lifespan. Central to this regulation is a class of transporters that sense and transport specific nutrients and transduce the signal downstream to control genes responsible for growth and survival. In this study, we identified SUL1, a plasma membrane transporter responsible for regulating the entry of extracellular sulfate in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, as a key gene for regulating lifespan. We conducted a systematic analysis to delineate the downstream mechanism underlying the lifespan extension by SUL1 deletion. Surprisingly, we found that the lifespan-extending effect of SUL1 deletion is not due to decreased sulfate transport. The SUL1 deletion mutant exhibited decreased PKA signaling, resulting in a series of downstream effects, including increased stress-protective trehalose and glycogen, increased nuclear translocation of MSN2, elevated expression of general stress response genes, enhanced autophagy, and reduced expression of amino acid biosynthetic and ribosomal genes. We demonstrated that the observed increase in lifespan is dependent on MSN2 and autophagy pathways. Our findings exemplify the influence of nutrient signaling rather than the nutrient itself on lifespan regulation and further substantiate the pivotal role of the PKA pathway in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SUL1</kwd><kwd>PKA activity</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>MSN2</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sichuan Science and Technology Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2022ZYD0076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sichuan Science and Technology Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2023YFS0050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>China West Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant No. ZYGX2022YGRH018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SUL1 deletion extends lifespan via PKA-MSN2 pathways, underscoring nutrient signaling over sulfate transport in aging regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The metabolism of nutrients is known to have a significant regulatory impact on the physiology and growth of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">González and Hall, 2017</xref>). Reduced food intake has been shown to extend the lifespan across many eukaryotes, such as yeast, worms, flies, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmona and Michan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Green et al., 2022</xref>). The regulation of longevity has been documented to involve distinct routes and regulators, such as the integrated stress response (ISR), AMPK signaling pathway, and mTORC1 signaling pathway. These pathways are activated in response to various nutrient restriction stresses, including glucose, amino acid, and lipid restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loewith and Hall, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). Eukaryotic cells have evolved distinct mechanisms for nutrition sensing and transportation to exert regulatory control over various cellular targets. The deregulation of nutrient sensing, widely recognized as a hallmark of aging, can influence lifespan and healthspan in a variety of animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Rodríguez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duran-Ortiz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several nutrient transporters have been implicated in the mediation of aging or age-related illnesses. For example, the inhibition of glucose transporter SGLT-2 has the potential to delay cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">La Grotta et al., 2022</xref>). The amino acid transporter SLC36A4 can regulate the mTORC1 signaling in lysosomes of retinal pigmented epithelial cells through its regulation of the amino acid pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shang et al., 2017</xref>). Apo E, which serves as a constituent of plasma lipoproteins responsible for lipids transportation, plays a role in several neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martens et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to organic nutrients, organisms are subject to the regulation of a vast amount of inorganic nutrients including phosphate and sulfate. However, the impact of these nutrients transporters on longevity remains largely unexplored.</p><p>The yeast has been widely used as a model organism in the study of molecular mechanisms underlying aging, as well as evolutionarily conserved signal pathways. Yeast cells possess a diverse array of inorganic nutrient sensing systems that facilitate rapid adaptation to fluctuating environments. For instance, the MEP2 system detects ammonium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Van Nuland et al., 2006</xref>), the PHO84 system senses phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giots et al., 2003</xref>), the FTR1 system is involved in iron sensing, the ZRT1 system detects zinc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schothorst et al., 2017</xref>), and the SUL1/SUL2 system that senses and transports sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kankipati et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, there is substantial evidence from higher eukaryotes indicating the presence of transporters that exhibit an extra role in nutrient-sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pérez-Torras et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walch-Liu and Forde, 2008</xref>). Further investigation is required to examine the impact of inorganic nutrients transporters on lifespan and the underlying mechanisms. Considering the crucial role of sulfur-containing substances in regulating lifespan, such as hydrogen sulfide and methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2019</xref>), the sulfate transporters can serve as a good model for such investigation.</p><p>Sulfur is widely recognized as a crucial nutrient that exerts significant regulatory influences on cellular metabolism and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maw, 1963</xref>). Sulfur is mostly absorbed and stored within cells in the form of sulfate, facilitated by specialized membrane transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cherest et al., 1997</xref>). In yeast, the process of enzymatic reduction converts sulfate to sulfide, which is then integrated into organic molecules by the sulfate assimilation pathway (SAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan, 1997</xref>). This pathway involves the utilization of two high-affinity transporters SUL1 and SUL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khurana et al., 2000</xref>). Both SUL1 and SUL2 have been identified as transceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kankipati et al., 2015</xref>), which can sense sulfur signals and exhibit a robust response to sulfur deprivation by upregulating sulfate transport. Additionally, they play a crucial role as mediators in the activation of the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in response to nutrient stimuli, thereby governing various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thevelein and de Winde, 1999</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the regulatory mechanism of SUL1 in relation to yeast longevity. We found that SUL1, instead of SUL2 deletion, significantly extends yeast replicative lifespan (RLS), and the increase of lifespan resulting from the deletion of SUL1 is not contingent upon sulfate transport. The SUL1 mutant strain displayed several traits indicative of decreased PKA activity, including accumulation of stress-protective carbohydrates, increase of MSN2 nuclear localization and upregulation of stress response genes, and downregulation of ribosomal gene expression. We show that lifespan extension depends on the stimulation of MSN2 transcriptional activity and autophagy. Our study provides an example where downstream signaling of nutrient instead of the nutrient itself influences lifespan, which may be general for other nutrient transceptors. Our findings also support the PKA pathway’s important role for lifespan regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SUL1 deletion increases yeast RLS in a sulfate metabolism-independent way</title><p>In budding yeast, SUL1 and SUL2 serve as two plasma membrane transporters responsible for regulating the import of extracellular sulfate.

Sulfate is converted into various sulfur-containing substances, including methionine, cysteine, glutathione, and S-adenosylmethionine through the SAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marzluf, 1997</xref>). SUL2 is the homolog of SUL1 and may function as a redundant sulfate transporter.

Our initial guess was SUL1 deletion decreases the sulfate transport, limiting the availability of sulfur, thus extending lifespan through a mechanism similar to methionine (which also contains sulfur) restriction.</p><p>In order to investigate the influence of sulfur metabolism on the extension of lifespan in the SUL1 knockout strain, we generated three strains that modulate the SAP at various levels. These strains include a SUL2 knockout strain, a site-directed mutant strain SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup>, which has been previously demonstrated to disrupt sulfate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kankipati et al., 2015</xref>), and a MET3 knockout strain that specifically affects a key enzyme in the SAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan, 1997</xref>). We found that inhibition of the sulfur-transporting function of SUL1 (SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup>) does not extend lifespan. In addition, neither the depletion of SUL2-dependent sulfate transport nor the disruption of SAP through MET3 deletion leads to an increase in the RLS of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then compared the rapid uptake of sulfur following sulfate stimulation in WT, SUL1Δ, SUL2Δ, and SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> to evaluate the impact of sulfur transport ability on RLS. Compared with the WT, SUL1Δ, SUL2Δ, and SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> all exhibited a delayed sulfur uptake process, but there was no significant difference in the final concentration of intracellular sulfur ion in all groups, and the kinetics of sulfur uptake in SUL1Δ and SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> exhibit comparable patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings indicate that the extended lifespan associated with the deletion of the SUL1 gene is not attributable to alterations in intracellular sulfur ion levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SUL1 deletion induces global transcriptional changes indicative of conserved longevity promotion mechanisms</title><p>To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to the extension of lifespan in SUL1Δ strains, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the global gene expression profiles of the SUL1Δ strains in comparison with the wild-type strains through RNA-seq.

Additionally, the suppression of protein biogenesis and ribosomal function is also known to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Steyfkens et al., 2018</xref>). Our analysis of gene expression suggests that the deletion of the SUL1 gene triggers a universal, conserved anti-aging mechanism, resulting in an increased lifespan. In contrast, the stress responses that promote longevity and the elevated production of carbohydrates, such as trehalose, are diminished in both the SUL2Δ strains and the SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> strains. This observation further supports the genetic mechanism underlying the longevity phenotype, which is exclusively observed in the SUL1Δ strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We observed considerable upregulation of several stress response genes, specifically those controlled by MSN2, in the SUL1 deletion mutant. These genes are involved in the synthesis of trehalose and glycogen, such as TPS1, TPS2, GSY2, and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, left). To identify potential transcriptional regulators, we performed association analysis between TFs and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (see ‘Materials and methods’). We observed that a number of upregulated DEGs in the SUL1 mutant are associated with six stress-related transcription factors, namely SUA7, MSN2, IXR1, FKH1, FKH2, and SFP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, besides MSN2, which is a well-known general stress response regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). We also identified IXR1, a transcriptional repressor that regulates hypoxic genes during normoxia, suggesting that SUL1 deletion induces a gene expression program similar to diauxic shift, a phenomenon also observed in a constitutively active MSN2 mutant that mimics lower PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pfanzagl et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SUL1 deletion inhibits the PKA activity and promotes the nuclear translocation of MSN2</title><p>Based on our observations, it is evident that the lifespan extension in the SUL1 mutant does not depend on reduced sulfate transport. It has been reported that SUL1 exhibits the ability to react to environmental stress via signaling through the PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kankipati et al., 2015</xref>). Under conditions of nutrient starvation, yeast cells display traits associated with decreased activity of PKA, including the accumulation of stress-protective carbohydrates such as glycogen and trehalose, enhanced resistance to stress, increased expression of stress response genes, and decreased expression of ribosomal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kankipati et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, the transcription factors MSN2/MSN4, which are involved in stress resistance, are suppressed by PKA activity.

These compounds are subsequently incorporated into sulfur-containing molecules, including methionine, cysteine, glutathione, and S-adenosylmethionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marzluf, 1997</xref>).

Our study revealed, however, that the downregulation of the high-affinity transceptor SUL2 did not result in an increase in lifespan. Our findings indicate that specific mutations designed to eliminate the sulfate transporter activity of SUL1, while maintaining the signaling capabilities, did not result in an increased lifespan. Furthermore, the disruption of a crucial enzyme in the sulfur assimilation pathway also failed to extend lifespan.</p><p>Our study provided an interesting example where lifespan is regulated by the signal transduction downstream of nutrient sensing, instead of the nutrient itself. This might be more general for other nutrient transceptors and is worth further investigation. There is also an interesting parallel in multicellular organisms that the lifespan extension by caloric restriction can be abolished by smelling the food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>), highlighting the importance of downstream signaling in regulating lifespan.</p><p>Deprivation of a single essential nutrient in a fermentative medium decreases PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thevelein and de Winde, 1999</xref>), leading to the accumulation of reserve and stress protective carbohydrates, glycogen, and trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lillie and Pringle, 1980</xref>). PKA plays a crucial role in nutrient regulation of yeast growth and stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thevelein and de Winde, 1999</xref>). In our transcriptome analysis, the DEGs in SUL1 knockout strain are enriched in BP, including RNA-mediated transposition, protein catabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, stress response, cellular amino acid biosynthesis, and ribosome biogenesis. While in the SUL2 deletion strain and SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> mutant strain, the function of DEGs was highly similar (Figure S1), and many enriched categories of them showed opposite trends in the SUL1 deletion strain. For example, the carbohydrate metabolic process-related genes were upregulated in SUL1Δ, while downregulated in SUL2Δ and SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> mutant (Figure S1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B)</xref>, indicating SUL1 deletion results in significant PKA signaling change, instead of the interruption of sulfur transport, which contributes to RLS extension. More intriguingly, we found the expression of SUL1 mRNA was significantly increased in the SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> mutant (mean FPKM of SUL1 in SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> mutant and WT were 37.13 and 21.36, respectively), suggesting that the abolishment of SUL1 sulfur transport function compensatively upregulated the expression of SUL1. But the mechanism of these transposition and metabolic processes demands further exploration.</p><p>We identified six transcription factors as important regulators of DEGs in SUL1Δ through a computational analysis: SUA7, which is required for transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pinto et al., 1994</xref>) IXR1, which regulates hypoxic genes under normoxia conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; FKH1 and FKH2, which regulate the CLB2 gene cluster during the G2/M phase of the mitotic cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bähler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jorgensen and Tyers, 2000</xref>) SFP1, which regulates ribosomal biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blumberg and Silver, 1991</xref>) and MSN2, which orchestrates the general stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schmitt and McEntee, 1996</xref>).</p><p>In consideration of the diminished activity of the PKA signaling, we specifically focused on MSN2 as a downstream transcription factor of PKA and observed a unique dynamic pattern of nuclear localization in the SUL1Δ strain. Regarding the transcriptional activity of MSN2, the SUL1 mutant exhibited a more robust response to both acute and chronic stimulation. The administration of glucose limitation stimulus, which simulates an acute stress in yeast, resulted in a significant enhancement of MSN2 nuclear entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to the wild type, the translocation of MSN2 into the nucleus was more pronounced in the SUL1Δ strain as cells age, indicating that SUL1 is more sensitive to chronic stresses such as aging-related damage.</p><p>In addition to MSN2, MSN4 was initially identified as a PKA-controlled transcription factor that regulates stress response and tolerance genes downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Görner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martínez-Pastor et al., 1996</xref>).

Interestingly, compared to the wild type, no significant MSN4 nuclear translocation alteration was observed in SUL1Δ as a result of aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the regulation of stress response capacity of SUL1Δ is MSN2-dependent rather than MSN4-dependent.</p><p>In addition, PKA signaling regulates the initiation of the autophagy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budovskaya et al., 2004</xref>), and ATG8 is recruited to an expanding structure and is required for the completion of autophagosome formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xie et al., 2008</xref>). Our study revealed that autophagy associated with ATG8 contributed to the lifespan extension of the SUL1Δ strain.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that downregulation of SUL1 inhibits the activity of the nutrient-sensing PKA signaling pathway. This regulatory mechanism is responsible for modulating several BP, ultimately leading to an increase in the RLS of yeast. Since the PKA pathway and the associated nutrient response are highly conserved across different organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kankipati et al., 2015</xref>), our study may have significant implications for the regulation of lifespan in more complex organisms. Further research is needed to clarify the regulatory mechanisms that lead to the weakened PKA signaling pathway following SUL1 knockdown, uncover additional BP that contribute to the lifespan extension, and investigate the complex interactions between the sulfur signaling pathway and other essential nutrient pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids, and media</title><p>All <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are in the BY4741 (<italic>MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0</italic>) background and are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Knockout strains were generated by transforming with a PCR product encoding the kanamycin-resistance (KanR) cassette or HisMX6 cassette to replace the ORF of interest.

Images were captured using Zeiss Axio Observer 7, and image analysis was conducted using the ImageJ software. In brief, the quantification of protein expression abundance in each cell is determined by subtracting the background intensity from the green fluorescence intensity. In each experiment, a minimum of 100 cells were subjected to analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>The EGFP-labeled strains were incubated overnight, followed by being diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> equal to 0.01. The cultures were then grown for an additional duration of 2–4 hours until they attained an OD<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.05 in a 96-well plate. Subsequently, flow cytometry was employed to quantify the EGFP signals (FITC channel) in each sample at regular hourly intervals. The cellular concentration of EGFP was assessed by normalizing the EGFP signal with cell size using a forward scattering signal (FSC channel) for individual cells. Mean fluorescence intensity was utilized to compare the differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The RLS was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the survival differences were determined by the log-rank test. Other group differences were evaluated with Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. The rapid sulfur intake experiment was analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. The statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 22.0 and GraphPad Prism 6. Statistical significance was considered at p-value &lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Strains used in this study, related to experimental procedures.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-94609-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Primers used in this study, related to experimental procedures.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-94609-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94609-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Sequencing data have been deposited in GEO under accession codes GSE296216.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Juan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Jing</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2025">2025</year><data-title>SUL1 deficiency reduces PKA activity to increase replicative lifespan in yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></data-title><source>NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/?term=GSE296216">GSE296216</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by Sichuan Science and Technology Program (no. 2022ZYD0076; no. 2023YFS0050), and the funding supported by Medico-Engineering Cooperation Funds from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China and China West Hospital (grant no.

The authors claim that the deletion of SUL1, rather than SUL2 (encoding a similar transporter), extended yeast replicative lifespan independent of sulfate transport. They also show that SUL1 loss-of-function mutants display decreased PKA activity, indicated by stress-protective carbohydrate accumulation, relevant transcription factor relocalization (measured during aging in single cells), and changes in gene expression. Finally, they show that loss of SUL1 increases autophagy, which is consistent with the longer lifespan of these cells. Overall, this is an interesting paper, but additional work should strengthen several conclusions, especially for the role of sulfate transport. Specific points include the following:</p><p>What prompted the authors to measure the RLS of sul1 mutants? Prior systematic surveys of RLS in the same strain background (which included the same sul1 deletion strain they used) did not report lifespan extension in sul1 cells (PMID: 26456335).</p><p>Cells carrying a mutant Sul1 (E427Q), which was reported to be disrupted in sulfate transport, did not have a longer lifespan (Figure 1), leading them to conclude that &quot;lifespan extension by SUL1 deletion is not caused by decreased sulfate uptake&quot;. They would need to measure sulfate uptake in the mutants they test to draw that conclusion firmly.</p><p>Related to my previous point, another simple experiment would be to repeat the assays in Figure 1 with exogenous sulfur added to see if the lifespan extension is suppressed.</p><p>There needs to be more information in the text or the methods about how they did the enrichment analysis in Figure 2B. P-values are typically insufficient, and adjusted FDR values are reported from standard gene ontology platforms (e.g., PANTHER).</p><p>It is somewhat puzzling that relocalization of Msn2 was not seen in very old cells (past the 17th generation), but it was evident in younger cells. The authors could consider another possibility, that it was early and midlife experiences that made those cells live longer. Past that window, loss of Sul1 may have no impact on longevity. A conditional shutoff system to regulate SUL1 expression would be needed to test the above, albeit this is probably beyond the scope of this report.</p><p>The connections between glucose restriction, autophagy, and sul1 (Figure 4) could be further tested by measuring the RLS of sul1 cells in glucose-restricted cells. If RLS is further extended by glucose restriction, then whatever effects they see should be independent of glucose restriction.</p><p>They made and tested the double (sul1, msn2) mutants, but they should also test the sul1, msn4 combination since Msn4 functions similarly to Msn2.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>Overall, this is a somewhat improved manuscript, but some prior concerns about the validity of the conclusions remain unresolved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94609.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors find that deletion of a sulfate transporter in yeast, Sul1, leads to extension of replicative lifespan. They investigate mechanisms underlying this extension, and claim that the effects on longevity can be separated from sulfate transport, and are instead linked to a previously proposed transceptor function of the Sul1 transporter. Through RNA sequencing analysis, the authors find that Sul1 loss triggers activation of several stress response pathways, and conclude that deletion of two pathways, autophagy or Msn2/4, partially prevents lifespan extension in cells lacking Sul1. Overall, while it is well-appreciated that activation of Msn2/4 or autophagy is beneficial for lifespan extension in yeast, the results of this study would add an important new mechanism by which this could achieved, through perceived sulfate starvation. However, as described below, several of the experiments utilized to support the authors conclusion are not experimentally sound, and significant additional experimentation is required to support the authors claims throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The major strength of the study is the robust RNA-seq data that identified differentially expressed genes in cells lacking Sul1. This facilitated the authors focus on two of these pathways, autophagy and the Msn2/4 stress response pathway.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Several critical experimental flaws need to be addressed by the authors to more rigorously test their hypothesis.</p><p>(1) The lifespan assays throughout the manuscript contain inconsistencies in the mean lifespan of the wild type strain, BY4741. For example, in Figure 1A, the lifespan of BY4741 is 24.3, and the extended lifespan of the sul1 mutant is 31. However, although all mutants tested in Figure 1B also have lifespans close to 30 cell divisions, the wild type control is also at 30 divisions in those experiments as well. This is problematic, as it makes it impossible to conclude anything about the lifespan extension of various mutants with the inconsistencies in the wild type lifespan. Additionally, the mutants analyzed in 1B are what the authors use to claim that loss of the transporter does not extend lifespan through sulfate limitation, but instead through a signaling function. Thus, it remains unclear whether loss of sul1 extends lifespan at all, and if it does, whether this is separable from cellular sulfate levels.</p><p>(2) While the authors use mutants in Figure 1 that should have differential effects on sulfate levels in cells, the authors need to include experiments to measure sulfate levels in their various mutant cells to draw any conclusions about their data.</p><p>(3) Similar to point 2, the authors focused their RNA sequencing analysis on deletion of sul1 and did not include important RNA seq analysis of the specific Sul1 mutation or other mutants in Figure 1B that do not exhibit lifespan extension. The prediction is that they should not see activation of stress response pathways in these mutants as they do not see lifespan extension, but this needs to be tested.</p><p>(4) While the RNA-seq data is robust in Figure 2 as well as the follow up quantitative PCR and trehalose/glycogen assays in 2A-B, the follow-up imaging assays for Msn2/4 localization in Figure 2 are not robust and are difficult to interpret. The authors need to include more high-resolution imaging or at least a close up of the cells in Figure 3C.</p><p>(5) The autophagy assays utilized in Figure 4 appear to all be done with a C-terminal GFP-tagged Atg8 protein. As C-terminal GFP is removed from Atg8 prior to conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine, microscopy assays of this reporter cannot be utilized to report on autophagy activity or flux. Instead, the authors need to utilize N-terminally tagged Atg8, which they can monitor for vacuole uptake as an appropriate readout of autophagy levels. As it stands, the authors cannot draw any conclusions about autophagy activity in their studies.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>Their autophagy conclusions are weak at best. As was highlighted in the previous review, they need to use an N-terminal Atg8 fusion for these experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94609.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, Long et al., showed that sul1∆ mutants have extended replicative lifespan in budding yeast. In comparison, other mutants that have sulfate transport deficiency did not show extended lifespan, suggesting SUL1 deletion extends lifespan independently of sulfate intake. The authors then explored the transcriptome of sul1∆ mutants by RNA-seq, which suggests that SUL1 deletion impacts common longevity pathways. Furthermore, the authors characterized how the PKA pathway is affected in sul1∆ mutants: SUL1 deletion promotes the nuclear localization of Msn2, as well as autophagy, indicating down-regulation of the PKA pathway.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study raised an interesting point that inorganic transporters may impact cellular stress response pathways and affect lifespan. Some of the characterizations on the sul1∆ mutants, including the RNA-seq and MSN2 localization could provide valuable sources for people in related fields. Compared with the previous version, the writing is significantly improved, making the manuscript clearer.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Several critical flaws have not been revised. The claims are still not well supported by the data.</p><p>(1) The revised manuscript still uses Atg8-EGFP, in which GFP is likely tagging at the C-terminus of Atg8. No strain information was provided for this strain, so it is unclear whether it is N- or C- terminal tagged. As pointed by reviewers of the previous version, C-terminal tagged Atg8 is not functional. As a result, the conclusions on autophagy (Figure 4) is questionable.</p><p>(2) The nuclear localization of Msn2 is much more convincing after the authors updated Figure 3C. However, the rest of the microscopy images (e.g. Figure 3E, 4B, 4E) are still of low resolution. Again, I suggest to separate the DIC and GFP channels. It is really hard to tell where is the GFP signal from these figures.</p><p>(3) In the Kankipati et al. 2015 paper, which is cited by the authors, SUL1E427Q is incorporated on a pRS316 (URA3) plasmic and expressed in sul1∆sul2∆ mutants. In this manuscript, the authors used SUL1E427Q mutants but did not give detailed information on how this construct is expressed. Is it endogenously mutated, incorporated into somewhere in the genome, or expressed from an extrachromosomal plasmid?</p><p>In Figure 1B, they simply used BY4741 as a control for the SUL1E427Q mutant. This makes me thinking they are using a SUL1E427Q endogenous point mutation mutant. If so, the authors may want to include the information about this strain in their Supplementary table. Or if it is expressed from an extra copy on chromosomes or extrachromosomal plasmids, the authors would need to express this construct in sul1∆ mutant. In this case, the authors may want to use sul1∆ and sul1∆+empty vector as controls, instead of BY4741. As the authors mentioned in their rebuttal letter, lifespan experiments vary between each individual trials and are not comparable between different trials. Thus proper controls are essential to make the results convincing.</p><p>(4) As suggested by reviewers of the previous version, the authors tested the sulfate uptake in different mutants within 10 minute of Na2SO4 addition (Figure 1B). The authors concluded from the data that wild type takes up sulfate faster than the mutants but they reach similar concentrations at the end point (as fast as 10 minutes). Are all these cells sulfate-starved before the experiment? If not, the experiment might be affected by the basal level of sulfate in each mutants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94609.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Yuting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Motivation for studying SUL1 in RLS</p></disp-quote><p>Considering that the regulation of cellular metabolism in response to nutrient availability is crucial for cell survival and lifespan, and several organic nutrient transporters have also been implicated in the mediation of aging, we believe that transporters of specific nutrients can transduce the signal downstream to control genes responsible for survival.

In contrast, the lifespan data for other mutant strains have been increased to 200 (see Figure 1B). This confirms the reproducibility of the lifespan extension observed in the sul1Δ strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Mechanistic link between sulfate transport and lifespan</p></disp-quote><p>Sulfate absorption assays were performed on the WT, SUL1Δ, SUL2Δ, and SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> strains (Figure 1C). Compared to the wild type (WT), the SUL1Δ, SUL2Δ, and SUL1<sup>E427Q</sup> strains exhibited delayed sulfate intracellular transportation. However, there was no significant difference in the final concentration of intracellular sulfur ions among all groups. This result reinforces our conclusion that the extended lifespan of SUL1Δ is not associated with sulfate transport.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Testing the RLS of SUL1ΔMSN4Δ double mutants</p></disp-quote><p>The replicative lifespan data for the SUL1ΔMSN4Δ double mutant were further analyzed (shown in the following supplementary figure). It was observed that the extension of the SUL1Δ lifespan was not rescued by the knockout of MSN4, supporting the hypothesis that MSN2 may serve as the downstream transcription factor responsible for the increased lifespan of SUL1Δ.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Replicative life span of MSN4 deletion mutants in WT and SUL1Δ strains.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94609-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Inconsistent WT lifespan in Figure 1B</p></disp-quote><p>All measurements of life expectancy were conducted under controlled conditions (30°C, 2% glucose).

This similarity may be attributed to experimental variability arising from multiple trials; however, it does not compromise the validity of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Sulfate level measurements</p></disp-quote><p>Intracellular sulfate levels were measured by quantitatively assessing the sulfate concentrations in wild-type (WT), SUL1Δ, SUL2Δ, and SUL<sup>E427</sup> cells, as detailed in the methods section (Figure 1C).
