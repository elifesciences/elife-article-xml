Mutations in β-catenin that activate Wnt signaling have been found in colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas. However, the dynamics of wild-type and mutant forms of β-catenin are not fully understood. Here, we genome-engineered fluorescently tagged alleles of endogenous β-catenin in a colorectal cancer cell line. Wild-type and oncogenic mutant alleles were tagged with different fluorescent proteins, enabling the analysis of both variants in the same cell. We analyzed the properties of both β-catenin alleles using immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy approaches, revealing distinctly different biophysical properties. In addition, activation of Wnt signaling by treatment with a GSK3β inhibitor or a truncating <italic>APC</italic> mutation modulated the wild-type allele to mimic the properties of the mutant β-catenin allele. The one-step tagging strategy demonstrates how genome engineering can be employed for the parallel functional analysis of different genetic variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>β-catenin</kwd><kwd>endogenous tagging</kwd><kwd>fluorescence correlation spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>FCS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Cancer</kwd><kwd>CTNNB1</kwd><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Oncogenic signaling</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1324, Project number 331351713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ambrosi</surname><given-names>Giulia</given-names></name><name><surname>Voloshanenko</surname><given-names>Oksana</given-names></name><name><surname>Eckert</surname><given-names>Antonia Franziska</given-names></name><name><surname>Kranz</surname><given-names>Dominique</given-names></name><name><surname>Nienhaus</surname><given-names>Gerd Ulrich</given-names></name><name><surname>Boutros</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001656</institution-id><institution>Helmholtz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Material Systems Engineering</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nienhaus</surname><given-names>G Ulrich</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bi-allelic tagging enables the biophysical analysis of oncogenic β-catenin genetic variants in Wnt signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wnt signaling pathways play fundamental roles in many biological processes in development, stem cell maintenance, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>). A key regulator of “canonical” Wnt signaling is β-catenin (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>). When Wnt signaling is inactive, β-catenin forms part of the destruction complex, which consists of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), axis inhibition protein 1 (Axin1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2012</xref>), casein kinase 1α (CK1α), and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β). In the destruction complex, β-catenin is N-terminally phosphorylated at Ser45 by CK1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagen and Vidal-Puig, 2002</xref>) and then sequentially phosphorylated at residues Ser33, Ser37, and Thr41 by GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Subsequently, phospho-β-catenin is targeted to proteasomal degradation by the SCF<sup>ßTrCP</sup> E3-ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Wnt signaling is activated when Wnt ligands bind to seven-pass transmembrane receptors of the Frizzled (Fzd) protein family and the transmembrane LRP5/6 (low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein) co-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cong et al., 2004</xref>). Fzd proteins then recruit the cytosolic adaptor protein Dishevelled (Dvl) to the cell membrane <italic>via</italic> its DEP domain, leading to polymerization of Dvl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007</xref>). Dvl facilitates membrane recruitment of Axin1 by a DIX-DIX domain heterotypic interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cliffe et al., 2003</xref>), which in turn stimulates GSK3β- and CK1α-mediated phosphorylation of the LRP5/6 cytosolic tail in its five PPPSPxS motifs and its binding to LRP5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stamos et al., 2014</xref>). As a consequence, the destruction complex disassembles, β-catenin is no longer degraded and translocates into the nucleus. In the nucleus, β-catenin interacts with the T cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (LEF) family of transcription factors and activates target genes in a cell-type-dependent manner. In addition to its role in Wnt signaling, β-catenin is also found at cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs) mediating the interactions between the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hoschuetzky et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huber and Weis, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The human β-catenin protein consists of 781 amino acids and contains three distinct structural domains. Crystal structure and NMR analysis of β-catenin have revealed that both N- and C-terminal domains are structurally flexible, whereas the central armadillo repeat has a rather rigid scaffold structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huber et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsulic and Peifer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). The N-terminus is crucial for its stability and for cell adhesion by interacting with α-catenin. This region also contains evolutionarily conserved serine and tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Valenta et al., 2012</xref>). Dysregulation of Wnt signaling components is associated with a variety of human diseases, ranging from growth-related pathologies to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>); however, overactive Wnt signaling has been difficult to target pharmacologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhong and Virshup, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in <italic>CTNNB1</italic>/β-catenin in colorectal cancer are typically found in its N-terminal domain, particularly in exon 3 that carries multiple phosphorylation sites for CK1 and GSK3β, including amino acids Ser33, Ser37, Thr41, and Ser45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>). Mutations or deletions of these sites, often in only one allele, prevent phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to its accumulation and subsequent activation of Wnt pathway target genes. However, the biochemical and biophysical properties of different β-catenin alleles in their endogenous loci have remained largely unknown.</p><p>To functionally analyze proteins, the introduction of small immune epitopes or fluorescent tags in-frame of the genomic locus enables their visualization and quantitative biophysical analysis. In this study, we aimed to examine the behavior of wild-type and a mutant oncogenic β-catenin. We made use of the colon cancer cell line HCT116, which harbors one wild-type and one mutant ∆Ser45 β-catenin allele, to generate endogenously tagged β-catenin by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. We engineered an HCT116 clone with mClover-tagged wild-type β-catenin and mCherry-tagged mutant β-catenin. Tagging wild-type and mutant β-catenin in the same cell provided an opportunity to compare the function and behavior of both proteins in parallel in the same sample. Our results indicate that wild-type and mutant β-catenin exist in two separate pools differing in their physical properties. Moreover, treatment with a GSK3β inhibitor or introduction of a truncating mutation of <italic>APC</italic> changed the physical properties of wild-type β-catenin, phenocopying the ∆Ser45 mutant isoform.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A strategy to generate endogenously tagged fluorescent β-catenin isoforms</title><p>Previously, the dynamics and biochemical properties of β-catenin in cells were investigated by using transiently or stably overexpressed fluorescent fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giannini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>). To study wild-type and mutant β-catenin at physiological expression levels, we utilized the diploid colon cancer cell line HCT116 that harbors both a wild-type and a ∆Ser45 mutant allele. This in-frame ∆Ser45 deletion results in a loss of phosphorylation at this position, leading to the stabilization of β-catenin and constant activation of Wnt downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagen and Vidal-Puig, 2002</xref>).</p><p>To generate endogenously tagged β-catenin, we applied a gene replacement strategy using CRISPR/Cas9 editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) to introduce different fluorescent tags in the two alleles of the β-catenin locus of HCT116 cells in one step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To this end, we identified a suitable sgRNA sequence for targeting the C-terminal region of β-catenin. This target site was chosen because it has previously been shown that C-terminal tagging did not affect β-catenin function in overexpression experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giannini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>). Then, two donor templates with 180 bp homology arms were designed close to the sgRNA PAM sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>) encoding two different fluorophores. We chose mClover3 and mCherry2 for their favorable biophysical properties such as spectral absorbance, brightness, photostability, and maturation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thorn, 2017</xref>). In the following, for the sake of brevity, we will refer to these two fluorescent proteins as Clover and Cherry, respectively. Moreover, FLAG and V5-tags were integrated between the C-terminal domain of β-catenin and the flexible GS linker to enable biochemical experiments. To avoid steric hindrance of the different domains, a flexible GS linker consisting of three repeats of glycine and serine residues, (Gly-Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)<sub>3</sub>, was inserted between the FLAG/V5 tags and the fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Trinh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Gene resistance cassettes flanked by loxP sites were also introduced after the fluorescent proteins for selection of edited cells after homology-directed repair (HDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smirnikhina et al., 2019</xref>). Selection cassettes encoded for antibiotic resistance to hygromycin and blasticidin on the Clover and Cherry donor templates, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The loxP sites were included to allow resistance cassette removal upon expression of Cre recombinase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strategy and workflow for bi-allelic fluorescent tagging of β-catenin in colon cancer cells.</title><p>(Left panels) Schematic representation of <italic>CTNNB1</italic>/β-catenin tagging strategy, the CTNNB1/β-catenin locus and tagged β-catenin proteins.

To confirm the editing events, genomic DNA, mRNA, and protein lysates were analyzed and compared to the parental HCT116 (β-catenin<sup>WT/∆45</sup>) cell line and to an HCT116 isogenic cell line in which the ∆Ser45 allele was removed (β-catenin<sup>WT+/−</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2002</xref>).

While PCR amplicons of successfully tagged <italic>CTNNB1/</italic>β-catenin alleles are expected to be more than 3 kb in length, amplicons from the untagged locus would be approximately 1.2 kb. PCR from genomic DNA from clone #37 resulted in a single band of 3 kb, indicating that both alleles of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were edited. In contrast, genotyping of clones #33, #45, and #24 resulted in 3 kb and 1.2 kb amplicons, suggesting that only a single donor integrated in one allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since genotyping with primers annealing within the donor construct cannot distinguish between homology-mediated integration at the target locus and non-targeted integration elsewhere in the genome, we next performed genotyping PCRs with one primer annealing in the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> locus and the other one inside the integration cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Separate PCRs were done for the 5′ and 3′ junction of the integration cassette; each confirmed correct integration at the target locus in all four clones. We also used primers that anneal selectively to either the Cherry or Clover donor construct or can be used to distinguish between these two donors by the size of their resistance gene (primers (b), (b’), (c), (e), and (e’) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). These PCRs revealed that clones #33, #37, and #24 harbor the Clover tag, while clones #37 and #45 have the Cherry tag integrated at the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Finally, we performed PCR with a primer pair annealing at either side of the donor cassette, with the resulting amplicon spanning the entire inserted exogenous sequence. PCR of genomic DNA from clone #37 gave rise to a single band of the expected size of approximately 3 kb, indicating correct insertion of the donor cassette in both alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Taken together, these experiments indicate that single-cell clones #24 and #33 had the Clover donor construct inserted in one <italic>CTNNB1</italic> allele, clone #45 had the Cherry tag inserted in one allele, and clone #37 had one allele tagged with Cherry and the other one tagged with Clover.</p><p>Next, we sequenced the amplicons from our genotyping PCRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). This revealed correct in-frame integration of the fluorophore sequences at the 3′ end of the CTNNB1/β-catenin coding sequence. We also confirmed that one <italic>CTNNB1</italic> allele remained untagged in clones #24, #33, and #45. While the untagged allele was not altered at the sgRNA target site in clones #24 and #45, we detected a 40-bp mutation in clone #33, presumably from error-prone non-homologous end joining of a Cas9-induced double-strand break. This mutation results in four additional amino acids at the end of β-catenin. Importantly, sequencing of the bi-allelically tagged clone #37 revealed that both alleles had been modified without unintended mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, PCR was performed to determine which allele (wild-type or ∆Ser45) was tagged with Clover and which with Cherry using cDNA from reverse-transcribed mRNA of each isogenic cell line and specific reverse primers to Clover or Cherry.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, clones #33 and #45 have one of the tagged variants of β-catenin, whereas clone #37 has two high molecular weight bands indicative of both tagged β-catenin variants. Furthermore, immunoprecipitations using either affinity beads for the Clover (GFP) and Cherry (RFP) fluorophores, or anti-β-catenin antibodies were performed and analyzed by Western blotting. GFP-immunoprecipitated lysates of clone #37 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a β-catenin variant with molecular mass higher than 97 kDa was recognized by β-catenin, GFP, and Flag antibodies.

Upon immunoprecipitation, especially with RFP beads, several bands of mutant β-catenin-Cherry are frequently detected. To evaluate whether this is due to modifications of mutant β-catenin or due to the Cherry-tag itself, we analyzed clone #24 expressing a mutant β-catenin tagged with Clover. All three antibodies, β-catenin, GFP, and Flag, detected only one band representing the mutant β-catenin-Clover protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that the additional bands of mutant β-catenin-Cherry arise from the Cherry-tag. One possible explanation is that the mCherry protein undergoes chemical modification during sample preparation, for example, by TCEP in the loading dye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cloin et al., 2017</xref>). Alternatively, mCherry might undergo backbone cleavage during chromophore maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barondeau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nienhaus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wei et al., 2015</xref>).

To simultaneously monitor the dynamics of wild-type Clover-tagged and mutant Cherry-tagged β-catenin of HCT116 cells clone #37, we used FCS with detection in two color channels. With this method, we recorded the fluorescence intensity emanating from a tiny observation volume (ca. 1 fL) as a function of time. For each cell studied, two measurements were performed, with the observation volume first positioned into the cytosol and then into the nucleus. Thus, we focused on the freely diffusing β-catenin fraction, which mediates Wnt signaling, and excluded the membrane-bound fraction, which is responsible for cell-cell adhesion and has been previously shown by FRAP to tightly interact with cadherins, which markedly reduces its mobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>From the intensity time traces in the two color channels, autocorrelation functions were calculated and fitted with model functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to extract two parameters, the diffusional correlation time, and the correlation amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zemanová et al., 2003</xref>). The correlation time is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient, D, of the fluorescent molecules. For this conversion, we performed calibration FCS experiments using fluorescent dye molecules with known D values as reference samples (see Materials and methods). According to the Stokes-Einstein law, the diffusion coefficient is inversely related to the linear extension of the diffusing entity and thus to the cube root of its volume/molecular mass. Thus, measurement of D values provides size information. The correlation amplitude is inversely proportional to the average number of molecules, N, in the observation volume. The calibration experiment with dye molecules mentioned above also allows us to determine the effective volume, V<sub>eff</sub>, from which the fluorescence emanates, so that the molecule concentration, c, in the observation volume can simply be calculated as c=N/<sub>Veff</sub>. In addition to autocorrelation analysis, we calculated cross-correlation functions to identify correlated intensity fluctuations in the two color channels. These will appear if the Clover and Cherry labeled β-catenin molecules co-diffuse, that is, bind to each other and migrate in concert through the observation volume. Cross-correlation amplitudes between wild-type Clover-tagged and mutant Cherry-tagged β-catenin were always found to be zero within the experimental error, implying that these two β-catenin variants diffuse independently and do not associate to any significant degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of FCS experiments in the cytosol of more than 40 cells, we calculated a median D value of 10.6 ± 1.8 µm² s<sup>–1</sup> for mutant Cherry-tagged β-catenin, which is significantly smaller than the one of wild-type Clover-tagged β-catenin (D=17.3 ± 6.1 µm² s<sup>–1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The ratio of diffusion coefficients indicates that mutant Cherry-tagged β-catenin diffuses as part of a larger complex, with a more than fourfold larger volume/overall mass than wild-type Clover-tagged β-catenin. For Clover and Cherry overexpressed in HCT116 cells, we measured D=43 ± 8 µm² s<sup>–1</sup> in the cytosol. Taking this number and dividing it by the cube root of the molecular mass ratio between wild-type Clover-tagged β-catenin and Clover (120 kDa:26 kDa), we obtain an estimated D=26 ± 5 µm² s<sup>–1</sup> for the tagged β-catenin, which is on the high end of the distribution of D values of the respective ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

These data agree well with previous measurements in the RKO cell line, which revealed β-catenin concentrations of ~52 nM upon Wnt3A stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hernández et al., 2012</xref>) and in HEK293T and colon cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Next, we were interested in whether activation of the Wnt signaling pathway had an impact on the diffusional dynamics of wild-type and mutant β-catenin. Therefore, FCS measurements were performed in the presence of the GSK3β inhibitor CHIR99021, which induces canonical Wnt signaling, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Under control conditions (DMSO), wild-type β-catenin was less abundant and diffused faster than mutant β-catenin in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, treatment with CHIR99021 changed the diffusion coefficients and concentrations of wild-type β-catenin so that they became similar to the ones of mutant β-catenin, whereas smaller effects were observed for the mutant isoform. Essentially, the same effects were obtained for both isoforms in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These observations suggest that, by applying the drug, wild-type β-catenin was also incorporated into a larger complex. The increased concentration suggests that complex formation reduces the probability of β-catenin degradation. Taken together, these results indicate that GSK3β inhibition renders the concentration and diffusional dynamics of wild-type β-catenin such that they are in the range of those of the mutant isoform.</p><p>The next question which we addressed was how inhibition of Wnt secretion influences concentration and dynamics of wild-type and mutant β-catenin. To this end, HCT116 β-catenin<sup>WTClover/∆45Cherry</sup> cells were treated with the porcupine inhibitor, LGK974, for 5–6 days before FCS measurements were performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Upon this treatment, the concentration of wild-type β-catenin was found to be reduced, whereas the decrease of mutant β-catenin concentration was less pronounced. These concentration changes could be rescued by addition of recombinant Wnt3a, whereas addition of recombinant Wnt3a to cells without inhibitor treatment increased the wild-type β-catenin amount only slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Inhibition of Wnt secretion also affected the diffusional dynamics of Clover-tagged wild-type β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Upon LGK974 treatment, the diffusivity of the Clover-tagged β-catenin fraction was two times as large as for the control, D<sub>WT,LGK</sub>=24.0 ± 2.8 µm² s<sup>−1</sup>; however, the diffusivity of the mutant Cherry-tagged β-catenin fraction did not increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additional Wnt3a treatment reversed the effect of LGK974 treatment on the diffusivity of wild-type β-catenin.

Based on these reports, we designed our two donor templates with 180 bp homology arms for the insert of around 3 kbp. Surprisingly, the efficiency of integration of the two donor templates was different, with Clover having about a 12-fold better integration efficiency than Cherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This might indicate that the efficiency of HDR depends not only on homology arms but also on the integrated sequence.</p><p>While tagging of proteins can interfere with protein functions, it can also lead to the accumulation of the protein and its potential overactivation. In line with our study, previous overexpression studies showed that C-terminal tagging of β-catenin did not affect its functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giannini et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsulic and Peifer, 1996</xref>). We also show that all generated clonal cell lines with one or both tagged alleles had the same proliferation capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that the tag does not lead to a loss-of-function phenotype. In contrast, inactivation of β-catenin or canonical Wnt signaling in HCT116 cells has been previously shown to inhibit proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scholer-Dahirel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voloshanenko et al., 2013</xref>). The region required for its adhesion function is within the central part of β-catenin and not at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Valenta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, the likelihood of C-terminal tagging affecting this function is rather small. Indeed, we found that β-catenin adhesive function was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Previous studies used overexpression of fluorescently tagged β-catenin to analyze its kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jamieson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kafri et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>). By contrast, here we studied the dynamics of endogenous wild-type and mutant β-catenin by leveraging genome engineering tools for endogenous tagging.</p><p>Using FCS, we analyzed mutant and wild-type proteins in the same cell. These measurements revealed that wild-type β-catenin diffuses faster than the mutant isoform in the cytoplasmic and the nuclear compartments, suggesting that wild-type protein is present as a monomer or as part of a smaller complex in the cell. In support of our data, a similar diffusion coefficient was recently determined by FCS for β-catenin endogenously tagged with monomeric SGFP2 in HAP1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Man et al., 2021</xref>). It appears that the mutant form of β-catenin binds more tightly to the destruction complex, resulting in slower diffusion in the cytoplasm. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the mutant protein physically interacts with APC, Axin, and GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous reports indicated that β-catenin mutants with deletion or mutation of Ser 45 retain signaling activity and are still responsive toward Wnt activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). We also found that mutant β-catenin is present at higher concentrations and diffuses more slowly than wild-type protein in the nucleus, suggesting increased nuclear import and binding to other proteins and DNA to form larger complexes.</p><p>Activation of Wnt signaling by inhibition of GSK3β or truncation of APC results in slower diffusion and higher abundance of wild-type β-catenin, indicating that β-catenin now becomes part of larger multi-protein complexes. This might—at least in part—be due to enhanced shuttling into the nucleus, where β-catenin interacts with the Wnt enhanceosome, a large transcriptional complex including TCF/LEF, PYGO, BCL9, and other proteins to activate transcription of Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiedler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Tienen et al., 2017</xref>). Along this line, FRAP analysis demonstrated that TCF4, APC, Axin, and Axin2 reduced β-catenin mobility and nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling suggesting that these interaction partners control the subcellular localization of β-catenin by sequestering it in the respective compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krieghoff et al., 2006</xref>). Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</xref> demonstrated that structural changes of β-catenin rather than molecule numbers regulate Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goentoro and Kirschner, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, a recent FCS-based study in HAP1 cells showed that Wnt pathway activation regulates the distribution of free β-catenin and β-catenin bound in multi-protein complexes between nucleus and cytosol by modulating β-catenin destruction, shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus, and nuclear retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Man et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we have used FCS to quantify the concentration and diffusional mobility of β-catenin in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments for the first time. The observed small diffusion coefficients indicate that β-catenin migrates as part of multi-protein complexes. Unraveling the protein composition of these complexes will require dual- or multicolor FCS experiments, which allow us to analyze co-diffusion of proteins via cross-correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we have performed FCS experiments at single locations within subcellular compartments. In the future, we will also adopt fluorescence microscopy-based fluctuation spectroscopy techniques for the analysis of intracellular protein dynamics in a spatially resolved fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tetin, 2013</xref>). While these techniques are frequently used with conventional, diffraction-limited microscopy, super-resolution variants have also become available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedde et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>β-catenin plays an important role not only in Wnt signaling but also in cell adhesion, in which it links the adhesion complex to the actin cytoskeleton via its interaction with the actin-binding protein α-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rimm et al., 1995</xref>). Since the different functions require distinct localization, β-catenin can be found in at least two distinct pools, one at the cell membrane and one that can shuttle between the cytosol and nucleus. Whether both pools originate from a common pool or from two independent pools, and how these reservoirs regulate each other is still a matter of debate. Accordingly, it was shown that it is possible to in vivo affect one function of β-catenin without interfering with the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orsulic and Peifer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Valenta et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Valenta et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, different molecular forms of β-catenin have been described, demonstrating that most cytosolic β-catenin exists in a monomeric form, whereas dimers of α-catenin and β-catenin interacted mainly with cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gottardi and Gumbiner, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, our immunoprecipitation and FCS analyses indicate that wild-type and mutant β-catenin are found in two separate pools. We observed that β-catenin is mobile in both compartments, with mutant β-catenin being found in higher molecular weight complexes.</p><p>In summary, we engineered, to our knowledge, the first biallelically tagged cell model carrying a different fluorescent fusion protein on each allele, demonstrating the feasibility of our one-step tagging strategy to analyze the consequences of genetic variants. β-catenin knock-in cell lines provide a powerful tool for investigating β-catenin’s role in the canonical Wnt signaling, and also in adhesion. Due to these properties of β-catenin, these cell models can serve to evaluate both functions in parallel on the endogenous level. Cell models of wild-type and mutant variants can also be used for drug discovery, identifying small molecules that only interfere with mutant, but not wild-type β-catenin, thereby circumventing side effects that are often associated with interfering with homeostatic levels of Wnt signaling. In general, bi-allelic tagging of genetic variants in their endogenous locus can open new avenues toward understanding and possibly targeting disease-causing variants in a broad spectrum of cellular and organismal phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

For antibody staining, cells were permeabilized with 0.25% Triton/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After several washing steps, cells were blocked for 1 hr with 5% goat serum (v/v) and 5% BSA (v/v) in PBS at room temperature. After overnight incubation with the primary antibody at 4°C, cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (1:250) for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark. Antibodies were diluted in PBS with 5% goat serum (v/v) and 5% BSA (v/v). Finally, cover slips were gently transferred onto microscope slides (Carl Roth GmbH) and fixed with Vectashield mounting media containing DAPI solution (Biozol Diagnostica). Fluorescence images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. For live-cell imaging, cells were added into μ-slide with a glass bottom (Ibidi) and staining was performed as described. For automated microscopy, cells were seeded into 384-well plates and subjected to fixation using the CybiWell Vario robotic system.

After an additional treatment with LGK974/Ctrl for 32 hr, cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml of recombinant Wnt3a for 16 hr. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min and stained with the Hoechst solution (1:2000 in PBS) for 30 min. Fluorescence images were acquired with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope. 5–20 slides per condition were taken. The fluorescence intensities of Clover, Cherry, or Hoechst were analyzed with ImageJ without any additional manipulation of the images. The Clover and Cherry intensities were normalized to Hoechst and further to control.</p><p>In the silencing experiment, CTNNB1, CLOVER, and CHERRY were downregulated by applying siRNA directly on the Ibidi µ-Slide for 72 hr.

Each well of a eight-well Nunc Lab-Tek chambered cover glass (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was incubated with 200 µl of the solution for at least 1 hr at room temperature. Afterward, the solution was removed by aspiration, and the wells were allowed to dry. These chambers were either used immediately or stored at 4°C for a maximum of 1–2 weeks and washed with DPBS directly before use. For FCS measurements, HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s medium without phenol red in the chambers. For drug treatment, the cell culture medium was replaced with a medium containing 10 µM CHIR99021 ~16‒26 hr before the FCS measurements. For LGK974 treatment, cells were seeded in six-well plates and incubated with 5 µM LGK974 for 5 days. During this period, the drug-containing medium was renewed and, if necessary, cells were split. On day 6, cells were transferred into fibronectin-coated eight-well chambered cover glass, where they were left to adhere for ~4‒6 hr before adding 100 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> of recombinant Wnt3a. FCS measurements were started at ~16‒26 hr after Wnt treatment. All FCS measurements were carried out at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>For FCS analysis, intensity time traces were acquired in two color channels for 120 s each by using a home-built confocal microscope described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al., 2020</xref>). mClover3 and mCherry2 were excited with pulsed 470 nm and 561 nm laser light of typically 3 µW (1.5 kW cm<sup>−2</sup>) and 5 µW (2.8 kW cm<sup>−2</sup>), respectively. The emission was filtered by 525/50 nm and 607/37 nm (center/width) band-pass filters (BrightLine, Semrock, Rochester, NY). For data acquisition, the observation volume of the microscope was first positioned into the cytoplasm and directly afterward into the nucleus. The intensity decrease during the measurement due to photobleaching was compensated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dörlich et al., 2015</xref>). Then, autocorrelation and cross-correlation functions were calculated from the time traces, and correlation amplitudes and times were extracted by fitting a model function to the correlation functions that describes free diffusion of fluorescent particles through an observation volume shaped as a three-dimensional Gaussian function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). The correlation amplitudes of each individual cell measurement were corrected for photobleaching according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eckert et al., 2020</xref>, and uncorrelated background according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Foo et al., 2012</xref>. For the latter correction, we measured background intensities in the cytosol and in the nucleus on ensembles of more than 15 cells of lines #45 and #33, both under control conditions (DMSO) and with drug treatment (CHIR99021). For each cell measurement, the correction factor was calculated using the median intensity of the respective ensemble. Finally, the (microscope-dependent) correlation times and corrected amplitudes were converted into (microscope-independent) diffusion coefficients and concentrations, which are reported in this work. For this conversion, we carried out careful FCS calibration experiments using solutions of organic dyes (Alexa 488 and Alexa 546, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with well-known diffusion coefficients and concentrations. Furthermore, FCS measurements of fluorescent proteins (eGFP, Clover, and Cherry) overexpressed in HCT116 wild-type cells were performed to obtain estimates of the molecular mass of the β-catenin carrying entities.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64498-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>p-values.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64498-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>siRNAs.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64498-supp2-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Antibodies.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64498-supp3-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Plasmids.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64498-supp4-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Primers for qPCR.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64498-supp5-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Oligonucleotides.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-64498-supp6-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated during this study is included in the manuscript.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to F Port, KE Boonekamp, and S Redhai for providing critical comments on the manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a fluorescent tagging strategy that allows them to knock in one copy each of differently tagged wild-type and a non-destructible β-catenin mutant, so that the behavior of the mutant can be directly compared to the wild-type protein under different activities of the β-catenin destruction complex. The differential tagging of a wild-type and mutant Wnt components offers the opportunity to compare directly their properties in a living cell, and the approach is likely to be useful for future mechanistic investigations by the Wnt and cancer communities.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors show that wt and mutant β-catenins both diffuse in larger complexes that differ between wt and mutant, possibly destruction complexes vs. transcriptional partners. These are interesting observations that may ultimately provide insights into the mechanism of β-catenin destruction. There is concern regarding the apparent degradation of the cherry fluorescent protein, and although the authors rationalize what is happening based on prior literature, there is no experimental validation of these ideas. Nonetheless, the ability to IP the cherry tag and the observation of fluorescence from this tagged version is consistent with their interpretation. There are, however, a number of technical issues that require attention, specifically a more rigorous validation that the targeting is correct, and better support for the conclusions regarding nuclear β-catenin translocation.</p><p>1. The genotyping is not adequate to prove both alleles have been correctly targeted in the double targeted clone.</p><p>In the case of the double targeted cells, specific genotyping is required for the 5' and 3' ends of both alleles. As the 3' genotyping only is the same primer set for both the Cherry and Clover cassettes it is possible that only one is targeted. 3' genotyping should be shown both for the Cherry and Clover alleles separately. Especially as CRISPR was used to generate these, it is quite possible the other allele has an NHEJ generated mutation which does not amplify by PCR, meaning that the positive band is derived from just one targeted allele (without amplification from the second allele) (New Figure 1—figure supplement 2 - old Figure S1c; primer pair c).</p><p>2. Some of the clones are apparently positive in the wrong genotyping reactions.</p><p>Clone 33 and 24 are supposedly heterozygous for the Clover allele but also appear to be positive for the specific Cherry allele (New Figure 1—figure supplement 2A - figure supplement 2A - Figure S1c; primer pair b). This may indicate that the clones are carrying extra integrated copies of the targeting vectors or that the clones analysed contain a mixture of cells both of which may impact the downstream analysis.</p><p>Clone 37 also has an apparent 3rd band when PCR is performed with the internal primer set (primer pair d; Figure S1c). This may indicate a duplication of the cassette at the targeted locus. This is especially important to resolve given that the data presented does not prove both alleles are correctly targeted at the 3' end.</p><p>3. Sequencing of the targeted alleles had not been done or has not been adequately detailed</p><p>There is no real description of the sequencing done on the targeting alleles. It is not uncommon for CRISPR generated alleles to have rearrangements including nucleotide changes, indels, local rearrangements and additional integrations were also frequently generated (e.g. Codner et al. BMC Biol. 2018 Jun 21;16(1):70.). Consequently it is important that these alleles should be properly characterised.</p><p>4. Although the quantification (Figure 4) shows increase in nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of β-catenin, the images presented do not seem to support this. Can the authors present zoomed-in images of different cells to demonstrate that this is the case?</p><p>5. There seems to be more perinuclear puncta for Cherry-β-catenin in general compared to Clover-β-catenin, and they increase in the presence of CHIR99021 compared to DMSO control. The authors do not comment on this, and how it might possibly impact the quantification of the images, given that these puncta are outside the nuclear area.</p><p>6. Consistent with point #2 above, siCLOVER experiments (Figure 5) demonstrate that a pool of Cherry-β-catenin seems to localize at the perinuclear region in cells. The authors do not comment on this and also do not provide quantification of the fluorescence imaging experiments to support their conclusion.</p><p>7. How do clover-WT and Cherry-mut-β-catenin diffuse in response to treatment with exogenous Wnt ligand, given that Wnt secretion is still required for Wnt signaling activity in HCT116 cells? Is there a difference in their nuclear translocation?</p><p>8. Why is there a band corresponding to Cherry β-catenin in the western blot of clone #33 (Figure 2)? The authors do not comment on this. Also, were all lanes loaded with equivalent amounts of total protein? The β-catenin expression levels in knock-ins are clearly higher than in the parental line.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Allele-specific endogenous tagging and quantitative analysis of β-catenin in colorectal cancer cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Owen J Sansom (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Regarding the new experiments looking at diffusion after treatment with porcupine inhibitor, which show some level of Wnt regulation of the Δ45 mutant, have the authors considered that GSK3 inhibition produced by Wnt treatment will also reduce the association of β-catenin with APC; perhaps this is the origin of their observation.</p><p>2. The discussion starting at line 430 could use some clarification. Can the authors be more specific as to what they think are the causes of the difference in diffusivity of the WT and mutant alleles? One can imagine that the mutant is bound to Axin and APC in the destruction complex and not turned over as fast as WT. The authors also mention association with transcription factors, and also cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of destruction complex components. Perhaps a cartoon or at least a clear delineation of the possible reasons for these behaviors would help.</p><p>3. Figure S1d is frequently referred to but is not clearly indicated. I assume it's part of S1B but not clear. These supplemental figures are also called out in the rebuttal but don't exactly correspond to what is in the manuscript. Lowercase vs. uppercase? Labeling of the individual FACS plots is needed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64498.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors show that wt and mutant β-catenins both diffuse in larger complexes that differ between wt and mutant, possibly destruction complexes vs. transcriptional partners.

We now show 3’ genotyping with three different primer pairs (Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A primer pairs c, e, e’). While primer pair e selectively amplifies the Cherry-tagged allele and e’ selectively amplifies the Clover-tagged allele, primer set c amplifies both alleles, which can be distinguished by their size, due to the different lengths of the antibiotic resistance markers (Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). All three PCRs support the correct integration of each cassette in the different clones. To make these results more accessible, we now show all primer pairs separately in Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A.</p><p>Furthermore, we have also performed additional genotyping of the double targeted clone 37 with primers annealing 5’ and 3’ of the integration cassettes outside of the homology arms (New Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). This further supports the correct integration and does not indicate that multiple copies of the cassette are present in the target locus. Moreover, we have used the PCR amplicons spanning the modified locus for Sanger sequencing (primers are indicated in Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, sequence alignments are shown in New Figure 1—figure supplement 3,4), which further supports successful gene targeting. We have revised the text to better explain these results.</p><p>Specifically, we have made the following changes to the text:</p><p>“In the following we focus on clones #24, #33, #37, #45, as they were found to represent different integration events. To confirm the editing events, genomic DNA, mRNA and protein lysates were analyzed and compared to the parental HCT116 (β-catenin<sup>WT/∆45</sup>) cell line and to an HCT116 isogenic cell line in which the ∆Ser45 allele was removed (β-catenin<sup>WT+/-</sup>) (Chan et al., 2002). First, to analyze them in depth, we used primers annealing upstream and downstream of the fluorophore tags (primers (a) in Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). While PCR amplicons of successfully tagged <italic>CTNNB1/</italic>β-catenin alleles are expected to be more than 3 kb in length, amplicons from the untagged locus would be approximately 1.2 kb. PCR from genomic DNA from clone #37 resulted in a single band of 3kb, indicating that both alleles of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> were edited. In contrast, genotyping of clones #33, #45 and #24 resulted in 3 kb and 1.2 kb amplicons, suggesting that only a single donor integrated in one allele (Figure 1-figure supplement 2A). Since genotyping with primers annealing within the donor construct cannot distinguish between homology-mediated integration at the target locus and non-targeted integration elsewhere in the genome, we next performed genotyping PCRs with one primer annealing in the <italic>CTNNB1</italic> locus and the other inside the integration cassette (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) .....”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

To further verify the genotype of the indicated clones, we performed additional PCRs (New primer pairs d,e and e’ – Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). These include primer sets, which distinguish the Cherry and Clover alleles by their BRS/blasticidin (Cherry, new primer set e) and HGR/hygromycin (Clover, new primer set e’) resistance genes. Clones #24 and #33 result in bands with primer pair e’, but no amplification with primer pair e, indicating that they exclusively harbor a Clover-tagged allele (Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Importantly, we also performed PCR with primer pair c, where both primers anneal inside the donor plasmid and would therefore also amplify integrations elsewhere in the genome (Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). Due to the size difference of the blasticidin and hygromycin resistance genes, this PCR can differentiate between both donor templates. In clones #24 and #33, we exclusively detect a larger PCR amplicon expected from the Clover donor. Together, these assays support that clones #24 and #33 only contain a single integration of the Clover donor template in one β-catenin allele.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clone 37 also has an apparent 3rd band when PCR is performed with the internal primer set (primer pair d; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A - old Figure S1c).

We would expect to detect larger bands in the case of full or partial cassette duplication by most of the primers (Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, New Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). We do not detect such bands, however, indicating single copy integration of our donor sequences. Occasionally, a weak and often fuzzy DNA signal appears above the main bands, which we interpret as an unspecific amplification event or artefact of the agarose gels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As expected, we found that several clones carried mutations and/or rearrangements (Figure S1C). Sequencing also confirmed that only clone #37, which has been used for the bi-allelic comparison presented in this manuscript, harbors an integration cassette in both alleles. Importantly, extended sequence analysis of clone #37 covered both integrated regions completely and confirmed correct integration (Modified Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, New Figure 1—figure supplement 2,3,4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

The authors do not comment on this and also do not provide quantification of the fluorescence imaging experiments to support their conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we quantified immunofluorescence as shown in New Figure 5B, New Figure 5—figure supplement 1. Since β-catenin is difficult to detect on an endogenous level, its quantification is challenging, especially upon downregulation, and interpretation of the results is limited. New Figure 5B represents one of the four biologically independent experiments and normalized results of four independent ones are provided in New Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. How do clover-WT and Cherry-mut-β-catenin diffuse in response to treatment with exogenous Wnt ligand, given that Wnt secretion is still required for Wnt signaling activity in HCT116 cells? Is there a difference in their nuclear translocation?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated by the reviewer, HCT116 cells express canonical Wnt ligands, resulting in strong Wnt pathway activity. Therefore, it is not surprising that no changes were detected by IF upon addition of recombinant Wnt3a (New Figure 4C). Presumably, the cells reached maximal Wnt activity even without Wnt ligand stimulation, as shown previously (Voloshanenko et al. Nature Commun 2013). Hence, to address the role of Wnt secretion, we inhibited Wnt protein secretion using the porcupine inhibitor LGK974. First, we treated HCT116 #37 cells with the porcupine inhibitor LGK974 for five to six days to inhibit endogenous Wnt ligand secretion, then added 200 ng/ml of recombinant Wnt3a to induce Wnt signaling and performed immunofluorescence analysis 16 h later. Upon inhibition of Wnt secretion from HCT116 #37 cells, we observed a strong decrease of β-catenin that was rescued upon addition of recombinant Wnt3a (New Figure 4C). Surprisingly, not only β-catenin-Clover WT protein but also β-catenin-Cherry ∆Ser45 protein was regulated by LGK974. As we saw striking differences in the signal of β-catenin, we cannot measure translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of the protein.</p><p>The quantification of IF data of endogenous β-catenin especially upon signal reduction could lead to an over-interpretation of the data as the signal intensity is not linear. To confirm this result, we performed FCS measurements of β-catenin alleles after LGK794 treatment. Indeed, concentrations of both alleles of β-catenin are regulated by LGK974 treatment. β-catenin-Clover WT protein concentration in the cytoplasm is strongly dependent on Wnt secretion, for which the concentration in the cytosol was reduced from C<sub>WT,LGK</sub> = 36 ± 10 nM to C<sub>WT,LGK</sub> = 7.2 ± 2.6 nM. Additional treatment with recombinant Wnt3a raised the concentration again and almost reversed the effects of the LGK treatment (C<sub>WT,LGK</sub><sup>+</sup><sub>Wnt3a</sub> = 20 ± 8 nM, Cytosol). The concentration of the mutant β-catenin-Cherry decreased from C<sub>Δ45,DMSO</sub> = 101 ± 18 nM to C<sub>Δ45,LGK</sub> = 79 ± 13 nM upon LGK974 treatment and rose again to C<sub>Δ45,LGK</sub><sup>+</sup><sub>Wnt3a</sub> = 94 ± 22 nM by adding Wnt3a (New Figure 6D, New Figure 6—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Why is there a band corresponding to Cherry β-catenin in the western blot of clone #33 (Figure 2)? The authors do not comment on this. Also, were all lanes loaded with equivalent amounts of total protein? The β-catenin expression levels in knock-ins are clearly higher than in the parental line.</p></disp-quote><p>To improve the presentation of Figure 2B, we now indicated the different isoforms of β-catenin in the Western blot. Regarding clone #33, the lower band corresponds to the WT allele of β-catenin indicating the heterozygosity of clone #33. β-actin serves as a loading control in Figure 2B. Since less total protein was detected in the lane of the parental cell line, this might explain the lower β-catenin levels. Comparison of qPCR (Figure 3B) and CTNNB1/β-catenin mRNA expression levels indicated no differences between parental cells and clones. To clarify this point, we made additional Western blots to compare the parental cells and clone #37 and added them as New Figure 2—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Regarding the new experiments looking at diffusion after treatment with porcupine inhibitor, which show some level of Wnt regulation of the Δ45 mutant, have the authors considered that GSK3 inhibition produced by Wnt treatment will also reduce the association of β-catenin with APC; perhaps this is the origin of their observation.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results indicate that the mutant form of β-catenin can also (in part) be regulated by Wnt signaling, likely involving the regulation of its interaction with APC. In line with our report, previous studies have indicated that β-catenin mutants with deletion or a mutation of Ser 45 retain signaling activity and are still responsive towards Wnt activation (PMID: 12060769 and PMID: 32751567). Together, these data suggest that, despite the absence of Ser45 phosphorylation, interactions of β-catenin with the destruction complex and its proteasomal degradation still occur. Further studies will be required to test if inhibition of GSK3 after Wnt stimulation is an essential mechanism that controls the cellular behavior of mutant β-catenin, including its interaction with APC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The discussion starting at line 430 could use some clarification. Can the authors be more specific as to what they think are the causes of the difference in diffusivity of the WT and mutant alleles? One can imagine that the mutant is bound to Axin and APC in the destruction complex and not turned over as fast as WT. The authors also mention association with transcription factors, and also cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of destruction complex components. Perhaps a cartoon or at least a clear delineation of the possible reasons for these behaviors would help.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have rephrased and expanded this part of the discussion to indicate the different possibilities. In short, wt β-catenin protein diffuses faster than mutant β-catenin, suggesting that wt protein is present as individual molecules or as part of smaller complexes, whereas the mutant is part of larger, more slowly diffusing complexes. FCS analysis only reveals the size but not the composition of the complexes. Hence, we can only speculate about the different possibilities. For example, in the nucleus, the mutant form presumably already interacts with the Wnt enhanceosome, in the absence of stimulation. We agree with the reviewer that, in the cytoplasm, the mutant form is likely to interact with the destruction complex, but might not be turned over as fast as the wt isoform. In the revised manuscript, we discuss these possibilities in much more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure S1d is frequently referred to but is not clearly indicated. I assume it's part of S1B but not clear. These supplemental figures are also called out in the rebuttal but don't exactly correspond to what is in the manuscript. Lowercase vs. uppercase? Labeling of the individual FACS plots is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for pointing out the inconsistency in the figure labels, which we have corrected in the revised manuscript. We have added the labeling of the FACS plots, which was accidentally removed from the Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. Now every individual plot is labeled as (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv). We have also corrected the inconsistencies in the figure labeling.</p></body></sub-article></article>
