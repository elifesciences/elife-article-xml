Myelin production during development is dynamic and involves both sheath formation and loss (3, 9-13). However, how these parameters are balanced to generate this heterogeneity in sheath number has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore this question, we combined extensive time-lapse and longitudinal imaging of oligodendrocytes in the developing zebrafish spinal cord to quantify sheath initiation and loss. Surprisingly, we found that oligodendrocytes repetitively ensheathed the same axons multiple times before any stable sheaths were formed. Importantly, this repetitive ensheathment was independent of neuronal activity. At the level of individual oligodendrocytes, each cell initiated a highly variable number of total ensheathments. However, ~80–90% of these ensheathments always disappeared, an unexpectedly high, but consistent rate of loss. The dynamics of this process indicated rapid membrane turnover as ensheathments were formed and lost repetitively on each axon. To better understand how these sheath initiation dynamics contribute to sheath accumulation and stabilization, we disrupted membrane recycling by expressing a dominant-negative mutant form of Rab5. Oligodendrocytes over-expressing this mutant did not show a change in early sheath initiation dynamics but did lose a higher percentage of ensheathments in the later stabilization phase. Overall, oligodendrocyte sheath number is heterogeneous because each cell repetitively initiates a variable number of total ensheathments that are resolved through a consistent stabilization rate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myelination</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>ensheathment dynamics</kwd><kwd>endocytic recycling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5F31NS118830</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Almeida</surname><given-names>Adam R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37NS82203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macklin</surname><given-names>Wendy B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oligodendrocytes iteratively wrap and unwrap the same domain of an axon multiple times during development, which likely impacts myelin sheath stabilization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelin sheaths are specialized cellular structures produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) that wrap around axons to accelerate the velocity of action potential conduction and to provide trophic support to neurons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida and Lyons, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stadelmann et al., 2019</xref>). The number of myelin sheaths that are supported by each oligodendrocyte is remarkably variable (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Simons and Nave, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Williamson and Lyons, 2018</xref>). Experiments using genetically encoded fluorescent reporters and immunostaining in both murine and zebrafish models establish that oligodendrocytes have anywhere from one sheath per cell up to about 50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czopka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bechler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osanai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bacmeister et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Swire et al., 2019</xref>). However, the importance of this heterogeneity in sheath number and how it is created is still unclear.</p><p>Time-lapse imaging in zebrafish has shown that the dynamics of developmental myelination include both sheath production and sheath loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czopka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Appel, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Djannatian et al., 2023</xref>). As past studies have not thoroughly compared sheath formation and loss across the same individual cells, the question remains as to the relative contribution of these two mechanisms to establishing oligodendrocyte sheath number. Understanding this balance is important because there are dramatically different cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate sheath formation and loss. Thus, both processes could potentially be manipulated to improve myelin regeneration.</p><p>To address this gap in our knowledge we combined extensive time-lapse and longitudinal imaging in the developing zebrafish spinal cord to quantify both sheath initiation and loss from the same cells. Unexpectedly, oligodendrocytes repetitively formed and retracted ensheathments from the same axon multiple times before any stable sheaths were formed, a phenomenon that was independent of neuronal activity. These dynamics resulted in all oligodendrocytes consistently stabilizing only ~10–20% of the total number of immature ensheathments formed by each cell. Altering the endocytic recycling pathway in oligodendrocytes did not disrupt early sheath initiation dynamics but resulted in fewer ensheathments being maintained during the later stabilization phase. These studies suggest that oligodendrocyte sheath number is determined by the total number of ensheathments that are formed by each cell. Sheath stabilization is an important part of the process since it occurs at such a low rate but is proportionally regulated across oligodendrocytes.</p><boxed-text id="box1"><label>Box 1.</label><caption><title>Definitions.</title></caption><p><bold>Sheath initiation:</bold> The beginning steps of wrapping oligodendrocyte membrane around an axon.</p><p><bold>Ensheathment:</bold> Oligodendrocyte membrane wrapped around an axon.

However, it is unclear how this variability arises during development. Oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord myelinate either dorsal or ventral axon tracts and occupy these regions with differing cell densities. There are ~2-fold more myelinating oligodendrocytes in the ventral tracts compared to the dorsal tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). These domains have different functions, with ascending dorsal axons primarily transmitting sensory information and descending ventral axons transmitting motor information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Thau and Reddy, 2022</xref>). We investigated whether some of the variability in oligodendrocyte sheath number comes from quantifying cells from both regions together. Zebrafish embryos were injected at the single-cell stage with a <italic>sox10:eGFP-CAAX</italic> plasmid to sparsely label the membrane of individual oligodendrocytes. At 4 dpf, sheath number ranged from 4 to 21 per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), which is in line with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, oligodendrocytes in the dorsal region of the spinal cord had more sheaths on average than oligodendrocytes in the ventral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). No statistically significant differences in average sheath length or the total sheath length were found when comparing these groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Oligodendrocytes in the ventral spinal cord that myelinated Mauthner axons were excluded from all analyses in this manuscript. To investigate how the regional difference in sheath number is generated, we compared sheath initiation and loss by oligodendrocytes in the dorsal and ventral regions of the spinal cord.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sheath number was highly variable, but oligodendrocytes in the dorsal region of the spinal cord had more sheaths per cell than oligodendrocytes in the ventral region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lateral image of the spinal cord of a living <italic>Tg(mbp:eGFP-CAAX; mbp:TagRFP</italic>) larva (scale bar = 20 µm).

The earliest stages of eGFP-CAAX-labeled sheath formation on tagRFP-CAAX-labeled axons were captured with extensive time-lapse imaging from 2.5 to 3 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, see Materials and methods for more details). We could consistently identify immature ensheathments that were ~2 µm or longer, surrounding axons with a cylindrical shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Unexpectedly, each oligodendrocyte repetitively ensheathed the same axonal domain an average of 2–3 times before any stable sheaths were formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, E</xref> [T0’, T15’, T45’, T60’]). We define repetitive ensheathment as multiple rounds of sheath initiation/loss on the same domain of an axon. Each axon domain was defined as the region between the two most lateral ensheathment attempts made by the same oligodendrocyte during a series of repetitive ensheathments. In cases with only a single ensheathment attempt, the axon domain was considered the region directly underneath the sheath. Of the 25 axonal domains analyzed, 14 of them ended up with a stabilized sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and 11 were lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The total number of ensheathment attempts on each axonal domain ranged from 1 to 6, and 72% of these domains were ensheathed more than once. This repetitive ensheathment phenomenon was therefore common in our experiment and possibly fundamental to the process of building myelin sheaths.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Oligodendrocytes repetitively ensheathed the same axonal domains before stable sheaths were formed.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Axonal ensheathment dynamics experimental paradigm.

This drug is a sodium channel blocker that silences action potentials throughout the CNS. Neuronal activity is important for myelination, and it is possible that the repetitive axonal ensheathment that we observed could result from silencing neuronal activity. We tested this using the same axonal ensheathment imaging paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We anesthetized each larva in either tricaine or pancuronium bromide, which is a neuromuscular blocking drug that does not dampen neuronal activity in the CNS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538346/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK538346/</ext-link>).

Importantly, there was essentially no difference in the average number of times an oligodendrocyte ensheathed the same axonal domain when comparing these forms of anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Since we sometimes observed more than one axonal domain on the same axon, we also normalized the data by averaging the total number of ensheathment attempts across all domains of each axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, there was still no difference between the two forms of anesthesia. We also found that 43% of the domains were stabilized (16 of 37) at the end of the imaging paradigm for the tricaine group and 55% were stabilized (16 of 29) for the pancuronium bromide group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

To do this we measured calcium transients in the zebrafish spinal cord using the <italic>Tg(elav3:H2B-GCaMP6f</italic>) pan-neuronal transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dunn et al., 2016</xref>). We anesthetized larvae at 2.5 dpf in pancuronium bromide and imaged the spinal cord above the yolk sac extension at 4 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Each larva was then spiked with embryo media containing either tricaine or pancuronium bromide (control) for 5 min. After this, another video was collected on the same cells. There was no significant difference in the number of calcium transients in the pre- and post-videos for the controls, but there was a clear reduction in transients after the tricaine spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). Due to the variability in the total number of transients that we observed across all the larvae, we also normalized the data by dividing the number of transients in the post-video by the number of transients in the pre-video to generate a percentage. There was still a clear difference in the percentage of calcium transients in the tricaine spiked group relative to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Collectively, this experiment allows us to more strongly conclude that the repetitive ensheathment phenomenon that we observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> is independent of neuronal activity.</p><p>Further assessment of the two axonal ensheathment experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> indicates that for the tricaine condition, 72.6% of all axonal domains were ensheathed more than once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, 65.5% of domains were ensheathed more than once for the pancuronium bromide group. In 100% of these instances, each axonal domain was repetitively ensheathed by the same oligodendrocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, the same cell process performs each ensheathment and seems to maintain continuous contact with the axon ~63–68% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>, see Materials and methods for more details). This suggests that maintaining contact with the axon could be important for sheath formation.</p><p>We next tried to better understand how the stabilization of sheaths might result from this repetitive ensheathment process. Due to the similarity in the outcomes for the tricaine and pancuronium bromide conditions in the previous paragraph, we combined all our data together to look at other metrics. We first looked at whether the average number of repetitive ensheathments for an axonal domain is different based on whether a sheath becomes stabilized. However, we found that there was no significant difference for this parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We then divided all stabilized domains by the number of total ensheathment attempts and this results in an a relatively low stabilization rate of 20.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). This means that only one in five ensheathment attempts is stabilized on average by the end of the imaging paradigm at 3 dpf. However, for the instances when the process maintained contact with the axon, 65.1% of these resulted in a stabilized sheath (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G</xref>). This suggests that continuous axonal contact might promote sheath stabilization. Collectively, this data supports a model where oligodendrocytes extensively explore the axonal environment to find targets that are primed for sheath formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The repetitive ensheathment of axons did not correlate with axon diameter</title><p>If the repetitive ensheathment of axons is independent of neuronal activity, it is possible that the mechanism is more biophysical in nature. One possibility is that oligodendrocytes measure the size of each axon by wrapping and unwrapping it multiple times. To explore this possibility, we measured the diameters of all the axonal domains in our two repetitive ensheathment experiments from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> above. We performed a full-width 1/3 max measurement of the diameter of each axonal domain underneath one of the ensheathments in each series. We then did a linear regression to assess the relationship between the diameter of the axon and the number of times that it was ensheathed. The R<sup>2</sup> value was 0.01 regardless of whether the ensheathment was stabilized or not. Thus, we found no relationship between these parameters in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Oligodendrocyte nascent sheath accumulation involved extensive sheath initiation and loss</title><p>In the previous axonal ensheathment experiments, we captured the dynamics of sheath initiation from the perspective of the individual processes of an oligodendrocyte.

Embryos were co-injected with our <italic>sox10:eGFP-CAAX</italic> oligodendrocyte lineage cell membrane reporter and <italic>myrf:tagRFP</italic>, a cytosolic reporter expressed in myelin-fated oligodendrocytes. This allowed us to identify sparse, double-labeled eGFP<sup>+</sup>RFP<sup>+</sup> cells in both the dorsal and ventral tracts of the spinal cord at 2.5 dpf. We captured the cellular dynamics of each cell for 15 hr with a 5 min imaging interval. At 3 dpf, larvae were placed back into embryo medium. At 4 dpf, the same larvae were remounted, and a single static image was taken for each of the same cells. From this, the formation and loss of every ensheathment could be tracked for each cell. Additionally, quality control experiments determined that the conditions of this imaging paradigm did not change the final sheath number or average sheath length of these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, see Materials and methods for further details).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Oligodendrocyte nascent sheath accumulation involved extensive sheath initiation and loss.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Oligodendrocyte ensheathment dynamics imaging paradigm.

As in published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czopka et al., 2013</xref>), we found that oligodendrocytes have an initial phase of immature sheath accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), followed by a phase of sheath stabilization and loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the accumulation phase was very dynamic in our studies, with a significant number of ensheathments eventually lost. For example, only 5 out of 19 ensheathment attempts were stabilized for the outlined region of the cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (# 10, 13, 14, 18, and 19, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This is consistent with our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>. We also readily observed instances of possible repetitive ensheathment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, since we do not have axons labeled in this experiment, we cannot definitively conclude that this is what we observed.</p><p>To better understand the impact of these ensheathment dynamics, we needed to average the levels of sheath initiation and loss across all cells in our data set and establish a graphic method for presenting the results. However, the number of hours over which each cell accumulates sheaths ranged from ~4 to 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), making it difficult to combine data from multiple cells for quantitative comparison. Nevertheless, we identified a definable transition point for each cell from when they were accumulating new immature sheaths to when they were stabilizing them. Thus, once an oligodendrocyte accumulated a peak (or maximum) number of immature sheaths, every cell slowed down and stopped forming new sheaths. Given this common dynamic of accumulation and plateau, it was therefore possible to normalize the timing of sheath accumulation in each video by defining the frame at which each cell had accumulated its peak number of sheaths as time zero for that cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Using this normalization for 19 individual dorsal cells and 18 individual ventral cells, we found that the dorsal cells accumulated a higher peak number of ensheathments compared to the ventral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, ~95% of all ensheathments attempts occurred before reaching this peak for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, vertical dashed line). This was an average of ~100 ensheathment attempts for dorsal cells and ~74 for ventral cells. Interestingly, ~75% of these ensheathments were also lost before reaching peak for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Collectively, this data shows that oligodendrocytes initiate a remarkable number of immature ensheathments, with only a small percentage maintained by the end of the accumulation phase.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Oligodendrocyte nascent sheath accumulation involved a consistent and high rate of sheath initiation and loss.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time required for peak (or max) sheath accumulation per cell (hours).

Dorsal oligodendrocytes exhibited more ensheathment attempts, accumulated a higher peak number of immature ensheathments, and maintained more sheaths at the 4 dpf time point compared to ventral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–E</xref>). Dorsal oligodendrocytes also lost more sheaths during the stabilization phase compared to ventral cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, both populations stabilized a similar percentage of ensheathments throughout the accumulation, stabilization, and combined phases of our experimental paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>). Thus, the levels of sheath initiation for each cell are very heterogeneous (ranging from ~20 to 190), but all oligodendrocytes exhibit a similar overall rate of sheath stabilization (~10–20%). To be confident with our quantification of this stabilization rate, we needed to be sure that these cells did not produce any new sheaths from 3 to 4 dpf during the sheath stabilization phase. We designed a modified ensheathment dynamics imaging paradigm to test this and found that oligodendrocytes made no new sheaths during this time interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, see Materials and methods for further details).

The cargo of endocytic vesicles is sorted at the early endosome (Rab5) and is then trafficked back to the plasma membrane or to the recycling endosome (Rab11) for further sorting. Alternatively, molecular cargo will be degraded as early endosomes mature into late endosomes/lysosomes (Rab7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grant and Donaldson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langemeyer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We initially analyzed whether the Rab5, Rab7, or Rab11 proteins localized to immature myelin sheaths.

We combined extensive time-lapse and longitudinal imaging of single oligodendrocytes and demonstrated that it was the total number of initial ensheathments formed that determined sheath number. Our analyses revealed that this was because ~80–90% of all ensheathments were consistently lost by each cell. This stabilization rate was comparable, whether we imaged the behavior of individual oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) or of individual axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). After summing up all the ensheathments that were formed in the axonal experiments, ~80% of them were lost. We therefore concluded that this low and consistent stabilization rate resulted from the repetitive ensheathment of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), which was independent of neuronal activity in our experiments. We next tested whether these dynamics were required for the proper accumulation of sheaths during the sheath initiation phase of myelination. It is likely that the same membrane and membrane proteins are being used with each iterative ensheathment attempt and so we disrupted the endocytic recycling pathway to perturb these dynamics. We found that inhibiting the activity of Rab5, a GTPase protein that regulates trafficking at the early endosome, caused oligodendrocytes to lose more sheaths during the stabilization phase specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). We therefore can only definitively conclude that Rab5 and endocytic recycling regulates longitudinal sheath stabilization in oligodendrocytes, i.e., its role in sheath initiation is unclear from these experiments.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>The process of sheath accumulation involves the repetitive ensheathment of axons and Rab5 promotes longitudinal sheath stabilization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model depicting how the repetitive ensheathment of axons is occurring during the dynamic accumulation phase of the sheath formation process.

Those studies were the first to demonstrate that oligodendrocytes accumulate sheaths over the course of a few hours. However, imaging intervals of 10–20 min were used, and sheaths had to be at least 5 µm in length and stable for &gt;10 min to be counted. Our studies show that immature ensheathments as short as 2 µm can wrap around axons, and many of these disappear before growing to 5 µm. To effectively track the dynamics of these initial ensheathments, 5 min was the minimum imaging interval necessary based on our criteria. Our work builds on these earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czopka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>) to show that while oligodendrocytes accumulate sheaths in a relatively short time, this phase is highly dynamic and involves extensive sheath initiation and loss.</p><p>Myelin sheath formation can be most simply described as a combination of axon adhesion and membrane biogenesis. So why are so many immature ensheathments lost? Our axonal ensheathment dynamics experiments demonstrated that oligodendrocytes will ensheathe the same domain of an axon an average of 2–3 times before a stable sheath is formed. This extensive ‘sampling’ of axons plausibly finds regions that are ready to be myelinated. Successful sheath formation presumably occurs on axons that are primed with the appropriate adhesion molecules needed to facilitate binding and downstream wrapping. Previous work supports this idea, showing that the disruption of different adhesion molecules in both neurons and oligodendrocytes can result in reduced myelin sheath number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Appel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elazar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djannatian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartsch et al., 1997</xref>). To further build on this concept, axonal vesicular release could be a part of this priming mechanism. This is suggested by the observation that synaptic adhesion proteins accumulate underneath and around myelin sheaths in axons to promote stability and sheath growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hines et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mensch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Appel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almeida et al., 2021</xref>). Recent evidence even suggests that myelin stimulates this vesicular release as part of a feed-forward mechanism to promote myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almeida et al., 2021</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the repetitive ensheathment of the same domain of an axon could be part of a mechanism for priming axons. However, our activity experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> did not significantly impact the repetitive ensheathment of axons. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that activity-dependent axonal vesicular release likely plays a larger role in the subsequent phase of sheath stabilization.</p><p>Our work supports a model where Rab5+, Rab7+, and Rab11+ endocytic endosomes localize to immature ensheathments and that Rab5 regulates the long-term stabilization of sheaths. It seems reasonable that the endocytic recycling pathway could be regulating the localization of adhesion proteins within myelin to help optimize sheath stability. The decrease in sheath stability that we observe when inhibiting Rab5 is consistent with some of the phenotypes reported from disrupting adhesion proteins in myelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes and Appel, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elazar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Djannatian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartsch et al., 1997</xref>). Previous work showing that the endocytic recycling pathway is critical for the proper localization of myelin proteins such as PLP in oligodendrocyte cultures also supports this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Trajkovic et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Winterstein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krämer et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldmann et al., 2011</xref>). Our study suggests that the recycling of adhesion molecules or other myelin proteins may be most prevalent during the stabilization phase of sheath formation. However, since we over-expressed a dominant-negative mutant to inhibit Rab5 activity using <italic>myrf</italic>, which is a specific but weak driver, it is possible that expression levels of the mutant were insufficient to disrupt the early accumulation phase of sheath formation. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the recycling of adhesion proteins is also important during the early sheath initiation phase.</p><p>It is very intriguing that there are regional differences in the number of ensheathments formed by each oligodendrocyte. Dorsal oligodendrocytes are less abundant but produce more ensheathments per cell than ventral oligodendrocytes. Despite these differences, cells from both regions exhibit a similar ratio of ensheathments formed to ensheathments lost. It is possible that oligodendrocytes balance total ensheathment attempts with the rate of stabilization based on the size of the axons that are being wrapped. Cells wrapping large caliber axons might not be able to support as many total sheaths due to the increased amount of membrane required to wrap larger axons. Whether there is a difference in the average axon diameter between the dorsal and ventral regions of the spinal cord is unclear. The mechanism by which oligodendrocytes would sense the caliber of each axon is also speculative, but one could envision that oligodendrocytes might repetitively ensheathe the same axons as a measuring mechanism. However, our data did not find a strong correlation between axon diameter and the number of ensheathment attempts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>This study highlights several striking observations regarding how oligodendrocyte sheath number is regulated at both the cellular and molecular level. There is a clear relationship between the number of ensheathment attempts performed by an oligodendrocyte and the number of these ensheathments that are ultimately stabilized during development. The endocytic recycling pathway appears to promote the stability of sheaths, but future work is needed to clarify its role. Overall, the current studies will lead to important future research examining how the mechanisms regulating membrane biogenesis and sheath stability cooperate to determine sheath number, sheath thickness, and length.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All source data have been provided within this manuscript.

Both sides of the spinal cord for each larva were imaged laterally above the yolk-sac extension with a 1× optical zoom (0.31 µm XY pixel size), a 0.3 µm z-step size (Nyquist), and 32× line averaging. Cell counts were performed in Imaris (version 9.8). Each image was cropped to separate dorsal and ventral regions. A Gaussian filter was then applied with a 0.311 µm width to smooth out noise. Following this, a local-background subtraction was performed with an estimated cell body size of 7 µm. A threshold for fluorescent intensity was then applied to each image manually. Finally, a 0.5 µm water-shed filter was used to separate contacting cell bodies and Imaris counted the number of cells in each image. Cell bodies occupying the area in between the dorsal and ventral axon tracts were manually removed (these cells were in the minority).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Static oligodendrocyte imaging for sheath number/length analysis</title><p>Individual sheaths were visualized by labeling oligodendrocytes with <italic>sox10:eGFP-CAAX</italic> by transient transgenesis. These cells were imaged at 4 dpf with a 2× optical zoom (0.16 µm XY pixel size), a 0.3 µm z-step size (Nyquist), and 32× line averaging. Cells were chosen that were not too crowded for accurate quantification. Except for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, dorsal and ventral cells were never combined for this analysis. In each image every sheath was identified and counted by inspecting individual optical sections. The lengths of each sheath were measured from maximum intensity projections using the simple neurite tracer plugin in Fiji. From this data we calculated sheath number, average sheath length, and the total sheath length per cell (calculated by adding up the length of all sheaths supported by each cell). The same images and ventral control data from this analysis were used and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Axonal ensheathment dynamics imaging and analysis</title><p>Criteria for quantifying ensheathment attempts using labeled axons were established. Axon membranes were sparsely labeled with the <italic>neuroD:tagRFP-CAAX</italic> plasmid by transient transgenesis in the <italic>Tg(nkx2.2:eGFP-CAAX</italic>) stable line. At 2.5 dpf larvae were anesthetized in tricaine and mounted, and time-lapse imaging was performed for 15–18 hr with an imaging interval of 5 min. A 2× optical zoom (0.16 µm XY pixel size), a 0.5 µm z-step size, and 16× line averaging were used. Imaging was done in the spinal cord above the yolk sac extension and focused on dorsal and midline axons, since the <italic>Tg(nkx2.2:eGFP-CAAX</italic>) line was too crowded in the ventral region for visualizing ensheathment dynamics. Regions in each video with potential axonal ensheathments were cropped and corrected for drift using the 3D drift correct plugin in Fiji. Individual optical sections were inspected and a volume projection in Imaris was analyzed for each axonal ensheathment. From this, we developed quantification criteria. Ensheathments had to be ~2 µm or longer and cylindrical in shape around the axon, that is, the axon fluorescent signal had to go through the center of the oligodendrocyte signal, and it had to be more than ~75% of the way around the axon. Once an ensheathment had formed, it had to shrink to below 2 µm in length and be less than half-way around the axon to be considered lost.</p><p>Repetitive ensheathments were multiple rounds of sheath initiation/loss on the same domain of an axon. Each axon domain was the region between the two most lateral ensheathment attempts that took place during a series of repetitive ensheathments. In cases with only a single ensheathment attempt, the axon domain was the region directly underneath the sheath. These domains ranged from ~2 to 20 µm in length. Some axons had more than one domain that was ensheathed. These domains were considered separate because they were ensheathed by different oligodendrocytes or because a single oligodendrocyte had more than one sheath on the same axon at the same time. Axonal domains were considered destabilized if each ensheathment was lost by the end of the time-lapse period and stable if they remained. We required that a minimum of 3 hr of video be acquired after the final ensheathment attempt to be quantified.</p><p>For the activity axonal ensheathment experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>Tg(nkx2.2:eGFP-CAAX</italic>) larvae were anesthetized and mounted in either tricaine or pancuronium bromide as described in the ‘Injections, anesthesia, mounting, and general imaging parameters’ section above. Using multi-well glass-bottom dishes (Greiner Bio-One, 627871), we imaged larvae from each group in each experiment exactly as described earlier in this section, and the videos were all processed and quantified exactly as was described.</p><p>We present data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, D</xref> showing how often the same process from the same oligodendrocyte performs each repetitive ensheathment. We also report on how often these processes seem to remain in contact with the axon. Except for one instance in this data set (64 repetitively ensheathed domains), if the same process performed each repetitive ensheathment it also remained in contact with the axon. For instances where different processes performed the repetitive ensheathments, this involved complete process retraction before a different process started the next ensheathment in the series. About 15–20% of processes could not be sufficiently tracked throughout the entire video due to periods of crowding from other processes. The activity for these instances was categorized as ‘unclear’. It is important to note that our imaging interval for these experiments was 5 min, which is not fast enough to fully capture all oligodendrocyte process dynamics. Analysis of this data set therefore could have missed some of these process movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Calcium imaging and quantification</title><p><italic>Tg(elav3:H2B-GCaMP6f</italic>) larvae were mounted at 2.5 dpf in pancuronium bromide as described in the ‘Injections, anesthesia, mounting, and general imaging parameters’ section above. We mounted two to three larvae in each well of a multi-well glass-bottom dish (Greiner Bio-One, 627871). This allowed us to pick a single larva per well to do a spike experiment on and then multiple spike experiments could be performed per dish. The same region of the spinal cord above the posterior portion of the yolk-sac extension was imaged. We used a 1× optical zoom (0.31 µm XY pixel size) and 8× line averaging. A 5 min, single optical-section, time-lapse video was collected at 4 Hz (4 fps) to get a baseline of calcium transients in each larva. Each well had 500 µL of embryo media with 0.45 mg/mL pancuronium bromide (same concentration as the agar) for the initial round of imaging. After this, each well was spiked with 500 µL of embryo media containing either pancuronium bromide (control group) or tricaine. For the control group the embryo media contained the same concentration of pancuronium bromide (0.45 mg/mL) and the embryo media for the tricaine spike group was at a 2× concentration (140 µg/mL final concentration as was used for all other experiments). All larvae were incubated for 5 min after the spike. Then, a final round of imaging was performed on the same cells in the same field of view for measuring changes in the overall number of transients.</p><p>All videos were processed and quantified post blinding. ROIs for the neuronal cell bodies in each field of view were generated in Fiji. The ‘despeckle’ filter was first used to clean up salt-and-pepper noise. A standard deviation time projection was made to create a visual of all the cell bodies in each video. Huang’s threshold was then applied manually to each projection to binarize the signal of each cell body. We used the ‘analyze particles’ function to automate the generation of ROIs around each cell. The ‘water-shed’ function was then used to separate cell bodies that were touching. Each set of ROIs were then applied to the raw video file and additional ROIs were added manually as needed that were missed by the segmentation work-flow. The mean intensity within each ROI was collected for every frame of the video and was transferred to excel for further analysis. Two ROIs were placed manually in each video for determining background levels. All the intensities in every frame for both background ROIs were averaged, and this single value was subtracted from every other mean intensity value that was collected. Calcium transients were determined with a moving baseline. Ten frames of video prior to each transient were averaged to set the baseline. The fluorescence intensity had to be 3 standard deviations above this baseline for a minimum of three frames to be counted. Within complex calcium transients with multiple peaks, transients were counted as being separate if the signal returned to below 3 standard deviations before going back up again. The total number of calcium transients within each video was quantified and after unblinding, the pre- and post-calcium transient numbers were compared.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Axon diameter measurements</title><p>The diameters of all the domains in both axonal ensheathment experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) were measured by selecting the first video frame of a single ensheathment for each axonal domain; a single optical section was then isolated for measurement in Fiji. Two different line scans with a 3-pixel width were drawn manually across each axon at the ensheathment site. The axon fluorescence intensity data was transferred to excel for further analysis. Two 8×4-pixel ROIs were also drawn to measure the background intensity. After background subtraction, the full-width 1/3 maximum was determined for each line scan manually and the two values from each domain were averaged as the representative diameter of each axonal domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Oligodendrocyte ensheathment dynamics imaging and analysis</title><p>Oligodendrocytes were sparsely double-labeled with our <italic>pEXPR-sox10:eGFP-CAAX</italic> plasmid and one of the following plasmids using transient transgenesis: <italic>pEXPR-myrf:tagRFP, pEXPR-myrf:tagRFP-RAB5C,</italic> or <italic>pEXPR-myrf:tagRFP- rab5C<sup>S36N</sup></italic>. The <italic>myrf</italic>-driven plasmids identified cells that were fated to make myelin. At 2.5 dpf, larvae were anesthetized in tricaine and mounted, and eGFP+/RFP+ progenitor cells were chosen for imaging above the yolk-sac extension in the spinal cord. Time-lapse imaging was performed for 15 hr with an imaging interval of 5 min. A 2× optical zoom (0.16 µm XY pixel size), a 0.75 µm z-step size, and 16× line averaging were used. After the time-lapse imaging period was over at 3 dpf, the larvae were removed from the mounting agar and were put back into embryo medium in separate wells of a 24-well plate. At 4 dpf, a final static image was taken for each of the same cells to conclude the imaging paradigm. To be considered for analysis, we had to obtain at least 30 min of imaging before each cell started the ensheathment process. Additionally, each cell had to stop making sheaths for at least 90 min before the end of the imaging interval.</p><p>A max projection of each video was background-subtracted and corrected for drift using Fiji’s 3D drift correct plugin. Sheath initiation and loss were counted manually in every frame using the multi-point counter in ImageJ based on the ensheathment criteria we established in the previous section. Although the counter ROIs for this were placed within each max projection, every sheath initiation/loss event was determined by inspecting individual optical sections and by looking at a volume projection in Imaris for each frame. At the final 4 dpf time point, all sheaths were counted, and the lengths were measured using the simple neurite tracer plugin in Fiji.</p><p>A quality control experiment determined that the conditions of this imaging paradigm did not significantly change the average sheath number or sheath length across a population of cells. Static images of both dorsal and ventral oligodendrocytes were collected at 4 dpf from zebrafish larvae that had been anesthetized in tricaine, mounted in agar, and housed in the time-lapse imaging chamber for the 15 hr experiment from 2.5 to 3 dpf. However, these larvae were not imaged during this time. We compared the sheath number and lengths for these cells (agar_tricaine condition) to our sheath number counts from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> (standard condition) and to cells that went through the full ensheathment dynamics imaging paradigm (time-lapse condition) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p><p>A separate quality control experiment determined that oligodendrocytes did not make any new ensheathments during the stabilization phase from 3 to 4 dpf. Cells were imaged using a modified ensheathment dynamics imaging paradigm. First, from 2.5 to 3 dpf, the imaging interval was 30 min rather than 5 min. At 3 dpf, the larvae were removed from the tricaine and imaging agar and were allowed to recover in embryo media for 30 min. After this the larvae were remounted, and the same cells were imaged for an additional 23 hr with an imaging interval of 15 min. We tracked sheath initiation and loss from 3 to 4 dpf for five dorsal cells and three ventral cells. None of these eight oligodendrocytes produced any new sheaths from 3 to 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Endosome imaging and quantification</title><p>Our <italic>myrf:eGFP-RAB5C</italic>, <italic>-RAB11A</italic>, and <italic>-RAB7A</italic> fusion constructs were transiently expressed alongside <italic>sox10</italic>:mScarlet-CAAX to label the membrane of individual oligodendrocytes. At 2.5 dpf, larvae were anesthetized in tricaine, mounted, and cells that were in the early stages of the ensheathment process were chosen for imaging. Static snapshots of a mix of both dorsal and ventral cells were taken using a 3× optical zoom (0.1 µm XY pixel size, Nyquist), a 0.75 µm z-step size, and 16–32× line averaging. A larger z-step size than Nyquist (0.3 µm) was used to minimize motion artifacts during imaging. Images were pre-screened by viewing the membrane marker channel only and individual sheaths with high-quality imaging were cropped for further processing. The number of endosomal puncta in each image was quantified using a spots analysis in Imaris (version 9.2). We used an estimated XY diameter of 0.5 µm to detect Rab5 and 0.4 µm to detect Rab7 and Rab11. After a local-background subtraction, a threshold for fluorescent intensity was applied to each image manually. Imaris counted the number of puncta, and we normalized these numbers to the length of each sheath (in µm), measured using the Imaris filament tracer. Only puncta within a sheath were counted based on overlap with the membrane marker. Puncta that were present in adjacent processes or other structures were manually excluded from each image.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics, sample size determination, and reproducibility/rigor</title><p>All statistics and plots were done using GraphPad Prism (version 9). We used the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test for all unpaired comparisons with no assumption of normality. We used the non-parametric Wilcoxon test for all paired comparisons with no assumption of normality. For groups of three or more, global significance was first assessed using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test. This was followed up by Dunn’s multiple comparison tests if the global p-value was &lt;0.05 (unless otherwise stated in each figure legend). Global p-values are reported when not significant. Non-parametric statistical tests were chosen since each data set had groups that were not normally distributed and/or had unequal variances. A Fisher’s exact test was used when testing categorical data because our sample sizes were less than 100. Simple linear regressions were performed for comparing the association of two variables with each other. Individual data points are shown for all plots with the central dashed lines representing the average of the group. We considered p &lt; 0.05 the threshold for statistical significance and we provide exact p-values for all analyses.</p><p>The sample sizes for the cell counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the repetitive axonal ensheathment analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, the Rab+ endosomal quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, and the modified ensheathment dynamics data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> were not pre-determined.

The control, Rab5WT, and Rab5DN ‘sheath number per cell’ data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> was used to do a power analysis (GPower Version 3.1) to determine the appropriate sample sizes for the oligodendrocyte ensheathment dynamics data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (time-lapse group) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>. We performed a power analysis using the parametric ‘ANOVA: Fixed effects, omnibus, one-way’ stats test in GPower with three groups (control, Rab5WT, Rab5DN) with an alpha error probability of 0.05 and 80% power. The effect size was calculated within GPower. From this, GPower calculated needing 15 cells per group. Since sheath number was not normally distributed, we had to assess statistical significance for these experiments using a non-parametric test. We therefore increased the sample size by 20% (n=15 increased to n=18) to account for the decreased power of non-parametric tests. The same time-lapse ventral control data set was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> because this data is very difficult to collect, and the analysis was very time intensive. Therefore, we also used the results of this power analysis to determine the same sample size of the dorsal group of cells analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> (time-lapse group).</p><p>All representative images in each figure were from the associated quantified data set. These images were adjusted for brightness and contrast for clarity of presentation. No quantifiable data was excluded from any analysis. Results/phenotypes that were replicated are present within this manuscript. All data in each figure was pooled from a minimum of two independent rounds of fish crossing and injections. Data for each individual oligodendrocyte in this study is considered a biological replicate because only one cell was imaged from each larva unless otherwise noted in each figure legend.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Robert H Miller (Reviewer #1); Sarah C Petersen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental</p><p>1.

The authors should double check the statistical methods employed in Figure 7 and clarify statistics throughout the manuscript to better describe the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are a number of issues that should be addressed to strengthen the manuscript as currently written.</p><p>1. Based on the data provided the studies are heavily overinterpreted and the language suggests a more profound result than is actually presented. It is not clear that the retraction of processes represents a destabilization of a complex sheath structure, and the text should be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>2. Along the same lines, OPCs are highly motile and time-lapse studies of oligodendrocytes in vitro show extensive process extension and retraction: it seems likely the authors are seeing the same thing in vivo. It might be interesting to see if transient disruption of actin polymerization or microtubule assembly affected the nature of these early interactions.</p><p>3. The repeated extension/retractions may reflect maturation of the oligodendrocytes and the random association of the nearest target axon to the process tip rather than the proposed molecular tuning. It was not clear the same axon was always targeted. While the data in Figure 2 shows the same axon being contacted, it is less clear in the other figures that it is always the exact same axon. The authors should clarify this point.</p><p>4. It is not clear how perturbation of Rab5 results in a loss of sheath stabilization, and Figure 6A seems redundant. This component of the paper seems somewhat out of line with the rest of the manuscript and maybe some additional studies – or even enhanced discussion would help with unification.</p><p>5. The studies would be strengthened by some perturbation studies. Given the short time frame of the initial cell interaction studies would TTX treatment be feasible to see if there is a role for activity in the selection process?</p><p>6. Does the difference in sheath number between dorsal and ventral cells reflect axon diameter with more smaller sheaths generated in dorsal regions, or is it a reflection of different populations of oligodendrocytes? Some additional quantification or at least discussion would be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is a wealth of data underpinning this manuscript, particularly with respect to the time-lapse datasets of myelination by oligodendrocytes in the zebrafish spinal cord. Although much of the data align well with previous analyses in the system, some novel insights are documented. The principal new finding is that of the repetitive ensheathment and unwrapping of early myelinating processes from single axons, and the apparently very high rate at which this occurs. I am, however, a little unclear as to how the various analyses in the manuscript relate to one another and think that a few aspects need to be clarified to allow the clearest conclusions to be drawn.</p><p>1. In Figure 2, there are very nice reconstructions of early ensheathing processes contacting and at least partly enwrapping axons, and exhibiting this wrapping and unwrapping type behaviour. However, what is not clear to me from the analysis presented is to what extent the unwrapping and re-wrapping represents a complete withdrawal from the axon or simply an unwrapping while retaining contact with the axon. It appears from the images shown that this wrapping-unwrapping-wrapping appears to show the myelinating process remains in continuous contact with the axon. One would suspect that the cell biology underlying a local wrapping-unwrapping-wrapping phenomenon, while maintaining contact with the axon to be quite distinct from making contact, wrapping, unwrapping, completely withdrawing from the axon, re-extending a process, re-wrapping etc. The data are clearly to hand, and I think an even more detailed description of the phenomena could be presented. It could obviously be that some processes do the former and others the latter, in which case it would be good to know the relative proportion doing so. This seems like an important additional analysis to me.</p><p>2. A huge amount of data centres on the analysis of time-lapse datasets where only the oligodendrocytes are labelled. I realise that this means that the authors can't be as definitive about the wrapping-unwrapping-wrapping of individual axons, but they could presumably tell which ensheathment events happen in the same region very locally, and which involve clear extension of processes and clear retraction of ensheathments from the axon entirely. It is basically the same point as above, but I think it would be very useful to categorise these very dynamic events further so that the field could better understand if we were observing dynamics at the level of processes in contact with axons/ very close to axons, or dynamic events that involved process extension and retraction as well. I hope this my point on this distinction is both clear to the authors and that they see that it will be important to deconstruct to fully appreciate the dynamics of myelination being described.</p><p>3. The data regarding the rab manipulations are interesting, but are clearly somewhat disconnected from the very early dynamics of initial ensheathment that represent arguably the most novel insights. I think that the authors could be a little clearer (relates to points 1 and 2) to make it very clear when during the entire process of myelination the rab effects are pronounced. This is reasonably clear when one digs into the data, but the abstract could be read in such a way that one might think that the various uses of the word stabilisation were of one event, where the rab manipulations made here are likely affecting a later stage than the initial part of the paper. Indeed, it could be that the expression of the constructs using a myrf sequence might have made it very hard to find a phenotype at the earlier initial ensheathment phase, so there is a chance of this being a false negative result. Could an alternative driver (olig1?) be used to test one of the candidates to better match the first part of the manuscript. The authors do discuss the limitations of the manipulation, but perhaps this could be a revision experiment worth the effort to have a more streamlined dataset.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I suggest the following major experiments:</p><p>1) Quantify axonal diameter (from Figure 2) to test whether this biases sampling and ultimately stabilization of myelin sheaths.</p><p>2) Similarly, test for effect of neuronal activity and/or subtype in early sampling and stabilization. This could be done in a number of ways. For instance, in Figure 2, distinguishing reticulospinal (phox2b+, activity dependent) or CoPA (tbx16+, activity independent) axons could permit measuring propensity for ensheathment attempt and/or stabilization. Alternatively, neuronal activity could be broadly disrupted or enhanced pharmacologically to test for this effect.</p><p>3) Given that already such a small proportion of nascent sheaths are stabilized in wild-type, what happens in larvae with a high number of (either mosaic or stably expressed) Rab5-DN oligodendrocytes? Is there ultimately reduced myelination overall, or is the relatively small decrease (per oligodendrocyte) negligible? This would contextualize the importance of endocytic recycling in myelination.</p><p>4) To get at the &quot;why&quot; repeated sampling occurs, the accumulation of synaptic vesicles with (or without) repeated sampling seems an obvious candidate to test. The fact that most destabilized sheaths only sampled the axonal domain once suggests that is insufficient to recruit pro-stabilization factors to the domain, but that 2-4 more sampling attempts could promote SV accumulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82111.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimental</p><p>1.

Given the massive number of axons in the tissue, we cannot have individual axons labeled in our individual oligodendrocyte ensheathment dynamics experiments, where we inject to tag single cells. Thus, we do not want to make any claims regarding the repetitive ensheathment of axons in this data. We have updated the text to better clarify this point (lines 212-215).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Assessing the impact of neuronal activity in this system would strengthen the work.</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent suggestion from the reviewers. We performed our time-lapse imaging using tricaine as anesthesia and therefore activity was silenced during these imaging paradigms. We did a quality control experiment in Figure 4.1 supp that showed that keeping larvae in tricaine for 15 hours from 2.5-3dpf did not impact final sheath number at 4dpf. This was our rationale for using tricaine in our experiments. However, it is possible that the repetitive ensheathment phenomenon that we observed in figure 2 was a result of silencing activity. To address this question, we compared tricaine and pancuronium bromide, which does not block CNS activity, in our axonal ensheathment paradigm in Figure 3. The results of this experiment are discussed on lines 132-160 and on lines 358-362 in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

The endogenous localization of Rab proteins in sheaths is a difficult experiment to interpret. Rab proteins are abundant within all cells, including axons. If we stained spinal cord tissue and found Rab5+ puncta in sheaths, we would not have the resolution to determine if the proteins were in the sheath or the axon.

Based on the data provided the studies are heavily overinterpreted and the language suggests a more profound result than is actually presented. It is not clear that the retraction of processes represents a destabilization of a complex sheath structure, and the text should be adjusted accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate this feed-back and we believe that the reviewer has made a good point. We have now included some definitions at the start of the manuscript (lines 50-69) so that we can make it absolutely clear what we mean with our terminology. We draw your attention to the use of the word “ensheathment”. To ensheathe means “to surround” and in our context an ensheathment is the surrounding of the axon with oligodendrocyte membrane. It is true that we do not know the composition of the oligodendrocyte membrane at this stage of the process. Additionally, the word “destabilized” is only meant to say that the ensheathment was lost from the axon. We have avoided using the term “retract” because we do not want to assume that we know the mechanism for how the oligodendrocyte membrane is disappearing. We have adjusted the text throughout the manuscript to be clearer about what we mean.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Along the same lines, OPCs are highly motile and time-lapse studies of oligodendrocytes in vitro show extensive process extension and retraction: it seems likely the authors are seeing the same thing in vivo. It might be interesting to see if transient disruption of actin polymerization or microtubule assembly affected the nature of these early interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point, and as we note in an earlier comment, we plan to pursue this in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The repeated extension/retractions may reflect maturation of the oligodendrocytes and the random association of the nearest target axon to the process tip rather than the proposed molecular tuning. It was not clear the same axon was always targeted. While the data in Figure 2 shows the same axon being contacted, it is less clear in the other figures that it is always the exact same axon. The authors should clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in essential revisions comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is not clear how perturbation of Rab5 results in a loss of sheath stabilization, and Figure 6A seems redundant. This component of the paper seems somewhat out of line with the rest of the manuscript and maybe some additional studies – or even enhanced discussion would help with unification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the intention and rationale for looking at Rab5 was not clear. We have modified the text throughout the manuscript to make this more obvious. How Rab5 disruption results in the loss of sheath stabilization is specifically discussed on lines 363-374.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The studies would be strengthened by some perturbation studies. Given the short time frame of the initial cell interaction studies would TTX treatment be feasible to see if there is a role for activity in the selection process?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in essential revisions comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Does the difference in sheath number between dorsal and ventral cells reflect axon diameter with more smaller sheaths generated in dorsal regions, or is it a reflection of different populations of oligodendrocytes? Some additional quantification or at least discussion would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question and we have addressed the part about axon diameter more directly in the discussion (lines 375-386).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There is a wealth of data underpinning this manuscript, particularly with respect to the time-lapse datasets of myelination by oligodendrocytes in the zebrafish spinal cord. Although much of the data align well with previous analyses in the system, some novel insights are documented. The principal new finding is that of the repetitive ensheathment and unwrapping of early myelinating processes from single axons, and the apparently very high rate at which this occurs. I am, however, a little unclear as to how the various analyses in the manuscript relate to one another and think that a few aspects need to be clarified to allow the clearest conclusions to be drawn.</p><p>1. In Figure 2, there are very nice reconstructions of early ensheathing processes contacting and at least partly enwrapping axons, and exhibiting this wrapping and unwrapping type behaviour. However, what is not clear to me from the analysis presented is to what extent the unwrapping and re-wrapping represents a complete withdrawal from the axon or simply an unwrapping while retaining contact with the axon. It appears from the images shown that this wrapping-unwrapping-wrapping appears to show the myelinating process remains in continuous contact with the axon. One would suspect that the cell biology underlying a local wrapping-unwrapping-wrapping phenomenon, while maintaining contact with the axon to be quite distinct from making contact, wrapping, unwrapping, completely withdrawing from the axon, re-extending a process, re-wrapping etc. The data are clearly to hand, and I think an even more detailed description of the phenomena could be presented. It could obviously be that some processes do the former and others the latter, in which case it would be good to know the relative proportion doing so. This seems like an important additional analysis to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in essential revisions comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A huge amount of data centres on the analysis of time-lapse datasets where only the oligodendrocytes are labelled. I realise that this means that the authors can't be as definitive about the wrapping-unwrapping-wrapping of individual axons, but they could presumably tell which ensheathment events happen in the same region very locally, and which involve clear extension of processes and clear retraction of ensheathments from the axon entirely. It is basically the same point as above, but I think it would be very useful to categorise these very dynamic events further so that the field could better understand if we were observing dynamics at the level of processes in contact with axons/ very close to axons, or dynamic events that involved process extension and retraction as well. I hope this my point on this distinction is both clear to the authors and that they see that it will be important to deconstruct to fully appreciate the dynamics of myelination being described.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in essential revisions comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The data regarding the rab manipulations are interesting, but are clearly somewhat disconnected from the very early dynamics of initial ensheathment that represent arguably the most novel insights. I think that the authors could be a little clearer (relates to points 1 and 2) to make it very clear when during the entire process of myelination the rab effects are pronounced. This is reasonably clear when one digs into the data, but the abstract could be read in such a way that one might think that the various uses of the word stabilisation were of one event, where the rab manipulations made here are likely affecting a later stage than the initial part of the paper. Indeed, it could be that the expression of the constructs using a myrf sequence might have made it very hard to find a phenotype at the earlier initial ensheathment phase, so there is a chance of this being a false negative result. Could an alternative driver (olig1?) be used to test one of the candidates to better match the first part of the manuscript. The authors do discuss the limitations of the manipulation, but perhaps this could be a revision experiment worth the effort to have a more streamlined dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the intention and rationale for looking at Rab5 was not clear. We have modified the text throughout to make this more obvious.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I suggest the following major experiments:</p><p>1) Quantify axonal diameter (from Figure 2) to test whether this biases sampling and ultimately stabilization of myelin sheaths.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in essential revisions comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, test for effect of neuronal activity and/or subtype in early sampling and stabilization. This could be done in a number of ways. For instance, in Figure 2, distinguishing reticulospinal (phox2b+, activity dependent) or CoPA (tbx16+, activity independent) axons could permit measuring propensity for ensheathment attempt and/or stabilization. Alternatively, neuronal activity could be broadly disrupted or enhanced pharmacologically to test for this effect.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in essential revisions comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given that already such a small proportion of nascent sheaths are stabilized in wild-type, what happens in larvae with a high number of (either mosaic or stably expressed) Rab5-DN oligodendrocytes? Is there ultimately reduced myelination overall, or is the relatively small decrease (per oligodendrocyte) negligible? This would contextualize the importance of endocytic recycling in myelination.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. We are planning to perform these experiments in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To get at the &quot;why&quot; repeated sampling occurs, the accumulation of synaptic vesicles with (or without) repeated sampling seems an obvious candidate to test. The fact that most destabilized sheaths only sampled the axonal domain once suggests that is insufficient to recruit pro-stabilization factors to the domain, but that 2-4 more sampling attempts could promote SV accumulation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point.
