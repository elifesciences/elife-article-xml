MetS-OA mice exhibited a rapid increase in joint subchondral bone plate and trabecular thickness before articular cartilage degeneration. Subchondral preosteoclasts undergo senescence at the pre- or early-osteoarthritis stage and acquire a unique secretome to stimulate osteoblast differentiation and inhibit osteoclast differentiation. Antagonizing preosteoclast senescence markedly mitigates pathological subchondral alterations and osteoarthritis progression in MetS-OA mice. At the molecular level, preosteoclast secretome activates COX2-PGE2, resulting in stimulated differentiation of osteoblast progenitors for subchondral bone formation. Administration of a selective COX2 inhibitor attenuated subchondral bone alteration and osteoarthritis progression in MetS-OA mice. Longitudinal analyses of the human Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) cohort dataset also revealed that COX2 inhibitor use, relative to non-selective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use, is associated with less progression of osteoarthritis and subchondral bone marrow lesion worsening in participants with MetS-OA.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our findings suggest a central role of a senescent preosteoclast secretome-COX2/PGE2 axis in the pathogenesis of MetS-OA, in which selective COX2 inhibitors may have disease-modifying potential.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health grant R01AG068226 and R01AG072090 to MW, R01AR079620 to SD, and P01AG066603 to XC.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cellular senescence</kwd><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>metabolic syndrome</kwd><kwd>senescence-associated secretory phenotype</kwd><kwd>subchondral thickening</kwd><kwd>cyclooxygenase 2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG068226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG072090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR079620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Demehri</surname><given-names>Shadpour</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01AG066603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Under metabolic syndrome, joint subchondral preosteoclasts acquire a senescence-associated secretome, which causes a rapid structural alteration of subchondral bone and contributes to the development of osteoarthritis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During the past two decades, major advancements have been made in understanding the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis-the most common chronic articular disease associated with pain and disability. However, effective disease-modifying osteoarthritis therapies are still unavailable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Misra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Veronese et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2020a</xref>). The heterogeneous causes of osteoarthritis make developing such therapies challenging. Osteoarthritis has long been considered the consequence of a ‘wear and tear’ process that leads to cartilage degradation, which is initiated and/or accelerated by direct joint trauma and excessive mechanical overloading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heijink et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang and Jordan, 2010</xref>). However, only 12% cases of symptomatic osteoarthritis are attributable to post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) of the hip, knee, or ankle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2006</xref>), indicating that mechanisms other than biomechanical factors are involved in osteoarthritis development.</p><p>While the causal relationship between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and OA is still under debate, epidemiological and prospective clinical studies have clearly showed that osteoarthritis is strongly associated with metabolic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, which are the individual components of MetS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Francisco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Misra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mohajer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020b</xref>). In particular, 59% of participants with osteoarthritis had MetS compared with 23% of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Puenpatom and Victor, 2009</xref>). The middle-aged population with osteoarthritis has more than five times the risk of MetS compared with the age-matched population without osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Puenpatom and Victor, 2009</xref>). Participants with osteoarthritis have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, independent of weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saleh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cerhan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Philbin et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, up to 81% of the elderly population have radiographic signs of hand osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banks and Lindau, 2013</xref>), non-weight bearing joints closely associated with MetS. MetS-associated osteoarthritis (MetS-OA) is now considered a distinct osteoarthritis phenotype defined by the presence of MetS—both individual MetS components and MetS as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhuo et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is imperative to understand the pathogenic mechanisms for MetS-OA development and progression.</p><p>Rather than being a primarily cartilage-based disease, osteoarthritis involves changes in the subchondral bone microarchitecture that might precede articular cartilage damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Walsh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suri et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that pathological alterations in subchondral bone are not merely a secondary manifestation of osteoarthritis but are critical contributors to early osteoarthritis progression and its severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Su et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mazur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burr, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burr and Gallant, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Findlay and Atkins, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Muratovic et al., 2019</xref>). Subchondral bone includes trabecular bone and the subchondral bone plate, which is corticalized bone similar to that found in other locations. Human osteoarthritis studies using histological and imaging analyses showed that subchondral bone changes are generally characterized by increased bone sclerosis with thickening of the cortical plate, loss of subchondral trabecular rods with thickening of the remaining trabecular bone, alteration in subchondral bone three-dimensional morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Haj-Mirzaian et al., 2018</xref>), and formation of new bone at the joint margins (i.e. osteophytes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2013</xref>). These changes were detected in late-stage human osteoarthritis. Subchondral bone changes during early-stage osteoarthritis remain unclear because of the lack of histological assessment of subchondral bone in human osteoarthritis. Animal studies have found increased osteoclast number and activity, with a high bone turnover rate in early-stage PTOA mice, rats, and rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kwan Tat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). As osteoarthritis progressed in PTOA mice, increased formation of osteroid islets and trabecular irregularity were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kwan Tat et al., 2010</xref>). Studies of the subchondral bone changes in MetS-OA are limited, especially during the early stage of this distinct osteoarthritis phenotype.</p><p>Cellular senescence has been viewed as a series of diverse and dynamic cellular states with irreversible cell-cycle arrest and the senescence‐associated secretory phenotype (SASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>). Senescent cells (SnCs) exhibit stable cell-cycle arrest through the actions of tumor suppressors, such as <italic>Cdkn2a</italic>, <italic>Cdkn2b</italic>, <italic>Trp53</italic>, <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campisi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McHugh and Gil, 2018</xref>). SnCs communicate with neighboring cells and influence the tissue microenvironment through SASP. Recently, it was found that SnCs increased in joint cartilage and synovium in mice after PTOA, and the selective elimination of SnCs led to attenuated osteoarthritis progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>). It remains unclear whether and how cellular senescence is involved in the pathogenesis of MetS-OA.</p><p>In the present study, we conducted analysis of the human osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) dataset to investigate the MRI subchondral bone features of MetS-human OA participants. We also characterized the joint phenotype of two MetS mouse models: high-fat diet (HFD)-challenged mice and STR/Ort mice. C57BL/6 mice fed a HFD are known to present key components of MetS relative to the mice fed a chow-food diet (CHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gallou-Kabani et al., 2007</xref>) and to develop articular cartilage degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sansone et al., 2019</xref>). The STR/Ort mouse strain, an inbred substrain of STR/N mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Staines et al., 2017</xref>), is a well-recognized model of spontaneous OA characterized by subchondral bone sclerosis, osteophyte formation, and articular cartilage degeneration. STR/Ort mice also develop hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Staines et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mason et al., 2001</xref>), and therefore are a promising model for studying the pathogenic mechanisms of MetS-OA. We uncovered a unique, early, structural joint alteration of MetS-OA (i.e. subchondral bone thickening), which distinguishes MetS-OA from the joint changes of PTOA. We further elucidated a SASP-stimulated cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (COX2-PGE2) pathway that mediates the paracrine effect of senescent preosteoclasts on osteoblast lineage to promote subchondral bone formation. Finally, we examined the potential disease-modifying properties of selective COX2 inhibitors for MetS-OA in mice and humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mice and treatment</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by and conducted in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines of The Johns Hopkins University.

Possible confounders were investigated using a directed acyclic graph to assess causal inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schisterman et al., 2009</xref>). The selected covariates for PS matching were age (years), sex (male/female), body mass index (categorized in pentiles for ease of matching of kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and race (Caucasian or non-Caucasian).

Participants with MetS-OA, had similar risk of radiographic osteoarthritis incidence (radiographic hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.56–1.41, and symptomatic HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.54–1.67) and progression (assessed by OARSI JSN, HR, 1.04; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.73–1.49) compared to matched PTOA participants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, despite the similar risk of knee OA incidence and radiographic progression, participants with MetS-OA had increased odds of 24 month worsening in subchondral bone marrow lesions (BML) damage compared to participants with PTOA. This finding was evident as the higher odds of increased knee joint subregions with subchondral BMLs (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06–1.77). Despite MetS-OA participants display a similar risk of knee OA incidence and progression compared to PTOA participants, they have more subchondral bone damage worsening compared to the matched PTOA participants. Therefore, MetS-OA participants have unique subchondral bone damage worsening, distinguishable from that of PTOA.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Longitudinal comparison of the standard knee OA outcomes and subchondral BML worsening between human participants with MetS-OA and their matched PTOA participants (MetS<sup>+</sup> PTOA<sup>–</sup> versus PTOA<sup>+</sup> MetS<sup>–</sup>).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">PS-matched MetS-OA versus PTOA participants</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Knee OA standard outcomes</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Hazard ratio (95% Confidence Interval), p-value, Sample size, Number of events<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2"><sup>*</sup></xref> [MetS-OA: PTOA]</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Knee OA incidence</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.89 (0.56–1.41), p:0.609, N:184 (92:92), Event [34:36]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Knee OA progression</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">1.04 (0.73–1.49), p:0.822, N:316 (158:158), Event [65:62]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Symptomatic incidence (NASS)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.95 (0.54–1.67), p:0.859, N:338 (169:169), Event [28:30]</td></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Subchondral BML Worsening (MOAKS)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Odds ratio (95% Confidence Interval), P-value, N:338 (169:169), Number of events<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table1fn2"><sup>*</sup></xref> [MetS-OA: PTOA]</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Worsening in number of affected subregions with BML</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>1.37 (1.06–1.77), p:0.015</bold><break/>Improvement, [16:31]<break/>No change, [92:84]<break/>Worsening, [61:54]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Worsening in the number of affected subregions</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom"><bold>0.44 (0.22–0.87), p:0.018</bold><break/>Yes, [31:16]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Maximum worsening in BML score</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.17 (0.85–1.6), p:0.337<break/>No change, [83:91]<break/>Worsening by ≤1 grade, [59:54] by ≥2 grades, [27:24]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Improvement in the subregions' BML score</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">0.82 (0.51–1.30), p:0.389<break/>Yes, [90:98]</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Standard OA outcomes (baseline to 8<sup>th</sup> year) and validated MOAKS measures of subchondral BML worsening (between baseline and 24 month visit) were assessed between knees of participants with MetS-OA and their PS-matched knees of participants with PTOA.

Mice fed a HFD for 3 months had higher body weight, body fat mass, and serum glucose relative to CHD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). Serum lipid oxidation products assessed by malondialdehyde (MDA) level were also markedly higher in the HFD mice than in the CHD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, HFD mice developed key components of MetS. We investigated the changes in osteoarthritic joints of HFD mice. Three-month-old mice were placed on a CHD or HFD for various periods, and subchondral bone changes were assessed. Mice fed a HFD for 3 and 5 months had different degrees of cartilage degeneration, indicated by proteoglycan loss and OARSI scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Cartilage degeneration was not found in mice fed a HFD for 0.5 month or 1 month. Notably, three-dimensional micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis showed a high subchondral bone mass phenotype in HFD-challenged male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Tibial subchondral bone volume (BV)/tissue volume (TV) ratio, subchondral bone plate thickness (SBP.Th), and subchondral trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th) increased dramatically in mice fed a HFD (vs. CHD) for all time periods tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-F</xref>), indicating an early and severe thickening of the subchondral plate and trabecular bone. Subchondral trabecular number (Tb.N) was reduced in mice fed a HFD for 1, 3, or 5 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), likely because of the fusion of the trabeculae. HFD-challenged female mice had a same high subchondral bone mass phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), with increased BV/TV, SBP.Th, and Tb.Th but decreased Tb.N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B-E</xref>). Moreover, osteophyte formation, another characteristic of osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dieppe and Lohmander, 2005</xref>), was also identified in mice fed a HFD for 5 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, unlike PTOA mice that have apparent trabecular bone irregularity, as indicated by an increase in trabecular pattern factor (Tb.Pf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Su et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>), HFD mice had similar subchondral Tb.Pf relative to CHD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Although OCN<sup>+</sup> cell number per bone surface was unchanged in HFD mice relative to CHD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), OCN<sup>+</sup> cell number per bone marrow area markedly increased and formed clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>) in mice at 0.5 month and 1 month after a HFD challenge.

We then used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to evaluate whether the same secreted factors identified in the subchondral bone of HFD mice were also elevated in oxLDL-challenged preosteoclasts. oxLDL-treated cells had much higher expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-6, which are two common SASP factors. Moreover, seven factors identified in the subchondral bone of HFD mice, including osteopontin (OPN), Lipocalin-2, Cystatin C, IL-33, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cellular communication network factor 4 (CCN4), and platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), were also markedly increased in oxLDL-treated cells relative to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), indicating that these are important SASP factors involved in osteoarthritis pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Senescent preosteoclasts have diminished differentiation capacity and secrete SASP to inhibit differentiation of non-senescent osteoclast precursors</title><p>We tested whether the factors secreted by senescent preosteoclasts act on surrounding cells to regulate their activity in a paracrine manner.

We first examined the functional changes of osteoclast lineage cells by incubating bone marrow Mo/Mac, osteoclast precursor cells, with the SnC-CM. SnC-CM inhibited the osteoclastogenesis ability of the non-adherent bone marrow Mo/Mac compared with Con-CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating an inhibitory effect of preosteoclast SASP on osteoclastogenesis. We then test whether preosteoclasts lose their capacity to further differentiate into mature osteoclasts when become senescent. Cellular senescence of in vitro differentiated mononuclear preosteoclasts was induced by challenging the cells with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which has been widely used to achieve oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Toussaint et al., 2000</xref>).

Moreover, bulk RNA-seq analysis revealed 4,056 differentially expressed genes in the senescent vs. control preosteoclasts (p&lt;0.05). Comparison of our data with previously defined aging/senescence-induced genes (ASIGs) from publicly available mouse RNA-seq data sets (Aging Atlas database; KEGG pathway database; GO database; MSigD database) identified a total of 150 ASIGs in the senescent preosteoclasts (vs. control non-senescent preosteoclasts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Among these ASIGs, 31 genes were upregulated, and 119 genes were downregulated in the senescent preosteoclasts relative to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). In the main biological process and molecular function genes, alterations in those involved in ‘Aging’, ‘Damaged DNA binding’, ‘chromatin DNA binding’, and ‘NF-kappaB binding’ were notable for their known links to senescence and SASP triggering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tilstra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di Micco et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Of note, osteoclast differentiation- and bone resorption-associated genes are among the most significantly downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating a diminished osteoclast differentiation capacity of the preosteoclasts after becoming senescent. Therefore, the senescent preosteoclasts, on one hand, have declined differentiation capacity toward mature osteoclasts; on the other hand, secrete SASP factors that inhibit the differentiation of non-senescent osteoclast precursors to osteoclasts in a paracrine manner.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Preosteoclast secretome promotes osteoblast differentiation via COX2-PGE2 signaling</title><p>We then tested whether SnC-CM affects the activity of osteoblast lineage cells.

In animal studies, increasing evidence supports an important role of subchondral bone changes during PTOA progression. However, almost nothing is known about progressive changes in subchondral bone in nontraumatic osteoarthritis. Our findings show that humans and mice with MetS-OA have a subchondral bone phenotype distinct from that of PTOA and have a greater likelihood of developing osteoarthritis-related subchondral bone damage. Structurally, contrary to the increased osteoclast bone resorption in subchondral bone in early-stage PTOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sun et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>), there is rapid thickening of subchondral bone plate and trabecular bone in HFD-challenged mice and STR/Ort mice, both of which are MetS-OA mouse models. These subchondral alterations appear much earlier than the occurrence of cartilage degradation. Cellularly, unlike the accumulated SnCs in cartilage and synovium in PTOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jeon et al., 2018</xref>), increased SnCs are located almost exclusively in the subchondral bone in MetS-OA mice. We also found that many of the SnCs were RANK<sup>+</sup>TRAP<sup>+</sup> preosteoclasts in bone marrow. Mechanistically, the senescent preosteoclasts acquire a unique secretome, which acts on both osteoclast and osteoblast lineages in a paracrine manner, leading to inhibited osteoclast bone resorption and increased osteoblastic bone formation for rapid subchondral bone thickening at the onset of osteoarthritis.</p><p>Accumulated senescent chondrocytes in articular cartilage have been found in PTOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jeon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diekman, 2018</xref>). We observed significantly increased senescent preosteoclasts in subchondral bone but not in articular cartilage in HFD or STR/Ort mice. Therefore, the joint locations of the SnCs and the major SnC type are distinct in MetS-OA and PTOA. We also show that deletion of senescence gene <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> specifically in osteoclast lineage attenuated short term HFD challenge-induced pathological subchondral bone alterations. As a result, HFD-induced cartilage degeneration was also greatly alleviated. Therefore, preosteoclast senescence in subchondral bone is a key mediator for the progression of MetS-OA. Our data showing that accumulation of senescent preosteoclasts and subchondral bone architectural change occur rapidly (0.5 months) after HFD treatment but cartilage degeneration occurred much later (5 months) after HFD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) suggests that the eventual cartilage damage may be caused by progressive subchondral bone architectural changes rather than a direct effect from the SASP of preosteoclasts. The contribution of aberrant subchondral bone alteration to articular cartilage degeneration has been well-recognized. Accumulating evidence suggests that normal subchondral bone structure is essential for the homeostasis of articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goldring and Goldring, 2016</xref>), and the incremental increase of either subchondral bone/plate thickness or subchondral plate stiffness modulus subsequently increases stress and creates uneven stress distributions in the overlaying articular cartilage for its degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DeFrate et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lories and Luyten, 2011</xref>). Moreover, strategies reducing/normalizing subchondral bone alterations during the early stage of PTOA effectively prevented cartilage degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Su et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhen et al., 2013</xref>). It is of interest to define whether increases in subchondral bone volume and subchondral plate/trabecular thickness result in incremental increase in mechanical stress on cartilage for its degeneration in MetS-OA.</p><p>Our in vivo results from HFD-challenged mice and in vitro evidence from cultured preosteoclasts showed that senescent preosteoclasts secrete previously identified common SASP factors, such as IL-1β, IL-6, VEGF, and OPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coppé et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tchkonia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gómez-Santos et al., 2020</xref>), as well as several factors that were not previously recognized in SnCs, including Lipocalin-2, Resistin, Cystatin C, IL-33, CCN4, MPO, and PDGF-BB. Importantly, the abnormally high production of these factors in the subchondral bone of HFD-challenged mice is fully or partially rectified by deletion of <italic>Cdkn2a</italic> from preosteoclasts. It is well-accepted that the SASP is largely distinct in composition, highly cell type–specific, and also dynamic depending on the senescence inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basisty et al., 2020</xref>). The SASP secretome promotes, via autocrine/paracrine pathways, the reprogramming of neighboring cells and modifies the microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mosteiro et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we show that the secretome of preosteoclasts negatively regulates the differentiation of osteoclasts but promotes osteoblast differentiation in the metabolic dysregulation–associated microenvironment of subchondral bone/bone marrow. These effects of the SASP factors appear opposite of what have been found in bone in the context of aging. Particularly, it has been reported that the SASP in bone microenvironment impair osteoblastic bone formation and enhance osteoclastic bone resorption during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farr et al., 2016</xref>). The contradicting results is likely attributed to the different composition and activity of subchondral preosteoclast SASP in the setting of MetS-OA than in the setting of aging. Of note, among the preosteoclast-derived factors that we identified, there are both osteoclast differentiation stimulators, such as IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruscitti et al., 2015</xref>) and IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rose-John, 2018</xref>), and inhibitors, such as MPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>), IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amarasekara et al., 2018</xref>), and CCN4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2018</xref>). The net result of these 2 opposite effects is likely an inhibition of osteoclastic bone resorption given our in vivo observation of the reduction in osteoclast numbers in subchondral bone of HFD mice and in vitro finding of the partial inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by the SnC-CM. Therefore, the SASP factors from senescent preosteoclasts have a unique paracrine effect on the nearby non-senescent osteoclast precursors to inhibit their osteoclastogenic ability. Moreover, our RNA-seq data also showed many downregulated osteoclast differentiation genes in the senescent preosteoclasts relative to non-senescent cells, suggesting that the senescent preosteoclasts have decreased ability to further differentiate into mature osteoclasts. An unexpected effect of the preosteoclast secretome is to stimulate osteoblast differentiation of the BMSCs. Of note, the CFU-F and gene expression of RUNX2, a transcription factor controlling the early commitment of BMSCs to osteoblast lineage, were unchanged in cells treated with SnC-CM relative to those treated with Con-CM. Thus, the SASP secretome specifically promotes osteoblast differentiation/maturation without affecting the colony forming capacity and lineage commitment of BMSCs. Importantly, our in vivo data demonstrate that unlike bone surface localization in normal physiological conditions, osteoblasts were aberrantly accumulated and formed clusters in the marrow cavity of HFD mice. This in vivo finding is consistent with the increased osteoblast differentiation of the BMSCs in response to SnC-CM. The formation of osteoblast clusters within the bone marrow may represent a unique subchondral bone feature of MetS-OA, contributing to the rapid development of subchondral plate thickening and sclerosis.</p><p>Our work shows that COX2-PGE2 activation is a key mediator of the SASP secretome–induced osteoblast differentiation and subchondral bone thickening that occurs in MetS. Of note, all of the identified SASP factors produced by senescent preosteoclasts, including IL-1β, IL-6, OPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jain et al., 2006</xref>), IL-33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2018</xref>), Lipocalin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hamzic et al., 2013</xref>), MPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Panagopoulos et al., 2017</xref>), VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chien et al., 2009</xref>), Resistin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Su et al., 2017</xref>), and PDGF-BB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Englesbe et al., 2004</xref>), were identified previously as positive COX2-PGE2 stimulators. Indeed, both COX2 gene expression in BMSCs and PGE2 level in the culture medium were upregulated when the cells were incubated with SnC-CM relative to Con-CM. Addition of selective COX2 inhibitor celecoxib in the BMSC culture medium significantly downregulated the osteoblast differentiation marker genes stimulated by SnC-CM, confirming the requirement of COX2-PGE2 activation for SASP-induced osteoblast differentiation of the BMSCs. Further, our in vivo data also show that the majority of COX2<sup>+</sup> cells were subchondral osteoblasts and osteocytes during the progression of MetS-OA, and selective COX2 celecoxib treatment markedly alleviated pathological subchondral bone thickening and osteoarthritis progression. Thus, COX2-PGE2 is a critical mediator of subchondral bone alteration and disease progression of MetS-OA. Clinically, COX2 inhibitors have been used widely to relieve arthritis-associated pain at lower doses and to inhibit inflammation at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Geba et al., 2002</xref>). However, there are contradictory reports regarding their direct disease-modifying function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zweers et al., 2011</xref>). It is unclear from multiple clinical trials and preclinical studies during the past two decades whether selective COX2 inhibitors protect cartilage and slow osteoarthritis progression. One of the main reasons for the inconclusive results of these studies could be the heterogeneous causes of osteoarthritis. Our findings from the human OAI dataset analysis confirmed the central role of subchondral bone damage in MetS-OA worsening. We showed that participants with MetS-OA with similar longitudinal worsening to their matched PTOA participants had increased subchondral bone damage. Intriguingly, among selective COX2-inhibitor users, only those with MetS-OA have alleviated joint structural alterations, and use of COX2-inhibitor is associated with reduced the odds subchondral bone damage. More importantly, this effect is seen compared with participants who use other analgesics, even after matching for pain status (which can be a source for confounding by indication bias, as the most widely indication of both non-selective NSAID and selective COX2 inhibitor prescription). These findings suggest that selective COX2 inhibitors but not the non-selective NSAIDs may have disease-modifying properties for MetS-OA.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>received consultancy fees from Pfizer, Novartis, MerckSerono, TissueGene, AstraZeneca, and Regeneron.

We have addressed all of the questions and concerns brought forth through additional experimentation and clarification. Specifically, in the mouse study, the reviewers (Reviewer A and B) mainly concerned about the changes (i.e. cellular senescence) of articular cartilage during metabolic syndrome associated osteoarthritis (MetS-OA) and how the subchondral preosteoclast senescence and bone alterations lead to cartilage degeneration. We have conducted more immunostaining analyses to demonstrate the change in senescent cells in both subchondral bone and articular cartilage during the progression of MetS-OA. More importantly, we have demonstrated that senescent preosteoclasts contribute to the progression of cartilage degeneration using a new genetic mouse model to delete the key senescence gene specifically in osteoclast lineage. In the human study, the major concern raised by the reviewers (Reviewer B and C) is that the results of the human participants with MetS-OA are insufficient to prove the role of subchondral bone alterations in OA progression as shown in the MetS-OA mouse models. To further similarize our human OA participants with corresponding mouse models of OA, using propensity score matching, we have further compared subchondral bone marrow lesions worsening between MetS-OA participants (without PTOA) to PTOA participants (without MetS-OA) akin to the mice models to better delineate the unique role of subchondral bone damage in MetS-OA.</p><p>To aid in readability, we have made the modified text in blue font to distinguish from the black original text. The following responses have been prepared to address all of the reviewers’ comments in a point-by-point fashion.</p><p>Response to comments from Reviewer A:</p><p>In this study, Su et al. examine the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome-associated OA (MetS-OA) using a combination of human and mouse/in vitro data. Their findings implicate senescent pre-osteoclastic cells and their SASP in inhibiting osteoclasts and stimulating osteoblasts in the subchondral bone, leading to changes of OA.</p><p>Overall, the studies are done well and the results support the conclusions. To the authors’ credit, they use multiple approaches to establish the presence of senescent pre-osteoclasts (increased p16 expression, SA-βGal staining, redistribution of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, loss of lamin B1). I have the following points for the authors to address:</p><p>1. The authors focus exclusively on subchondral bone changes in their mouse models. It would be important to define what is happening in the cartilage during the time that the bone changes are occurring in their models. Are cartilage cells becoming senescent? Is there evidence for damage to the articular cartilage from the SASP? Although OA is associated with sub-chondral bone changes, the ultimate problem is the deterioration of the articular cartilage, and that seems to be ignored here.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize the importance of this question and have conducted a panel of new experiments to define the cartilage changes when the alterations of subchondral bone occurred in our model system. We have first evaluated the senescent cells on the joint cartilage tissue in our HFD-induced osteoarthritis (OA) mouse model. Fluorescence imaging of the knee joint tissue sections from <italic>p16<sup>tdTom</sup></italic> reporter mice shows that tdTom+ cells were exclusively localized at subchondral bone/bone marrow at earlier time points (1 and 3 months) after the mice were fed HFD (Figure 3, A and C). tdTom+ SnCs were not seen in articular cartilage until later (5 months) after HFD challenge (Figure 3, A and B), when significant cartilage degeneration occurs as indicated by a markedly increased OARSI score (Figure 1, A and B). Consistently, increased SA-βGal<sup>+</sup> cell number were detected at the subchondral bone/bone marrow (Figure 3, D and F) but not in articular cartilage (Figure 3, D and E) in mice fed a HFD for 1 month or 3 months. Our results suggest that senescent cells primarily accumulate in subchondral bone at the pre- or early-OA stage and appear in cartilage only at more advanced stages.</p><p>We then examined whether cellular senescence in subchondral bone may be a major pathogenic culprit of the eventual cartilage degeneration induced by metabolic syndrome by characterizing joint phenotype of a conditional <italic>RANK-Cre; p16 <sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> (p16<sup>cKO</sup>) mouse line, in which senescence gene <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> is deleted in RANK<sup>+</sup> cells. <italic>RANK-Cre</italic> (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Kobayashi at Matsumoto Dental University, Japan) targets osteoclast lineage cells (<italic>Nat Med.</italic> 2012; 18: 405–412; <italic>Nat Med.</italic> 2016; 22: 1203–1205). Consistent with Figure 3, D-F, SA-βGal+ cells accumulated only in subchondral bone marrow in WT mice with 1-month HFD treatment, and this increase in subchondral SA-βGal+ cells was greatly dampened in the p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice relative to WT mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 7). Therefore, deletion of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> in RANK<sup>+</sup> cells efficiently prevents/blocks subchondral cellular senescence. Importantly, deletion of senescent preosteoclasts in subchondral bone indeed prevents the increase of subchondral thickness (Figure 5, A-H) and greatly attenuated cartilage degeneration (Figure 5, I-L) induced by HFD treatment. Collectively, the results from the new panel of experiments suggest that preosteoclast senescence in subchondral bone is a key initiating factor for the pathological subchondral bone architectural alterations, which may eventually lead to cartilage degeneration.</p><p>Whether bone preosteoclast SASP directly causes pathological chondrocyte changes for articular cartilage degeneration is an interesting, unresolved question. Our data showing that accumulation of senescent preosteoclasts and subchondral bone architectural change occur rapidly (0.5 months) after HFD treatment but cartilage degeneration occurred much later (5 months) after HFD treatment (Figure 1 and 3) suggests that the eventual cartilage damage may be caused by progressive subchondral bone architectural changes rather than a direct effect from the SASP of preosteoclasts. The contribution of aberrant subchondral bone alteration to articular cartilage degeneration has been well-recognized in the OA field. Accumulating evidence suggest that normal subchondral bone structure is essential for the homeostasis of articular cartilage (<italic>Nat Commun.</italic> 2021. 12: 1706; <italic>Nat Rev Rheumatol</italic>. 2016. 12: 632-644), and the incremental increase of either subchondral bone/plate thickness or subchondral plate stiffness modulus subsequently increases stress and creates uneven stress distributions in the overlaying articular cartilage for its degradation (<italic>Osteoarthritis Cartilage</italic> 2019. 27: 392-400; <italic>Nat Commun</italic>. 2021. 12: 1706). Moreover, strategies reducing/normalizing subchondral bone alterations during the early stage of post-traumatic OA (PTOA) effectively prevented cartilage degeneration (<italic>JCI Insight.</italic> 2020. 5:e135446; <italic>Nat Med</italic> 2013;19:704-712). It is of interest in the future to define whether increases in subchondral bone volume and subchondral plate/trabecular thickness result in incremental increase in mechanical stress on cartilage for its degeneration in MetS-OA. The discussion on this point has also been added in the revised manuscript (Line 425-442).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Their demonstration that the SASP of senescent pre-osteoclastic cells inhibits osteoclasts and promotes osteoblasts is the opposite of what other studies have found, specifically in the context of aging, where the SASP from senescent cells stimulates osteoclasts and inhibits bone formation. The most obvious explanation is that the SASP in the setting of MetS-OA is different than that in the setting of aging. But this point should be explicitly addressed in the Discussion, as otherwise this discrepancy may lead to confusion in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable comment and agree with the reviewer that it is important to clarify the discrepancy of our results and previous findings regarding the SASP effects on osteoclast and osteoblast lineage cells. Our results show that the senescent preosteoclast secretome negatively regulates the differentiation of osteoclasts but promotes osteoblast differentiation in the metabolic dysregulation–associated microenvironment of subchondral bone/bone marrow. These effects of the SASP factors appear opposite of what have been found in bone in the context of aging. Particularly, it has been reported that the SASP in bone microenvironment impair osteoblastic bone formation and enhance osteoclastic bone resorption during aging (<italic>Nat Med</italic> 23, 1072-1079; <italic>J Bone Miner Res</italic> 31, 1920-1929). We fully agree with the reviewer that the contradicting results is likely attributed to the different composition and activity of subchondral preosteoclast SASP in the setting of MetS-OA than in the setting of aging. Indeed, we have identified several new SASP factors, including Lipocalin-2, Resistin, Cystatin C, IL-33, CCN4, MPO, and PDGF-BB (Figure 6), that were not previously recognized in SnCs in bone in the setting of aging. Some of these factors, such as IL-33 and CCN4, have potent inhibitory effect on osteoclast differentiation (<italic>J Immunol</italic> 2011;186:6097-6105; <italic>J Biol Chem</italic> 2015;290:14004-14018). All of them are positive activators of COX2-PGE2 signaling, which acts on osteoblastic precursors to stimulate osteoblast differentiation (<italic>J Cell Biochem</italic> 2006;99:824-834; <italic>Biochem Biophys Res Commun</italic> 2007;360:199-204; Immune Netw 2018;18:e8; <italic>Int J Oncol.</italic> 2017;50(4): 1191-1200; <italic>J Clin Invest</italic> 2019;129:2578-2594; <italic>J Neuroendocrinol.</italic> 2013;25: 271-280; <italic>J Bone Miner Res</italic> 2011;26:193-208). Importantly, the results from our in vitro cell culture (Figure 7 and Figure 6—figure supplement 8) and in vivo mouse studies (Figure 5) consistently demonstrate that the SASP of senescent preosteoclasts inhibits osteoclast differentiation and promotes osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in subchondral bone in MetS-OA. Moreover, the new RNA-seq data revealed many downregulated osteoclast differentiation genes in the senescent preosteoclasts relative to non-senescent cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 10 and 11), suggesting that the senescent preosteoclasts also have decreased ability to further differentiate into mature osteoclasts. The discussion on this point has been added in the revised manuscript (Line 449-481).</p><p>Aging in mice contributes to the development of spontaneous OA, similar to what occurs in humans. For example, C57BL/6 mice usually develop knee OA in the absence of surgical knee operation at about 17 months of age. Significant ongoing effort in the lab is to determine the subchondral bone phenotypic changes in the setting of aging. We found that unlike increased subchondral bone volume and subchondral plate thickness in MetS-associated OA, there is a decrease in subchondral bone volume and trabecular thickness in aged mice relative to young mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), indicating increased subchondral osteoclast bone resorption and/or reduced osteoblast bone formation in age-associated OA joints. We will further characterize the senescent cells and the SASP in subchondral bone/bone marrow in the setting of aging. These experiments will be of great interest in understanding the distinct role of SASP in subchondral bone changes in different OA subtypes and will be an important area of future focus in the laboratory.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Subchondral bone changes in aged mice relative to young mice.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79773-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In each of the studies, the sex of the mice should be indicated.

Now, however, we have included additional data in the subchondral bone assessments using female HFD mice. As noted in the updated figures, female mice fed HFD for 3 months had the same subchondral bone phenotype (i.e. dramatically increased subchondral bone volume, subchondral plate thickness, and trabecular thickness) (Figure 1—figure supplement 3) as did in the male mice fed HFD relative to the chow diet mice (Figure 1). The results suggest that HFD challenge induces similar alterations in subchondral bone in male and female mice. As for the STR/Ort mice, it has been recognized that male mice have a higher incidence of OA than female mice (<italic>Osteoarthritis Cartilage</italic> 2017. 25: 802-808). We therefore used male STR/Ort and CBA control mice in this study. We look forward to future studies examining in more detail on the comparison of the female and male mice regarding the role of cellular senescence in the development of MetS-OA. Indeed, we are currently testing whether subchondral preosteoclasts become senescent and have the same SASP in female MetS mice as those from the male MetS mice.</p><p>In the human participants assessments, both female and male human subjects were included, and the sex of the participants is propensity-score matched between comparison groups and are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 (information on sex of the participants is in blue font in these 2 tables in the manuscript).

By using two different mouse models of metabolic syndrome/OA (high fat diet and STR/Ort mice), they found that a rapid increase in joint subchondral bone plate and trabecular thickness occurs before cartilage degeneration. This increase in bone mass is attributed to increased osteoblast number in the subchondral bone. They show that the increase in osteoblasts is due to senescent pre-osteoclasts that secrete senescence- associate secretory phenotype (SASP) factors which activate Cyclooxygenase 2 transcription and prostaglandin 2 (PGE2) production in osteoblasts. PGE2 stimulates the differentiation of osteoblasts progenitors and bone formation in the subchondral bone. Celecoxib, a COX 2 inhibitor, attenuates subchondral bone formation and progression of OA associated with metabolic syndrome in both mice models.</p><p>The studies in humans indicate that patients with metabolic syndrome have increased progression of OA during longitudinal follow up, compared to matched patients without metabolic syndrome; more importantly, the use of COX2 inhibitors reduced OA progression in patients with metabolic syndrome but not in matched patient without metabolic syndrome. MRI imaging, shown in just 1 patient/group, shows the presence of significant increase in size of the subchondral bone marrow lesions in the knee of a non–selective NSAIDS user with metabolic syndrome compared to unchanged subchondral bone marrow lesions in the knee of a selective COX2 inhibitor user with metabolic syndrome.</p><p>The authors conclude that senescent pre-osteoclasts, by affecting COX2/PGE2 axis in osteoblasts, play a central pathogenic role in metabolic syndrome- induced OA.</p><p>This paper is very well written and clear. The topic studied is very clinically relevant and has an immediate translational application. The strengths of the paper are the use of two different mouse models and the longitudinal analysis of the human osteoarthritis initiative cohort dataset.</p><p>There are, however, issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>– Mouse models:</p><p>– The role of subchondral bone changes is osteoarthritis progression is not new. Others have shown that in OA subchondral bone thickness is increased while trabecular bone thickness is reduced. Overall, previous models have shown increased subchondral bone remodeling with increase in osteoclasts. The changes in subchondral bone are associated with reduced osteochondral integrity and disruption of the barrier between the intra-articular and sub compartmental joint which causes vascular and nerve invasion and endochondral ossification.</p><p>In this paper, however, the author report the new finding that trabecular bone is increased in the subchondral space and the osteoclast number is decreased in both mouse models of OA- associated metabolic syndrome.</p><p>It remains unclear how those changes, not previously reported in subchondral bone, are pathogenic in the progression of OA and not just an associated phenomenon. To prove that senescent osteoclasts are the pathogenic culprit of the progression of metabolic syndrome-induced OA, the authors should measure with microCT, the subchondral bone changes and the OA progression (OARSI score) in mice with deletion of senescent osteoclast progenitors fed a high fat diet for 1 month (the mice shown in Figure 4 A), compared to the appropriate controls. If deletion of senescent pre osteoclasts in subchondral bone prevents the increase of subchondral bone thickness in mice fed a high fat diet and the increase of the HFD-induced increase in the OARSI score, this would be a compelling evidence that they could be the culprit of those changes. It would be crucial to use a short term high fat diet as the authors show in Figure 3b that the senescent cells are only present in subchondral bone and not in the articular space with this HFD duration.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable comments and constructive suggestion. As mentioned by the reviewer, MetS-associated OA mice used in this study (high fat diet and STR/Ort mice) have distinct subchondral bone phenotype from post-traumatic OA (PTOA) mice, which have been much more intensively investigated in the field. Unlike increased subchondral bone remodeling (increased osteoclast activity) at early-stage OA in the PTOA mice (ACLT and DMM mice), there is a rapid and persistent increase in joint subchondral plate and trabecular thickness during the progression of the MetS-OA mice.</p><p>As suggested, we have examined whether senescent osteoclasts are the pathogenic culprit of the progression of MetS-OA by conducting additional in vivo experiment using our established conditional <italic>RANK-Cre; p16 <sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (named “p16<sup>cKO</sup>” thereafter). In this mouse line, a key senescence gene <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> is deleted in RANK<sup>+</sup> cells. <italic>RANK-Cre</italic> (kindly provided by Dr. Yasuhiro Kobayashi at Matsumoto Dental University, Japan) targets osteoclast lineage cells (<italic>Nat Med.</italic> 2012; 18: 405–412; <italic>Nat Med.</italic> 2016; 22: 1203–1205). In the past several months, we have conducted a systemic characterization on the changes in knee joint subchondral bone and cartilage in the p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice and the <italic>p16<sup>flox/loxf</sup></italic> littermate control mice (named “WT” thereafter), especially under HFD challenge for 1 month. Consistent with Figure 3, D-F, SA-βGal+ cells accumulated only in subchondral bone marrow in WT mice with 1-month HFD treatment, and this increase in subchondral SA-βGal+ cells was greatly dampened in the p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice relative to WT mice (Figure 5—figure supplement 7). The results suggest that deletion of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> in RANK<sup>+</sup> cells efficiently prevents/blocks subchondral cellular senescence. Importantly, microCT analyses showed that tibial subchondral BV/TV ratio, SBP.Th, and Tb.Th were all higher in WT mice fed a HFD (vs. CHD) (Figure 5, A-D); however, these subchondral bone alterations induced by 1-month HFD treatment were not significant in p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice. Moreover, the reduction in the number of bone surface osteoclasts (Figure 5, E and F) and the increase in the osteoblast clusters in bone marrow (Figure 5, G and H) induced by HFD were both alleviated in p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice. Therefore, deletion of senescent preosteoclasts in subchondral bone indeed prevents the increase of subchondral thickness induced by a short-term (1 month) HFD treatment.</p><p>We also assessed whether deletion of <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> in preosteoclasts could ultimately lead to attenuated cartilage degeneration induced by HFD using the p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice. To reach the purpose, the mice have to be fed HFD for a much longer period of time than 1 month to see cartilage degeneration in our mouse model because we found that the MetS-OA mice started to show subchondral thickening phenotype as early as 2 weeks after HFD treatment, but cartilage degeneration did not occur until 3-5 months after HFD treatment (Figure 1). Because of this reason, we fed the p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice and WT littermate mice with HFD for 5 months. Our data show that HFD-challenged WT mice exhibited obvious proteoglycan loss in the joint cartilage and an increased OARSI score, which were not observed in p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice (Figure 5, I and J). Consistently, HFD-induced increase in the percentage of MMP13<sup>+</sup> chondrocytes, another feature of articular cartilage degeneration, was dramatically reduced in p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice relative to WT mice (Figure 5, K and L). Therefore, blockage of preosteoclast senescence led to a greatly attenuated cartilage degeneration induced by HFD. Of note, <italic>p16<sup>INK4a</sup></italic> is specifically deleted in osteoclast lineage in bone in the conditional p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice, and chondrocytes in cartilage were not targeted. Moreover, we did not detect any senescent cells in cartilage in our MetS-OA mouse model until 5 months HFD treatment (Figure 3). Thus, the attenuated cartilage degeneration in the p16<sup>cKO</sup> mice should be primarily through blockage of subchondral preosteoclast senescence. Collectively, the results from the new panel of experiments suggest that preosteoclast senescence drives pathological increase in subchondral bone volume and subchondral plate thickness, eventually leading to cartilage degeneration.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the mechanisms of how increases in subchondral bone volume and subchondral plate/trabecular thickness lead to cartilage degeneration were not explored in this study. In fact, the mechanisms by which subchondral bone alteration contribute to OA development/progression is a long-standing question in the OA field in general. There is significant evidence in the literature, however, to suggest that normal subchondral bone structure is essential for the homeostasis of articular cartilage (<italic>Nat. Rev. Rheumatol.</italic> 2011;7:43–49; <italic>Trends Pharmacol. Sci.</italic> 2014;35:227–236) and that the incremental increase of either subchondral bone/plate thickness or subchondral plate stiffness modulus subsequently increases stress and creates uneven stress distributions in the overlaying articular cartilage for its degradation (<italic>Osteoarthritis Cartilage</italic> 2019. 27: 392-400; <italic>Nat Commun</italic>. 2021. 12: 1706). Moreover, strategies reducing/ normalizing subchondral bone alterations during the early stage of OA effectively prevented cartilage degeneration (<italic>JCI Insight.</italic> 2020. 5:e135446; <italic>Nat Med</italic> 2013;19:704-712). Significant ongoing effort in the lab is focused on the functional relationship between subchondral bone and articular cartilage in the MetS-OA models. The discussion on this point has also been added in the revised manuscript (Line 425-442).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Also the protective effect of Celecoxib in the experiment in Figure 6 does not clearly prove an effect of Cox2 derived from osteoblasts as the beneficial effect of this drug on OA could be mediated by other cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an intriguing question. We wished to provide evidence to prove that the beneficial effect of Celecoxib is due to osteoblast/osteocyte-specific COX2 inhibition using conditional <italic>Osteocalcin-Cre; COX2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> or <italic>Dmp1-Cre; COX2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mouse lines. However, <italic>COX2<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice were not obtained until this month. We are now breeding this mouse strain with <italic>Osteocalcin-Cre</italic> to generate mice with conditional COX2 deletion in osteoblasts. We look forward to the exciting results from the mice, but it typically takes over a year to generate/validate the mouse line, apply HFD treatment, and conduct analyses of the joint phenotype. Instead, in this present study, we have carefully re-calculated the number of COX2<sup>+</sup> cells at both articular cartilage and subchondral bone regions in mice at different time points after HFD treatment. Our results showed that there were very few COX2+ cells at cartilage in mice fed HFD for shorter periods (0.5, 1, 3, and 4 months) relative to mice fed CHD, whereas there was a much higher number of COX2<sup>+</sup> cell number on bone surface (osteoblasts) and in mineralized bone (osteocytes) at these time points (Figure 8, A, C, and D). A higher number of COX2+ chondrocytes in cartilage was found in mice only after 5 months of HFD treatment (Figure 8, A and B), during which severe cartilage degeneration occurs. Therefore, the majority of COX2<sup>+</sup> cells were primarily subchondral osteoblasts and osteocytes during the progression of MetS-OA, and the major cellular target of celecoxib treatment should be subchondral bone osteoblast lineage cells but not cartilage cells. Discussion on this point has also been added in our revised manuscript (Line 491-494).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Histology:</p><p>– Figure 2: The authors indicate that the increase in subchondral bone is due exclusively secondary to increased osteoblasts, however the osteoclasts are also reduced on the bone surface. This reduction could be also causing increased bone mass in the subchondral bone. This aspect should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we fully agree with this reviewer that both increased osteoblastic bone formation and decreased osteoclastic bone resorption contribute to the increases in subchondral plate thickening and trabecular bone volume. We have included three new figures (Figure 6—figure supplement 8-10) to demonstrate the effects of preosteoclast senescence and the corresponding SASP on osteoclast differentiation. Our new results suggest that the senescent preosteoclasts, on one hand, have declined differentiation capacity toward mature osteoclasts; on the other hand, secrete SASP factors to inhibit the differentiation of non-senescent osteoclast precursors to osteoclasts in a paracrine manner. The new results have been describe in the Result section (Line 278-307). Discussion on the involvement of reduced osteoclast bone resorption in this process has been added in the revised Discussion section (Line 465-470).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2: the number of osteoblasts /bone surface should also be calculated to prove that they are increased. Alternatively, measurements of dynamic indices of bone histomorphometry should be reported (i.e. quantification of bone formation after calcein injection).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have re-evaluated the number of osteoblasts in subchondral bone. We found that, unlike subchondral bone surface localization of the osteocalcin (OCN)<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts in chow diet control mice, OCN<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts accumulate and form clusters within marrow cavity in HFD challenged mice. Osteoblast number per bone marrow area (OCN<sup>+</sup> N/BM.Ar) significantly increased but OCN<sup>+</sup> osteoblasts per bone surface (OCN<sup>+</sup> N/BS) remained unchanged in subchondral bone of HFD-challenged mice relative to CHD control mice (Figure 2, A-C). The results suggest that osteoblasts are located on subchondral bone surface in normal healthy joints but aberrantly accumulate in bone marrow cavity in the joints of MetS-OA mice. The formation of aberrant osteoblast clusters within the bone marrow may represent a unique subchondral bone feature of MetS-OA, contributing to the rapid development of subchondral sclerosis and increased subchondral bone mass. The point has been included in the revised Discussion (Line 475-481).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Human longitudinal analysis:</p><p>– In supplementary table 1 it looks like that OA is less severe in patients with metabolic syndrome (based on KL grade) compared to matched patients without metabolic syndrome. This is the opposite of what it should be expected, as the premise of this research is that OA is more severe in patients with metabolic syndrome. The authors should discuss this contradictory finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this very constructive comment of the reviewer. We have responded to this comment in two different sections:</p><p>1) &quot;OA is less severe in participants with metabolic syndrome (based on KL grade) compared to matched participants without metabolic syndrome&quot;: We have re-assessed our propensity score (PS) matching method. A high body-mass index (BMI) is a well-known risk factor for OA (<italic>International Journal of Obesity</italic> 2001; 25: 622-627). On the other hand, while high BMI itself is not included in the definition of MetS (as defined by IDF [<italic>Diabetic Medicine</italic> 2006; 23: 469-480]), it is strongly correlated with abdominal (i.e., central) obesity, which is among MetS criteria. Furthermore, BMI is both associated with knee OA and MetS and can confound the relationship between MetS and OA. Thus, BMI has to be included in the PS-matching model. Since, by MetS definition, all participants with MetS had abdominal obesity (and therefore had high BMIs), PS-matched participants without MetS (MetS<sup>–</sup>) also had high BMIs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). To address this comment, we have speculated that, given the inclusion of BMI in the PS-matching, MetS<sup>–</sup> participants may have a relative high BMI after PS-matching and consequently have higher radiographic KL-grades compared to matched MetS<sup>+</sup> participants. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis with matching the participants once with BMI in the matching model and once without it. We observed that the exclusion of BMI from PS-matching resulted in MetS<sup>+</sup> participants with higher KL grades compared to PS-matched MetS<sup>–</sup> participants (Marked as blue in <xref

alterations in the MetS-OA: Following this comment, your other comment (#4), and also similar comments from other reviewers (e.g., Reviewer C, comment #1), to assess the role of subchondral bone structural changes and to better similarize the human participants and mice models of OA design, we tailored our selection criteria. We compared KOA progression in participants with MetS-OA without a history of knee trauma (to exclude PTOA cases) versus participants with PTOA without MetS (to exclude MetS-OA cases). These selection criteria helped us delineate the unique pathophysiology (e.g., prominent and rapid subchondral bone marrow changes) in the MetS-OA phenotype. As we have shown in the animal model, while both PTOA and MetS-OA have degrees of cartilage degradation, prominent and rapid subchondral bone change is a feature of MetS-OA. We gathered data of OAI participants with MRI reads for baseline and 24-month follow-up visits and carefully selected and matched participants. Following your constructive comments, we added KL and medial JSN grades to the PS-matching and adjusted the Cox models for these variables to address the inhomogeneity in the baseline knee OA status and grade. (Supplementary Flowchart 1 and Supplementary Table 1). We compared both standard knee OA outcomes (including JSN progression) and subchondral bone marrow lesion (BML) worsening between these two groups of MetS-OA<sup>+</sup>(PTOA<sup>–</sup>) versus PTOA<sup>+</sup>(MetS-OA<sup>–</sup>). For the assessment of BMLs, we used MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score (MOAKS) measures, which have been shown to have excellent reliability (<italic>Osteoarthritis and cartilage</italic> 2011; 19: 990-1002; <italic>Arthritis Rheumatol</italic> 2016; 68: 2422-31). MOAKS is a validated and the most commonly used semi-quantitative scoring tool to assess longitudinal change in subchondral BMLs within knee subregions in terms of time points (<italic>Osteoarthritis and cartilage</italic> 2011; 19: 990-1002; <italic>Arthritis Rheumatol</italic> 2016; 68: 2422-31). While we observed that the risk of knee OA radiographic progression in participants with MetS-OA is similar to participants with PTOA during the follow-up period, we found that participants with MetS-OA have more odds of subchondral bone marrow lesion (BML) worsening compared to participants with PTOA (even though they had similar risk of radiographic knee OA progression). This finding was evident because of the higher odds of worsening in the number of knee joint subregions with subchondral BMLs (Table 1). The changes have been reflected in the revised Methods section (Line 552-570 and Line 576-579), Results section (Line 92-119), Table 1, Discussion section (Line 409-411 and Line 501-506), Supplementary material section (Line 116-122, Line 138-164 and Line 181-184, Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Flowchart 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the longitudinal analysis of table 1 and 2 more details are needed. The detailed data for the matched patients should be reported in addition to the average length of follow up. In addition, the detailed analysis of the OA scores should be reported and not just the Hazard ratio of progression. Those data would give a better idea on the degree of progression in every group (i.e patient with metabolic syndrome vs matched patients without metabolic syndrome; patients with metabolic syndrome chronically using Cox2 inhibitors vs matched patients not using this drug).</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added details of the analysis, the follow-up duration, and the number of events to the manuscript text and tables (see changed Table 1 and 2 in the manuscript). In all BML assessments, we used 24-month worsening in BML MOAKS measures between baseline and 24-month follow-up MRI assessments. Therefore, the follow-up duration for BML assessments was 24 months. Regarding the comparison of knee OA standard outcomes between participants with MetS-OA and PTOA, we have added to the Results section (Line 107) and also footnote of Table 1. Regarding the comparisons of knee OA standard outcomes between COX2 inhibitor users and non-selective NSAID users, we have added to the Results section (Line 370-371) and also footnote of Table 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Based on the data presented in table 1 and 2 metabolic syndrome does not affect the incidence of OA, but worsens the progression of OA.

If possible the data on the subchondral bone in these patients should be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Following your precise and relevant comment, we assessed subchondral BML changes between COX2 inhibitor users and non-selective NSAID users using validated MOAKS measures (<italic>Osteoarthritis and cartilage</italic> 2011; 19: 990-1002; <italic>Arthritis Rheumatol</italic> 2016; 68: 2422-31).

The authors suggest that in MetS OA subchondral bone changes (as induced by senescent pre-osteoclasts and their specific secretory phenotype) precede cartilage damage and that selective inhibition of COX-2 may have beneficial effects in patients with MetS OA that got beyond the effects seen in non-MetS patients. Generally, this is a very well performed study that may contribute important novel aspects to the field. I have three major comments</p><p>– The human data as obtained from the OAI dataset are not completely convincing. This is because they largely focus in JSN as a readout for progression, which actually reflects cartilage loss rather than subchondral bone thickness. If the hypothesis of the authors holds true, differences in subchondral bone thickness should be visible particularly in early OA patients with MetS (vs non- MetS patients) and it should be possible to retrieve those data. The same is true for the COX-2 data. Also here, the authors may want to show differences in subchondral bone thickness between (part early) OA patients with/without MetS that had taken COX-2 inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive comment of the reviewer. Following this comment and similar comments of other reviewers (Reviewer B, comments #1 &amp; #4), we tailored our selection criteria to assess the role of subchondral bone structural changes and to better similarize the human participants and mice models of OA design, we tailored our selection criteria.

This is a useful though somewhat limited approach that isn't entirely up-to-date. A more holistic and unbiased approach (e.g. RNAseq) would have been far more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed bulk RNA-sequencing of control and senescent preosteoclasts. The RNA-seq analysis revealed 4,056 differentially expressed genes in the senescent vs. control preosteoclasts (p &lt; 0.05). Comparing our data with previously defined aging/senescence-induced genes (ASIGs) from publicly available mouse RNA-seq data sets (Aging Atlas database; KEGG pathway database; GO database; MSigD database) identified a total of 150 ASIGs in the senescent preosteoclasts (vs. control non-senescent preosteoclasts) (Supplemental Figure 10A). Among these ASIGs, 31 genes were upregulated, and 119 genes were downregulated in the senescent preosteoclasts relative to control cells (Supplemental Figure 10B). In the main biological process and molecular function genes, alterations in “Aging,” “Damaged DNA binding,” “chromatin DNA binding,” and “NF-kappaB binding” are notable for their known links to senescence and SASP triggering (Supplemental Figure 10C). Of note, osteoclast differentiation- and bone resorption-associated genes are among the most significantly downregulated genes (Supplemental Figure 11), indicating a diminished osteoclast differentiation capacity of the preosteoclasts after becoming senescent. These results further validate that preosteoclasts become senescent and exhibit SASP under pathological conditions. In addition, significantly downregulated osteoclast differentiation-associated genes in the senescent preosteoclasts, in combination with the results from the in vitro osteoclast differentiation assay (Supplemental Figure 8, A and B), suggest that the senescent preosteoclasts, on one hand, have declined differentiation capacity toward mature osteoclasts; on the other hand, secrete SASP factors to inhibit the differentiation of non-senescent osteoclast precursors to osteoclasts in a paracrine manner. An important future focus in the laboratory is on single-cell RNA-seq, which will give more insight into gene expression profile of individual cells and offer important understanding on the interplay between senescent cells and their neighboring cells in joint subchondral bone in the context of MetS-OA.</p></body></sub-article></article>
