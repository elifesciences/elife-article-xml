in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Mechanical stimulation can regulate skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and metabolism; however, the molecular mechanosensor remains unknown. Here, we show that SWELL1 (<italic>Lrrc8a</italic>) functionally encodes a swell-activated anion channel that regulates PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2, mTOR signaling, muscle differentiation, myoblast fusion, cellular oxygen consumption, and glycolysis in skeletal muscle cells. LRRC8A over-expression in <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO myotubes boosts PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling to supra-normal levels and fully rescues myotube formation. Skeletal muscle-targeted <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO mice have smaller myofibers, generate less force ex vivo, and exhibit reduced exercise endurance, associated with increased adiposity under basal conditions, and glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when raised on a high-fat diet, compared to wild-type (WT) mice. These results reveal that the LRRC8 complex regulates insulin-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle to influence skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro and skeletal myofiber size, muscle function, adiposity and systemic metabolism in vivo.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Skeletal muscles – the force-generating tissue attached to bones – must maintain their mass and health for the body to work properly. It is therefore necessary to understand how an organism can regulate the way skeletal muscles form, grow and heal.</p><p>A multitude of factors can control how muscles form, including mechanical signals. The molecules that can sense these mechanical stimuli, however, remain unknown. Mechanoresponsive ion channels provide possible candidates for these molecular sensors. These proteins are studded through the cell membranes, where they can respond to mechanical changes by opening and allowing the flow of ions in and out of a cell, or by changing interactions with other proteins.</p><p>The SWELL1 protein is a component of an ion channel known as VRAC, which potentially responds to mechanical stimuli. This channel is associated with many biological processes such as cells multiplying, migrating, growing and dying, but it is still unclear how.</p><p>Here, Kumar et al. first tested whether SWELL1 controls how skeletal muscle precursors mature into their differentiated and functional form. These experiments showed that SWELL1 regulates this differentiation process under the influence of the hormone insulin, as well as mechanical signals such as cell stretching. In addition, this work revealed that SWELL1 relies on an adaptor molecule called GRB2 to relay these signals in the cell.</p><p>Next, Kumar et al. genetically engineered mice lacking SWELL1 only in skeletal muscle. These animals had smaller muscle cells, as well as muscles that were weaker and less enduring. When raised on a high-calorie diet, the mutant mice also got more obese and developed resistance to insulin, which is an important step driving obesity-induced diabetes. Together, these findings show that SWELL1 helps to regulate the formation and function of muscle cells, and highlights how an ion channel participates in these processes.</p><p>Healthy muscles are key for overall wellbeing, as they also protect against obesity and obesity-related conditions such as type 2 diabetes or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This suggests that targeting SWELL1 could prove advantageous in a clinical setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>VRAC</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>knock-out mouse</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DK106009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sah</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL125436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grueter</surname><given-names>Chad E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1HL127764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abel</surname><given-names>E Dale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1HL112413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Abel</surname><given-names>E Dale</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P30AR074992-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sah</surname><given-names>Rajan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001024</institution-id><institution>Roy J.

Skeletal muscle atrophy, the loss of skeletal muscle mass, is associated with cancer (cachexia), heart failure, chronic corticosteroid use, paralysis or denervation (disuse atrophy), chronic positive pressure ventilation (diaphragm atrophy, inability to extubate), prolonged space flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fitts et al., 2001</xref>) or bed rest (unloading) and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schiaffino et al., 2013</xref>). Each of these clinical scenarios also contribute to poor metabolic health and increase frailty. Thus, a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle maintenance, growth and function has important implications for human health.</p><p>Skeletal muscle growth is regulated by a multitude of stimuli, including growth factor signaling, cytokines, mechanical load, integrin signaling and hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schiaffino et al., 2013</xref>). Activation of AKT-mTOR signaling downstream of insulin and IGF-1 is well established as a critical regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schiaffino et al., 2013</xref>). However, mechanical loading of muscle, as occurs with regular activity, exercise, and resistance training also induces mTOR-mediated skeletal muscle growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Sahra and Manning, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hornberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoon, 2017</xref>), possibly via a growth-factor independent mechanosensory mechanism. β1-integrin and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling has been proposed as this mechanosensory system - sensing mechanical load on skeletal muscle and regulating hypertrophic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carson and Wei, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schlaepfer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flück et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klossner et al., 2009</xref>). However, mechanosensitive ion channels, or ion channel complexes, may also regulate intracellular signaling, including PIEZO1, TRPV4 and the recently identified LRRC8 channel complex that functionally encodes the volume-regulated anion current (VRAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>Lrrc8a</italic> (leucine-rich repeat containing protein 8A, also known as SWELL1) encodes a ~ 95 kDa membrane protein with four transmembrane domains and an intracellular, C-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain (LRRD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osei-Owusu et al., 2018</xref>). It was first described, in 2003, as the site of a translocation mutation in a young woman with an immunodeficiency characterized by agammaglobulinemia and absent B-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubota et al., 2004</xref>). This phenotype led to studies linking LRRC8A to lymphocyte differentiation defects arising from impaired LRRC8A dependent GRB2-mediated PI3K-AKT signaling, in part based on data from a global <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> knock-out (KO) mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Although LRRC8A was speculated in 2012 to form a hetero-hexameric ion channel complex with other LRRC8 family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abascal and Zardoya, 2012</xref>), it was not until 2014 that LRRC8A was experimentally identified as an essential component of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>), forming hetero-hexamers with LRRC8B-E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Syeda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voss et al., 2014</xref>). So, for about a decade, LRRC8A was considered a membrane protein that regulates PI3K-AKT-mediated lymphocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sawada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubota et al., 2004</xref>), putatively via non-ion channel, protein-protein interaction mediated signaling, and only later discovered to also form the long-studied VRAC ion channel signaling complex. Indeed, since its first description &gt;30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cahalan and Lewis, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hazama and Okada, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pedersen et al., 2015</xref>), VRAC has been associated with a multitude of complex physiological and pathophysiological functions, including cell proliferation, cell migration, angiogenesis, cell death and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eggermont et al., 2001</xref>); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these diverse functions had remained elusive without knowledge of the molecular identity of this ion channel complex.</p><p>We recently identified LRRC8A as a swell or stretch-activated volume sensor in adipocytes that regulates glucose uptake, lipid content, and adipocyte growth via a LRRC8A-GRB2-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway – providing a putative feed-forward amplifier to enhance adipocyte growth and insulin signaling during caloric excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunasekar et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, others have shown that mechanical stimuli applied by pulling on β1-integrins on cardiac muscle cells with magnetic beads activates a VRAC-like current, suggesting a putative connection between β1-integrin/focal adhesion kinase signaling and LRRC8A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browe and Baumgarten, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browe and Baumgarten, 2006</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that LRRC8A may connect β1-integrin-mediated mechano-transduction with insulin/IGF1-PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, which, in skeletal muscle is anticipated to regulate skeletal muscle differentiation, function and potentially also adiposity and systemic glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüning et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2000</xref>). In this study, we tested this hypothesis by examining LRRC8A dependent intracellular signaling and myotube differentiation in both C2C12 and primary skeletal muscle cells in vitro, and by performing skeletal muscle targeted LRRC8A loss-of-function experiments in vivo. We find that myotube differentiation and insulin and stretch-mediated PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2, mTOR signaling is strongly regulated by LRRC8A protein expression, and provide evidence that GRB2 signaling mediates these LRRC8A dependent effects. Finally, using skeletal muscle <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> knock-out mice, we reveal the requirement of skeletal muscle LRRC8A for maintaining normal skeletal muscle cell size, muscle endurance, force generation, adiposity and glucose tolerance, under basal conditions and in the setting of overnutrition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LRRC8A is expressed and functional in skeletal muscle and is required for myotube formation</title><p>LRRC8A is the essential component of a hexameric ion channel signaling complex that encodes I<sub>Cl,SWELL</sub>, or the volume-regulated anion current (VRAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>). While the LRRC8A complex has been shown to regulate cellular volume in response to application of non-physiological hypotonic extracellular solutions, the physiological function(s) of this ubiquitously expressed ion channel signaling complex remain unknown. To determine the function of the LRRC8A channel complex in skeletal muscle, we genetically deleted <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> from C2C12 mouse myoblasts using CRISPR/cas9-mediated gene editing as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2018</xref>), and from primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from <italic>Lrrc8a <sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice transduced with adenoviral Cre-mCherry (KO) or mCherry alone (WT control) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).

In vivo, skeletal muscle-targeted <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO mice have smaller skeletal muscle cells, impaired muscle endurance, and force generation, and are predisposed to adiposity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Insulin/stretch-mediated PI3K-AKT, mTOR signaling are well known to be important regulators of myogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rotwein and Wilson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Héron-Milhavet et al., 2008</xref>), metabolism and muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schiaffino et al., 2013</xref>) suggesting impaired LRRC8A-AKT-mTOR signaling may underlie the defect in myogenic differentiation. Indeed, consistent with our previous findings and proposed model in adipocytes, in which LRRC8A mediates the interaction of GRB2 with IRS1 to regulate insulin-AKT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunasekar et al., 2019</xref>), LRRC8A also associates with GRB2 in skeletal myotubes, and GRB2 knock-down rescues impaired myogenic differentiation in <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO muscle cells. Thus, our working model for LRRC8A-mediated regulation of insuln-PI3K-AKT and downstream signaling in adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunasekar et al., 2019</xref>) appears to be conserved in skeletal myotubes. The in vitro phenotype that we observe in CRISPR/cas9-mediated <italic>Lrrc8a KO</italic> C2C12 myotubes and in <italic>Lrrc8a KO</italic> primary myotubes is consistent with the observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref> that used siRNA-mediated LRRC8A knock-down to demonstrate that the LRRC8A channel complex is required for myogenic differentiation. However, the ability of both GRB2 KD and LRRC8A O/E to rescue myogenic differentiation and augment insulin-AKT, MAP kinase and mTOR signaling in <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO myotubes implicates non-canonical, non-conductive signaling mechanisms. Based on our work and also previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>), LRRC8A O/E does <italic>not increase</italic> I<sub>Cl,SWELL</sub>/VRAC to supranormal levels at the plasma membrane. However, pAKT, pERK1/2 and mTOR levels are augmented by twofold to threefold <italic>above endogenous</italic> levels, upon twofold LRRC8A O/E in C2C12 myotubes. These data suggest that alternative/non-canonical signaling mechanisms underlie LRRC8A signaling, as opposed to canonical/conductive signaling mechanisms.</p><p>Another finding that warrants further study is the requirement for LRRC8A in stretch-induced AKT and MAP kinase signaling in C2C12 myotubes upon static stretching. Mechanical stretch is known to regulate myoblast proliferation and differentiation and myofiber hypertrophy via PI3K-AKT-MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schiaffino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Also, there are numerous reports that VRAC, and presumably LRRC8A , is mechano-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browe and Baumgarten, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browe and Baumgarten, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Osei-Owusu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barakat et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nakao et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nilius and Droogmans, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Romanenko et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strange et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, it may not be surprising that LRRC8A complexes co-regulate both insulin and stretch-mediated PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2 signaling in skeletal myotubes - potentially integrating mechanical and hormonal stimuli to tune downstream signaling. Indeed, the concept of mechano-tuning insulin signaling has been proposed and demonstrated in other cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Chalfie, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) which implicate integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2018</xref>) as the mechano-sensory mechanism. Curiously, it has been reported that VRAC can be activated in cardiac muscle cells by applying mechanical tension to β1-integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Browe and Baumgarten, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Browe and Baumgarten, 2006</xref>), supporting the notion that, in striated muscle, integrin-LRRC8A may indeed participate in mechano-tuning insulin-AKT and downstream signaling. Further studies to more fully delineate the putative molecular mechanisms are necessary.</p><p>It is also notable that the profound myogenic differentiation block observed upon <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> ablation in both C2C12 myotubes and primary myotubes in vitro is significantly milder in vivo, where only a 30% reduction in skeletal myocyte cross-sectional area is observed, with no change in total muscle mass, or lean content, in Skm KO mice. This discordance in phenotype may reflect fundamental differences in the biology of skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro versus the in vivo milieu. Alternatively, it may be that, although early, the time interval between <italic>Myf5-Cre</italic> expression early in myogenesis, and ultimate reductions in LRRC8A protein (potentially ~3 days) may extend beyond the critical period during which LRRC8A is required for myogenic differentiation. Directly testing this hypothesis would require examining mice expressing Cre-recombinase at the precursor stage, in skeletal muscle satellite cells, such as Pax3 or Pax7 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Relaix et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buckingham et al., 2006</xref>) - these experiments are currently underway.</p><p>Although overall muscle development is grossly intact in both LRRC8A skeletal muscle KO (<italic>Myl1<sup>Cre</sup>/Lrrc8a<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Myf5<sup>Cre</sup>/Lrrc8a<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</italic> mice, there is a consistent reduction in exercise capacity, muscle endurance and force generation, and a propensity for increased adiposity over time compared to age and gender matched controls. The impaired exercise capacity observed in skeletal muscle <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> KO mice are consistent with some level of insulin resistance, as in <italic>db/db</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ostler et al., 2014</xref>) and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Reusch et al., 2013</xref>), and may be due to impaired skeletal muscle glycolysis and oxygen consumption in LRRC8A-depleted skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the increased gonadal adiposity, with preserved glucose and insulin tolerance, observed in LRRC8A skeletal muscle KO (<italic>Myl1<sup>Cre</sup>/Lrrc8a<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and <italic>Myf5<sup>Cre</sup>/Lrrc8a<sup>fl/fl</sup>)</italic> mice phenocopy both skeletal muscle-specific insulin receptor KO mice (MIRKO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brüning et al., 1998</xref>) and transgenic mice expressing a skeletal muscle dominant-negative insulin receptor mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moller et al., 1996</xref>), wherein skeletal muscle-specific insulin resistance is compensated for by re-distribution of glucose from skeletal muscle to adipose tissue, to promote adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2000</xref>). In the case of LRRC8A skeletal muscle KO mice, overnutrition and HFD feeding unmasks this underlying mild insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, as adipose-tissue insulin resistance also begins to set in. Recent findings from skeletal muscle specific AKT1/AKT2 double KO mice indicate that these effects may not attributable to solely to muscle AKT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaiswal et al., 2019</xref>), but potentially involve other insulin-sensitive signaling pathways.</p><p>In summary, we show that LRRC8A regulates myogenic differentiation and insulin-PI3K-AKT-AS160, ERK1/2, and mTOR signaling in myotubes via GRB2-mediated signaling. In vivo, LRRC8A is required for maintaining normal exercise capacity, muscle endurance, adiposity under basal conditions, and systemic glycemia in the setting of overnutrition. These findings contribute further to our understanding of LRRC8A channel complexes in the regulation of systemic metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

GRB2 knock-down was achieved by transducing myotubes with Ad5-U6- shSCR-GFP (Control, MOI 50–60) or Ad5-U6- sh LRRC8A-GFP (GRB2 KD, MOI 50–60) in DMEM (2% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin) supplemented with polybrene (4 µg/ml) for 24 hr. Cells were allowed to differentiate further in differentiation media up to 6 days. Differentiated myotube images were taken for myotube surface area quantification before collecting the cells for RNA isolation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Myotube signaling upon LRRC8A disruption post-differentiation</title><p>WT C2C12 cells were cultured in differentiation media for 6 days to form myotubes. Subsequently myotubes were transduced either with Ad5-U6-scramble-mCherry (sh-SCR) or Ad5-mCherry-U6-shLRRC8A(sh LRRC8A) shRNA (KD) (MOI 50–60) for 2 days and grown for 1 additional day prior to analysis. Myotubes were then incubated in serum free media for 6 hr and stimulated with 0 and 10 nM insulin for 15 min. Primary skeletal muscle cells isolated from <italic>Lrrc8a <sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were grown in differentiation media for 3.5 days.

Cells were allowed to differentiate up to 6 days in differentiation media, and then placed into a Flexcell Jr. Tension System (FX-6000T) and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. C2C12 myotubes on flexible membrane were subjected to either no tension or to static stretch of 5% for 15 min. Cells were lysed and protein isolated for subsequent western blots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blot</title><p>Cells were washed with ice cold 1X PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES, 1% NP-40, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) with added proteinase/phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). The cell lysate was further sonicated (20% pulse frequency for 20 s) and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected and estimated for protein concentration using DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). For immunoblotting, an appropriate volume of 4 x Laemmli (Bio-rad) sample loading buffer was added to the sample (10–20 μg of protein), then heated at 90°C for 5 min before loading onto 4–20% gel (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated using running buffer (Bio-Rad) for 2 hr at 110 V. Proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) and membrane blocked in 5% (w/v) BSA or 5% (w/v) milk in TBST buffer (0.2 M Tris, 1.37 M NaCl, 0.2% Tween-20, pH 7.4) at room temperature for 1 hr.

Tissues were homogenized on ice with a Dounce homogenizer (40–50 passes) and incubated for overnight at 4°C with continuous rotation. Tissue lysate was further sonicated in 20 s cycle intervals for 2–3 times and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected for protein concentration estimation using DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Due to the high content of contractile protein in this preparation, coomassie gel staining was performed to demonstrate equal protein loading, and for quantification normalization of Western blots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Tissue histology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was carefully excised and gently immersed into the tissue-tek O.C.T medium placed on wooden cork. Orientation of the tissue maintained while embedding in the medium. Subsequently, wooden cork with tissue gently immersed into the liquid N2 pre-chilled isopentane bath for 10–14 s and store at −80°C. Tissue sectioning (10 µm) were done with Leica cryostat and all sections collected on positively charged microscope slide for H and E staining as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonetto et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, TA sectioned slides were stained for 2 min in hematoxylin, 1 min in eosin and then dehydrated with ethanol and xylenes. Subsequently, slides were mounted with coverslip and image were taken with EVOS cell imaging microscope (10X objective). For quantification of fiber cross-sectional area, images were processed using ImageJ software to enhance contrast and smooth/sharpen cell boundaries and clearly demarcate muscle fiber cross sectional area. All measurements were performed with an independent observer who was blinded to the identity of the slides.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Muscle fiber type quantification</title><p>Skeletal muscle fiber-type was quantified in WT and Skm KO tibialis anterior (TA) muscle as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biltz et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, sections were immunostained against myosin heavy chain isoforms (type I, type IIa, and type IIb BA‐F8, SC‐71 and BF‐F3, respectively, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) and against laminin (ab11575; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to quantify fiber types and areas. Fiber types were identified on four non‐overlapping 20 × images in controlled locations: two from the superficial region and two from the deep. Unstained fibers were assumed to be of type IIx. Fiber areas were detected with a custom ImageJ macro using the automated Huang threshold and particle analyzer. Regions of interest with a circularity of less than 0.5 were excluded as being out of the axial plane of that fiber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Exercise tolerance test and inversion testing</title><p>Mouse treadmill exercise protocols were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dougherty et al., 2016</xref>. Briefly, mice were first acclimated with the motorized treadmill (Columbus Instruments Exer3/6 Treadmill Columbus, OH) for 3 days by running 10–15 min (with 3 min interval) for three consecutive days at 7 m/min, with the electric shocking grid (frequency 1 Hz) installed in each lane. During the treadmill testing, mice ran with a gradual increase in speed (5.5 m/minute to 22 m/minute) and inclination (0<sup>o</sup>-15<sup>o</sup>) at time intervals of 3 min each. The total running distance for each mouse was recorded at the end of the experiment. The predefined criteria for removing the mouse from the treadmill and recording the distance travelled was: continuous shock for 5 s or receiving 5–6 shocks within a time interval of 15 s. These mice were promptly removed from the treadmill and total duration and distance were recorded for further analysis.</p><p>Mouse inversion test was performed using a wire-grid screen apparatus elevated to 50 cm. Mice were stabilized on the screen inclined at 60<sup>o</sup>, with the mouse head facing towards the base of the screen. The screen was slowly pivoted to 0<sup>o</sup> (horizontal), such that the mouse was fully inverted and hanging upside down from the screen. Soft bedding was placed underneath the screen to protect mouse from any injury, were they to fall. The inversion test for each mouse was repeated two times with an interval of 45 min (resting period). The hang time for each mouse was repeated three times with an interval of 5 min. The maximum hanging time limit for each mouse was set for 3 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Isolated muscle contractile assessment</title><p>Soleus muscle was carefully dissected and transferred to a specialized muscle stimulation system (1500A, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada) where physiology tests were run in a blinded fashion. Muscle was immersed in a Ringer solution (in mM) (NaCl 137, KCI 5, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 24, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1, glucose 11 and curare 0.015) maintained at 37°C. The distal tendon was secured with silk suture to the arm of a dual mode ergometer (300C-LR, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada) and the proximal tendon secured to a stationary post. Muscles were stimulated with an electrical stimulator (701C, Aurora Scientific, Aurora, ON, Canada) using parallel platinum plate electrodes extending along the muscle. Muscle slack length was set by increasing muscle length until passive force was detectable above the noise of the transducer and fiber length was measured through a micrometer reticule in the eyepiece of a dissecting microscope. Optimal muscle length was then determined by incrementally increasing the length of the muscle by 10% of slack fiber length until the isometric tetanic force plateaued. At this optimum length, force was recorded during a twitch contraction and isometric tetanic contraction (300 ms train of 0.3 ms pulses at 225 Hz). The muscle was then fatigued with a bout of repeated tetanic contractions every 10 s until force dropped below 50% of peak. At this point, the muscle was cut from the sutures and weighed. This weight, along with peak fiber length and muscle density (1.056 g/cm3), was used to calculate the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and convert to specific force (tension). The experimental data were analyzed and quantified using Matlab (Mathworks), and presented as peak tetanic tension (Tetanic Tension) – peak of the force recording during the tetanic contraction, normalized to PCSA; Time to fatigue (TTF) – time for the tetanic tension to fall below 50% of the peak value during the fatigue test; Half relaxation time (HRT) – half the time between force peak and return to baseline during the twitch contraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>XF-24 seahorse assay</title><p>Cellular respiration was quantified in primary myotubes using the XF24 extracellular flux (XF) bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies/Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA, USA).

Cells were then switched to differentiation media for another 3 days. For insulin-stimulation, cells were incubated in serum free media for 4 hr and stimulated with 0 and 10 nM insulin for 2 hr. Subsequently, medium was changed to XF‐DMEM, and kept in a non‐CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 60 min. The basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was measured in XF‐DMEM. Subsequently, oxygen consumption was measured after addition of each of the following compounds: oligomycin (1 μg/ml) (ATP-Linked OCR), carbonyl cyanide 4‐(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP; 1 μM) (Maximal Capacity OCR) and antimycin A (10 μM; Spare Capacity OCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wende et al., 2015</xref>). For the glycolysis stress test, prior to experimentation, cells were switched to glucose‐free XF‐DMEM and kept in a non‐CO2 incubator for 60 min. Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was determined in XF‐DMEM followed by these additional conditions: glucose (10 mM), oligomycin (1 μM), and 2‐DG (100 mM).

metabolism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Muthu Periasamy as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Kumar et al. assesses the role of SWELL1 in regulating skeletal muscle differentiation, growth and metabolism. By knocking-out and rescuing SWELL1 expression in muscle cells, the authors show that this protein is crucial for myogenesis and myotube formation, and it plays a role in regulating insulin-dependent pathways and stretch-induced signaling. Mechanistically, the authors postulate SWELL1 interacts with and restrains GRB2 to regulate downstream AKT/MAPK pathways. Finally, a muscle-specific KO of SWELL1 exhibits smaller myofibers and reduced muscle endurance with no effect over the total muscle mass. The authors also show that SWELL1 regulates insulin signaling and systemic glucose homeostasis during metabolic challenge with a high fat diet. Overall, the study is well done and the majority of the data is convincing. The study provides interesting insights into potential role of stretch activated channel in skeletal muscle function. While the study is interesting, there are limitations in the manuscript, particularly the link between insulin signaling, and metabolic homeostasis is not thoroughly investigated. Several questions remain to be clarified and some additional data would enhance the study for the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1D- RNA-Seq results could be secondary to differentiation rather than to say that SWELL1 regulates these pathways to influence differentiation. Can the authors comment on this.</p><p>2) Figure 2- This is related to the comment in Figure 1D. Are the partial responses to insulin due to the difference in differentiated vs. undifferentiated myocytes? Another question is in the differentiated SWELL1 KO myocytes, what is the impact of SWELL1 absence? Do they fully respond to insulin? So once differentiated, is SWELL1 dispensable for normal function. The pAS160 data suggest there is still a defect whereas the pAKT2 data may signal otherwise. In addition, there certainly may be SWELL1-dependent and SWELL1-independent pathways.</p><p>3a) Are the effects of SWELL1 manipulation on insulin signaling or RNA-seq linked to impaired differentiation or the other way around? This question remains outstanding. Perhaps can be included in the Discussion. b) The in vivo effects are not associated with muscle size, but could be due to other effects of SWELL1 KO, such as fiber type switch, impaired oxidative metabolism, impaired insulin signaling.</p><p>4) How do the authors explain impaired performance? Can the authors measure some key markers quickly to resolve this issue?

As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and now described in the Results subsection “LRRC8A regulates multiple insulin dependent signaling pathways in skeletal myotubes”, we observe similar reductions in insulin-stimulated signaling in differentiated C2C12 myotubes, but these differences are, in some cases, less pronounced than observed when SWELL1 is deleted prior to differentiation. These findings suggest that <italic>both</italic> SWELL1-dependent impairments in myotube differentiation <italic>and</italic> direct contributions of SWELL1 to intracellular signaling contribute to the observed signaling defects. Since, in the current version of the manuscript, we describe this in the aforementioned Results subsection with additional experimental evidence (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), we have not included further discussion in the Discussion section.</p><p>The observation by the reviewers that pAS160 is quite significantly suppressed upon SWELL1 deletion, while pAKT2 is only partially suppressed is astute. Moreover, this appears to be true not only in SWELL1 depleted skeletal myoblasts that are subsequently differentiated into myotubes (Figure 2), but also in fully differentiated myotubes that are subjected to SWELL1 depletion (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). As the reviewer suggests, this finding is consistent with AKT-independent mechanisms of AS-160 phosphorylation, such as via PKC (Farese, R.V., Am J Physiol: Endocrinology and Metabolism 2002).</p><p>2) Is the impaired exercise and muscle performance related to fiber-type switching, or other mechanisms. The Major points below fall under this category:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The in vivo effects are not associated with muscle size, but could be due to other effects of SWELL1 KO, such as fiber type switch, impaired oxidative metabolism, impaired insulin signaling.</p><p>4) How do the authors explain impaired performance? Can the authors measure some key markers quickly to resolve this issue? NADH staining, fiber typing, gene expression, westerns?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we stained frozen sections that we had previously stored from both superficial and deep tibialis anterior muscle from skeletal-muscle SWELL1 KO and WT mice for muscle fiber-types (MHC Type 1, MHC Type IIa, MHC Type IIx and MHC Type IIb) in both superficial and deep tibialis anterior muscle in Skm KO as compared to WT mice as described in the Results section subsection “Skeletal muscle targeted <italic>Lrrc8a</italic> knock-out mice have reduced skeletal myocyte size, muscle endurance and ex vivo force generation” and shown in Figure 7—figure supplement-1. We observe no differences in muscle fiber-type between WT and Skm KO mice indicating that observed reductions in muscle force and endurance is not due to muscle fiber-type switching. Indeed, it is increasingly appreciated that changes in muscle metabolic potential and morphology may occur independent from adaptive fiber-type switching as measured by a change in MHC expression (Egan and Zierath, 2013). Instead, we believe that alternative mechanisms are responsible for these observations in SWELL1 KO muscle, such as impaired glycolysis and glucose metabolism (as described in the aforementioned subsection, and Figure 7H), and this is the currently the subject of ongoing studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
