remained elusive. To study cerebellar activity during visual attention we recorded extracellular activity of dentate nucleus (DN) neurons in two non-human primates (NHPs). NHPs were trained to read the direction indicated by a peripheral visual stimulus while maintaining fixation at the center, and report the direction of the cue by performing a saccadic eye movement into the same direction following a delay. We found that single-unit DN neurons modulated spiking activity over the entire time course of the task, and that their activity often bridged temporally separated intra-trial events, yet in a heterogeneous manner. To better understand the heterogeneous relationship between task structure, behavioral performance, and neural dynamics, we constructed a behavioral, an encoding, and a decoding model. Both NHPs showed different behavioral strategies, which influenced the performance. Activity of the DN neurons reflected the unique strategies, with the direction of the visual stimulus frequently being encoded long before an upcoming saccade. Moreover, the latency of the ramping activity of DN neurons following presentation of the visual stimulus was shorter in the better performing NHP. Labeling with the retrograde tracer Cholera Toxin B in the recording location in the DN indicated that these neurons predominantly receive inputs from Purkinje cells in the D1 and D2 zones of the lateral cerebellum as well as neurons of the principal olive and medial pons, all regions known to connect with neurons in the prefrontal cortex contributing to planning of saccades. Together, our results highlight that DN neurons can dynamically modulate their activity during a visual attention task, comprising not only sensorimotor but also cognitive attentional components.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dentate nucleus</kwd><kwd>visual attention</kwd><kwd>heterogeneous activity</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>prefrontal

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The crucial role of the cerebellum in sensorimotor processing, such as learning and execution of eye movements, is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inoshita and Hirano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ivry and Diener, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kunimatsu et al., 2016</xref>). Yet, over the last few decades evidence is emerging that the cerebellum also participates in more complex cognitive visual functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brissenden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courchesne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicolson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Voogd et al., 2012</xref>). For example, while interacting with areas such as the frontal eye fields (FEFs), lateral intraparietal area, superior colliculus, and basal ganglia, the cerebellum uses visual information to guide the planning of saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kunimatsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scerra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wardak et al., 2011</xref>). An open question is to what extent the cerebellum also has access to information in the peripheral visual field to adjust the planning of saccades. If the cerebellum is prominently involved in such processing, one expects to find encodings of both visual cues and the related eye movements at its output stage in the cerebellar nuclei.</p><p>In daily life, visual scenes often contain considerably more information than the visual system can process in short periods of time. Therefore, saccades are made to align the fovea, the region of the retina having the highest visual acuity and largest representation in the visual cortex, with the target of interest. Yet, it remains to be elucidated how saccades are planned. Neuroimaging studies suggest that network mechanisms in the parietal, frontal, and temporal lobes that control the programming of saccades overlap with those underlying covert attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbetta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nobre et al., 2000</xref>). Along the same avenue, the ‘premotor theory of attention’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizzolatti et al., 1987</xref> proposes that the circuit used for generating movements is also active during attention shifts. This theory is also supported by the observation that the working peripheral location of the covert cue stimulus is restricted by the ultimate potential outer position of the eye in that it is not possible to attend to a covert cue when the cue is outside of the range of the oculomotor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craighero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanning and Deubel, 2020</xref>). At the same time, it should be noted that when it comes to neuronal responses at the single-cell level, the cortical networks engaged in covert attention do not always perfectly overlap with those that control saccades. For example, findings in the FEF show that at least part of the visual cells that respond to covert attention do not modulate in relation to the saccades, implying that there may be cell type – specificity for responses to covert attention in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregoriou et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we aimed to examine if visual attention stimuli are processed in the dentate nucleus (DN) of the cerebellum, and to what extent the signaling during a visuomotor task controls the directional saccadic eye movements. We tested the overall hypothesis that DN neurons can dynamically modulate their activity during a covert visual attention task, comprising a mixture of sensorimotor and cognitive attentional, that is, multimodal, components. More specifically, given that earlier studies in primates and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzfeld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Es et al., 2019</xref> have indicated that direction selectivity of cerebellar activity may occur in various sensorimotor domains, we hypothesized that DN cells can be direction selective for not only the sensorimotor but also the cognitive components. Therefore, we studied the activity of single units in the DN during a complex, peripheral Landolt C saccade task in two non-human primates (NHPs). The task comprised the following consecutive components: (1) shifting attention toward the C-location in the peripheral visual field, while holding gaze fixation on the center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), (2) recognizing of the location of a ‘gap’ in a virtual full circle as eminent in the letter C, which provides the cue for the direction of the saccade to be made in the future (while still holding central gaze fixation), (3) planning of a saccade into the direction that depends on the peripheral visual information (i.e., position of the gap in the C), (4) executing the corresponding saccade following a delay, and (5) receiving a reward if the direction of the saccade is correct. We found that DN neurons could modulate their activity during multiple task epochs, often selectively for an individual C-gap direction or saccade direction. After analyzing DN activity and choice performance following task relearning, it became evident that each animal employed a different behavioral strategy during execution of the task. In addition, early onset of stimulus triggered activity was detected in the better performing animal. Finally, the location of the task-relevant neurons in the DN was in line with the known connections from and to the FEF, that is, one of the main classical attention and saccade planning center(s) in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregoriou et al., 2012</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task and behavioral performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, drawing of the animal performing the task.

The animals had to maintain central fixation throughout the trial as long as the central fixation dot remained red (see example trial in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After a delay of ~500 ms after fixation onset, the C-stimulus was randomly presented in one of four cardinal directions (Right = 0°, Left = 180°, Up = 90°, Down = 270°) for the duration of 250 ms. The animals had to perceive the direction of the gap of the C (gap direction), which was always positioned perpendicular to the stimulus location. Specifically, the gap direction is either Up or Down [U/D] when the C-stimulus was presented in locations L or R [L/R], or the gap direction is either Left or Right [L/R] when the C-stimulus was presented in locations U or D. After the presentation of the C-stimulus, the C was masked for 100 ms to prevent retinal afterimages, and subsequently there was a delay period of 500–700 ms in which Mi and Mo had to remember the gap direction. After the delay period, two saccade targets were shown at the same eccentricity; one target was placed in the same direction as the gap direction (i.e., the correct target), and the other one was presented as a distractor. If the animals made a saccade to the correct target within 500 ms after the target onset, they received a juice reward.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Task and behavior</title><p>There were significant differences in task performance levels between Mi and Mo that did not depend on the gap direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Mo consistently outperformed Mi, and this trend was present across different experimental sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It should be noted that this analysis used data from periods after the monkeys had been sufficiently trained to understand the task structure above-chance level (i.e., &gt;60% correct responses), so the performance differences do not directly represent the structure of the initial learning process. Still, since for each animal the task sessions were separated by weeks-long breaks, during which the other animal was subjected to electrophysiological recordings, some level of retraining likely took place when sessions restarted.</p><p>To assess which task variables contributed to the behavioral performance in the individual animals we split the type of tasks in two sets: the upward and downward directions (U/D task) and the leftward and rightward directions (L/R task). This allowed us to apply a logistic regression model with the dependent variable being the fraction of correct responses, and the independent variables being those that specify the task structure. We first explored how the gap direction presented in the current trial was weighted to best predict the animals’ performance over the sessions. The weight that Mi assigned to the U/D gap direction increased simultaneously with task performance. In contrast, the weight that was assigned to the L/R stimulus remained constant, suggesting that his overall performance increase was mostly mediated by his improvement in the subset of up-/downward trials in the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). Mo, on the other hand, exhibited increased weighting of the stimulus in both U/D and L/R trials. Indeed, the overall higher performance of Mo relative to Mi was reflected in the model on Mo’s data having higher weights for the gap direction throughout all measured sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). We next assessed if any past-trial conditions influenced the behavioral response in the current trial. Therefore, we determined the weight of events gap direction and saccade direction in the previous trial with the same logistic regression approach. According to this model, Mi assigned less weight to the previous saccade over time if the current trial was in the L/R direction (p = 0.016; <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.32, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, there was no change in event weight to predict the response on the current trial in the past-trial variables for Mo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>DN activity</title><p>Once the animals reached an above-chance performance level (60%), we identified the site of the DN in both Mi and Mo with the use of structural MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Single-unit activity was recorded for 305 DN neurons, while the animals performed the Landolt C task. The activity levels of DN neurons in both Mi and Mo changed during the instruction and movement stage, depending on the stimulus identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, D</xref>; for separate datasets of Mi and Mo, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, during the presentation of the C-stimulus a DN cell could respond with an increase in activity, followed by suppression around the time of the correctly executed saccade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Yet, the level of activity during the facilitation after the presentation of the C-stimulus could be selective for trials with different directions; for example, it could be higher for trials during which the gap direction was either left or up, compared to those with right or down directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Differences in spiking for different directions were determined by comparing the number of spikes in a bin at the moment of largest divergence between directions (see Methods). Changes of neuronal activity in relation to the presentation of the C-stimulus and/or the saccade were common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). For example, cells could show significant facilitation of their activity in a window associated with the C-stimulus (200 ms moving window, 100 ms steps from 0 to 800 ms after C-stimulus onset) or the saccade (200 ms moving window, 100 ms steps from −200 ms before to 200 ms after saccade onset) relative to baseline activity from before trial onset (see Material and methods for details) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Likewise, cells could also show suppression of their firing following the C-stimulus and the saccade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When we aligned the neurons to the time of their maximum change in activity after C-stimulus onset, the population of suppressing neurons (<italic>n</italic> = 85) exhibited the modulation significantly earlier (p &lt; 0.0041; Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) than did the facilitating units (<italic>n</italic> = 90), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). This was not the case (p = 0.23) for facilitating (<italic>n</italic> = 57) and suppressing (<italic>n</italic> = 38) cells during the saccade window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neural activity in the dentate nucleus (DN) during the Landolt C task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MRI images of Mi and Mo, showing the electrode position in the DN.

To fully characterize the neural responses, we fitted a generalized linear model (GLM) and analyzed which of the task events were encoded in the spike activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This model predicts the spiking activity time course of individual neurons as a weighted sum of time-dependent basis functions in response to every task event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2014</xref>). LASSO regularization was used to select a parsimonious set of task events that should be included in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>; for details see Materials and methods). We found that many cells encoded the gap direction, the saccade or both, while a smaller fraction was sensitive to the events in the previous trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Many units showed firing rate modulation in relation to both particular gap directions and saccades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>). Likewise, a neural response after the saccade in trials where the animal made a mistake was a common feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since retinal errors were not expected to be a relevant feature of this task, at least not in the sense of those that may occur in classic saccadic adaptation paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herzfeld et al., 2018</xref>), it is possible that these responses are related to the absence of reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heffley and Hull, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>).

Despite the level of heterogeneity among the two NHPs in terms of performance level and strategy, the fractions of recorded neurons that were sensitive to particular task parameters, including gap direction, saccade direction, or miscellaneous were similar in both animals, indicating that we sampled from comparable populations of DN neurons in the two NHPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Encoding of task events by dentate nucleus (DN) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a generalized linear model (GLM) for the spike count of a given neuron as being Poisson-distributed around behavior-dependent mean rates.

For each 200-ms time window in the trial, we fit a logistic regression model to determine at which time points a given trial condition could be decoded from the cell’s activity. The condition that was most reliably represented was the trial outcome, that is, whether the monkey made a correct or incorrect choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The proportion of cells from which the trial outcome could be decoded increased at about 1 s following the presentation of the C-stimulus to the monkey, and this persisted throughout the delay period and remained present for more than a second after the monkey had made his choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see different columns). Compared to Mo, Mi had more cells from which the trial outcome could be decoded around the time of the reward. This may be due to the overall poorer performance of Mi, resulting in more error trials which may result in stronger neural responses. Instead, Mo showed many cells in which we could decode information about the C-stimulus, including the gap direction, which is relevant to making a correct choice. Possibly, this was particularly visible in Mo as his DN activity was generally better entrained to the stimulus, leading to a better overall behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In line with the findings of the behavioral model, Mi instead had more cells than Mo that maintained information about the choice he had made in the previous trial, well into the time-frame of the ongoing trial.

In both cases, the injections were focused on the centrolateral part of the DN positioned in the center of its rostrocaudal axis; given the distribution of the modulating cells according to the stereotactic coordinates with respect to the 2D-grid of the recording chamber and the recording depths, we estimated that the functionally relevant recording area covered a vertical column of approximately 2 mm long, 2 mm wide, and 3 mm deep, as all modulated cells were recorded in a square of that size. Despite a similar location for the core of the injection site, the size of the injection was bigger in Mo as compared to Mi, possibly reflecting different stock preparations or anisotropic spread of the tracer. Accordingly, when we quantified the number of retrogradely labeled neurons in one out of four sections of the inferior olive (IO), so as to assess the relative effective size of the DN injections in both animals, we found more labeled cells in Mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>).

Their activity often bridges different experimental epochs and frequently show both upbound and downbound modulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>), similar to PCs in the lateral cerebellum that project to the DN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avila et al., 2022</xref>). Importantly, following training of the task, many DN neurons respond in a visual direction- or movement direction-selective manner more than half a second before the saccade of choice is made. Thus, multimodality and timing-dependent activation appear to be common properties of neurons in the lateral cerebellum.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Visuomotor DN neurons connect to cerebellar modules in D1 and D2 zones</title><p>The distribution of the retrogradely labeled PCs in lateral lobules VII and VIII as well as crus I/II indicates that the region where we recorded in the DN forms part of the cerebellar D1 and D2 microcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Zeeuw, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Zeeuw and Ten Brinke, 2015</xref>).

Most anterogradely labeled fibers were found in the pulvinar, mediodorsal thalamus and ventrolateral thalamus, which are known to connect to various parts of the prefrontal cortex, such as FEF and Brodmann area 46 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kipping et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Middleton and Strick, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Romanski et al., 1997</xref>), and/or the parietal eye field, an established hub in the dorsal attention network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roitman and Shadlen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Svoboda and Li, 2018</xref>).

After a delay, the primates had to move their eyes to a virtual point in space dependent on the cue implied by the gap of the peripheral C-stimulus. The spatial and temporal dissociation of cue and action in this task allows us to separate neural activity related to the visual and attentional processes from that related to motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avila et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goldberg and Segraves, 1987</xref>). Our data reveal that individual DN cells can encode both the direction of the visual cue and the associated direction of the subsequent saccade, suggesting that different task-specific activations in the cerebellar cortex may be relayed downstream to the same target neurons in the cerebellar nuclei. Our data are compatible with and expand upon fMRI studies, which have demonstrated that lateral lobules VIIb/VIIIa upstream of the DN exhibit functional properties characteristic of the dorsal attention network in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brissenden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brissenden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Es et al., 2019</xref>).

The difference in onset of DN ramping between the monkeys highlights the possibility that injecting accelerations of simple spike modulations of PCs in the cerebellar hemispheres into the complex of cerebellar nuclei may be instrumental in improving the performance of responses to covert attention, akin to what has been shown for the impact of PCs of the vestibulocerebellum on responses in the vestibular nuclei and compensatory eye movements upon vestibular stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Zeeuw et al., 1995</xref>).

Moreover, our recordings are corroborated by electrophysiological studies that have revealed a role of the cerebellar nuclei, including that of the DN, in motor planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chabrol et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deverett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deverett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).

In the cerebellar cortex such integration can take place at both the input and output stage. At the input stage, that is, at the level of the granule cells in the granular layer, activation of different sensory modalities has been shown to enhance spiking output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giovannucci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ishikawa et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, given that many individual granule cells can receive inputs from both the cuneate nucleus relaying sensory proprioceptive signals and the pontine nuclei mediating presumptive motor command signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wagner et al., 2019</xref>), it is likely that sensory, motor and cognitive signals can also be integrated at the level of the cerebellar input layer. At the level of the PCs in the molecular layer with inputs from thousands of parallel fibers contacting single PC dendrites, the opportunities for convergence and integration of different modalities are even greater (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that integration of various forms of sensory, motor, and/or cognitive signals also occurs at the level of the DN neurons downstream of PCs in the D1 and D2 zones. Indeed, single DN neurons can encode the direction of a visual stimulus, as well as the preparation and execution of a saccadic eye movement into a particular direction. The encoding of both stimulus and saccade directions is present in the biggest proportion of task-modulated neurons in both monkeys. The decoding analysis showed similar outcomes, albeit with greater variability between Mi and Mo. To what extent the integration of different modalities is taking place at the level of the DN itself, mediated by converging inputs from the PCs, mossy fibers, and/or climbing fiber collaterals, or solely by events upstream in the cerebellar cortex, remains to be elucidated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Systems mechanisms underlying covert attention</title><p>Our electrophysiological data on DN encoding during the Landolt C task are in line with fMRI studies showing covert attention signals in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brissenden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brissenden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Es et al., 2019</xref>). These neuroimaging studies, which have also implemented a consistent distractor stimulus to evaluate the validity of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posner, 1980</xref>), point toward a coordination of cerebral and cerebellar cortical activation during covert attention. In this respect, both our electrophysiological study and the imaging studies of others elaborate on the premotor theory of covert attention, which has so far mainly highlighted the relevance of processing in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corbetta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nobre et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rizzolatti et al., 1987</xref>). More specifically, the premotor theory highlights the relevance of circuits in the frontal and parietal lobes that are activated during both attention shifts and subsequent movements, so as to strengthen the association process. Our data show that most of the neurons in the main output nucleus of the cerebellum, the DN, exhibit heterogeneous modulations during putative attention shifts made when the animals read the peripheral C-stimulus, as well as during the subsequent goal-directed saccadic eye movements that depend on this preceding cue in the peripheral visual field. The converging coordination of cerebellum and cerebral cortex in higher order mental processes such as covert attention also occurs during other cognitive processes. For example, not only the mirror neuron system in cerebral cortex but also connected areas in the cerebellum are actively involved in perceiving and interpreting the action of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelgabar et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, just like during the Landolt C task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brissenden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brissenden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Es et al., 2019</xref>), lobules VII and VIII in the cerebellar hemispheres are recruited during such action observation tasks when evaluating the kinematics of goal-directed hand actions of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelgabar et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, patients suffering from spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 are severely impaired in performing these tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelgabar et al., 2019</xref>). These data raise the question as to how the cerebellum may contribute to overt and covert attentional tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lupo et al., 2018</xref>). One can hypothesize that cerebellar processing helps the frontal premotor and parietal cortices to map visual input from high level visual regions onto the motor machinery involved in performing related goal-directed actions. This suggests that much like action control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wolpert and Ghahramani, 2000</xref>), complex mental observation, either overt or covert, relies on a cortico-cerebellar loop that maps sensory input onto motor control structures (inverse models) and motor programs to expected sensory input (forward models). This loop may bring descending information from our visual cortical networks to the cerebellum and ascending information from the cerebellum back to premotor areas in the prefrontal cerebral cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures complied with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland), and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (AVD8010020184587).

At trial onset the animals were given a window of 500 ms to make a saccade to the central fixation point (red dot, 0.2° diameter) and required fixation to this point within a 4° diameter circular window for a period of at least 100 ms. If fixation was broken, a new trial was started after a 1.5-s time-out. If not, the red C-stimulus was presented in one out of four positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), randomly selected every trail. The gap direction of the C was always perpendicular to the position of the C relative to the fixation dot. The C-stimulus was presented for 250 ms at 5° eccentricity and had an outer and inner diameter of 1° and 0.6°, respectively. During the presentation of the C-stimulus the animals had to maintain fixation on the fixation dot. After the 250-ms period, the C-stimulus was masked for 100 ms with a full red circle to prevent the animals from gaining extra information from the retinal after-images. After the offset of the mask presentation, the fixation dot was visible for another randomly drawn interval between 500 and 700 ms (50 ms steps) during which the animals were also not allowed to break fixation. After this delay period, two potential saccade targets were presented perpendicular from the target location; subsequently, the fixation dot turned gray (go-cue), indicating that the animal was allowed to make a saccade into the direction indicated by the initial cue, that is, the gap of the C-stimulus. A trial was rewarded with a juice reward when the animals made a saccade to the correct target indicated by the gap of the C-stimulus within 500 ms after the central target turning gray. The correct target had to be fixated within a 4° diameter circular window around the target and fixation had to last at least 100 ms.

We call the previous model with no category dependence the ‘unspecialized’ model, and the model with category dependence the ‘category-modulated’ model. We considered all possible categories of trials as specified by four types of trial conditions: C direction, gap direction, saccade direction, and values of the same in the previous trial (past-gap and past-saccade). The gap direction (same for saccade direction) can take on one of four values {U,D,L,R}, which means that there are 14 different ways to construct categories of trials by gap direction (all partitions of the set). These 14 possibilities are:</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">Categories</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U}, {D}, {L}, {R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U, D}, {L, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U, L}, {D, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">4</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U, R}, {D, L}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">5</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U}, {D, L, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">6</td><td align="left" valign="top">{D}, {U, L, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">7</td><td align="left" valign="top">{L}, {U, D, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">8</td><td align="left" valign="top">{R}, {U, D, L}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">9</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U}, {D}, {L, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U}, {L}, {D, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">11</td><td align="left" valign="top">{U}, {R}, {D, L}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">12</td><td align="left" valign="top">{D}, {L}, {U, R}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">13</td><td align="left" valign="top">{D}, {R}, {U, L}</td></tr><tr><td align="char" char="." valign="top">14</td><td align="left" valign="top">{L}, {R}, {U, D}</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We furthermore wished to include the possibility that neuronal responses depend simultaneously on two or more trial conditions, for example, both the current trial gap and past-gap directions. As the number of all possible combinations of all trial-condition categories is exceedingly large, we used a greedy model selection procedure to select a parsimonious set of trial conditions that describes a given neuron’s response sufficiently well. Starting from the unspecialized model as the ‘parent’, we first constructed a set of candidate ‘child’ models, each of which corresponds to a particular choice of categorization for a particular trial condition (e.g., one of these would be {U,D},{L},{R} for saccade direction). We then selected the child model with the highest (cross-validated) likelihood <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf37"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> relative to its parent model, and if this is sufficiently high (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf38"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>), we retain this child model as the best model so far. This best model was then used as the parent model for a second repetition of the same procedure. In subsequent repetitions, trial conditions that were already included in the parent model were no longer considered for the child model (e.g., if the parent model had saccade-direction categories, then its child models will only include additional dependencies on gap, past-gap, and past-saccade categories). This procedure terminates when adding categories to the model no longer significantly improves the model likelihood.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Principal component decomposition</title><p>The average firing rate for correct and incorrect trials was calculated for the population of 145 and 160 neurons for Mi and Mo, respectively. From the firing rates in the window of [−0.5 to 1.5] s around stimulus onset PCA was performed for the pool of neurons of both monkeys, using the ‘pca’ function in MATLAB. Principal component coefficients were plotted over time to display new axes representing the direction of maximum variation on the trial average firing rates of correct and incorrect trials of individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Detection of firing rate ramping onset</title><p>After the PCA analysis, we further investigated whether differences in the latencies of neuronal ramping activity following presentation of the visual stimulus may contribute to heterogeneity in performance. To determine the latency of onset of both facilitating and suppressing firing rate ramping after presentation of the C-stimulus, a modified Kneedle algorithm was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Satopaa et al., 2011</xref>). This algorithm calculates the distance between each data point and the line connecting the starting point and the maximum point; the point with the greatest distance was identified as the ramping onset. To minimize noise from firing frequency fluctuations, average firing rates for correct and incorrect trials were generated using a 100-ms Gaussian kernel density estimation. Furthermore, due to the sensitivity of Kneedle for noise, the analysis was limited to neurons from which at least 100 correct and incorrect trials were recorded and that were found to be modulated during the ‘stimulus window’ as described above. Following the feature extraction process described above, statistical tests were conducted to assess significance through repeated measures ANOVA with the Tukey post hoc test. Latency until ramping onset was the outcome variable, trial outcome (i.e., correct or incorrect) as within subject variable, and monkey (Mi or Mo) as between subject variable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Decoding model</title><p>We used logistic regression to decode four behavioral quantities from the spiking activity of each neuron as a function of time in the trial (separately for each 200-ms time-bin aligned to different behavioral events). These behavioral quantities are the C direction, gap direction, the outcome of the trial, that is, whether the monkey receives a reward at the end of the current trial, and the previous trial versions of these quantities (past-gap direction and past-outcome). Because the trial outcome (e.g., variable A) and gap directions (variable B) are both behaviorally correlated, neural information about one behavioral quantity (neural activity being correlated with A) can spuriously appear as if it was information about another (neural activity being correlated with B, but only through the <italic>behavioral</italic> correlation between A and B). To control for this issue we used a trial weighting procedure to ‘re-balance’ the dataset so that all pairs of behavioral variables are in effect uncorrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kobak et al., 2016</xref>). For a given neuron, we first divided the trials in its dataset into categories defined by the three other behavioral quantities of interest (see above). Since the trial outcome can take on two values (rewarded/not rewarded), and gap direction can take on four values (U/D/L/R), this means that there are 2 x 4 x 2 x 4 = 64 categories of trials.

Injection position was verified with an electrode that was fixed to the injection line. When performing the tracer injections the tip of the electrode exceeded the tip of the capillary by 1 mm, the positional difference was corrected for by descending this distance deeper. The injectrode was lowered through the tentorium in an extra wide guide tube, allowing simultaneous access of both the electrode and the capillary. After perforation of the tentorium the tissue was left to settle for 20 min so as to allow the wider guide tube and injectrode to acquire a stable position. Next, the injectrode was lowered another 5–8 mm over 30 min so that the tissue was as stable as possible during the injection. Guided by the earlier neuronal recordings and current activity on the electrode, the tip of the capillary was lowered to a depth that was estimated to be the center of the task-related site. The 600 nl of the CTb solution was injected over a time course of 10 min, after which the injectrode was left in place for another 15 min.

At the same time, the authors recorded single-unit neural activity in the cerebellar dentate nucleus. They demonstrated that substantial fractions of DN cells exhibited sustained modulation of spike rates spanning task epochs and carrying information about stimulus, response, and trial outcome. Finally, tracer injections demonstrated this region of the DN projects to a large number of targets including several known to interconnect the visual attention network. The data compellingly demonstrate the authors' central claims, and the analyses are well-suited to support the conclusions. Importantly, the study demonstrates that DN cells convey many motor and nonmotor variables related to task execution, event sequencing, visual attention, and arguably decision-making/working memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99696.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Flierman</surname><given-names>Nico A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Koay</surname><given-names>Sue Ann</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Janelia Research Campus, Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Princeton</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Hoogstraten</surname><given-names>Willem S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Erasmus Medical Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rotterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ruigrok</surname><given-names>Tom JH</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roelfsema</surname><given-names>Pieter</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Vrije Universiteit</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Amsterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Badura</surname><given-names>Aleksandra</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Erasmus MC</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rotterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>De Zeeuw</surname><given-names>Chris I</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Erasmus MC</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Rotterdam</named-content></addr-line><country>Netherlands</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>- Summary:</p><p>Recordings were made from the dentate nucleus of two monkeys during a decision-making task. Correlates of stimulus position and stimulus information were found to varying degrees in the neuronal activities.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this summary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Strengths:</p><p>A difficult decision-making task was examined in two monkeys.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Weaknesses:</p><p>One of the monkeys did not fully learn the task. The manuscript lacked a coherent hypothesis to be tested, and no attempt was made to consider the possibility that this part of the brain may have little to do with the task that was being studied.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers concern. It is correct that one of the monkeys (Mi) did not perform at a high level, but it should be noted that both monkeys learned significantly above chance level. Therefore, we would argue that both monkeys in fact did learn the task but Mi’s performance was suboptimal. This difference in the performance levels gave us a rare opportunity to dive deeper into the reasons why some animals perform better than the others and we show that Mi (the lower performing monkey) paid more attention to the outcome of the previous trial – this is evident from our behavioural and decoding models.</p><p>We tested the overall hypothesis that neurons of the nucleus dentate can dynamically modulate their activity during a visual attention task, comprising not only sensorimotor but also cognitive attentional components. Many neurons in the dentate are multimodal (Figure 3C-D) which was something that was theorized. One of the specific hypotheses that we tested is that the dentate cells can be direction-selective for both the sensorimotor and cognitive component. Given that many of the recorded cells showed direction-selectivity in their firing rate modulation for gap directions and/or stimulus directions, we provide strong evidence that this hypothesis is correct. We have now spelled out this hypothesis more explicitly in the introduction of the revised version. We now also explain better why we tested this specific hypothesis. Indeed, earlier studies in primates such as those by Herzfeld and colleagues (2018, Nat. Neuro.) and van Es and colleagues (2019, Current Biol) have indicated that direction-selectivity of cerebellar activity may occur in various sensorimotor domains.</p><p>We also appreciate the comment of this Reviewer that in our original submission we did not show our attempt to consider the possibility that this part of the brain may have little to do with the task that was being studied. We in fact did consider this possibility in that we successfully injected 3 ml of muscimol (5 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) into the dentate nucleus in vivo in one of the monkeys (Mo). This application resulted in a reduction of more than 10% in correct responses of the covert attention task after 45 minutes, whereas the performance remained the same following saline injections. Unfortunately, due to the timing of the experiments and Covid19-related laboratory restrictions we were unable to perform these experiments in the other monkey or repeat them in Mo. We aim to replicate this in future experiments and publish it when we have full datasets of at least two monkeys available. For this paper we have prioritized our tracing experiments, highlighting the connections of the dentate nucleus with attention related areas in brainstem and cortex in both monkeys, following perfusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Perhaps the large differences in performance between the two subjects can be used as a way to interpret the neural data's relationship to behavior, as it provided a source of variance. This is what we would hypothesize if we believed that this area of the brain is playing a significant role in the task. If one animal learns much more poorly, and this region of the brain is important for that behavior, then shouldn't there be clear, interpretable differences in the neural data?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment. We have added a new Supplementary Figure 2, in which we present the data for both monkeys separately in the revised manuscript. Comparing the two datasets however, we see more commonalities related to the significant learning in both monkeys than differences that might be related to their different levels of learning. We have therefore decided to show the different datasets transparently in the new Supplementary Figure 2, but to stay on the conservative side in our interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How should we look for these differences? A number of recent papers in mice have uncovered a large body of data showing that during the deliberation period, when the animal is interpreting a sensory stimulus (often using the whisker system), there is ramping activity in a principal component space among neurons that contribute to the decision. This ramping activity is present (in the PCA space) in the motor areas of the cortex, as well as in the medial and lateral cerebellar nuclei. Perhaps a similar computational approach would benefit the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We also appreciate this point. We have done the principal component analysis accordingly, and we indeed do find the ramping activity in several components of the dentate activity of both monkeys (Mi and Mo). We have now added a new Supplementary Figure 3 with the first three components of both correct and incorrect trials for Mi and Mo, highlighting their potential contribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What is the hypothesis that is being tested? That is, what do you think might be the function of this region of the cerebellum in this task? It seems to me that we are not entirely in the dark, as previous literature on mice decision-making tasks has produced a reasonable framework: the deliberation period coincides with ramping activity in many regions of the frontal lobe and the cerebellum. Indeed, the ramp in the cerebellum appears to be a necessary condition for the ramp to be present in the frontal lobe. Thus, we should see such ramping activity in this task in the dentate. When the monkey makes the wrong choice, the ramp should predict it. If you don't see the ramping activity, then it is possible that the hypothesis is wrong, or that you are not recording from the right place.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed one of our specific hypotheses that the dentate cells can be direction-selective for the preparing cognitive component and/or sensorimotor response. We provide evidence that this hypothesis may be correct when we analyze the regular time response curves (see Figure 2 and the new Supplementary Figure 2 where the data of both monkeys are now presented separately). Moreover, we have now verified this by analysing the ramping curves of PCA space (new Supplementary Figure 3) and firing frequency of DN neurons that modulated upon presentation of the C-stimulus (new Supplementary Figure 4). These figures and findings are now referred to in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As this is a difficult task that depends on the ability of the animals to understand the meaning of the cues, it is quite concerning that one of the monkeys performed poorly, particularly in the early sessions. Notably, the disparity between the two subjects is rather large: one monkey at the start of the recordings achieved a performance that was much better than the second monkey did at the end of the recording sessions. You highlighted the differences in performance in Figure 1D and mentioned that you started recording once the animals reached 60% performance. However, this did not make sense to me as the performance of Mi even after the final day of recording did not reach the performance of Mo on the first day of recording. Thus, in contrast to Mo, Mi appeared to be not ready for the task when the recording began.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this point. However, please note that the learning performance of the monkeys concerned retraining sessions after they had had several weeks of vacation. So, even though it is correct that one of the two monkeys had a very good consolidation and started already at a relatively high level on the first retraining session, the other one also started and ended at a level above chance level (the y-axis starts at 0.5). We now highlight this point better in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- One objective of having two monkeys is to illustrate that what is true in one animal is also true in the other. In some figures, you show that the neural data are significantly different, while in others you combine them into one. Thus, are you confident that the neural data across the animals should be combined, as you have done in Figure 2? Perhaps you can use the large differences in performance as a source of variance to find meaning in the neural data.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid question; as highlighted above, we have now addressed this point in the new Supplementary Figure 2, where the data for both monkeys are presented separately. Given the sample sizes and level of variances, it is in general difficult to draw conclusions about the potential differences and contributions, but the data are sufficiently transparent to observe common trends. With regard to linking differences in the neural data to the differences in performance level, please also consider Figure 4, the new Supplementary Figure 3 (with the ramping PCA component) and new Supplementary Figure 4 (with the additional analysis of the ramping activity of DN neurons that modulated upon presentation of the C-stimulus), which suggests that the ramping stage of Mo starts before that of Mi. This difference highlights the possibility that injecting accelerations of the simple spike modulations of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar hemispheres into the complex of cerebellar nuclei may be instrumental in improving the performance of responses to covert attention, akin to what has been shown for the impact of Purkinje cells of the vestibulocerebellum on eye movement responses to vestibular stimulation (De Zeeuw et al. 1995, J Neurophysiol). This possibility is now also raised in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How do we know that these neurons, or even this region of the brain, contribute to this task? When a new task is introduced, the contributions of the region of the brain that is being studied are usually established via some form of manipulation. This question is particularly relevant here because the two subjects differed markedly in their performance, yet in Figure 3 you find that a similar percentage of neurons are responding to the various elements of the task.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question. As highlighted above, we are refraining from showing our muscimol manipulation (3 ml of 5 μg/ml muscimol, Sigma Aldrich), as it only concerns 1 successful dataset and 1 control experiment. We hope to replicate this reversible lesion experiment in the future and publish it when we have full new datasets of at least two monkeys available. As explained above, for this paper we have sacrificed both monkeys following a timed perfusion, so as to have similar survival times for the transport of the neuro-anatomical tracer involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Behavior in both animals was better when the gap direction was up/down vs. left/right. Is this difference in behavior encoded during the time that the animal is making a decision? Are the dentate neurons better at differentiating the direction of the cue when the gap direction is up/right vs. left/right?</p></disp-quote><p>These data have now been included in the new Supplementary Figure 2; we did not observe any significant differences in this respect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>- The authors trained monkeys to discriminate peripheral visual cues and associate them with planning future saccades of an indicated direction. At the same time, the authors recorded single-unit neural activity in the cerebellar dentate nucleus. They demonstrated that substantial fractions of DN cells exhibited sustained modulation of spike rates spanning task epochs and carrying information about stimulus, response, and trial outcome. Finally, tracer injections demonstrated this region of the DN projects to a large number of targets including several known to interconnect the visual attention network. The data compellingly demonstrate the authors' central claims, and the analyses are well-suited to support the conclusions. Importantly, the study demonstrates that DN cells convey many motor and nonmotor variables related to task execution, event sequencing, visual attention, and arguably decision-making/working memory.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this positive and constructive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The study is solid and I do not have major concerns, but only points for possible improvement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this positive feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A key feature of this data is the extended changes/ramps in DN output across epochs (Figure 2). Crudely, this presents a challenge for the view that DN output mainly drives motor effectors, as the saccade itself lasts only a tiny fraction of the overall task. Some discussion of this dichotomy in thinking about the function(s) of the cerebellum, vis a vis the multifarious DN targets the authors demonstrate here, etc., would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer and we have expanded our Discussion on this point, also now highlighting the outcome of the new PCA analysis recommended by Reviewer 1 (see the new Supplementary Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A high-level suggestion on the data: the presentation of the data focuses (sensibly) on the representation of the stimulus and response epochs (Figures 2-3). Yet, the authors then show that from decoding, it is, in fact, a trial outcome that is best represented in the population (Figure 4). While there is nothing 'wrong' with this, it reads slightly incongruously, and the reader does a bit of a &quot;double take&quot; back to the previous figures to see if they missed examples of the trial-outcome signals, but the previous presentations only show correct trials. Consider adding somewhere in the first 3 main figures some neural data showing comparisons with incorrect trials. This way, the reader develops prior expectations for the outcome decoding result and frame of reference for interpreting it. On a related note, the text contains an earlier introduction of this issue (p24 last sentence) and p25 paragraph 1 cites Figure 3D and 3E for signals &quot;related to the absence of reward&quot; - but the caption says this includes only correct trials?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for bringing up these points. We have addressed the textual suggestions. Moreover, we have done the PCA analysis suggested by Reviewer 1 for both the correct and incorrect trials (see Supplementary material).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- P29: The discrepancy in retrograde labeling between monkeys (2 orders of magnitude): I realize the authors can't really do anything about this, but the difference is large enough to warrant concerns in the interpretation (how did the tracer spread over the drastically larger area? Isotropically? Could it cross more &quot;hard boundaries&quot; and incorporate qualitatively different inputs/outputs?). A small discussion of possible caveats in interpreting the outcomes would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this comment. As highlighted in the text, in both monkeys we first identified the optimal points for injection in the dentate nucleus electrophysiologically and we used the same pump with the same settings to carry out the injections, but even so the differences are substantial. We suspect that the larger injection might have been caused by an air bubble trapped in the syringe or a deviation in the stock solution, but we can never be sure of that. We have added a potential explanation for the caveat that might have played a role.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- And a list of quick points:</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all points listed below; we want to thank the Reviewer for bringing them up.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P3 paragraph 2 needs comma &quot;in daily life,&quot;.</p><p>P4 paragraph 2 &quot;C-gap&quot; terminology not previously defined.</p><p>P4 paragraph 2 &quot;animals employed different behavioral strategies&quot;.
