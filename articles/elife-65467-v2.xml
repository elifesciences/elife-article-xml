ATP-powered DNA-loop-extrusion motors indispensable for organizing and faithfully segregating chromosomes. How SMC complexes translocate along DNA for loop extrusion and what happens when two complexes meet on the same DNA molecule is largely unknown. Revealing the origins and the consequences of SMC encounters is crucial for understanding the folding process not only of bacterial, but also of eukaryotic chromosomes. Here, we uncover several factors that influence bacterial chromosome organization by modulating the probability of such clashes. These factors include the number, the strength, and the distribution of Smc loading sites, the residency time on the chromosome, the translocation rate, and the cellular abundance of Smc complexes. By studying various mutants, we show that these parameters are fine-tuned to reduce the frequency of encounters between Smc complexes, presumably as a risk mitigation strategy. Mild perturbations hamper chromosome organization by causing Smc collisions, implying that the cellular capacity to resolve them is limited. Altogether, we identify mechanisms that help to avoid Smc collisions and their resolution by Smc traversal or other potentially risky molecular transactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SMC complexes</kwd><kwd>chromosome organization</kwd><kwd>chromosome condensation</kwd><kwd>DNA loop extrusion</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>ParABS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>724482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-CE12-0013-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Assocation pour la Recherche contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boccard</surname><given-names>Frederic</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacterial chromosome folding by DNA loop extrusion is here shown to rely on avoidance of SMC collisions by low SMC abundance, clustering of loading sites, efficient translocation, and rare unloading.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Members of the family of SMC proteins are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and also present in most bacteria and at least some lineages of archaea. They are crucial for establishing 3D genome organization inside cells, laying the foundation for faithful segregation, recombination, and repair of the chromosomal DNA molecules. Together with kleisin and kite subunits (or kleisin and hawk subunits), SMC proteins form ATP-hydrolyzing DNA motors that actively fold chromosomal DNA molecules apparently by DNA loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yatskevich et al., 2019</xref>). Loop extrusion can explain diverse folding phenomena across all domains of life: formation of topologically associated domains (TADs) in interphase, lengthwise compacted chromosomes during mitosis, as well as juxtaposition of the arms of bacterial chromosomes.</p><p>Recently, ATP-dependent loop extrusion has been recorded in single-molecule experiments. Purified yeast condensin and vertebrate cohesin extrude DNA loops at rates of ~1 kb/s in an asymmetric (one-sided) or symmetric (two-sided) manner, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the molecular underpinnings of loop extrusion are yet to be discovered. In the case of yeast condensin, two DNA-loop-extruding complexes on the same DNA molecule were reported to occasionally traverse one another in vitro, thus forming interlocking loops (also termed Z loops) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). In principle, the latter behavior could improve the otherwise poor loop coverage achieved by one-sided motors, but on the other hand it likely generates undesirable DNA entanglements (such as pseudoknots) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banigan et al., 2020</xref>). The biological relevance of Z-loop formation and condensin traversal is yet to be determined.</p><p>Two distinct patterns of chromosome organization have been described for bacteria. One relies on MukBEF (or MksBEF) complexes, presumably starting DNA loop extrusion from randomly chosen entry sites on the bacterial chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lioy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mäkelä and Sherratt, 2020</xref>). The second pattern occurs in most bacteria, where Smc-ScpAB complexes start DNA translocation from predefined entry sites, the 16 bp <italic>parS</italic> DNA sequences, which are generally found near the replication origin and are specifically recognized by the Smc-loader protein ParB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gruber and Errington, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lin and Grossman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Minnen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sullivan et al., 2009</xref>). ParB dimers form DNA clamps that self-load onto DNA at <italic>parS</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jalal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Osorio-Valeriano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Soh et al., 2019</xref>). As Smc complexes translocate away from the <italic>parS</italic> loading site in both directions (two-sided), they co-align the left and the right chromosome arms that flank the replication origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marbouty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Minnen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), eventually getting unloaded by XerD near the replication terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karaboja et al., 2021</xref>).

This activity might be shared with condensin in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dyson et al., 2021</xref>). The degree of defects in chromosome segregation caused by <italic>smc</italic> deletion is variable among species. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, chromosome segregation fails completely in <italic>smc</italic> mutants under nutrient-rich growth conditions but not when cells are grown with more limited nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruber et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Orlandini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Deletion of <italic>parB</italic> or removal of <italic>parS</italic> sites eliminate chromosome arm alignment, but have only a mild impact on chromosome segregation, demonstrating that chromosome arm alignment is not required for efficient chromosome segregation (and for cell viability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and implying that Smc-ScpAB can use non-<italic>parS</italic> sequences for loading in the absence of ParB/<italic>parS</italic>. For simplicity, we represent the translocating unit of Smc-ScpAB as a single ring; however, we note that other arrangements (such as a double ring) are conceivable.</p><p>SMC complexes share a characteristic elongated architecture: a globular head and a hinge domain are connected by a long intramolecular antiparallel coiled coil ‘arm’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The functioning of the complex is restricted to discreet lengths of the coiled coil, the same periodicity of which is observed across diverse species and types of SMC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bürmann et al., 2017</xref>). Two SMC proteins dimerize at the hinge and are bridged at the head domains by a kleisin subunit. This generates annular tripartite SMC-kleisin assemblies that entrap chromosomal DNA double helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilhelm et al., 2015</xref>). The kite subunit (ScpB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) also forms dimers that associate with the central region of kleisin (ScpA in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürmann et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To support the nearly complete alignment of chromosome arms, Smc complexes must keep translocating on the same DNA molecule (i.e., remain in cis) and in the same direction for extended periods of time (estimated to be in the range of 40 min in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>). This processivity is thought to rely on the stable entrapment of one or more DNA double helices by the SMC complex guaranteeing lengthy periods of time between association and dissociation events (‘chromosome residency’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilhelm et al., 2015</xref>). The extended nature of the coiled coils would nevertheless permit the SMC complex to overcome relatively big obstacles (~30 nm) without dissociating from DNA. How DNA entrapment might be compatible with the bypass of even larger obstacles on the chromosome remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brandão et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, Smc complexes loaded simultaneously at different <italic>parS</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) will translocate towards each other and eventually collide. Dedicated mechanisms (such as Smc traversal proposed for purified yeast condensin) might be necessary to resolve such encounters. On the other hand, a translocation mechanism not involving DNA entrapment by the SMC complex would readily facilitate bypassing of obstacles, but it is unclear how directionality of translocation and chromosome association might be maintained in this case.</p><p>Here, we studied the effect of Smc, ParB, and <italic>parS</italic> alterations on chromosome organization to explore how Smc-ScpAB load and translocate on a chromosome with multiple loading sites. Based on our results, we propose that Smc complexes rarely meet on the chromosome under physiological conditions. We argue that multiple parameters are fine-tuned to avoid Smc-Smc collisions in the first place. Few Smc complexes are available for loading because most Smc complexes are associated with the chromosome arms for an extended period of time. Artificially increasing the rate of encounters by mildly elevating the levels of Smc complexes in vivo, or by altering the efficiency of Smc loading, entrapment and/or translocation, leads to obvious perturbations in chromosome architecture, presumably due to unresolved Smc-Smc collisions. Also, the genomic clustering of strong <italic>parS</italic> sites seems to play a vital role in avoiding Smc collisions in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Although we cannot exclude the possibility of dedicated mechanism for the resolution of collisions per se, we suggest that an optimized Smc flux helps to eschew such events, presumably to avoid complications emerging from any attempted resolution reaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arm-modified Smc proteins fail to juxtapose chromosome arms</title><p>We previously isolated chimeric Smc proteins with elongated and shortened coiled coils that can functionally substitute for the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Smc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bürmann et al., 2017</xref>).

To address this, we performed 3C-seq analysis on cells grown in nutrient-poor medium (SMG) at 37°C, supporting growth with a generation time of ~60 min. Encounters between translocating Smc complexes and the replication fork are expected to be rare under these conditions as replication initiates only about every 60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruber et al., 2014</xref>). We found that Smc-CC425 and the other elongated variants failed to support normal chromosome organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As revealed by the absence of a secondary diagonal, the co-alignment of chromosome arms was strongly compromised. An arc of contacts on the left arm of the chromosome however was observed in wild-type and mutant 3C-seq maps (see below). A control chimeric protein with wild-type arm length (Smc-CC334 <italic>Spn</italic> hinge+CC100) showed similar growth behavior and 3C-seq maps as the resized variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Smc and Smc-CC425 complexes were both found enriched in an ~700 kb region centered on the replication origin after 20 min of ParB induction by ChIP-seq analysis using α-ScpB serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For wild-type Smc, the enriched region increased in size over time, inferring a constant DNA translocation rate of roughly 500 bp/s at 30°C. Notably, the high enrichment near <italic>parS</italic> disappeared at the later time points as Smc-ScpAB became more broadly distributed on the chromosome. The region of Smc-ScpAB enrichment also broadened in Smc-CC425 during the later time intervals, albeit with an apparently reducing rate. In addition, the origin region remained highly enriched in ScpB also at the later time points. Using 3C-seq, we observed that Smc-CC425 was able to align chromosome arms in this experimental system, yet the alignment did not extend all the way to the <italic>ter</italic> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Moreover, the onset of chromosome alignment as well as the rate of progress appeared somewhat reduced when compared to wild-type Smc. Determining a translocation rate for Smc-CC425 from the ChIP-Seq and 3C-Seq data turned out to be difficult because of the lack of a clear moving front particularly at the later time points. Moreover, the translocation rates appeared to reduce at later timer points, possibly due to increased spontaneous unloading of Smc-CC425. Regardless, these experiments demonstrate that Smc-CC425 efficiently accumulated in the replication origin region, but the translocation to distal loci on the chromosome arms was hampered.</p><p>A simple explanation for the hyper-accumulation of Smc-CC425 in the replication origin region (in the presence of a single <italic>parS</italic> site) is an increase in spontaneous unloading of translocating Smc. With shorter periods of time spent translocating along the chromosome arms, the cytoplasmic pool of Smc increases and as a consequence so does the flux of loading, which—possibly together with a reduced translocation rate—leads to artificially increased enrichment near the <italic>parS</italic> site(s). This in turn is expected to elevate the probability of Smc-Smc collisions on the chromosome when loading occurs at multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites but not when restricted to a single <italic>parS</italic> site. Such collisions would further exacerbate the Smc hyper-enrichment by hindering Smc translocation away from <italic>parS</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right panel). A reduced chromosome residency time and a reduced translocation rate may thus explain all phenotypic consequences of the Smc arm-modifications.

While all other scenarios seemed plausible and may contribute to the process of chromosome organization, one scenario, the avoidance of encounters by infrequent loading, provided an explanation for the defects observed with Smc-CC425 without making additional assumptions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Increasing the pool of Smc hampers chromosome organization</title><p>If Smc-CC425 indeed fails to juxtapose chromosome arms due to an increased flux in the replication origin region, collisions may be rare in wild-type cells because of a high chromosome residency time and a limited pool of soluble Smc complexes, resulting in a low flux of Smc onto the chromosome. If so, artificially increasing the flux of Smc should lead to defects in chromosome organization with multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites but not with a single <italic>parS</italic> site (as observed for Smc-CC425 under normal expression levels) (assuming that most Smc is loaded at <italic>parS</italic>). If Smc complexes, however, were to efficiently traverse, reverse, or unload one another, then increased Smc levels would not result in defective translocation and chromosome organization.</p><p>To test this prediction, we first slightly increased the cellular level of all subunits of the Smc complex by inserting an additional copy of the <italic>smc</italic> gene and of the <italic>scpAB</italic> operon under the control of their respective endogenous promoters into the genome. The increased levels of Smc-ScpAB did not noticeably affect cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Immunoblotting suggested a four- to fivefold increase in Smc and ScpB protein levels in the SMC<sup>high</sup> strain when compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we performed 3C-seq analysis. Chromosome arm co-alignment was strongly hampered—rather than improved—by the presence of extra Smc complexes in the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A prominent arc was formed at the position of the <sup>–304kb</sup><italic>parS</italic> site, and the secondary diagonal originating in the origin region was weak and diffuse in the SMC<sup>high</sup> strain. This defect was fully restored, however, by removal of seven <italic>parS</italic> sites (with the remaining strong site being either <sup>–9kb</sup><italic>parS</italic><sub>opt</sub> or <sup>–304kb</sup><italic>parS</italic><sub>opt</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Note that an additional feature (a minor secondary diagonal) present on the right arm of the chromosome likely originated from Smc loading at the weak <sup>+1058kb</sup><italic>parS</italic> site. The presence of two strong <italic>parS</italic> sites (<sup>–9kb</sup><italic>parS</italic><sub>opt</sub> and <sup>–304kb</sup><italic>parS</italic><sub>opt</sub>) led to a new pattern of chromosome folding in the SMC<sup>high</sup> strain. The alignment of DNA flanking the <italic>parS</italic> sites became highly asymmetric, presumably because Smc complexes loaded at opposite <italic>parS</italic> sites hinder each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, the contacts corresponding to paired loops became clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Finally, contacts outside the <italic>parS</italic>-demarcated region were rare and spread out, and their center was shifted away from the <italic>parS</italic> sites. The former indicated that only a few Smc complexes loaded at one <italic>parS</italic> site managed to move beyond the other <italic>parS</italic> site. And if they did, they experienced a strongly reduced translocation rate when moving from <italic>parS</italic> site to the other, presumably due to encounters with and temporary (or partial) blockage by Smc complexes translocating in opposite orientation. Importantly, the hindrance observed with two or all <italic>parS</italic> sites being present was not relieved by treatment with rif, being consistent with the notion that Smc-Smc encounters rather than Smc-RNA polymerase encounters are mainly responsible for the impediment of translocation in SMC<sup>high</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Increasing the cellular pool of Smc hampers chromosome organization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoblotting using α-Smc (top panel) and α-ScpB serum (bottom panel).

SMC complexes translocate along an unusually flexible, congested and entangled translocation track, that is, the ‘chromatinized’ DNA double helix. The architecture of SMC complexes—one of a kind amongst the collection of molecular motors—is likely a reflection of a unique translocation mechanism. To support the folding of Mb-sized regions of the chromosome, Smc complexes need to keep translocating on the same DNA double helix from initial loading to unloading (a process lasting several tens of minutes in bacteria). Assuming a topological SMC-DNA association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gligoris et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilhelm et al., 2015</xref>), staying on the translocation track in cis is guaranteed as long as the SMC-kleisin ring remains closed, thus preventing the release of DNA.</p><p>During translocation, SMC complexes must frequently overcome obstacles on the DNA to translocate fast and far, and to globally organize the chromosome. RNA polymerase is a known obstacle for Smc-ScpAB in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. It is highly abundant in the replication origin region due to the clustering of highly transcribed genes. Inhibition of RNA polymerase by the chemical inhibitor rif indeed partially relieved the impediment of DNA translocation by Smc. However, defects with SMC<sup>high</sup> in particular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) persisted in the presence of rif implying that other obstacles exist. Very large obstructions (&gt;30 nm) could not be overcome while keeping DNA entrapped within the Smc ring but would need to be traversed by dissociating from the translocation track transiently. Such obstacles might include branched DNA structures and protein-mediated DNA junctions (i.e., crossings in the translocation track) as well as other SMC complexes located at the base of a DNA loop.</p><p>Traversal and bypassing are not risk-free strategies. When transiently disconnecting from DNA, the complex risks losing directional translocation by wrongly reconnecting with the same DNA double helix or even establishes an unwanted trans-DNA linkage by connecting with a different DNA double helix. Any straying onto the sister DNA molecule (going in trans) would not only defeat the purpose of DNA loop extrusion but actually actively hinder chromosome segregation. Here, we addressed the balance between avoiding and resolving Smc collisions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Avoiding Smc encounters</title><p>In our study, we show that impacts from collisions are barely noticeable in wild-type cells. Under physiological conditions, collisions between Smc-ScpAB complexes are kept at a tolerable level by a low cellular abundance of Smc-ScpAB ~30 Smc dimers per chromosome or less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilhelm et al., 2015</xref>), a high DNA translocation rate, an extended time of residency on the chromosome arms, and the preferential usage of a cluster of <italic>parS</italic> sites (spanning ~60 kb region of the genome: <sup>–68kb</sup><italic>parS</italic>, <sup>–63kb</sup><italic>parS</italic>, <sup>–49kb</sup><italic>parS</italic>, <sup>–9kb</sup><italic>parS</italic>). Thus, multiple parameters are fine-tuned to avoid Smc encounters, possibly rendering the resolution of Smc collisions unnecessary. Occasional loading of Smc at one of the more distal <italic>parS</italic> sites however would quite often lead to collisions, thus resulting in contact maps with an arc-shaped pattern, such as observed for <sup>–304kb</sup><italic>parS</italic> (the strongest of the distal <italic>parS</italic> sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandão et al., 2020</xref>). When strong <italic>parS</italic> sites are artificially moved further away from each other, then impacts from collisions also become noticeable with wild-type Smc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>The obvious defects in chromosome organization observed with altered <italic>parS</italic> positioning, elevated Smc levels, or engineered Smc proteins, however, do not substantially impact bacterial growth, suggesting that chromosome segregation is efficiently supported even with Smc collisions (and without chromosome arm alignment being detectable by population-averaging 3C methodology). Colliding Smc complexes might thus efficiently promote DNA disentanglement locally (with the help of DNA topoisomerases) but hamper the global chromosome folding process, possibly leading to large cell-to-cell variations in chromosome organization with likely knock-on effects on other cellular processes including nucleoid occlusion and cell division.</p><p>The presence of multiple types of SMC complexes acting on the same chromosome likely aggravates the issue of collisions. In <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, the impact of collisions seems to be dealt with by a hierarchy amongst two endogenous SMC complexes and a coordination of SMC activity with chromosome replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lioy et al., 2020</xref>). Smc-ScpAB appears to limit the loop extrusion activity of MksBEF but not vice versa. When the heterologous <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MukBEF complex was introduced in place of MksBEF, it blocked the activity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> Smc-ScpAB but not the other way around. The hierarchy is possibly given by the relative abundance of these complexes and differing chromosome association dynamics (residency times).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Resolving Smc encounters?</title><p>The parsimonious explanation for our observations—not requiring the involvement of dedicated and potentially hazardous molecular transactions—is that neither wild-type nor modified Smc proteins are able to traverse one another. A recent study describing Smc action in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> by simulations, however, suggested that Smc traversal is needed to accurately recapitulate the relative abundance of long-range contacts observed with natural and artificial arrangements of <italic>parS</italic> sites (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brandão et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, the authors explained the patterns of DNA contact distribution on the basis of estimated or fitted values for Smc abundance (&lt;40 per chromosome), Smc translocation rate (~1 kb/s), Smc-Smc blockage, Smc unloading (~0.0033 s<sup>−1</sup>), and Smc traversal (~0.05 s<sup>−1</sup>). While these simulations have apparently successfully predicted changes in contact patterns upon alterations in Smc abundance, we believe that they are not fully conclusive due to substantial uncertainties concerning the involved parameters and the possible existence of unexplored alternative scenarios (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Furthermore, direct observation of Smc traversal and of interlocking DNA loops (Z loops) on the bacterial chromosome is lacking. Also, a basic understanding of the necessary molecular transactions is elusive.</p><p>Nevertheless, the idea of Smc traversal is an intriguing proposition with potentially wide implications warranting serious consideration. A putative defect in traversal might contribute to the hyper-accumulation of Smc-CC425 in the replication origin region and the defective chromosome organization with multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites. Assuming the validity of Smc traversal, it is tempting to speculate—on the basis of the observations with Smc-CC425—that the nature and the integrity of the Smc hinge domain and the adjacent coiled coil are critical for the putative bypassing step. How Smc traversal might occur without the risk of establishing unwanted (‘trans’) DNA linkages yet is totally unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites on the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> chromosome</title><p>The presence of multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites likely improves the robustness of the chromosome segregation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Böhm et al., 2020</xref>).

Severe consequences of manipulating <italic>parS</italic> distribution include a longer generation time (when <italic>mksBEF</italic> is missing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lagage et al., 2016</xref>), an increased number of anucleate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Böhm et al., 2020</xref>) and elongated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tran et al., 2017</xref>). Some of these defects might be related to altered Smc function. In <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, Smc translocates only ~600 kb away from <italic>parS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tran et al., 2017</xref>). The partial chromosome arm alignment in <italic>C. crescentus</italic> is reminiscent of the observation with modified Smc proteins in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. It is tempting to speculate that a shorter chromosome residency time or a lower translocation rate of Smc-ScpAB is acceptable when <italic>parS</italic> sites are tightly clustered or when combined with a single <italic>parS</italic> site. Nevertheless, some bacterial genomes harbor multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites that are quite widely scattered on the genome. From the point of view of collision avoidance, this seems counterproductive. Intriguingly, the scattered <italic>parS</italic> distribution is restricted to few lineages on the phylogenetic tree of bacteria, including Bacilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Livny et al., 2007</xref>). The scattering of <italic>parS</italic> sites likely serves a dedicated purpose in the lifestyles of these bacteria, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> possibly during sporulation when large chunks of the genome (~1 Mb, i.e., about a quarter of the genome) are captured at the cell pole to promote entrapment of the chromosome in the pre-spore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu and Errington, 1998</xref>). This process might benefit from the condensation of the replication origin (possibly involving Smc collisions as observed here) rather than an alignment of chromosome arms. Consistent with this notion, chromosome arm alignment is lost when DNA replication is artificially blocked (as naturally occurring during sporulation) and replaced by smaller loops formed at individual <italic>parS</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marbouty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

After sorting and merging both mates, the reads of mapping quality &gt;30 were filtered out and assigned to a restriction fragment. Uninformative events like recircularization on itself (loops), uncut fragments, and re-ligations in original orientation were discarded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cournac et al., 2012</xref>) and only pairs of reads corresponding to long-range interactions were used for generation of contact maps (between 5 and 8% of all reads). The bin size used is 10 kb. Next, contact maps were normalized through the sequential component normalization procedure (SCN, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cournac et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequent visualization was done using MATLAB (R2019b). To facilitate visualization of the contact matrices, first we applied to the SCN matrices the log<sub>10</sub> and then a Gaussian filter (H = 1) to smooth the image. The scale bar next to the maps represents the contact frequencies in log<sub>10</sub>—the darker the color, the higher the frequency of contacts between given loci.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Expression analysis of HaloTagged proteins</title><p>Cells were cultured at 37°C in 200 ml SMG to exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.022–0.030) and harvested by filtration. Next, they were washed in cold PBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) glycerol (‘PBSG’) and split into aliquots of a biomass equivalent to 1.25 OD<sub>600</sub> units. Cells were centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 g, resuspended in 40 μl PBSG containing 75 U/ml ReadyLyse Lysozyme, 750 U/ml Sm nuclease, 5 μM HaloTag TMR Substrate and protease inhibitor cocktail (‘PIC’) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min to facilitate lysis. After lysis, 10 μl of 4× LDS-PAGE with DTT (200 mM final) buffer was added, samples were incubated for 5 min at 95°C, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were imaged on an Amersham Typhoon scanner with Cy3 DIGE filter setup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Chromosome co-entrapment assay</title><p>Microbead entrapment followed the developments reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Vazquez Nunez et al., 2019</xref>. Cells containing the Smc alleles with cysteines at the desired positions were inoculated in SMG medium to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.004 and grown to mid-exponential phase (OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.02) at 37°C. Cells were mixed with ice for rapid cooling and harvested by filtration. A cell mass equivalent of OD<sub>600</sub> units of 3.75 was resuspended in 121 µl PBSG and incubated with a final concentration of 1 mM BMOE for 10 min. Reactions were quenched by the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 32.6 mM. 45 μl of cross-linked cells were retained as ‘Input’ sample. 1 µl of PIC and 9 µl Dynabeads Protein G were added to 90 μl of the remaining cell fraction. Samples for entrapment were mixed with 100 μl 2% low-melt agarose at a temperature of 45°C before being mixed rapidly with 700 μl mineral oil. Resulting Agarose microbeads were washed once in 1 ml RT PBSG by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. Beads were subsequently resuspended in 300 μl PBSG and mixed with EDTA pH 8 (1 mM final), 5 μl PIC, Halo TMR ligand (5 μM final), as well as ReadyLyse lysozyme to a final concentration of 40 U/μlL. Input samples were mixed with 5 μlL of a master mix containing 0.9 μl PBSG, 0.5 μl PIC, 2.5 μlL 1:100 Benzonase, 0.5 μl Halo TMR ligand, as well as 0.6 μlL of a 1:10 dilution of ReadyLyse lysozyme. Input as well as Entrapment samples were incubated for 25 min at 37°. All subsequent steps were undertaken to protect from light as much as possible. Input samples were mixed with 50 μl 2× LDS loading dye. Entrapment samples were washed twice with 1 ml PBSG by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm, 1 min, RT. Microbeads were then washed three times in TES under gentle (500 rpm) shaking, first for 1 hr with two subsequent washing steps for 30 min each. Preparations were resuspended in 1 ml TES and incubated on a rolling incubator overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, the beads were washed twice with 1 ml PBS before being resuspended in 100 μl PBS. 5 μl Benzonase were added (750 U/ml final concentration), and samples were incubated at 37°C under light shaking for 1 hr. To free the preparations from agarose, the samples were first heated to 70°C for 1 min before incubating on ice for 5 min. Agarose was removed from the sample content by centrifugation, first with 21,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min, then with 14,000 rpm at RT for 5 min. Supernatant liquid was transferred to spin columns and centrifuged for 1 min, 10,000 rpm, ambient temperature. The resulting solution was brought to 1 ml total volume with water and mixed to final concentrations of 33 mg/ml BSA and 0.02% (w/v) deoxycholate before resting on ice for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 8.8% preceding a 1 hr incubation on ice. Precipitated protein was spun down (21,000 rpm, 4°C, 15 min), resuspended in 10 μl 1× LDS loading dye and brought to neutral pH by μl-wise addition of 1 M Tris solution. 5 μl of input material and all of the ‘eluate’ samples were loaded on Tris-acetate gels and run at 35 mA. Gels were scanned using Amersham Typhoon Imager with the Cy5 filter settings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Hugo Brandao, Leonid Mirny, and Xindan Wang for sharing unpublished data and comments on the manuscript.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This manuscript presents intriguing data to support the notion that <italic>B. subtilis</italic> cells have tuned a variety of parameters related to SMC loading and translocation to ensure that individual complexes do not collide. This is likely an important but poorly understood aspect of condensins/SMCs, and as such represents a valuable contribution to the field and should be of interest to a broad set of readers.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fine-tuning of the Smc flux facilitates chromosome organization in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Michael Laub, and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Although the reviewers were generally enthusiastic, there were some concerns raised. The full set of concerns/issues is appended below and the authors should respond to each item in a revised document. Immediately below is a summary of the 5 major issues – the first two include additional experiments that the reviewers collectively decided would be needed for a revision.</p><p>1) The authors need to include a quantification of SMC (and SMC variant) levels, including an assessment by chromatin fractionation of the quantity free in solution versus chromosome-associated. There are also several cases of quantification of Hi-C data that are needed.</p><p>2) Additional experiments are needed to help address the relative contributions of SMC-RNAP and SMC-SMC collisions. In particular, the reviewers agreed that the authors should examine the effects of adding rifampicin on WT-SMC and SMC-CC425 with all parS, parS-9 kb, and two parS (e.g. parS-9 kb and parS-304 kb). The results in Figure 4 with higher levels of WT-SMC could also potentially benefit from the addition of a +rif experiment, though this was deemed lower priority.</p><p>3) In some cases, conclusions about the actions of SMC in individual cells are being made based on Hi-C data that intrinsically average the behavior of SMC in large populations of cells. This fact should be more carefully taken into account when interpreting and discussing the data presented.</p><p>4) In general, the authors should, in light of the comments from the reviewers ensure that the conclusions they draw take into account the full set of possible models that explain their results, not just the favored model. In other words, if alternative models cannot be fully ruled out in some cases, please make that explicit in the text and tone down conclusions accordingly.</p><p>5) Finally, although not noted in the reviews, the discussion among the reviewers led to the suggestion that the paper should better discuss the simulations in the pre-print from Wang and Mirny, which is cursorily discussed in the current version of the manuscript at hand.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The data generally support the conclusions.</p><p>I would like to see inclusion of some chromatin fractionation experiments to directly address the quantity of Condensin in free versus chromosome-associated states – many of the authors conclusions would be strengthened by inclusion of these data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Below I list out a few other suggestions/concerns for the authors to consider:</p><p>1. Figure 3B: the insertion of two equally strong parS sites on an otherwise parS-less background showed reduced loop formation/arm alignment. This can be attributed to SMC collision or that the total pool of the SMC loader (ParB) is being shared equally between the two parS sites, leading to fewer SMC available to travel from each site. Can the authors rule out the later possibility? I think this is an important point since the accumulation of SMC in the interval between the 2 parS sites (as seen by a population-averaged method such as ChIP-seq, Figure 3C or so) does not necessarily mean that SMCs collide there.</p><p>2. ParB can slide at a short distance but might bridge over a longer distance, should the authors consider the possibility that the very weak Hi-C interactions (orange box, Figure 3B ) is due to the bridging of ParB-DNA from the two distal sites</p><p>3. How did the authors distinguish experimentally between SMC loading rate and SMC unloading rate? For example, lines 196-199: &quot;..indicating that the modified SMC coiled coil impede DNA translocation and/or increased the rate of unloading&quot;. Why an increase in unloading rate? The proposed increase in unloading rate for the arm-modified SMC-CC425 is very counter-intuitive to me when I looked into the magnified ChIP-seq profiles (Figure 2A). Figure 2A (left panel, WT SMC): parS-9kb does not align with the summit of the highest ChIP-seq peak. That is probably due to SMC unloading/escaping from the loading site parS. However, in Figure 2A (right panel, SMC-CC425), parS-9kb aligns perfectly with the summit of the highest ChIP-seq peak. Naively, that suggests to me that SMC-CC425 has a problem either (i) unloading less from parS (rather than more as proposed) or (ii) SMC-CC425 somehow being held on more tightly by the loader ParB. Could the authors clarify this, please?</p><p>4. Is this possible, given available data, to speculate on why there is no major arm-alignment in an all-parS + SMC-CC425 strain (Figure 1B)? Is that because of too many collisions in the main parS cluster that cannot be resolved by a defective SMC-CC425, leading to unproductive loop formation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Improvements on the presentation of previous models and results from the literature:</p><p>– Is there direct evidence that bacterial condensins also work by loop extrusion? This is not clear to me and is an important assumption of the authors.</p><p>– &quot;Smc-ScpAB complexes start DNA translocation from predefined entry sites&quot;. The manuscript cites Gruber and Errington and Sullivan (2009) but did these studies show that SMC-ScpAB translocate on DNA?</p><p>– Citations of ParB binding specifically at <italic>parS</italic> should rather acknowledge the original papers describing this, as it is unimportant whether ParB forms a clamp or not.</p><p>– The first to describe condensin-dependent co-alignment of chromosome arms in Bacillus were the papers of Wang et al. (2015) and Marbouty et al. (2015). These should be cited for this instead of: Minnen et al., 2016;Tran et al. 2017; Wang et al., 2017.</p><p>– The authors seem to assume in the introduction that Bs SMCs translocates by a two-sided mechanism. But has this been demonstrated?</p><p>– Removal of parS/ParB in Bs does have an impact in chromosome conformation and segregation, as shown by Wang et al. (2014). Thus, I would be careful with conclusion that arm-alignment is not required for efficient translocation.</p><p>– Wang 2015, and Marbouty 2015 both showed that a single parS site display arm alignment. The authors cite only Wang 2017.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65467.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors need to include a quantification of SMC (and SMC variant) levels, including an assessment by chromatin fractionation of the quantity free in solution versus chromosome-associated. There are also several cases of quantification of Hi-C data that are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed additional experiments to estimate the levels of Smc and Smc-CC425 in cell extracts and on the chromosome. Briefly, Western blotting indicated that Smc-CC425 might be less abundant than Smc, however, we believe this might be due to poor blotting (of the larger Smc-CC425 protein) or poor recognition of the chimeric Smc-CC425 protein. Consistent with this notion, we found that a HaloTagged version of the protein exhibited nearly identical signal by in-gel fluorescence detection as wild-type Smc-HaloTag protein (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We have also estimated the chromosomal levels of these proteins by the chromosome entrapment assay. The input fractions showed similar levels of cross-linked species, demonstrating that Smc-CC425 assembles normal Smc-ScpAB complexes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The eluate fractions showed only slightly reduced signals for Smc-CC425 when compared to wild-type Smc, being consistent with the notion of a mildly reduced chromosome residency time of Smc-CC425 and suggesting that defects in arm alignment in strains with multiple <italic>parS</italic> do not originate from an aberrant failure of loading or entrapping DNA by Smc-CC425.</p><p>We also provide quantifications of 3C-seq data, showing that the extent of arm alignment is reduced in all Smc-CCxxx proteins (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). However, we had difficulties in obtaining trustworthy estimates for the velocity of DNA translocation by Smc-CC425 (from ChIP-seq analyses or by alignment of chromosome arms). We think this is due to elevated spontaneous unloading of Smc-CC425 and thus reduced levels of Smc-CC425 particularly further away from the loading sites. The apparent velocity is thus not reduced at later time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Additional experiments are needed to help address the relative contributions of SMC-RNAP and SMC-SMC collisions. In particular, the reviewers agreed that the authors should examine the effects of adding rifampicin on WT-SMC and SMC-CC425 with all parS, parS-9 kb, and two parS (e.g. parS-9 kb and parS-304 kb). The results in Figure 4 with higher levels of WT-SMC could also potentially benefit from the addition of a +rif experiment, though this was deemed lower priority.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated key experiments in the presence of the transcription elongation inhibitor rifampicin (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2; Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The results indicate that blockage by transcription indeed contributes to the defects in chromosome organization observed in Smc-CC425. Addition of rifampicin largely eliminates the contact arc formed at <sup>-304kb</sup>parS and leads to a notable but faint secondary diagonal in Smc-CC425. In contrast, in SMC<sup>high</sup> cells, contacts formed from <sup>-304kb</sup>parS are still highly asymmetrical, indicating that Smc-Smc collisions are largely responsible for hindrance of Smc translocation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In some cases, conclusions about the actions of SMC in individual cells are being made based on Hi-C data that intrinsically average the behavior of SMC in large populations of cells.

We find that cellular and chromosomal levels are roughly comparable (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Below I list out a few other suggestions/concerns for the authors to consider:</p><p>1.

We have added the following statement to the Results section: ‘However, we cannot rule out that this effect is mainly caused by competition between the two <italic>parS</italic> sites for Smc loading.’ (Please note that the quality of these maps has been improved by additional DNA sequencing).</p><p>Several findings indicate that ParB levels at <italic>parS</italic> are not rate-limiting for Smc loading. For example, if ParB-parS clusters were limiting Smc loading, then in SMC<sup>high</sup> one would expect a similar outcome as with wild-type Smc levels. In a recent preprint (Antar et al., 2021) we also showed that Smc is efficiently recruited by limited amounts of (a mutant of) ParB. ParB sharing by multiple <italic>parS</italic> sites thus does not seem to be a limiting factor for Smc loading and function (translocation/ arm alignment). Moreover, we do not see how a reduction in loading at one <italic>parS</italic> site would lead to increased levels between the two <italic>parS</italic> sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. ParB can slide at a short distance but might bridge over a longer distance, should the authors consider the possibility that the very weak Hi-C interactions (orange box, Figure 3B ) is due to the bridging of ParB-DNA from the two distal sites</p></disp-quote><p>ParB has indeed been suggested to organize DNA by DNA bridging in the vicinity of <italic>parS</italic>. However, ParB occupancy of <italic>parS</italic> flanking DNA is limited to tens of kb. Here, we observed longer-distance (&gt;100 kb) interactions that seem to be out of the range of ParB-mediated DNA contacts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

For example, lines 196-199: &quot;..indicating that the modified SMC coiled coil impede DNA translocation and/or increased the rate of unloading&quot;. Why an increase in unloading rate?

Could the authors clarify this, please?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not been able to directly measure Smc loading and unloading rates. However, the newly added chromosome co-entrapment assay indicates that Smc-CC425 is loaded slightly less well onto the chromosome than wild-type Smc rather than better. This supports our initial interpretation.</p><p>Given the finite number of Smc complexes in the cell (Wilhelm et al., 2015) and the expected high residency time of the complexes on the chromosome (Banigan et al., 2019), we see that the initial high enrichment near the replication origin in t<sub>20</sub> after ParB repletion is promptly followed by a reduction, suggesting that most complexes are now associated with the chromosome and are not available for loading (Figure 2C). Most of them will only become available again for re-loading after dissociating from the chromosome near <italic>ter</italic> (Karaboja et al., 2021). In case of Smc-CC425, the complexes remain enriched in the replication origin region. Since the velocity of Smc-CC425 and its entrapment capacity appear only partially affected compared to wt Smc, it implies that the Smc-CC425 enrichment in the origin region is most likely due to spontaneous unloading during translocation and reloading in the origin region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is this possible, given available data, to speculate on why there is no major arm-alignment in an all-parS + SMC-CC425 strain (Figure 1B)? Is that because of too many collisions in the main parS cluster that cannot be resolved by a defective SMC-CC425, leading to unproductive loop formation?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, based on our experiments, we suggest that an increased flux of Smc-CC425 loading onto the chromosome at the cluster of main <italic>parS</italic> sites (parS-354, 355, 356 and 359) (and a possibly reduced translocation rate) lead to frequent Smc collisions and unproductive loop formation. Conversely, Smc loading at <sup>—304kb</sup>parS site, due to its more remote position, has a particularly high chance of forming a noticeable DNA loop before encountering another Smc acting upon a different parS site/sites.</p><p>To underscore this point, we have added following statement to the relevant section of results:</p><p>“We suggest that hyper-enrichment of Smc-CC425 leads to frequent collisions and unproductive loop formation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Improvements on the presentation of previous models and results from the literature:</p><p>– Is there direct evidence that bacterial condensins also work by loop extrusion? This is not clear to me and is an important assumption of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Bacterial Smc-ScpAB complexes are known to be loaded at parS sites and then translocate bidirectionally away from parS. This process is equivalent to the process of DNA loop extrusion in eukaryotes (albeit with predefined loading rather than stalling sites). To highlight the equivalence of the SMC processes in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, we find it useful to use the same term to describe SMC activity also in bacteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Smc-ScpAB complexes start DNA translocation from predefined entry sites&quot;.
