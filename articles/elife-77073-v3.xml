activities; hence, their genomes are constantly exposed to an onslaught of genotoxic agents and processes. Branched DNA intermediates generated during replication and recombinational repair pose genomic threats if left unresolved, and so they must be eliminated by structure-selective endonucleases to preserve the integrity of these DNA transactions for the faithful duplication and propagation of genetic information. To investigate the role of two such enzymes, GEN1 and MUS81, in B cell biology, we established B-cell conditional knockout mouse models and found that deletion of GEN1 and MUS81 in early B-cell precursors abrogates the development and maturation of B-lineage cells while the loss of these enzymes in mature B cells inhibits the generation of robust germinal centers. Upon activation, these double-null mature B lymphocytes fail to proliferate and survive while exhibiting transcriptional signatures of p53 signaling, apoptosis, and type I interferon response. Metaphase spreads of these endonuclease-deficient cells show severe and diverse chromosomal abnormalities, including a preponderance of chromosome breaks, consistent with a defect in resolving recombination intermediates. These observations underscore the pivotal roles of GEN1 and MUS81 in safeguarding the genome to ensure the proper development and proliferation of B lymphocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B lymphocytes comprise the humoral arm of the adaptive immune system. They undergo a well-orchestrated series of clonal expansion and differentiation programs in the bone marrow (BM) to become mature B cells that reside in secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">LeBien and Tedder, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pieper et al., 2013</xref>). During an adaptive immune response, B cells are recruited into the germinal center (GC) where they adopt one of two cellular fates before exiting the GC: memory B cells that confer immunological memory and plasma cells that produce antibodies of high affinity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mesin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Victora and Nussenzweig, 2022</xref>). B lymphocytes are unique among other immune cells in that they initiate programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) both as developing precursors in the BM and as GC B cells in the secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2013</xref>). V(D)J recombination generates a primary repertoire of B cell receptors that can be further diversified when GC B cells employ the DNA-modifying enzyme activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) to instigate the formation of DSBs in the immunoglobulin heavy loci (IgH) for class-switch recombination and to somatically hypermutate the variable regions of the immunoglobulin loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). To outcompete other clonal cells and be selected for survival and differentiation, GC B cells not only are required to express the correct antigen-specific receptor of high affinity and specificity, but they must also satisfy the formidable replicative, transcriptional, and metabolic demands for clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Young and Brink, 2021</xref>). These cellular activities pose significant collateral genotoxic hazards to GC B cells; therefore, safeguarding the cells’ genomic integrity is paramount for accurate duplication and propagation of genetic information.</p><p>Impediments to the progression of the replication fork—termed replication stress—represent a significant endogenous source of DSBs in proliferating cells, producing up to 50 DSBs per cell cycle in a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mehta and Haber, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). Factors that impair the functionality of the replication machinery include repetitive sequences, secondary structures (such as R-loops and G-quadruplexes), transcription-replication conflicts, lesions such as thymidine dimers and single-stranded breaks, oxidative stress, and imbalance or depletion of the nucleotide pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). To ensure completion of DNA synthesis before mitosis commences, replication forks that have stalled or collapsed can be restarted via recombination-dependent or -independent pathways, the choice of which is contingent upon the nature of the replication barrier, the duration of stalling, the nature of the intermediates generated after fork stalling, and the type of processing these intermediates undergo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petermann and Helleday, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). Though primarily studied in the context of DSB repair, proteins involved in homologous recombination (HR) including BRCA2 and RAD51 are also critical for the protection, remodeling, and recombination-dependent restart of replication forks, highlighting the necessity of HR in mitigating replication stress and assisting the timely completion of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ait Saada et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr and Lambert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Scully et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recombination-dependent repair of DSBs and restart of replication forks entail strand invasion and homology search of an intact duplex DNA, generating a nascent joint intermediate termed the displacement loop (D-loop) that culminates in the formation of Holliday junctions (HJs) that physically link the two sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falquet and Rass, 2019</xref>). Several mechanisms have evolved to process these intermediates, as failure to eliminate them prohibits chromosomal segregation during mitosis, interfering with the faithful transmission of genetic material to the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">West and Chan, 2017</xref>). The BLM-TOP3A-RMI1-RMI2 (BTR) complex dissolves double HJs to generate non-crossover products while structure-selective endonucleases (SSEs) such as the SLX1-SLX4, MUS81-EME1, and XPF-ERCC1 (SMX) trinuclease complex and GEN1 resolve single and double HJs to generate both crossover and non-crossover products, depending on the position of the nicks introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blanco and Matos, 2015</xref>). Due to their in vitro 3′-flap endonuclease activity and the formation of 3′ flaps during synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), MUS81 complexes may also participate in the resolution of non-HJ-mediated recombination by cleaving such overhangs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hollingsworth and Brill, 2004</xref>). Moreover, <italic>mus81</italic> and <italic>yen1</italic> in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> can process D-loops to influence the pathway choice and outcome of HR-mediated DSB repair as the absence of these enzymes promote break-induced replication (BIR) instead of SDSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2010</xref>). Because these SSEs are active against a broad spectrum of branched DNA structures, they are subjected to multiple cell cycle-dependent regulatory mechanisms so that replication can proceed without interference and that toxic recombination outcomes due to uncontrolled cleavage are minimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wild and Matos, 2016</xref>). Although the deletion of BLM itself causes embryonic lethality in mice, individual loss of GEN1 or MUS81 does not confer a strong DNA repair-deficient phenotype in unperturbed cells, implying some degree of functional overlap between the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McDaniel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarbajna et al., 2014</xref>). Only when GEN1 and MUS81 are both absent is the genomic integrity of the cells severely subverted, resulting in aberrant mitotic structures including bulky chromatin bridges and ultrafine anaphase bridges (UFBs) that lead to compromised viability, gross chromosomal mis-segregation and abnormalities, multinucleation, and heightened formation of micronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan and West, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Garner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarbajna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sarlós et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wechsler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">West et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Besides removing HR intermediates arising from recombinational DNA transactions, both SSEs process persistent replication intermediates to promote the completion of genome replication and sister chromatid disentanglement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Falquet and Rass, 2019</xref>). MUS81 complexes can cleave replication forks, structures resembling intact HJs such as four-way reversed forks, and D-loops to initiate and regulate BIR as a mechanism to repair dysfunctional forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanada et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hua et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kikuchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pepe and West, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pepe and West, 2014b</xref>). MUS81 is also essential for the ‘expression’ of common fragile sites (CFSs)—sites that are prone to under-replication during stressed conditions—by cleaving stalled replication forks to enable POLD3-mediated mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debatisse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Minocherhomji et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Naim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ying et al., 2013</xref>). Generation of DSBs via MUS81-dependent cleavage of stalled replication forks, however, is not a prerequisite for HR-dependent replication restart as the uncoupling of the DNA strands at collapsed forks generates ssDNA that can invade and re-initiate DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lambert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rass, 2013</xref>). Though GEN1 has been implicated in maintaining replication fork progression alongside MUS81 and in eliminating persistent replication intermediates in Dna2 helicase-defective yeast cells to potentially facilitate MiDAS, its importance in rectifying replication stress and DNA under-replication in a genetically intact background remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ölmezer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarbajna et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The role of GEN1 and MUS81 in replication-challenged in vitro settings employing ionizing irradiation, DNA-damaging chemicals, and replication inhibitors is well established. Less is known, however, of these enzymes’ importance in an unperturbed in vivo context as the use of such genotoxic agents may not accurately reproduce the nature and composition of various DNA lesions generated during cellular proliferation. Because B cells face an elevated risk of cell death and oncogenic transformation due to the high level of replication stress and DSBs inflicted on their genome by AID-dependent and -independent activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>), we asked whether B cells require GEN1 and MUS81 to develop, survive, and perform their immunological functions. By employing different stage-specific Cre strains and a global <italic>Gen1</italic>-knockout mouse carrying floxed <italic>Mus81</italic> alleles, we report that the loss of both <italic>Gen1</italic> and <italic>Mus81</italic> in early pro-B cells severely impaired B cell development whereas double-null mature B cells failed to form competent GCs at steady-state and after immunization. Ex vivo characterization of the endonuclease-knockout cells uncovered a proliferation block caused by G2/M arrest, potent activation of p53 and apoptotic pathways, induction of type I interferon (IFN) response, and widespread chromosomal aberrations. Our findings support the notion that the function of GEN1 and MUS81 in highly proliferative somatic cells such as B cells is in eliminating replication- and recombination-born junction and branched DNA molecules ranging from stalled and reversed replication forks to D-loops and dHJs to maintain replication and genomic fidelity, ensure proper chromosome segregation, and avert mitotic catastrophe.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GEN1 and MUS81 are critical to normal B cell lymphopoiesis</title><p>We analyzed a publicly accessible RNA-seq data set (GSE72018) to ascertain the expression pattern of <italic>Gen1</italic> and <italic>Mus81</italic> in various developing and mature B cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brazão et al., 2016</xref>).

To examine the genome-stabilizing role of GEN1 and MUS81 at various stages of B cell development, we established a <italic>Gen1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mouse model and utilized early and late B-cell-specific Cre drivers for the conditional deletion of MUS81. Inactivation of both enzymes in early B cell precursors abolished the production of mature B cells in the BM and periphery, whereas ablation in mature, naïve B cells impaired GC formation in response to antigenic stimulation. Ex vivo cellular and transcriptomics analyses revealed that these endonuclease-deficient B cells exhibited significant proliferation and viability perturbations underpinned by widespread chromosomal abnormalities and activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to protracted p53 signaling elicited by extensive DNA damage.</p><p>The severe attrition of pro-B cells in the <italic>Mb1</italic>-Cre <italic>Gen1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice could be caused by a developmental arrest during the transition from pre-pro B cell to pro-B cell stage, by proliferation and survival defects of the pro-B cells, or both. Pro-B cells, compared to the mitotically inactive pre-pro B cells, undergo IL-7R-dependent proliferative expansion prior to V(D)J recombination and so are more likely to suffer from intense replication stress that could necessitate commensurate effort of replication restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hardy et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Peschon et al., 1994</xref>). As the SSE-knockout pro-B cells are unable to resolve both stalled replication forks and recombination-associated DNA structures formed during such restart activities, they would fail to thrive and proliferate further. Similarly, the lack of robust chronic and induced GC responses in the <italic>Cd23</italic>-Cre <italic>Gen1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice can be ascribed to the inability of DKO cells to alleviate replication stress generated during sustained proliferation by eliminating replication-induced junction molecules, leading to G2/M stalling and abrogation of a complete cell division. High levels of concurrent DNA replication and transcriptional activities within the GC B cells could promote replication-transcription conflicts and R-loop formation that further exacerbate replication stress. We did not observe a time-dependent G2/M accumulation in the DKO culture, suggesting that the arrested DKO cells could not tolerate for long periods the high level of DNA damage incurred from multiple rounds of cell division and consequently undergo mitotic catastrophe, evidenced in the comparatively higher rate of apoptosis among cells in the G2/M phase. Resting mature DKO cells, however, persisted unscathed in the spleen, as exemplified by the normal frequencies and numbers of splenic B cell subpopulations in the <italic>Cd23</italic>-Cre <italic>Gen1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. Splenic naïve B cells do not self-renew; instead, they are constantly replenished from immature precursors produced in the BM and maintained homeostatically by the survival signals BAFF and APRIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hao and Rajewsky, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mackay and Gommerman, 2015</xref>). Hence, resting mature B cells are spared from replication-derived genotoxicity, rendering GEN1 and MUS81 dispensable in these cells.</p><p>The inability of the BTR complex to compensate for the concomitant deficiencies of GEN1 and MUS81 and maintain the viability of proliferating DKO B cells suggests that DNA replication and recombination events generate persistent double HJs and multiple BTR-refractory HJ species such as single HJs and nicked HJs that must be resolved by these endonucleases to suppress genomic instability and catastrophic mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Luis and Machín, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless, the absence of these SSEs may also preclude the processing of aberrant replication intermediates that could deleteriously impact the genome duplication process and undermine the proliferative capacity of the cells. In particular, the MUS81-EME2 complex has been shown to mediate replication fork restart by endonucleolytic cleavage of stalled replication forks during S phase to protect genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pepe and West, 2014a</xref>). Although the in vivo relevance of GEN1 in processing such intermediates remains to be formally established, our genetic analysis and others suggest that when MUS81 is unavailable, GEN1 can potentially act on these substrates (or a processed form of them) that persist into mitosis upon nuclear breakdown to initiate HR-dependent fork restart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Luis and Machín, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarbajna et al., 2014</xref>). Deregulated mutagenic synthesis of the DNA strand during BIR can also contribute to the genomic instability of the DKO cells. Deficiency in these SSEs enables the uncleaved D-loop to undergo prolonged extension, promoting mutagenesis, template switching, and nonreciprocal loss of heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ho et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). SSEs can presumably act on nascent D-loops to promote the less deleterious genetic outcome of half crossovers and on extended D-loops to restrict error-prone DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schwartz and Heyer, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, the inability to eliminate single HJ intermediates formed from the merger of an incoming replication fork with the extending D-loop may explain the genotoxicity of BIR in <italic>Gen1-Mus81</italic>-DKO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mayle et al., 2015</xref>). Although the disruption of the D-loop is central to the initiation of SDSA, no experimental evidence has emerged thus far to support such a role by MUS81, and we believe this to be highly unlikely due to its nicking mechanism. The MUS81 complexes, nonetheless, may be implicated in facilitating SDSA because of their 3′-flap cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hollingsworth and Brill, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Our observation of extensive chromosomal aberrations in the endonuclease-null mouse B cells concur with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarbajna et al., 2014</xref> that employed siRNA depletion of <italic>Gen1</italic> and <italic>Mus81</italic> in cells treated with replication inhibitors. Recombination intermediates generated in S phase that fail to be resolved in the absence of GEN1 and MUS81 evade the checkpoint response and persist into mitosis, generating homologous recombination ultrafine bridges (HR-UFBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mohebi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tiwari et al., 2018</xref>). Breakage of the HR-UFBs during cytokinesis engenders chromosomal breaks that activate the DNA damage checkpoint in the next cell cycle, triggering non-homologous end joining-mediated fusion of DNA ends that leads to widespread chromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). The preponderance of chromosome breaks that appear to occur at identical sites on sister chromatids suggest that the aberrations result from defective resolution of inter-chromatid recombination intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kikuchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shimizu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wechsler et al., 2011</xref>). This phenotype is distinct from that of irradiated HR-defective mutants in which chromatid breaks predominate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shimizu et al., 2020</xref>). Unresolved HJs have been implicated to impede DNA condensation in mitosis, manifesting as ‘pinches’ in the chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wechsler et al., 2011</xref>); thus, a subset of the chromosome breaks observed in DKO cells may not be actual breaks but rather intact HJs. Although these chromosome-type breaks may also arise due to defective NHEJ, the established roles of GEN1 and MUS81 in HJ resolution render this explanation unlikely. We also cannot completely exclude the role of MUS81—and potentially GEN1—in cleaving stalled replication forks to initiate BIR and MiDAS at CFS and other under-replicated regions where such failure leads to the formation of FANCD2-flanking fragile site-UFBs (FS-UFBs) between the segregating chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Naim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ying et al., 2013</xref>). However, the frequent occurrence of breaks at corresponding locations on paired sister chromatids argues for a failure of DKO B cells to resolve HR intermediates. Visualization of UFBs in these cells hence may help delineate the molecular origins of these unique aberrations.</p><p>Detailed investigations into whether HR-UFBs derive predominantly from genomic loci where stalled replication forks are preferentially restarted through recombination-dependent mechanisms could provide mechanistic insights into the genomic instability of SSE-null B cells and clarify the manner by which GEN1 and MUS81 resolve replication stress—do they cleave persistent and late-occurring replication intermediates such as reversed forks or do they process HR intermediates (e.g., D-loops and HJs) arising from recombination-mediated restart of perturbed forks? Further studies to determine whether the loci where HR-UFBs manifest encompass early replication fragile sites (ERFSs) should be pursued given that ERFSs exhibit higher level of HR-dependent sister chromatid exchanges than CFSs upon chemical induction of replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Waisertreiger et al., 2020</xref>). More importantly, such sites have recently been identified as hotspots for transcription-replication conflicts and breakpoints of chromosomal rearrangements in B lymphocytes; hence, elucidating the molecular events involved in rectifying replication stress at ERFSs will be critical to better understanding the drivers of genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The robust transcriptional upregulation of p53 signaling and apoptosis gene programs coupled with the de-enrichment of gene sets related to G2/M checkpoint progression, E2F targets, and MYC targets in activated DKO cells is consistent with the cell cycle and survival perturbations exhibited by these cells. Cellular stresses including DSBs trigger the p53 stress response that entails global transcriptional inhibition with activation of specific gene programs to induce metabolic rewiring, DNA damage repair, G1 and G2 arrests, apoptosis, and senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levine, 2020</xref>). Although the loss of GEN1 and MUS81 has not been directly linked to the downregulation of MYC signaling, the DNA damage response activated in the DKO cells causes the accumulation of p53 protein, resulting in elevated p53 binding to an enhancer element within a MYC super-enhancer and consequent repression of <italic>Myc</italic> mRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Porter et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, p53 can directly impact the expression of <italic>Myc</italic> via other transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. p53 can activate the transcription of the long noncoding RNA <italic>Pvt1b</italic> to suppress in cis <italic>Myc</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olivero et al., 2020</xref>). miR-34 family and miR-145 are transcriptional targets of p53 and they contribute to the silencing of <italic>Myc</italic> expression by eliciting the degradation of Myc mRNA transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sachdeva et al., 2009</xref>). Other transcriptional targets of p53, including PTEN, TSC2, and AMPKβ, can impinge on MYC expression via their inhibition of the upstream regulator mTORC1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levine, 2020</xref>). These MYC-counteracting mechanisms are crucial to the proper enforcement of p53-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our genetic study showed that the loss of p53 was insufficient to rescue the abrogated GC response and proliferative expansion of DKO B cells. Though p53 deletion did prevent apoptosis of ex vivo-activated DKO B cells early on, this survival benefit was only temporary as the p53-null DKO B cells experienced much higher level of cell death at later time points. We infer that the absence of p53 precludes the DKO p53-KO cells from arresting their cell cycle despite incurring extensive replication-associated DNA damage, leading to mitotic catastrophe and their eventual demise.</p><p>Our study presents the first evidence that the ablation of both GEN1 and MUS81 induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), most likely attributed to the elevated levels of micronuclei in the DKO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sarbajna et al., 2014</xref>). Primary human fibroblast cells lacking the BLM dissolvase exhibit an enhanced ISG gene expression signature due to the increased level of cytoplasmic DNA and cGAS-positive micronuclei in these cells, suggesting a common transcriptional outcome in cells that fail to eliminate recombination-associated structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gratia et al., 2019</xref>). Micronuclei are formed when chromosomal fragments or lagging chromosomes—manifestations of mitotic or DNA repair defects—become enveloped in a rupture-prone nuclear membrane after failing to be incorporated into the nucleus after mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller et al., 2021</xref>). Recognition of the micronuclei by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) triggers the catalytic production of the second messenger cyclic 2′3′-GMP-AMP (2′3′-cGAMP), promoting the phosphorylation of the adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) that mediates the activation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to drive the transcription of ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harding et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Chen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mackenzie et al., 2017</xref>). Production and release of chromatin fragments from spontaneously ruptured micronuclei and from improper degradation of nascent DNA at unprotected, stalled replication forks further contribute to the cytosolic pool of immunostimulatory DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coquel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glück et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ragu et al., 2020</xref>). DNA-stimulated type I IFN signaling, besides promoting the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, triggers various cell death programs including apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Paludan et al., 2019</xref>). Recent evidence in T cells, however, suggests that p53 signaling can be directly activated by STING via cyclic dinucleotides to trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis independent of type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Concepcion et al., 2022</xref>). We speculate that the cytoplasm of the DKO B cells could accumulate a panoply of self-DNA materials that fosters the production of 2′3-cGAMP and type I IFNs, initiating multiple cell death pathways simultaneously. This raises the question as to whether the cGAS-STING cascade comprises a secondary cell death signaling axis in the SSE-null cells, and whether micronucleated DKO B cells could elicit cell death in neighboring cells through the paracrine release of 2′3′-cGAMP and type I IFNs, given that macrophages and T cells can import 2′3′-cGAMP via the heteromeric anion channels LRRC8A-LRRC8E and LRRC8A-LRRC8C, respectively, to activate STING and type I IFN production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Concepcion et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies examining the impact of cGAS or STING inhibition on the viability DKO B cells will be warranted to assess the role of these factors in DNA-stimulated intrinsic and extrinsic cell death pathways.</p><p>We posit that the illegitimate processing of branched DNA structures and the persistence of unresolved HR intermediates generated following replication fork stalling and recombination-mediated fork restart in proliferating B cells lacking GEN1 and MUS81 lead to the manifestation of aberrant mitotic structures including chromatin bridges, HR-UFBs, and micronuclei that enable rampant fusions of broken chromosomes and amplification of replication-derived DNA damage during the next cell cycle. Our studies show that such extensive chromosomal instability and genomic damage consequently activate p53-dependent G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Concurrently, these endonuclease-deficient B cells exhibit a type I IFN transcriptional signature, potentially a ramification of high levels of cytoplasmic self-DNA. The synthetic lethality of GEN1 and MUS81 deficiencies in B cells highlights the essentiality of SSEs in eliminating branched and joint DNA intermediates formed during replication, recombination, and repair events to safeguard the genomic integrity of proliferating cells and to confer the proliferative and survival capacities required for the proper development and functionality of B lymphocytes, and possibly other immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Gen1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were generated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Mouse Genetics Core Facility. <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were generated using ES cell clone purchased from EUCOMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Skarnes et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Mb1</italic> (<italic>Cd79a</italic>)-Cre mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (strain #:020505) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hobeika et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Cd23</italic>-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>) and <italic>Aicda</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Muramatsu et al., 2000</xref>) mice were gifted by Meinrad Busslinger (Research Institute of Molecular Pathology, Austria) and Tasuku Honjo (University of Kyoto, Japan), respectively. <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (strain #:008462) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marino et al., 2000</xref>).

Images were acquired on an Olympus IX50-S8F microscope using a 100× objective and images were analyzed using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Telomere FISH</title><p>Metaphase chromosome spreads were prepared and dropped onto slides as described above. Instead of Giemsa staining, samples were treated with 100 μg/ml RNAse A for 1 hr at 37°C, dehydrated with a series of 70%, 90%, and 100% ethanol for 5 min each at room temperature, then allowed to air dry. Hybridization with 0.5 μg/ml CY-3 (CCCTAA)<sub>3</sub> probe (PNA Bio) was carried out in hybridization buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 70% formamide, 0.5% blocking reagent (Roche)). Samples were denatured at 75°C for 5 min and hybridization was then allowed to proceed at room temperature for 16 hr. Slides were washed two times in wash buffer (10 mM Tris pH 7.5, 0.1% BSA, and 70% formamide) and then three times in PBS/0.15% Triton X. Slides were subsequently incubated for 10 min at room temperature in SYTOX Green Nucleic Acid Stain (diluted to 0.5 mM in PBS). After a final PBS wash, slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen). Images were acquired on a DeltaVision Elite Cell Imaging System (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) with a CMOS Camera on an Olympus IX-71 microscope using a 60× objective. Images were analyzed using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Graphical representation of data and statistical analyses were performed using Prism 9 (GraphPad Software).

development. Using knockouts for the genes encoding the structure-selective endonucleases GEN1 and MUS81 in mice, the authors show that the absence of both proteins is incompatible with embryonic development. On the background of a GEN1 knockout, a MUS81 flox allele was used to study the effect on B-cell development using the Mb1-Cre and Cd23-Cre drivers, showing that the absence of both proteins leads to development and maturation defects. Selective loss in mature B cells inhibited germinal center formation. This is the first study of these enzymes in an organismic context and in primary cells, revealing insight into the in vivo consequences of loss of GEN1 and MUS81 functions not previously accessible through studies in cultured cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77073.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Heyer</surname><given-names>Wolf-Dietrich</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05rrcem69</institution-id><institution>University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Heyer</surname><given-names>Wolf-Dietrich</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05rrcem69</institution-id><institution>University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.09.479711">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.09.479711v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Wolf-Dietrich Heyer as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors refer to GEN1 and MUS81 as Holliday junction resolvases. This terminology mischaracterizes the enzymes and inherently limits the type of DNA substrates that may be involved here. GEN1 can cleave HJs but also has a very broad substrate spectrum cleaving many types of branched and junction DNA molecules. MUS81 by itself is inactive, it requires EME1 to become a functional nuclease. MUS81-EME1 cannot cleave HJs, only in the context of the tri-nuclease <italic>SLX1</italic>-SLX4, MUS81-EME1, XPF-ERCC1. While I suspect the authors use this terminology as a shorthand and are aware of these complexities, many readers are not and will be misled. For this reason, the terminology, description, and discussion of these enzymes should be more precise. Both enzymes are structure-selective endonucleases. Just focusing on the HJ intermediate is also too narrow, as SDSA does not involve HJs and may be relevant here. MUS81-EME1 can cleave D-loops, another central HR intermediate, which may be of significance here. For these reasons, the concluding sentence of the introduction (line 135 ff) and many other passages should be rephrased to broaden the discussion of which specific molecular defects (dHJ resolution, other junction substrates, including stalled replication forks, etc.) underlie the observed phenotypes.</p><p>Note in Line 106, also MUS81-EME1 can cleave replication fork-type substrates.</p><p>2) The Mus81 flox allele should be described in more detail to indicate what exactly is predicted to be deleted in the encoded protein.</p><p>3) The results from the cell cycle analysis underline the indispensable role of GEN1 and MUS81 in supporting proliferation of activated B lymphocytes. These conclusions disregard another potentially interesting observation. The peak of the double knock-out splenocytes accumulated at 0 cell divisions (Figure 3B) is interpreted as cells that have not divided. How does deletion of proteins that participate in late homologous recombination repair affect the initiation of cell division? Could the authors provide a possible explanation?</p><p>4) Figure 5: The data presented on DNA damage are not convincing. It is the primary evidence that defective HR resolution is the cause, i.e. breaks at the same place on both sister arms. The images provided with damage classifications can be interpreted to either be different types of damage or undamaged chromosomes:</p><p>a) The picture labeled exchange can be caused by metaphase dropping – chromosome arms lay over each other does not mean that crossover occurred. It appears to be a radial or radial-like chromosome fusion.</p><p>b) The image labeled acentric is not an acentric chromosome, rather it is 2 chromosomes with 2 centromeres – the twin telomere foci in the middle look like the acrocentric arms at the centromere. Again, it is likely a fusion/damage event but appears to have a centromere by DNA + telomere staining.</p><p>c) The chromosome labeled dicentric has only one centromere at the top – again the twin telomere dots label the acrocentric arms at the centromere.</p><p>A commercially available centromere probe would aid with chromosome rearrangement analyses.</p><p>The interpretation in the manuscript relies heavily on published results to support the claim that the DKO mice are suffering from defective double Holliday junction (dHJ) resolution. However, if a dHJ persisted into mitosis without being resolved, why would this manifest as a chromosome break in a metaphase chromosome spread where the spindle has been destabilized with colcemid to &quot;trap&quot; cells in mitosis? Rather chromosome arms should be intertwined at the dHJ site which may not be visible at all, or visible as a &quot;pinch&quot; in the chromosome (picture 5F top left may actually be this, the &quot;pinch&quot; looking like a break -the DNA may be decondensed because of a HJ/dHJ?). This may be visible in the spreads: there are 4 chromosomes with this gap in them on both arms in Figure 5A. The HJ/dHJ and resulting UFB would only snap and create a &quot;true&quot; DSB on both sisters in anaphase when the spindle pulls the two sisters apart.</p><p>An increase in chromosome breaks is also a hallmark of defective NHEJ – double-strand breaks occurring in G1 are not repaired and then replicated leading to a chromosome break at same places on the sister. While this is unlikely for Gen1/Mus81-deficient cells, it is still formally possible.</p><p>5) Western Blot or genomic DNA analysis are necessary to assess the efficiency of Cre-mediated gene deletion in the different bone marrow cell populations. Deletion may be incomplete due to the late stage at which it acts and explain why germinal centers cells are only reduced ~2-fold in Figure 2A? The discussion regarding germinal center B cells independent of GEN1-MUS81 expression could be expanded.</p><p>6) The discussion of the results of the RNA-Seq analysis should be expanded. One of the most significantly downregulated pathways in the RNA-Seq are related to MYC targets. How does the deletion of the two resolvases connect to MYC?</p><p>7) The results of the RNA-Seq study are poorly discussed. While there is a clear experimental follow up on p53 pathway and apoptosis activation, What are the possible implications or causes of the interferon α response upregulation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Comments for the Authors):</italic></p><p>Essential revision</p><p>1) The authors refer to GEN1 and MUS81 as Holliday junction resolvases.

In reference to point 1 above, it would be of interest to see the consequences of p53 deficiency on the accumulation of the undivided population.</p><p>3) On the same line, one of the most significantly downregulated pathways in the RNA-Seq are related to MYC targets.

We also have modified and expanded the Introduction and Discussion sections to recognize and elaborate on the possibility that the molecular defects underpinning the developmental and immunological phenotypes observed in the B-cell-specific <italic>Gen1</italic>-<italic>Mus81</italic>-null mice might involve the persistence of other non-HJ joint and branched structures that necessitate GEN1 and MUS81 processing, consequently impairing a greater variety of DNA replication and recombination events beyond what we have described initially.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Mus81 flox allele should be described in more detail to indicate what exactly is predicted to be deleted in the encoded protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text to describe the location of the loxP sites and the region of the protein that is being deleted in the floxed <italic>Mus81</italic> mouse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results from the cell cycle analysis underline the indispensable role of GEN1 and MUS81 in supporting proliferation of activated B lymphocytes. These conclusions disregard another potentially interesting observation.

How does deletion of proteins that participate in late homologous recombination repair affect the initiation of cell division? Could the authors provide a possible explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very astute comment by the reviewer. In response, we quantified the absolute number of division- zero cells under all conditions of stimulation and found it to similar across all genotype groups, indicating that a small subset of B cells does not undergo cell division under any condition. As fewer viable, proliferating DKO cells were present in the 72-hour culture, the undivided (division-zero) cells are thus disproportionately represented in the DKO B cell culture compared with those in the control and SKO B cell cultures, producing the “enriched” division-zero peak in Figure 3C. We have included this data in Figure 3D and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>And, as the reviewer has noted, while GEN1 and MUS81 have canonically been associated with the resolution of structural intermediates generated during HR (primarily HJs), they could also act on a more diverse array of DNA substrates, including those formed independently of recombinational DSB repair (i.e., during replication). Therefore, the inability of DKO cells to initiate cell division or sustain multiple rounds of replication could reflect a failure to eliminate replication-induced junction molecules, the persistence of which leads to G2/M stalling and abrogation of a complete cell division. These possibilities have now been described in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5: The data presented on DNA damage are not convincing.

We agree with the reviewer, and we have corrected the labeling to read as “radial”. We are confident that we have counted radial structures in our analysis, and we have included additional examples of what has been identified as a radial in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The image labeled acentric is not an acentric chromosome, rather it is 2 chromosomes with 2 centromeres – the twin telomere foci in the middle look like the acrocentric arms at the centromere. Again, it is likely a fusion/damage event but appears to have a centromere by DNA + telomere staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We have called these structures “acentrics” because they appear to be so by Giemsa staining; only by Tel-FISH could one observe a radial structure involving the short arms of two chromosomes. We agree that this should have been addressed in the original text, and we have added discussion to this effect and additional examples of 'acentrics' in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The chromosome labeled dicentric has only one centromere at the top – again the twin telomere dots label the acrocentric arms at the centromere.</p><p>A commercially available centromere probe would aid with chromosome rearrangement analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>This chromosome appears to have two centromeres due to the additional constriction, but it is impossible to be certain of this without doing centromere staining (although mouse chromosomes are acrocentric, lack of additional telomere signal does not preclude an additional centromere being present). This is one instance where we respectfully disagree with the reviewer. We believe that performing the centromere staining would not add significant value to the paper given that dicentrics do not represent a major class of aberration in the DKO cells and removing the dicentrics from our analysis would not impact the conclusions of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interpretation in the manuscript relies heavily on published results to support the claim that the DKO mice are suffering from defective double Holliday junction (dHJ) resolution.

However, prior to the chromosome analysis, some of these cells would have been through multiple cell cycles, so these could also be true breaks that are the result of an unresolved HJ that was broken in the previous mitosis. Although not directly tested by us in our DKO cells, the West lab recently showed that these unresolved recombination intermediates form ultrafine anaphase bridges that are broken during cytokinesis, generating DNA ends amenable to NHEJ-mediated chromosomal fusions (Chan et al., 2018, <italic>Nature Cell Biology</italic>). We have discussed these possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An increase in chromosome breaks is also a hallmark of defective NHEJ – double-strand breaks occurring in G1 are not repaired and then replicated leading to a chromosome break at same places on the sister.

We want to note that despite several attempts with various commercial and lab-made antibodies using protein amounts as high as 100 μg, we were unable to reliably detect mouse GEN1 and MUS81 proteins in our ex vivo B cell cultures.</p><p>We did not analyze the deletion efficiency in Fraction A (pre-pro-B) cells because we recently realized from unrelated experiments that the “Fraction A” cells defined by the gating strategy employed in our manuscript is composed predominantly (~90%) of plasmacytoid dendritic cells that are positive for B220 and negative for the same set of B-lineage markers used in our experiment. We were only able to identify these contaminating plasmacytoid dendritic cells by including anti-Siglec-H and anti-Cd11c antibodies in our staining panel. (We now realize this is a common omission made by others in the field.) We have therefore decided to remove all data related to the Fraction A population from Figure 1 and have revised the Results section. The conclusion that the loss of <italic>Gen1</italic> and <italic>Mus81</italic> in early B-cell progenitors impairs the development of mature B cells, however, is unaffected despite the exclusion of the data as Fraction B cells are almost completely absent in the <italic>Mb1-Cre</italic>: <italic>Gen1</italic><sup>+/–</sup> <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The discussion of the results of the RNA-Seq analysis should be expanded. One of the most significantly downregulated pathways in the RNA-Seq are related to MYC targets. How does the deletion of the two resolvases connect to MYC?</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with this comment, we have expanded the discussion of the RNA-seq findings. Porter et al., (2017, <italic>Molecular Cell</italic>) reported that p53 upregulation in response to DNA damage suppresses MYC transcription via the binding of p53 to an enhancer region within a MYC super-enhancer element, and that such transcriptional inhibition is necessary for the proper enforcement of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in cells experiencing a high level of genotoxic stress. This MYC-counteracting mechanism would thus be similarly engaged in DKO cells that exhibit gross genomic destabilization and high p53 activity. Furthermore, the transcriptional targets of p53 can directly suppress MYC expression via other transcriptional (by the lncRNA <italic>Pvt1b</italic>) and post-transcriptional (by miR-145 and miR-34b) mechanisms, and indirectly via the inhibition of mTOR (by TSC2 and PTEN), the upstream regulator of MYC (Cui et al., 2021, <italic>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</italic>; Levine, 2020, <italic>Nature Reviews Cancer</italic>; Olivero et al., 2020, <italic>Molecular Cell</italic>; Sachdeva et al., 2009, <italic>PNAS</italic>).</p><p>In addition, we have generated and extensively characterized the <italic>Cd23</italic>-Cre: <italic>Gen1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> <italic>Mus81</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> <italic>Trp53</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> mice to examine whether the inactivation of p53 can ameliorate the DKO phenotype. Loss of p53 did not improve any of the defects observed in the DKO cells, suggesting that the DNA damage sustained by the proliferating DKO cells might be too extensive for their survival. These findings are now presented in the Results section and included in Figure 4—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The results of the RNA-Seq study are poorly discussed. While there is a clear experimental follow up on p53 pathway and apoptosis activation, What are the possible implications or causes of the interferon α response upregulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the brevity of the RNA-seq discussion. In the revised text, we have now expanded on how the sensing of cytosolic DNAs (e.g., micronuclei, free DNAs) by cGAS and the subsequent activation of an immune signaling cascade induces the type I IFN transcriptional program. We have also elaborated on the role type I IFN signaling might play in DNA-stimulated cell death, particularly in activating effector proteins involved in apoptosis and necroptosis (Paludan et al., 2019, <italic>Nature Reviews Immunology</italic>). Further, activation of the adaptor protein STING by cGAS has recently been implicated in the upregulation of p53 signaling in T cells, and this could potentially occur in our ex vivo-activated endonuclease-deficient B cells to elicit apoptosis (Concepcion et al., 2022, <italic>Nature Immunology</italic>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
