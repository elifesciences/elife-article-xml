However, can internal energy storage influence the type of memory that is formed? We show that the duration of starvation determines whether <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> forms appetitive short-term or longer-lasting intermediate memories. The internal glycogen storage in the muscles and adipose tissue influences how intensely sucrose-associated information is stored. Insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons integrates internal energy storage into memory formation. Octopamine, in turn, suppresses the formation of long-term memory. Octopamine is not required for short-term memory because octopamine-deficient mutants can form appetitive short-term memory for sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status. The reduced positive reinforcing effect of sucrose at high internal glycogen levels, combined with the increased stability of food-related memories due to prolonged periods of starvation, could lead to increased food intake.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Deciding what and how much to eat is a complex biological process which involves balancing many types of information such as the levels of internal energy storage, the amount of food previously available in the environment, the perceived value of certain food items, and how these are remembered.</p><p>At the molecular level, food contains carbohydrates that are broken down to produce glucose, which is then delivered to cells under the control of a hormone called insulin. There, glucose molecules are either immediately used or stored as glycogen until needed. Insulin signalling is also known to interact with the brain’s decision-making systems that control eating behaviors; however, how our brains balance food intake with energy storage is poorly understood. Berger et al. set out to investigate this question using fruit flies as an experimental model.</p><p>These insects also produce insulin-like molecules which help to relay information about glycogen levels to the brain’s decision-making system. In particular, these signals reach a population of neurons that produce a messenger known as octopamine similar to the human noradrenaline, which helps regulate how much the flies find consuming certain types of foods rewarding. Berger et al. were able to investigate the role of octopamine in helping to integrate information about internal and external resource levels, memory formation and the evaluation of different food types.</p><p>When the insects were fed normally, increased glycogen levels led to foods rich in carbohydrates being rated as less rewarding by the decision-making cells, and therefore being consumed less. Memories related to food intake were also short-lived – in other words, long-term ‘food memory’ was suppressed, re-setting the whole system after every meal.</p><p>In contrast, long periods of starvation in insects with high carbohydrates resources produced a stable, long-term memory of food and hunger which persisted even after the flies had fed again. This experience also changed their food rating system, with highly nutritious foods no longer being perceived as sufficiently rewarding. As a result, the flies overate.</p><p>This study sheds new light on the mechanisms our bodies may use to maintain energy reserves when food is limited. The persistence of ‘food memory’ after long periods of starvation may also explain why losing weight is difficult, especially during restrictive diets. In the future, Berger et al. hope that this knowledge will contribute to better strategies for weight management.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory stability</kwd><kwd>starvation</kwd><kwd>octopamine</kwd><kwd>food intake</kwd><kwd>overeating</kwd><kwd>carbohydrates</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scho 656/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scholz</surname><given-names>Henrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scholz</surname><given-names>Henrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intense starvation with high internal energy levels results in remarkably stable food-related memories that persist beyond actual food intake and are associated with overeating.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To ensure survival, the internal energy status of an animal needs to be adjusted to the energy expenditure of the organism and the availability of external food. Increased storage of energy correlates with increased food intake in the past. Dysregulation of food intake can lead to diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Sucrose is a carbohydrate enriched in Western diets, and the breakdown product of sucrose – glucose – can be stored in the organism as glycogen, primarily in the liver and muscles. Elevated glycogen levels are a hallmark of glycogen storage diseases that are accompanied by defects in the liver, muscles, and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ellingwood and Cheng, 2018</xref>). Similar to vertebrates, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> uses glucose as its primary energy source and stores glycogen primarily in the muscles – the main site of energy expenditure – and the fat body – the equivalent of the vertebrate liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gáliková and Klepsatel, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wigglesworth, 1949</xref>). As in vertebrates, glycogen levels are also found in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamada et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the monoamine octopamine – functionally related to noradrenalin in vertebrates – is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis. In tyramine-β-hydroxylase (<italic>Tβh</italic>) mutants lacking the neurotransmitter octopamine, the glucose and trehalose concentrations in the hemolymph change less upon starvation, and the life span is extended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damrau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants show an increased threshold to respond to sucrose with the extension of their proboscis when sucrose is offered to their tarsi – a structure that contains gustatory receptor neurons. The reduced responsiveness to sucrose correlates with a reduced sucrose intake in <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>). Octopaminergic neurons potentiate the response of sugar-sensing gustatory receptor neurons in satiated flies, suggesting that octopaminergic neurons regulate feeding behavior by changing the sensitivity of taste receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Youn et al., 2018</xref>). The reduced responsiveness to sucrose is also thought to be responsible for the defects observed in habituation in <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scheiner et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to their changes in simple forms of neuronal plasticity, <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants fail to form a positive association with a food reward in a classical olfactory conditioning paradigm. Flies quickly learn to associate an odorant with sucrose, and T<italic>β</italic>h mutants do not show this positive association directly after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). However, when a longer time after training has elapsed, memory appears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2014</xref>). The release of octopamine mediates the reinforcing effect of sweet taste in short-term memory (STM) and the anesthesia-resistant form of long-term memory (LTM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Huetteroth et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). The question arises how the internal energy supply is integrated into the formation of food-related memories and feeding behavior in <italic>Tβh</italic> mutants.</p><p>The peptide hormone insulin regulates glycose homeostasis at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saltiel and Kahn, 2001</xref>). Insulin and its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, insulin-like peptides, perform their functions through well-conserved signal transduction cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>). In vertebrates, in addition to its function in fat tissue and muscles, the insulin receptor is broadly expressed in the brain and regulates neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakai et al., 2022</xref>). For example, in rats, reduced insulin receptor function in the hypothalamus results in loss of long-term potentiation and impaired spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grillo et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the insulin receptor substrate Chico is required for the development of mushroom bodies, a brain region required for learning and memory, and loss of Chico results in learning defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Naganos et al., 2012</xref>). Disrupting the function of the insulin receptor in the mushroom bodies also results in learning defects, whereas the insulin receptor and Chico are required in the ellipsoid body for protein biosynthesis-dependent LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>). While there is evidence that insulin receptor signaling regulates cellular physiology, it is not clear how the internal energy supply of the animal influences the formation of food-related memories.</p><p>To analyze the relationship between energy status, the evaluation of a food reward, and the formation of memory and food intake, we used the olfactory associative learning and memory paradigm. Using nutrients as a positive reward allows for investigating how the internal energy status influences the evaluation of the reinforcer and in turn learning and memory. As a step to understand the interconnection between reward evaluation, nutrient intake, and the formation of food-related memories, we analyzed the function of octopamine in the regulation of internal energy homeostasis, learning and memory, and food intake.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Starvation increases learning and memory performance when using a food-related reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>). However, how the internal energy status is integrated into the evaluation of the reward and the stability of food-related memories and whether there is a correlation between the perceptions of the food reward, food-related memories, and food intake are not clear.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The duration of hunger influences the strength and stability of memories</title><p>To investigate whether changes in internal energy storage influence food-related memories, we used the olfactory associative learning and memory paradigm using sucrose as a food-related reinforcer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). In the paradigm, flies learn to associate an odorant with sucrose and are later tested on whether they remember the association. A prerequisite for this association to be made is that the animals are hungry. During the training, starved flies were exposed for 2 min to the unconditioned odorant, 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH), followed by a 2 min exposure to a second odorant, 3-octanol (3-OCT), that was paired with the reward of 2 M sucrose. After the training, flies were given a choice between the two odorants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Normally, flies prefer the rewarded odorant already 2 min after the training. To avoid a bias towards one odorant, in a reciprocal experiment, the first odorant was rewarded. The performance index presents the average positive association between the reward and both odorants and describes whether information is learnt and remembered. To ensure that observed differences in learning and memory were not due to changes in odorant perception, odorant evaluation, or sucrose sensitivity, different fly populations of the same genotypes were tested for their odorant acuity, odorant, and sucrose preference (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The flies of the different genotypes sensed the odorants and evaluated them as similar salient in comparison. This is important to avoid bias where flies have to choose between the two odorants after training. They also sensed sucrose. We next determined whether the differences in sucrose preference influence sucrose intake during training. Therefore, we measured the intake of food-colored sucrose of starved flies in the behavioral set up. After 2 min, we evaluated whether there was dyed food in the abdomen of the fly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Flies of both genotypes fed sucrose within 2 min and there was no difference between <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> flies.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Starvation influences the strength of memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Appetitive olfactory learning and memory paradigm.

We used 3- to 5-day-old male flies to minimize differences in body weight and control for differences in food preferences. We included <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants lacking octopamine in the experiments since they showed defects in energy metabolism and sucrose reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). Flies that were starved for 16 hr established a positive association between the odorant and the reward. They remembered this association for 2 min, but not for 6 hr or 24 hr. Consistent with previous results, learning and memory performance was significantly improved by prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colomb et al., 2009</xref>). The memory was also remembered for longer since it was still detectable 6 hr after training. The <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants starved for 16 hr did not show 2 min memory but emerged memory 6 hr later that lasted up to 24 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants remembered the rewarded odorant after only 2 min following starvation extended to 40 hr. The memory was still detectable after 6 hr and 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We repeated similar experiments using a lower concentration of 0.15 M sucrose as reinforcer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to the experiments using 2 M sucrose as a reward, 16 hr-starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form a negative association with 0.15 M sucrose directly after the training, which turns into a positive association when the flies were starved longer 40 hr. Again, prolonged starvation significantly increased learning and memory performance in controls and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. Thus, the length of starvation and the reinforcer strength influence appetitive memory strength.</p><p>Next, we investigated how starvation affects the stability of memory. Protein synthesis-dependent LTM is still labile immediately after training and can be blocked by 4°C cold-shock anesthesia immediately after training. After consolidation, LTM is cold-shock-resistant and insensitive to a cold shock 1 hr before the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>). To investigate how hunger influences the stability of food-related memories, we administered cold-shock anesthesia immediately after the training and 1 hr before the test and analyzed the effect on memory formation in differently starved control and <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We reduced the time for the memory test after training from 6 hr to 3 hr to be able to detect memory in 16 hr-starved flies. The memory was completely abolished by a cold shock directly after training or shortly before the test. Prolonging the starvation period resulted in memory that was sensitive to cold shock directly after training but not shortly before the test. In contrast, 16 hr-starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants developed memory that was sensitive to cold shock directly after training and cold-shock-insensitive shortly before the test. The results, together with the observed memory 24 hr later of <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> after the same training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), support that <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant develop LTM.

Mildly starved control flies exhibit an appetitive memory sensitive to cold shock 3 hr after training. Severely starved control flies develop a memory that is initially sensitive to cold shock, but becomes insensitive after 2 hr. This phenotype is shared with mildly starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. Prolonged starvation in the mutants shifts memory to cold-shock-insensitive memory.

To detect the expression of an activated insulin receptor, we used an insulin antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated form of the insulin receptor (InR).

The extending the hunger period, memory formation shifts to an anesthesia-resistant ITM. Presentation of the reward leads to the release of octopamine and thus the suppression of LTM. The shifting of different memories phases in response to different energy supplies has been also described for memories that are formed of aversive non-food-related memories. Depending on the reduction of the internal energy supply, flies initially form protein-dependent aversive olfactory LTM and later ARM, a protein synthesis-independent form of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2005</xref>). In times of energy shortage, the organism exchanges the costly protein biosynthesis-dependent LTM for the ‘less costly’ protein biosynthesis-independent ARM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mery and Kawecki, 2005</xref>). The effect of memory transition can also be observed at the level of appetitive LTM. In <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants, mild starvation, along with elevated glycogen levels, leads to the formation of LTM and prolonged starvation leads to the formation of anesthesia-resistant LTM. Furthermore, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form only anesthesia-sensitive aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form cold-shock-resistant LTM. Therefore, Tβh<sup>nM18</sup> mutants are not defective in appetitive anesthesia-resistant types of memories rather the internal energy status defines how quickly anesthesia-resistant appetitive memories forms.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Octopamine gates memory formation</title><p>What function does octopamine play in memory formation? Octopamine is a negative regulator of LTM as feeding octopamine receptor antagonists to control flies results in memory, and emerging memory in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants is suppressed by octopamine after conditioning. Octopamine acts in the formation of LTM upstream of dopaminergic neurons as blocking neurotransmitter release of dopaminergic LTM-mediating neurons immediately after conditioning blocks memory formation in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants. The results are consistent with the model describing that dopamine release is not required during the pairing of the conditioned stimulus and the reward rather than as gain control after the training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adel and Griffith, 2021</xref>). The inhibitory function of octopamine controls the gain.</p><p>During the acquisition of appetitive STM, octopamine acts upstream of dopaminergic neurons M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). However, at first glance, the function of octopamine appears to differ in STM and LTM. Loss of octopamine in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants results in loss of STM, indicating that octopamine is required as a positive regulator for appetitive STM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). The loss of STM in <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants has been attributed to the loss of labile STM, which forms in response to the sweetness of sucrose, but not due to defects in stable LTM, which forms in response to the caloric value of sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fujita and Tanimura, 2011</xref>). Sweetness is sensed by taste receptor that change their sensitivity during hunger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inagaki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marella et al., 2012</xref>) and thereby influence the response to the external reinforcer. The responsiveness could be regulated by the octopaminergic system as octopaminergic neurons regulate the sucrose sensitivity of gustatory neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Youn et al., 2018</xref>). However, the reduced sensitivity of gustatory receptors cannot explain why octopamine-deficient mutants do not form STM. The <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants form aversive memory to lower concentrations of sucrose and the differences in sucrose preference of <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> do not translate to differences in food intake during training.</p><p>The internal energy status influences how the external source of sucrose is evaluated rather than octopamine being directly involved in the acquisition of appetitive STM. Consistently, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants can exhibit STM after prolonged periods of starvation. In mildly starved <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> flies that do not show STM, uncoupling of energy sensing in reward neurons by blocking insulin receptor function leads to STM. Furthermore, <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutant females with different energy requirements form appetitive STM, and a short pulse of octopamine before conditioning can even block STM. Thus, octopamine is not required in the acquisition of appetitive STM but rather suppresses LTM when enough energy is available. The function of octopamine as a suppressor of different memory types allows for selecting the memory type depending on the internal and external information. This gating function in memory formation can also be observed in other behaviors. For example, octopamine regulates the decision to approach or turn away from a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Claßen and Scholz, 2018</xref>). Taken together, the octopaminergic system integrates internal energy demands and the evaluation of external food supplies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The internal energy level of the animal influences memory formation</title><p>At the cellular level, insulin receptor signaling regulates energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee and Perrimon, 2021</xref>). The broad expression pattern of the insulin receptor in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) indicates that every cell in the brain needs to regulate its own energy homeostasis. However, the fly’s entire energy resources and the evaluation of the external food supply must also be integrated. The reward system evaluates the external food supply. In mice, insulin receptor signaling in dopaminergic neurons mediates food reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Könner et al., 2011</xref>). Consistently, insulin receptor function in octopaminergic reward neurons regulates the rewarding properties of sucrose in appetitive STM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and during food intake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>The systemic metabolic rate is regulated by fat bodies. For example, after food intake, the fat body secretes unpaired 2 (Upd2), which in turn regulates the secretion of <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin-like peptides via GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>). We show that the reduction in glycogen in the fat bodies is not sufficient to change appetitive STM, but reduction in the muscles or both tissues is. The results support a feedback mechanism between the assessment of glycogen levels in the muscles and the brain. In addition, the muscles and the fat bodies communicate about the energy content of both structures, and this information is signaled back to the brain. Such long-range signals from the muscles exist. Skeletal muscles are secretory organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pedersen and Febbraio, 2012</xref>). For example, the muscle-secreted Amyrel amylase reduces the age-related accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rai et al., 2021</xref>). Regardless of how the glycogen levels of both tissues are communicated to the brain, they influence how the reinforcer is evaluated. The feedback between the energy levels in both structures is still intact in octopamine-deficient mutants as <italic>Tβh<sup>nM18</sup></italic> mutants still form STM when the energy storage is sufficiently reduced.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Are food-related memories and internal glycogen levels predictive of food intake?</title><p>The feeding behavior in hungry animals is regulated by various neural systems, including networks that receive and process sensory information and networks that assign reward properties to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berridge, 2009</xref>). Blocking insulin receptor function in dopaminergic neurons results in increased food intake and weight gain in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Könner et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, blocking insulin receptor function in octopaminergic reward neurons in flies with increased glycogen levels and reduced food intake increases food intake. Thus, the octopaminergic system assigns reward properties to food. However, blocking insulin receptor signaling on reward neurons does not result in extensive overconsumption, supporting that the regulation of the food quantity is still intact and is not due to insulin receptor resistance in reward neurons. Increased levels of internal energy, for example, glycogen, reduced the reward properties of food, resulting in a decreased positive association of food-related memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D and</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>) and decreased food consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is intended to prevent increased food intake when there is excess food. Insulin resistance could contribute to weight gain because in addition to high internal levels of glycogen, the flies show normal food intake. However, the overconsumption only becomes visible after a prolonged period of hunger, which correlates with the emerging stable appetitive LTM. This suggests that the stability of appetitive memory could lead to the re-evaluation of food and could trigger the overconsumption of food.</p><p>In summary, the octopaminergic neurotransmitter system integrates several aspects that influence the regulation of food memories. Octopamine modulates the sensory perception of the conditioned stimulus and the sensory perception of the reward. Here, we show that the evaluation of food reward in the context of the energy storage is integrated by the octopaminergic system and influences the stability of food-related memories. The function of octopamine as a negative regulator of various forms of memories allows for selective regulation of food-related behaviors such as food intake, and the loss of this regulation could also promote dysregulation of food intake. The close relationship between the octopaminergic neurotransmitter and the noradrenergic neurotransmitter system suggests that the integrator function may be conserved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup>TβhnM18</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Monastirioti et al., 1996</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Scholz lab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-GlyS<sup>HMS01279</sup>-RNAi</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC_34930</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>UAS-GlyP</italic><sup>HMS00032</sup><italic>-RNAi</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC_33634</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>; <italic>UAS-shi<sup>ts</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitamoto, 2001</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">P{UAS-InR.

The sucrose and yeast preference was determined by analyzing whether they preferred the side with a sucrose or yeast-soaked filter paper over a water-soaked filter paper. Flies of all genotypes used for behavioral experiments were tested for odorant acuity, odorant balance, and ability to sense reinforcer. To determine sucrose intake in the Tully and Quinn olfactory conditioning apparatus, flies were fed with a food-safe-colored sucrose solution and food intake was analyzed by the color in the abdomen. The data are provided in the supplement to the respective figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Food intake</title><p>To analyze the consumption of nutrients in flies, the capillary feeder (CaFe) assay was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diegelmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ja et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, eight 3- to 5-day-old male or female flies that were either non-starved or starved for 18 hr or 40 hr had access to four capillaries filled with either 5% sucrose or 5% yeast or a mixture of both for 24 hr at 25°C and 60% humidity. The solution was colored with red food dye. During starvation, flies were kept in vials with wet filter paper at 25°C and 60% humidity. The amount of consumed solution was determined using an electronic caliper. To account for evaporation, the average evaporation of three CAFE setups without flies was measured and used to normalize the average food intake per fly. To normalize food intake to body weight, at least five times 100 male flies per genotype and condition were weighed, and the average body weight of a single fly was determined. The total consumption per µg fly was calculated by dividing the total consumption per fly by the mean weight of a fly. N indicates the number of tested groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Glycogen content</title><p>Whole-body glycogen levels were determined with the Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, #GAHK20-1KT) according to the protocol of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tennessen et al., 2014</xref>. A group of five male flies that were either sated or starved for 16 hr or 40 hr were homogenized in 100 µl ice-cold 1× PBS. To reduce enzymatic degradation, proteins and enzymes were heat inactivated at 70°C for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and diluted 1:3 with 1× PBS. Then, 20 µl of the samples were either added to 20 µl of 1× PBS or PBS/amyloglucosidase mix and incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Then, 100 µl of HK-reagent was added to the sample or glucose standard and incubated for 15 min at RT. Absorbance was measured at 340 nm. The glycogen content was calculated by subtracting the total glucose concentration from 1× PBS-treated samples from the total glucose of amyloglucosidase-treated samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Periodic acid staining</title><p>To visualize glycogen levels in the fat bodies and muscle tissue of larvae and adult <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PAS staining was performed after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamada et al., 2018</xref> with a slight modification. The samples were fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde for 20 min and washed two times for 5 min with 1% BSA/PBS. Periodic acid solution was added for 5 min, followed by two washes of 5 min with 1% BSA/PBS. Schiff’s reagent was added for 5 min, followed by two washes of 5 min with 1% BSA/PBS. Tissue was stored in 50% glycerol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For immunohistochemistry, antibodies raised in rabbits against the activated insulin-like receptor (Cell Signaling Technology #3021) were used at a dilution of 1:50 in 5% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.1% Triton and incubated for 2 d. The brains were washed with PBS with 0.3% Triton.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Food intake was displayed as the mean ± s.e.m. For learning and memory experiments, the data are displayed as boxplot ± minimum (Q1 – 1.5 * IQR) and maximum (Q1 + 1.5*IQR). We used the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statskingdom.com/320ShapiroWilk.html">Shapiro–Wilk test</ext-link> (significance level p&lt;0.05) followed by a QQ-Plot chart analysis to determine whether the data were normally distributed. For normally distributed data, we used the Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test to compare differences between two groups and the one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc Honest Significant Difference (HSD) test for differences between more than two groups. For nonparametric data, we used the Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for differences between two groups and for more than two groups the Kruskal–Wallis test with post hoc Dunn analysis and Bonferroni correction. The nonparametric one-sample sign test was used to analyze whether behavior was not based on random choice and differed from zero (p&lt;0.05). The statistical data analysis was performed using statskingdom (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statskingdom.com">https://www.statskingdom.com</ext-link>).

While aversive memory formation has been extensively studied in this context, the investigation into appetitive memory formation has been comparatively sparse. It has long been recognized that flies can only form appetitive memory under conditions of starvation. However, the authors of this study go beyond this understanding by revealing that not only the duration of starvation matters, but it also dictates the type of memory formed, whether short- or long-term memory. The authors illustrate that internal glycogen stores play a crucial role in this process, facilitated by insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons, which integrates internal energy reserves into memory formation. Consequently, the authors propose that octopamine serves as a negative regulator of various forms of memory, shedding light on the enduring question of the octopaminergic neuronal system's involvement in appetitive memory formation, which has been overshadowed by the focus on the dopaminergic system in recent years. Additionally, the findings contribute to the ongoing debate concerning the role of insulin receptors, whether they function within neurons themselves or in glial cells. Moreover, the authors not only convincingly demonstrate that octopamine negatively regulates appetitive memory formation, but they also propose a mechanism whereby the insulin receptor in octopaminergic neurons senses the internal energy status and subsequently modulates the activity of these neurons. The experiments are meticulously designed, employing a variety of behavioral assays, genetic tools for manipulating neuronal activity, and state-of-the-art imaging techniques. The conclusions are well supported by the data and carefully performed controlled experiments, yielding high-quality data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88247.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>How organism physiological state modulates establishment and perdurance of memories is a timely question that the authors aimed at addressing by studying the interplay between energy homeostasis and food-related conditioning in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

This has been dealt with extensively in the case of aversive memory formation, but only very sparsely in the case of appetitive memory formation. It has long been known that an appetitive memory in flies can only be formed by starvation. However, the authors here additionally show that not only the duration of starvation plays a role, but also determines which form of memory (short- or long-term memory) is formed. The authors demonstrated that internal glycogen stores play a role in this process and that this is achieved through insulin-like signaling in octopaminergic reward neurons that integrates internal energy stores into memory formation. Here, the authors suggest that octopamine plays a role as a negative regulator of different forms of memory.</p><p>The study sheds light on an old question, to what extent the octopaminergic neuronal system plays a role in the formation of appetitive memory, since in recent years only the dopaminergic system has been in focus. Furthermore, the data are an interesting contribution to the ongoing debate whether insulin receptors play a role in neurons themselves or in glial cells. The experiments are very well designed and the authors used a variety of behavioural experiments, genetic tools to manipulate neuronal activity and state-of-the-art imaging techniques. In addition, they not only clearly demonstrated that octopamine is a negative regulator of appetitive memory formation, but also proposed a mechanism by which the insulin receptor in octopaminergic neurons senses the internal energy status and then controls the activity of those neurons. The conclusions are mostly supported by the data, but some aspects related to the experimental design, some explanations and literature references need more clarification and revision.</p><p>(1) Usually, long-term memory (LTM) is tested 24 hours after training. Here, the authors usually refer to LTM as a memory that is tested 6 hours after training. The addition of a control experiment to show that LTM that the authors observe here lasts longer would increase the power of this study immensely.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, as it helped greatly to clarify the matter.</p><p>We measured memory of control and mutant flies 24 h after the training and included the data into the manuscript (Figure 1B and summarized in a model in Figure 2C). We show that control flies develop an intermediate type of memory, that is depending on the length of starvation either anesthesia-sensitive or resistant. Mutants lacking octopamine develop either anesthesia-sensitive or resistant long-term memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors define here another consolidated memory component as ARM, when they applied a cold-shock 2 hours after training. However, some publications showed that LTM is formed after only one training cycle (Krashes et al 2008, Tempel et al 1983). This makes it difficult to determine, whether appetitive ARM can be formed. Furthermore, one study showed that appetitive ARM is absent after massed training (Colomb et al 2009). Therefore, the conclusion could be also, that different starvation protocols, would lead to different stabilities of LTM. Therefore, additional experiments could help to clarify this opposing explanation. From these results, it can then be concluded either that different stable forms of LTM are formed depending on the starvation state, or that two differently consolidated memory phases (LTM, ARM) are formed, as has already been shown for aversive memory. This is also important for other statements in the manuscript, and therefore the authors should address this. For example, the findings about the insulin receptor (is it two opposing memories or different stabilities of LTM).</p></disp-quote><p>The flies indeed develop different types of memory depending on the length of starvation and the internal energy supply.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>How organism physiological state modulates establishment and perdurance of memories is a timely question that the authors aimed at addressing by studying the interplay between energy homeostasis and food-related conditioning in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

If and how elevated levels of Tyramine contributes to the described phenotypes is unclear. In the current version of the manuscript, only one set of experiments (Figure 2) has been performed using Octopamine agonist. This is particularly important in light of recent published data showing that starvation modifies Tyramine levels.(2) Octopamine (and its precursor Tyramine) have been implicated in numerous processes, complicating the analysis of the phenotypes resulting from a general inhibition of tbh.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points. The observed memory defects of the Tbh mutants can be solely explained by loss of octopamine. We included models into the manuscript to illustrate this (Figure 2 C and Figure 7E).</p><p>To address whether the elevated levels of tyramine observed in Tbh mutants interfere with food consumption, we analyzed the effect of increased levels of tyramine and octopamine on food consumption. We included the data (Figure S2). An increase in tyramine levels did not result in a change in food intake, rather the increase in octopamine levels reduced food intake.

These manipulations are expected to affect the level of glycogen. Using specific drivers the authors attempt to manipulate glycogen level at the muscles and fat bodies and examine how this affects learning and memory. The conclusions of the authors arise solely from the manipulation intended (i.e. the genetics). However, the authors also directly measured glycogen levels at these organs and those do not follow the manipulation intended, i.e. the RNAi had very limited effect on the glycogen level. Nevertheless, these results are ignored.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with the reviewer and repeated the experiments. While we could not detect differences in whole animals, we detected differences in tissues enriched for muscles or fat, e.g. thorax or abdomen. We added the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors claim in the summary that OA is not required for STM. However, according to one experiment OA is required for STM as Tbh mutants cannot form STM. In another experiment OA is suppressive to STM as wt flies fed with OA cannot form STM. Therefore, it is very difficult to appreciate the actual role of OA on STM.</p></disp-quote><p>During mild starvation, the internal energy supply is greater in Tbh mutants than in control flies. This information is integrated into the reward system via insulin receptor signaling. Therefore, the association between the odorant and sucrose is not meaningful to the mutants and no STM is formed. At the same time there is no release of octopamine and therefore no repression of LTM. In starved animals, octopamine suppresses food intake (we added the data). This is consistent with a function of Octopamine as a signal for the presence of food. Depending on when the signal comes, this might suppress the formation of STM or LTM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors use t-test and ANOVA for most of the statistics, however, they did not perform normality tests. While I am quite sure that most datasets will pass normality test, nevertheless, this is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have included a description in the “Materials and Methods” section that explains how we tested the data for normal distribution. We corrected the figure legends accordingly.</p><p>“We used the Shapiro-Wilk test (significance level P &lt; 0.05) followed by a QQ-Plot chart analysis to determine whether the data were normal distributed. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) While it is logical to assume that OA neurons are upstream to R15A04 DA neurons, I am not sure this really arises from the experiment that is presented here. It is well established that without activity in R15A04 DA neurons there is no LTM. Since OA acts to decrease LTM, can one really conclude anything about the location of OA effect when there is no learning?</p></disp-quote><p>Normally control flies did not form memory 6 h after training, only Tbh mutants. We wanted to investigate what kind of memory develops in Tbh mutants. During the experiments of the manuscript, we kept the training procedure constant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is unclear how expression of a dominant negative form of insulin receptor (InR) in OA neurons can rescue the lack of OA due to the Tbh mutation. If OA neurons cannot release anything to the presumably downstream DA neurons, how can changing their internal signaling has any effect?</p><p>The expression of the dominant negative form of the insulin receptor signals no food or low energy levels and activation of the insulin receptor that there is enough food. The reward is a source of food, but the energy content is not high enough to fill the energy stores. The insulin receptor activation can activate at least three different signaling cascades, one of which might regulate octopamine release.</p><p>While I stressed some comments that need to be addressed, the overall take-home message of the manuscript is supported and the authors do show that the metabolic state of the animal affects learning and memory. I do think though, that some more caution is required for some of the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We added additional data to address the points raised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We addressed all points raised by the reviewers, clarified the content or added more data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Throughout the manuscript, the full stop of a sentence is always placed before the references.</p></disp-quote><p>We fixed this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I find the English in the manuscript not yet sufficient for publication.

However, in the introduction, the influence of the insulin receptor on memory formation is discussed first. Personally, I would describe this later in the manuscript, ideally in the results section. At this point in the manuscript, this leads to an interruption in the flow of reading.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion.

However, I have one comment. For each statistical test, a correction should be made depending on the number of tests. However, I could not determine whether this was also done for the parametric or non-parametric one-sample t-test. From the results and the methods section, I would guess not. Here I would recommend a Bonferroni correction or even better a Sidak-Holm correction. Furthermore, the authors could also go into more detail about which non-parametric one-sample t-test they used.</p></disp-quote><p>We described the statistic used in more detail in the material and method section.</p><p>“We used the Shapiro-Wilk test (significance level P &lt; 0.05) followed by a QQ-Plot chart analysis to determine whether the data were normal distributed.

For nonparametric data, we used the Mann-Whitney U test for differences between two groups and for more than two groups the Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc Duenn analysis and Bonferroni correction. The nonparametric one-sample sign test was used to analyze whether behavior was not based on random choice and differed from zero (P &lt; 0.5).

It is well established that without activity in these DA neurons there is no LTM. Since OA acts to decrease learning, how one can conclude anything about the location of OA effect when there is no learning? With STM the situation was opposite, OA supported learning and this was abolished when DA neurons were silenced.I think some supporting experiment are required, i.e. how OA affects DA neurons activity or, alternatively, tone down a bit the writing.</p></disp-quote><p>Normally control flies did not form memory 6 h after training, only Tbh mutants. We wanted to investigate what kind of memory develops in Tbh mutants. During the experiments of the manuscript, we kept the training procedure constant. The inhibition of dopaminergic neurons blocks the memory of Tbh mutants. Taken together the duration of the memory, the cold-shock experiments and the inhibition of the dopaminergic neurons, Tbh develops LTM after training. This training does not evoke memory in controls.</p><p>The loss of STM in mildly starved Tbh mutants depends on the integration of the high internal energy levels via InR signaling. Reducing the internal energy levels further by extension of starvation result in STM supporting that OA is not directly involved in the formation of STM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 4 requires some clarifications. In Supplementary Figure S2 the authors show that they could not manipulate glycogen levels in muscles. However, in Figure 4B they show that &quot;Increasing glycogen levels in the muscles did not change short-term memory in 16 h starved flies, but the reduction in glycogen significantly improved memory strength (Figure 4B)&quot; (lines 231-233). How can this be reconciled?</p></disp-quote><p>While we could not detect differences in whole animals, we detected differences in glycogen content in body parts enriched with muscles or fat, e.g. thorax or abdomen when using UAS-GlyP-RNAi or UAS-GlyS-RNAi under the control of the respective Gal4 drivers.</p><p>We added the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, the authors write that &quot;Increasing or decreasing glycogen levels in the fat bodies had no effect on memory performance (Figure 4C)&quot; Line (233-234). However, in Figure S2 they show that they can only increase glycogen levels but not decrease them.</p><p>As explained above the conclusion of Figure 4 &quot;Thus, low levels of glycogen in the muscles upon starvation positively influence appetitive short-term memory, while high levels of glycogen in the muscles and fat body reduce short-term memory&quot; lines 245-246, is not supported by the direct measurements of glycogen presented in Figure S2.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the data showing that the reduction or increase can be measured when analyzing the specific body parts enriched in muscles tissue or fat tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In cases where mutant flies do not display learning, a control should be done to see if they ate the sugar (with dye).

If I am not mistaken this was not demonstrated for any of the datasets used. I did a quick check on one of the datasets provided in the excel sheet and it is normally distributed. Therefore, please add normality test for all data sets. If some do not pass normality, please use a suitable non-parametric test.</p></disp-quote><p>We added normality test to all data sets and used non-parametric tests for non-normal distributed data. We clarify this in the material and method section and the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors show that OA suppresses also STM. This result is in contradiction to previous published results. This by itself is not a problem. However, this result also seems to me in contradiction to the authors own results. According to Figure 1B, OA is required for STM as it absence in the tbh mutant results in loss of STM. According to Figure 2C, OA is reducing STM as wt flies fed with OA just prior to learning do not form STM. This appears in other places in the manuscript as well.</p><p>In addition, in the text lines 178-180, the authors write &quot;A short pulse of octopamine before the training inhibits the STM. Thus, octopamine is a negative regulator of appetitive dopaminergic neuron-dependent long-term memory and can block STM.&quot; But in the summary they write &quot;Octopamine is not required for short-term memory, since octopamine deficient mutants form appetitive short-term memory to sucrose and to other nutrients depending on the internal energy status.&quot;So, the take-home message regarding OA and STM is unclear.</p><p>The authors need to better clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified these points. See comments above. The loss of memory in Tbh mutants is not due to loss of octopamine, but increased energy levels that changes the reward properties of sucrose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The manuscript is very difficult to follow. The authors constantly change between 16 and 40 hours starvation, short term memory, 3 hour memory and 6 hour memory. I think it would have been better to have a more focused manuscript. However, if this is not possible, I recommend preparing a diagram with the different neurons or signaling pathways (i.e. insulin) and how they affect each other. Also, perhaps add to each figure a panel describing exactly the experimental conditions. I think also simplifying the text and adding more conclusions throughout the results section will help the readers to follow. Finally, I think that it would help understanding the conclusions if the authors can add a diagram of the flow that they think occurs. For example, the authors show that glycogen suppresses learning as its reduction increases learning. They also show that InR activity receptor suppresses learning as its KD also increases learning. If I am not mistaken the link between the two is not straight forward (but I may be wrong here). A diagram of the flow would be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We prepared diagrams summarizing and explaining the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(1) I may not have understood correctly as I am not sure that I found Table S1.</p><p>Also, there was no legend for Table S1.</p><p>Nevertheless, if I understood correctly, the authors write that &quot;Before the experiments, flies were tested to determine whether they perceived the odorants, preferred one odorant over other and responded to the reward similarly to ensure that the observed differences in behavior were not due to changes in odorant perception or sucrose sensitivity (Table S1).&quot; However, according to the Table that I found it seems that following 40h starvation wt flies show preference to OCT whereas this does not occur for the mutant. Also, it seems that at 16h the mutant has a much higher preference to the odors than after 40h. This is a bit odd. I am also not sure what the balance value refers to. Finally, the mutant shows really low 2M sucrose preference after 40h. In general, this set of experiments requires a bit more explanation.</p><p>I think it is better to show these experiments using graphs and add this to the supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the experiments in the result section as follows and added an explanation to the material and method section.
