Comparative work, supported by theory, suggests clonal development should facilitate this transition, although this hypothesis has never been tested in a single model system. We evolved 20 replicate populations of otherwise isogenic clonally reproducing ‘snowflake’ yeast (Δ<italic>ace2/∆ace2</italic>) and aggregative ‘floc’ yeast (<italic>GAL1</italic>p<italic>::FLO1 /GAL1</italic>p<italic>::FLO1</italic>) with daily selection for rapid growth in liquid media, which favors faster cell division, followed by selection for rapid sedimentation, which favors larger multicellular groups. While both genotypes adapted to this regime, growing faster and having higher survival during the group-selection phase, there was a stark difference in evolutionary dynamics. Aggregative floc yeast obtained nearly all their increased fitness from faster growth, not improved group survival; indicating that selection acted primarily at the level of cells. In contrast, clonal snowflake yeast mainly benefited from higher group-dependent fitness, indicating a shift in the level of Darwinian individuality from cells to groups. Through genome sequencing and mathematical modeling, we show that the genetic bottlenecks in a clonal life cycle also drive much higher rates of genetic drift—a result with complex implications for this evolutionary transition. Our results highlight the central role that early multicellular life cycles play in the process of multicellular adaptation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>major transitions in evolution</kwd><kwd>life cycles</kwd><kwd>biological individuality</kwd><kwd>multicellularity</kwd><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB-1845363</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pentz</surname><given-names>Jennifer T</given-names></name><name><surname>DuBose</surname><given-names>James G</given-names></name><name><surname>Conlin</surname><given-names>Peter L</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinhardt</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name><name><surname>Ratcliff</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name><name><surname>MacGillivray</surname><given-names>Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM142616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacGillivray</surname><given-names>Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000008</institution-id><institution>Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Packard Fellowship for Science</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pentz</surname><given-names>Jennifer T</given-names></name><name><surname>DuBose</surname><given-names>James G</given-names></name><name><surname>Conlin</surname><given-names>Peter L</given-names></name><name><surname>Reinhardt</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name><name><surname>Ratcliff</surname><given-names>William C</given-names></name><name><surname>MacGillivray</surname><given-names>Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Libby</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Clonal development, but not aggregation, promotes the transition of Darwinian individuality from cells to groups, emphasizing the fundamental role of initial multicellular life cycles in the evolution of multicellularity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multicellularity has evolved more than 50 times across the tree of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Umen and Herron, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>). Multicellular organisms vary widely in their life cycles, ecological niches, and traits, and there are few features shared by all members of this diverse group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O’Malley, 2022</xref>). However, it is generally accepted that nascent multicellular lineages start out relatively simple (e.g. as undifferentiated groups of cells), gradually evolving increased organismal integration and functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfeiffer and Bonhoeffer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoll, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herron et al., 2022</xref>). In some cases, multicellular groups that gain the capacity for group reproduction undergo a shift in evolutionary mode: the origin of multicellular Darwinian individuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michod, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Godfrey-Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buss, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">West et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1997</xref>). This shift, from cell-level traits being the focal point of adaptation in the unicellular ancestor, to group-level traits becoming the focal point of adaptation in a nascent multicellular lineage, represents a crucial tipping point in evolutionary dynamics. In this paper, we examine the impact of early multicellular life cycles on the capacity for groups to serve as evolutionary units capable of adaptation.</p><p>There are two basic routes to forming a multicellular body. Nascent multicellular organisms employing either of these routes to group formation possess distinct multicellular life cycles. Individual cells can ‘stay together’ by forming permanent cell-cell bonds, forming clonal clusters that exhibit little within-group genetic variation. Alternatively, free-living single cells can ‘come together’, or aggregate, and often evolve to do so in response to some stimuli, such as starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crespi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tarnita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Velicer and Vos, 2009</xref>). Multicellularity has evolved multiple times via both staying together and coming together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2015</xref>), but ‘complex multicellularity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoll, 2011</xref>; e.g. plants, animals, fungi, red algae and brown algae) has only evolved in lineages that develop clonally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Knoll, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher et al., 2020</xref>). Evolutionary theory explains this observation as a consequence of social evolution: clonal life cycles are a simple and powerful mechanism that ‘de-Darwinizes’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michod, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Godfrey-Smith, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godfrey-Smith et al., 2013</xref>) while Darwinizing multicellular groups. By limiting within-group genetic diversity, clonal development prevents intra-organism genetic conflict, as there is little standing within-group genetic variation for selection to act on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buss, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maynard Smith and Szathmary, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke, 2014</xref>. Any genetic variation that arises due to mutation gets partitioned among multicellular offspring, allowing selection to act on the group-level effects of de novo mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahaj et al., 2021</xref>). Clonal groups align the fitness interests of cells and groups, allowing cells to evolve altruistic social traits necessary for cellular differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Michod, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michod, 2006</xref>). Finally, organisms that aggregate from a free-living state may experience contrasting selection on the fitness of free-living single cells and the fitness of these cells in a multicellular group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Márquez-Zacarías et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While the numerous origins of multicellularity provide a uniquely rich set of natural experiments to examine correlations between developmental mode and organismal complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Umen and Herron, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fisher et al., 2013</xref>), there is no direct evidence that clonal development has played a causal role in the transition to multicellular individuality, and the subsequent evolution of organismal complexity. Indeed, a number of alternative explanations exist. For example, clonal development has evolved more frequently in aquatic environments, while aggregation has evolved more often in terrestrial environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher et al., 2020</xref>). The lower complexity of aggregative organisms may be due simply to different life history selection in these fundamentally different environments, rather than evolutionary constraints due to within-organism genetic diversity. Alternatively, the potential for cellular differentiation appears to be highly contingent on the cell biology and behavioral repertoire of the unicellular ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hanschen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">King, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suga et al., 2013</xref>). The fact that complex multicellularity evolved in just five lineages may reflect historical contingency in developmental plasticity in these specific lineages, rather than evolutionary consequences of early developmental mode. Progress has been limited by the fact that all known transitions to multicellularity occurred in the deep past (&gt;200 MYA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grosberg and Strathmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herron et al., 2009</xref>), obscuring the evolutionary dynamics of early multicellular evolution in extant lineages. Experiments directly comparing the evolutionary consequences of developmental mode have not yet been conducted, in part due to a lack of experimentally tractable model systems that can be induced to undergo either clonal or aggregative development.</p><p>Here, we circumvent these constraints by synthetically generating an isogenic yeast model system capable of either clonal or aggregative development. We created clonal ‘snowflake yeast’ by knocking out <italic>ACE2</italic> in a unicellular ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ratcliff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pentz et al., 2020</xref>), and aggregative floc yeast by placing the dominant <italic>FLO1</italic> gene under transcriptional control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pentz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smukalla et al., 2008</xref>). While these strains differ only in these two genes, these differences produce two fundamentally different life cycles: obligately multicellular snowflake yeast undergo a unicellular genetic bottleneck during ontogeny, making them clonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ratcliff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratcliff et al., 2015</xref>), while floc yeast can form genetically diverse aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smukalla et al., 2008</xref>). We evolved 20 populations of each genotype for 24 weeks with galactose as the main carbon source, ensuring robust flocculation, selecting daily for both faster growth and increased multicellular size by selecting for rapid sedimentation in liquid media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>). We chose this selective regime because it is a simple and powerful way to examine the evolutionary consequences of selection acting simultaneously on both cell-level traits (such as growth rate) and group-level traits (such as settling rate). While buoyancy regulation may be an important driver of multicellularity in some lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dudin et al., 2021</xref>), we chose this selective regime because it is an efficient way to select on multicellular size, a fundamentally important multicellular trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tong et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In our experiment, both floc and snowflake yeast adapted to this fluctuating environment, settling faster and growing faster. However, competition experiments with their ancestors reveal fundamentally different modes of adaptation. In clonal snowflake yeast, groups of cells served as the primary evolutionary units, gaining nearly all their increased fitness during the settling selection phase of the experiment. In contrast, aggregative floc gained most of their fitness as the cell-level, with evolved floc growing faster but possessing no measurable advantage during settling selection when competing against their ancestor. Snowflake yeast, but not floc, are evolving as primarily multicellular Darwinian individuals. Clonal development, however, resulted in far more genetic drift than aggregation. Mathematical modeling suggests that this is the result of a key difference in their life cycles. In floc, a rare beneficial mutant can disperse into many groups, while in clonal snowflake yeast it is constrained to a few, exposing them to greater sampling error during group selection. This is a general property of clonal multicellular life cycles, and this disparity scales with the number of cells within the organism prior to reproduction. Together, our results show how a simple difference in the mechanism of group formation, whether cells adhere with reformable bonds or adhere permanently, can fundamentally change their subsequent evolutionary dynamics and impact the level of Darwinian individuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rose and Hammerschmidt, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental evolution</title><p>Our selection regime involved 24 hr of batch culture followed by daily selection for rapid sedimentation in liquid media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>). This selective scheme has previously been shown to promote multicellular adaption in snowflake yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratcliff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ratcliff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdag et al., 2023</xref>) and has led to increases in cluster size of up to 20,000-fold over 600 consecutive rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdag et al., 2023</xref>). We have previously quantified the effect of settling selection on snowflake yeast by using a variety of tools (i.e. microscopy and flow cytometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratcliff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ratcliff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdag et al., 2023</xref>) that cannot be used for floc, because floc aggregates form dynamically as the clusters are settling. Thus, we developed a method to measure the settling rate of both floc and snowflake yeast populations during sedimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pentz et al., 2020</xref>), calculating the displacement of biomass as they settle via high-resolution video (see Methods). We measured the settling speed of each of the 40 populations weekly over the course of the 24week experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

Examining one lineage through time, we found that size appeared to plateau after 8–10 weeks of settling selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is consistent with previous work in this model system where aerobic metabolism, and the corresponding reliance on diffused oxygen for growth, strongly inhibits the evolution of increased size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdag et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozdag et al., 2021</xref>). By 24 weeks, floc yeast appeared to be aggregating far more efficiently than their ancestors. To quantify this, we measured the coefficient of variation in pixel opacity in a well-mixed population just prior to settling selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This standardized variance measurement is as a proxy for flocculation efficiency, as when more cells are in flocs, the biomass will be more heterogeneously distributed within the cuvette. Thirteen populations showed significantly increased flocculation efficiency relative to the ancestor (one-way ANOVA, <italic>F<sub>(20,46)</sub></italic>=45.53, p&lt;0.0001, pairwise differences assessed with Tukey’s honestly significant difference [HSD] with ɑ=0.05). This resulted in a noticeable reduction in the density of free un-flocculated unicells, see examples of the ancestor (G) and a representative 24-week isolate (H). We confirmed that increased flocculation was not a product of cell density in floc cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) Thus, floc yeast evolved to settle more rapidly by forming larger aggregative groups and reducing the proportion of non-aggregated cells in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Both floc and snowflake yeast evolved to form larger groups.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Snowflake yeast increased their settling rate by evolving larger cluster size.

Our system is not amenable to this kind of decomposition given the dynamic nature of flocs: groups rapidly form and fuse during settling selection, changing in size and composition until they either succeed at joining the pellet at the bottom of the tube, where they rapidly adhere to these cells, or fail to do so and are discarded. The fluid nature of flocs, and corresponding difficulty of measuring their traits without changing the traits we seek to measure, prevents us from quantifying the genetic composition and fitness of flocs during settling selection - data that is necessary for a Price equation fitness decomposition. Fortunately, we can still gain insight into how selection is acting on cell and group-level traits by leveraging the biphasic nature of our experiment.</p><p>Fitness in our experiment depends on growth rate during the 24 hr of batch culture when the population is competing for resources, and survival during the subsequent settling selection step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pentz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratcliff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conlin and Ratcliff, 2016</xref>). Growth rate during batch culture is a classic trait under strong selection during experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lenski et al., 1991</xref>). The main way that a lineage can increase growth rates is by increasing the rate at which cells divide. In contrast, the main way in which a lineage can increase survival during settling selection is through changes in the phenotype of multicellular groups (i.e. increasing their size, packing density, or hydrodynamic profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ratcliff et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, if populations evolve higher fitness during the growth phase, this can be taken as evidence that selection is acting effectively at the cell-level. Correspondingly, fitness improvement during the settling phase, where strong between-group selection determines survival, can be taken as evidence that selection is acting at the group-level.</p><p>We measured the fitness of evolved isolates (one isolate per 24-week evolved population, or 40 isolates in total) in competition against their unevolved ancestor one 24 hr period of growth, and one round of settling selection, allowing us to partition fitness increases amongst the two factors that affect fitness in our system: growth and settling. Both floc and snowflake yeast showed overall fitness increases in our experimental regime. However, floc yeast showed a significantly higher increase in fitness than snowflake yeast, increasing by an average of 15% as opposed to 7%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> first panel: one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, n=20, p&lt;0.0001).

To determine why floc obtained such marginal fitness benefit during settling selection despite evolving such a large increase in their rate of flocculation, we measured the genetic structure of flocs formed by five 24-week isolates from across the range of settling speeds by calculating their assortment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yanni et al., 2019</xref>), a scaled statistic of genotypic enrichment relative to what would be expected by chance, which ranges from –1 to 1 (representative images of flocs, compressed to a single-cell thickness, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

In contrast, the mutations in floc yeast show a strong signature of selection. We observed more missense mutations than expected based on drift (there was a 3% chance of observing at least this many missense mutations in our null model). Similarly, we observed fewer synonymous mutations and fewer mutations in intergenic regions than expected based on our null model (in both cases, there was a 3% chance of observing this many mutations or fewer in our null model). Nonsense mutations occur infrequently, and do not provide a sufficiently large sample size for analysis. Because we did not have a prior expectation about the deviation from the null, each of the above tests should be treated as a two-sided test, meaning there is a 6% chance of observing a deviation in either direction at least as large as the one observed for the three categories of mutation described above, even when the null hypothesis of no selection is true. Taken together, our results show that selection was acting strongly on the mutations found in floc, but not snowflake yeast. The analysis above only examined the overall statistical properties of mutations, and should not be interpreted to mean that snowflake yeast did not undergo adaptive evolution. Indeed, we see that all evolved isolates taken from all 20 populations have evolved to form larger groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) that settle faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and are much more fit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Some of the mutations identified within snowflake yeast are putatively adaptive, such as missense mutations in the cell cycle (i.e<italic>. ULP1</italic>, <italic>SLK19</italic>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) or mutations affecting cellular morphology (i.e<italic>. AYR1, ACM1, GSC2, CHC1, ARP7, HKR1</italic>), which prior work in snowflake yeast has shown are a common mode of evolving larger group size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahaj et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdag et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bozdag et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacobeen et al., 2018</xref>). We saw only a single <italic>GAL2</italic> mutant (in contrast to seven arising independently in floc, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which is consistent with less growth rate adaptation in snowflake yeast. Indeed, it is plausible that selection acting on multicellular traits also contributed to genetic drift through the hitchhiking of otherwise non-adaptive alleles (an outcome that has been seen previously in yeast selection experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) suggest that faster settling in floc, in contrast to snowflake yeast, is only marginally adaptive. Yet if that is the case, why would floc convergently evolve to settle an average of 12 times faster than their ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)? We see two potential explanations, which are not mutually exclusive. The first is that low genetic assortment during flocculation reduces, but does not eliminate, the benefit of faster settling. Indeed, we found that 24 week evolved floc were an average of 10% more fit than their ancestor during settling selection, although this difference was not statistically significant for the treatment as a whole. Consistent with flocculation itself being under selection, we saw five parallel missense mutations in <italic>FLO1</italic>, and four in <italic>MSN1,</italic> a transcriptional activator of another major flocculin gene, <italic>FLO11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fichtner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">van Dyk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Greater statistical power during competitions may be required to detect the benefit of increased flocculation if it exists, however.</p><p>Alternatively, it may be that faster settling has evolved as a pleiotropic consequence of increased growth rate. In our experiments, mutations that increase growth rate by altering carbon metabolism may also increase flocculation efficiency as a side-effect, because <italic>FLO1</italic> expression is under the control of a <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. We saw seven parallel missense mutations in <italic>GAL2,</italic> a transmembrane galactose permease, which may increase the amount of galactose entering the cell. As the main carbon source in the medium and promoter of <italic>FLO1</italic>, this may both increase growth rate and flocculation rate simultaneously. We conducted an additional experiment to control for this possibility, evolving five floc genotypes for eight weeks with daily selection for growth rate, but not settling selection, in the same growth medium containing galactose. These controls evolved a 20.7% increase in fitness during the growth phase, but evolved a 40% decrease in flocculation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that cell-level adaptation to growth on galactose does not drive increased flocculation as a pleiotropic side-effect. It is thus likely that the dramatically increased flocculation efficiency seen in our main experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) is an adaptation, albeit one that provides only a relatively small advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Life cycles result in different genetic bottlenecks: modeling adaptation in aggregative and clonally-developing life cycles</title><p>To reconcile the results above, in which clonal multicellularity both facilitates multicellular adaptation yet experiences more genetic drift, we developed a theoretical model. Specifically, we consider the fate of a rare, beneficial mutant lineage that arises during the population growth phase. If the mutant lineage is to eventually fix in the population, it must survive settling selection, which means being in at least one group that gets selected. The probability that at least one mutant cell survives settling selection depends on the fraction of groups that contain at least one mutant cell.</p><p>As a point of comparison we begin by considering a simple population of equal-sized groups in which each group contains exactly one mutant cell. In this scenario if there are <italic>k</italic> mutant cells then there are also <italic>k</italic> groups with a mutant cell. Since all groups are the same size, we can model the process of selection as a statistical sampling procedure in which groups are sampled randomly without replacement. For the mutant lineage to go extinct none of the <italic>k</italic> groups containing a mutant can be selected. The probability of such an event (call it <italic>p<sub>e</sub></italic>) is described by a hypergeometric distribution: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∏</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where the total number of groups selected is expressed as a fraction f of a total population of <italic>N</italic> groups.

In the above case we assumed for simplicity that each group contained only a single mutant cell. Such a scenario could arise in a population without preferential assortment (i.e<italic>.</italic> an idealized form of aggregative development) if the proportion of mutant cells is small in comparison to the number of groups. In contrast, when groups are highly assorted (e.g<italic>.</italic> clonal development), the initially rare mutant and all of its descendants will be represented in a small number of groups, reducing <italic>k</italic> by a factor that corresponds to mean group size. To get a sense of this effect, suppose a mutant arises at the beginning of the growth phase. The population then grows 100-fold, resulting in 100 mutant cells. Assuming the average size of a group is 50 cells, then if 1% of the population survives settling selection, the probability that the mutant lineage goes extinct in a population that develops clonally is 98%, while it is just 36.4% for a population developing aggregatively. To assess the robustness of our theoretical predictions, we used experimental data measuring the distribution of group sizes in floc and snowflake yeast and simulated different mutations arising in these populations. We considered mutations that either: 1. Alter cell growth by a factor (1+<italic>s<sub>c</sub></italic>) where positive <italic>s<sub>c</sub></italic> corresponds to a beneficial mutation, or 2. Improve the settling rate of that group by a factor of <italic>s<sub>g</sub>·m,</italic> where <italic>m</italic> is the number of mutant cells. We assume the best scenario for a mutation to fix, that is<italic>,</italic> it arises at the very start of an exponential growth phase. We then used experimentally observed size distributions of groups to allocate the offspring of this original mutant cell. For simplicity, in the well-mixed aggregative life cycle, we randomly selected cells to be mutant, thereby causing larger groups to have more mutant cells (although keeping the proportion of mutants similar). For the clonal life cycle, we randomly selected groups, allocating mutant cells to it until we either ran out of cells, or had to choose a new group (biologically, these would be propagules of the first cluster, as they all descend from a common mutant ancestor). After allocating mutants, we simulated settling selection by probabilistically selecting groups, with survival weighted linearly by size. We iterated over five rounds of growth and size-dependent selection.</p><p>We recapitulate key dynamics from our experiments in this simple model. In the aggregative life cycle, selection readily acts on mutations that affect cellular growth rate (either favoring beneficial mutants or purging those that are deleterious; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In contrast, the clonal life cycle struggles to capture growth beneficial mutations- even mutants that doubled cellular growth rates went extinct ~40% of the time. When we examine mutations that increase group survival, we find that while they rarely go extinct in aggregative groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), neither can they be efficiently selected upon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C&amp;D</xref>). In the clonal life cycle, even strongly group-beneficial mutants (e.g., increasing the probability of group survival 10-fold) go extinct far more often than not, as they are extremely susceptible to being lost in the first several rounds of the simulation when they are found in only a small number of groups. If they escape being lost by drift, however, they rapidly fix in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C&amp;D</xref>). Additionally, we show that these general results are robust to variation in the overall bottleneck size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The clonal life cycle thus allows selection to act, albeit inefficiently, on group-survival beneficial mutations, while the aggregative life cycle is strongly biased in favor of capturing growth-enhancing mutations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Examining clonal vs. aggregative development in a simple model.</title><p>We examined the ability of organisms that develop clonally or aggregatively to fix mutations that increase growth rate (<bold>A</bold>) or group survival (<bold>B–D</bold>).

Using a simple yeast model system, in which we engineered either an aggregative life cycle or one in which groups develop clonally, we used experimental evolution to examine how developmental mode impacts this evolutionary transition in individuality. Our two strains each differ from the common ancestor by a single mutation (loss of <italic>ACE2</italic> for snowflake yeast, and gain of <italic>FLO1</italic> functionality for floc), highlighting how initially trivial differences in the mode of group formation may underpin divergent evolutionary trajectories. The clonal multicellular life cycle, but not aggregation, allowed for efficient multicellular adaptation in response to selection on group-level traits, suggesting that in these populations there was a shift in the level of Darwinian individuality.</p><p>While both clonally-developing snowflake yeast and aggregative floc evolved to settle faster in response to settling selection (forming larger, faster-settling clusters or flocs, respectively), only snowflake yeast showed a shift in the balance of selection from cells to groups. When competing evolved isolates against their ancestor, we found that snowflake yeast improved their fitness mainly during settling selection (a phase of the culture cycle that primarily reflects group-level properties), not the growth phase of the experiment (a period of the culture cycle that mainly reflects changes in cellular growth rate). Floc yeast adapted in the opposite manner, gaining a majority of their fitness increase during the growth phase, with little detectable increase in fitness during settling selection. When floc cells aggregate, they form groups with a genetic composition resembling the population as a whole. This low genetic assortment diminishes the ability for group-level selection to drive evolutionary change, impeding the transition to multicellular individuality.</p><p>The differential pattern of mutations in floc and snowflake yeast, informed by a simple mathematical model, highlights another significant impact of the mechanism of group formation: the rate of genetic drift. In floc yeast, natural selection efficiently acted on novel mutations, with fewer synonymous and intergenic mutations than expected by chance, and more missense mutations than expected by chance. As our method detects a divergence in the proportion of each mutation type from neutrality, these results could either be the result of selection against synonymous and intergenic mutations, selection for missense mutations, or both. While synonymous mutations may be non-neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shen et al., 2022</xref>), the vast majority of mutations that fix during microbial experimental evolution are nonsynonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bailey et al., 2021</xref>), as these are often subject to positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Good et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>). When we query all putative loss of function mutations that arose in our experiment in a genome-wide deletion collection grown on galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giaever et al., 2002</xref>), we find that 46% of the mutations in floc are predicted to increase growth rates on this carbon source, in contrast to just 35% in snowflake yeast. This is consistent with selection on mutations affecting cellular growth rate being more efficacious in floc than snowflake yeast.</p><p>Snowflake yeast, on the other hand, showed no statistical deviation from the expectations of neutrality. While initially surprising, this finding is consistent with group formation and selection playing a more central role in their evolution. Our model demonstrates that clonal development allows selection on group-level traits to be more efficacious, but simultaneously drives a much a higher overall rate of genetic drift, due to the higher probability that novel mutants will be lost during the group selection phase of the experiment. This result echoes prior theoretical work showing that the effective population size in a metapopulation is greatly reduced by strong among-deme selection, limited migration, and a small number of colonizing cells relative to carrying capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Whitlock and Barton, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Our model highlights how the severity of genetic bottlenecking due to clonal development scales with organismal size, with larger organisms exacerbating drift. Relative to the standards of most extant multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Mooers, 1997</xref>), snowflake yeast are small. As a result, the realized disparity between clonal and aggregative development in many organisms may be considerably greater than what was observed in this paper. It is not yet clear what impact this has on the evolution of complex multicellularity. Reducing the ability for selection to act efficiently on cell-level fitness (i.e<italic>.</italic> growth rate) may relax constraints on the evolution of novel group-level traits that come at a cost to growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herron et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, relaxed selection can facilitate a broader search of potential trait space, which may open up novel adaptive routes that would have been constrained by strong selection. This may be especially important during an evolutionary transition in individuality, as the nature of the organism is being fundamentally reshaped and genotypes are presumably far from potential fitness optima. Indeed, relaxed selection appears to have played a central role in the evolution of larger and more complex genomes within eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lynch and Conery, 2003</xref>), freeing these populations from the ruthless efficiency of strong purifying selection.</p><p>While floc and snowflake yeast differ starkly in evolutionary mode, our experiment was too short to examine long-term evolutionary consequences. Large scale change is possible in our system, but the evolution of macroscopic size appears to be much more challenging for snowflake yeast than in floc, requiring more innovation. Snowflake yeast must resolve fundamental biophysical challenges before they can form large groups, evolving larger size via three distinct biophysical mechanisms: reducing cellular density within clusters to limit cell-cell jamming, increasing the size and strength of the bonds connecting mother and daughter cells, and evolving branch entanglement so that group fracture requires breaking many cellular bonds, not just one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bozdag et al., 2023</xref>). These innovations took 400–600 serial transfers to evolve, and resulted in snowflake yeast that were 20,000 times larger than their ancestor, and 10,000 times more biomechanically tough. In contrast, evolving macroscopic size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) appears somewhat trivial for floc, likely due the relative ease and efficacy of increasing the strength of cell-cell adhesion.</p><p>There is an emerging consensus that clonal multicellular development provides the foundation upon which sustained multicellular adaptation may ultimately drive the evolution of dramatically increased multicellular complexity. This is supported by phylogenetic inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fisher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">King, 2004</xref>), first-principles theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tarnita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Márquez-Zacarías et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ratcliff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Gestel and Tarnita, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grosberg and Strathmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Queller, 2000</xref>), and now, experimental evolution. In this paper, we show that only clonally developing snowflake yeast exhibited a shift in Darwinian individuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Godfrey-Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rose and Hammerschmidt, 2021</xref>), such that multicellular groups were the primary unit of selection, with increased fitness arising mainly via the group-selection phase of the life cycle. Aggregative floc, in contrast, behaved as a social unicellular organism, adapting in both phases of the experiment, but low assortment limited the potential fitness benefits of selection acting on groups. Persistent low genetic assortment during group formation presents a challenge to this evolutionary transition, blunting the impact of group-level selection, enabling within-group genetic conflict, and ultimately inhibiting a shift in the level of Darwinian individuality from cells to groups.</p><p>And yet, aggregative multicellularity is clearly a successful life history strategy, evolving repeatedly in diverse lineages despite the issues described above. Our results thus raise a number of key questions for future research: how do lineages evolving aggregative multicellularity overcome the constraint of limited assortment? Is active kin recognition a pre-requisite to the evolution of multicellular individuality for aggregative life cycle, or can spatial structure generated by a patchy environment or viscous media like soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yanni et al., 2019</xref>) provide sufficiently high assortment for efficient, sustained multicellular adaptation? To this latter point, most lineages of aggregative multicellularity are terrestrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher et al., 2020</xref>) - does this reflect the potential of for a highly structured environment to scaffold the origin of aggregative multicellularity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Black et al., 2020</xref>), or are there simply more ecological opportunities for a biphasic life cycle in terrestrial habitats? We still have only a rudimentary understanding of how key components of early multicellular life cycles (e.g. developmental mode, level of genetic assortment within groups, type and strength of selection on cellular and group-level traits, etc.) influence the evolution of multicellular complexity. Developing a robust, bottom-up understanding of multicellular evolution from first-principles theory will require the integration of multiple approaches- including mathematical modeling, fieldwork, and experiments incorporating both synthetic and naturally evolved multicellular organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>Strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and the construction of these is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pentz et al., 2020</xref>.

To account for the fact that larger clusters contain more biomass, we calculated a biomass-weighted mean size for each population. To do so, we developed a Python script that divides the distribution of cluster size into 100 bins, then determines the proportion of the population’s total biomass that is found in each bin (sum of the FSC values for each cluster within that size range). This gives us a new distribution of the population’s biomass across the range of cluster sizes.

The population is well-mixed in this frame, so floc aggregates will result in optically dense regions while the planktonic culture (single cells that are not in flocs) will be less optically dense. Thus, higher flocculation efficiency will result in a higher variance in the pixel density between floc aggregates and planktonic cells. A custom Python script was used to calculate the maximum variance in pixel density on four biological replicates for each population. A histogram of pixel brightness of the two floc populations with highest flocculation efficiencies (populations F7 and F18, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) showed that pixel opacity does not saturate at either high or low pixel values representing cells in dense flocs or un-flocculated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), respectively, showing that this approach broad enough dynamic range to determine flocculation efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fitness competitions</title><p>To determine the fitness of evolved populations, a representative genotype was isolated from each population at the end of the experiment (24 weeks) by three rounds of single-colony selection on YPGal +Dex agarose plates (YPGal +Dex with 15 g/L agarose).

Thus, it is important to measure fitness in both of these important life history traits. To do so, we quantified the fitness of evolved isolates relative to their ancestor over one round of growth and one round of settling selection. Specifically, to initiate competitions, we inoculated 10 mL cultures of YPGal +Dex with isolates from each population as well as a GFP-marked ancestor and grown for 24 hr. Then, we mixed each of the evolved isolates in equal volumes with its marked ancestor (floc or snowflake), and 100 µL of this mixture was inoculated into 10 mL of YPGal +Dex to start competitions. For snowflake competitions, whole cluster counts of the GFP-tagged ancestor and evolved isolate were obtained via flow cytometry using a CyFlow Space flow cytometer where GFP and non-GFP clusters can be distinguished using the FL1 fluorescence channel. For floc competitions, flocs were deflocculated using 50 mM EDTA (pH 7) prior to running on the flow cytometer, and cell counts of the GFP-tagged ancestor and evolved isolate were obtained similar to snowflake competitions. Counts were obtained at time 0 and after 24 hr of growth to determine the fitness of the evolved isolate over one period of growth. To measure fitness over one round of settling selection, 2 mL of the overnight mixed culture was aliquoted into a microcentrifuge tube, and 500 µL was used to determine pre-selection counts. The remaining 1.5 mL was used to perform one round of settling selection (5 min on the bench), after which the top 1.4 mL was discarded.

To remove EDTA, which inhibits growth, strains were again centrifuged and resuspended in YP +1.8% galactose +0.2% dextrose. From this, 100 µL of each strain to be co-cultured were added to 10 mL of the same media to grow overnight at 30 °C.

Then, bcftools isec (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/samtools/bcftools">https://github.com/samtools/bcftools</ext-link>, v1.18, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002105">SCR_002105</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danecek et al., 2021</xref>) was used to filter out variants shared between the ancestor and evolved isolates, accounting for variants called due to aligning <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain Y55 used in our experiments to the S288C reference genome. Finally, bcftools isec was used again to identify unique variants for each evolved isolate. Variants were manually validated using the Integrated Genomics Viewer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>). Final validated variants were pooled and annotated using SnpEff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Next, we performed a bootstrap analysis to compare the classes of variants called experimentally to a randomly generated sample of SNPs to determine if different mutational classes are over- or underrepresented in our experimental populations. First, we used Mutation-Simulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kühl et al., 2021</xref>) to generate a null distribution of 100,000 random SNPs from across the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S288C genome and annotated using SnpEff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cingolani et al., 2012</xref>). Then, a custom Python script was used to perform a bootstrap analysis by first generating a random subsample of SNPs from the null distribution. The quantity of SNPs subsampled was equal to the pooled number of mutants seen experimentally for either snowflake or floc yeast (69 or 104 mutations, respectively). Next, we compared the number of SNPs in four mutational classes (missense, nonsense, synonymous/silent, and upstream gene variant) generated experimentally or simulated. We performed the bootstrap analysis 1000 times each for snowflake and floc yeast. Histograms for the number of simulated SNPs generated for different mutational classes in the bootstrap analysis can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> (experimental number shown as vertical blue and orange lines for snowflake and floc yeast, respectively). Finally, we determined the proportion (P) of runs where the # observed mutations &gt; # simulated mutations and the P # observed mutations &lt;simulated mutations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The code for the Python script is available at GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gabe-dubose/emus">https://github.com/gabe-dubose/emus</ext-link>; copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DuBose, 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mathematical modeling</title><p>We consider the survival and fixation of mutant lineages by distinguishing between two phases of the experiment between transfers: the population growth phase and the settling selection phase. During the population growth phase, we assume that both the mutant and ancestral lineages reproduce exponentially until the total population increases by a factor of 100, that is they reach the carrying capacity. So if the initial population is <italic>I</italic> and there are <italic>m</italic> mutants, we assume the population grows via <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> , where the sign of <italic>s<sub>c</sub></italic> determines whether the mutation is beneficial (<italic>s<sub>c</sub></italic> &gt;0) or deleterious (<italic>s<sub>c</sub></italic> &lt;0). We compute the number of mutants at carrying capacity and then place them in groups, according to whether we are simulating clonal or aggregative development. In the case of clonal development, we note that because of the branching pattern of snowflake yeast there can only be a maximum of one group that is mixed with mutant and ancestral lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ratcliff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Libby et al., 2014</xref>; all other groups with mutant cells are homogeneously mutant. We can simulate the distribution of mutants in groups of varying sizes by either tuning computational models of populations of snowflake yeast to fit experimental data or, instead, by directly using experimental data of group size distributions. We use the latter because it can easily be modified to consider aggregative development. Thus, for clonal development, we randomly select groups to place mutants. If there will be more mutant cells generated during growth (in this scenario, we are generating 100 mutant cells during the growth phase) than the size of the group, then the entire group is filled with mutant cells and a new group is selected to receive mutants, and so on until all mutant cells are allocated. In the case of aggregative development, we also use an experimentally derived distributions of group sizes but we select groups randomly weighted by their size to place individual mutant cells.</p><p>We simulate the settling selection phase of the experiment by randomly selecting groups weighted linearly by their size. For mutations that alter the survival of groups we assume that each mutant contributes an additional factor <italic>s<sub>g</sub></italic> to the size of the group, that is the weight of a group is its size plus <italic>s<sub>g</sub></italic>*<italic>m</italic>, or equivalently if there are <italic>n</italic> ancestral cells the weight is <italic>n</italic>+(1+<italic>s<sub>g</sub></italic>)*<italic>m</italic>. We then select groups randomly without replacement according to this weight until we have selected 1/100th of the population. If the number of cells exceeds 1/100th of the population we simply rescale the selected number of cells to fit. Following selection, we compute the number of surviving mutants and, if they exceed 0, we return to the growth phase. We iterate this process five times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of mutations found in evolved snowflake yeast isolates.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-84336-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of mutations found in evolved floc yeast isolates.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-84336-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84336-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Complete sequencing data for all clones is available and NCBI BioProject PRJNA907014.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Evolutionary consequences of nascent multicellular life cycles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Sara Mitri as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: María Rebolleda-Gómez (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>First, I would like to sincerely apologize for how long it has taken to get back to you. We are also sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Even though two reviewers were very positive about the paper, one maintained that there were flaws with the experimental design. The first issue is that previous work has already demonstrated that selection for settling selects for Snowflake, not Floc, which makes it unsurprising that Snowflake is fitter than Floc under these same selective conditions. The second main criticism was regarding the way in which the two strains were created: the use of the GAL1 promoter may disadvantage the FLO1 strain such that the observed results are not due to inherent differences between aggregative and clonal multicellularity but are instead due to differences in strain background. We hope that the reviews, in addition to the lengthy discussion, which I have appended below, will be useful for you to revise the paper and resubmit it elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I was very impressed by the experimental design and the scale of the experiments. My recommendations are all minor and/or because of interest, rather than being required for acceptance.</p><p>First, I found it interesting that the two strains differ only by 2 mutations. This means that the two potential evolutionary paths are actually very close together in origin. Does this have any significance for the evolution of multicellularity in yeast or is the selection regime too artificial to draw conclusions about these mutants in a natural environment? It might be interesting to add a few sentences on this to the Discussion section.</p><p>Another general comment I had was whether sedimentation is so obviously a group trait (L. 190-191). Although I am not so familiar with the literature, I know that this approach has been used for many years now, but is it that well-accepted? For example, the hydrodynamic profile was mentioned as something that could enhance sedimentation but sounds like an individual trait. This assumption is key to the whole conclusion of the paper, otherwise, it would not be justified to call it an evolutionary path towards multicellularity. In this sense, I find a bit strong in L. 460 to call selection for sedimentation &quot;a shift in biological individuality&quot;.</p><p>Even though there is a section entitled &quot;bottlenecks in the life cycle&quot;, bottleneck size is not being varied. Given that one of the main hypotheses of the model is that a strong bottleneck is what results in drift, it would be interesting to run a few more simulations to show that an increased bottleneck would lead to the stronger selection. The result is of course already known from the literature, but it would be good to verify that this occurs here.</p><p>A final point that could be discussed a bit more was the choice to pick single clones from each line. Is it possible that the single isolates you picked from each population may be cheaters, in particular in the floc lines? I understand that using 20 lines for each treatment protects to some extent against this, but it would be good to think about what this means statistically (e.g. if the majority of the population in an aggregate are cheaters, if there is some frequency-dependent selection, then in most lines you would miss the cooperators).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study has a few fundamental flaws that substantially limit what can be concluded.</p><p>1) The logic and interpretation of the selection and fitness experiments are circular.</p><p>1a) The logic of the experiment is circular. As demonstrated previously by the authors, settling/centrifugation-based selection overwhelmingly selects Snowflake, not Floc.</p><p>However, the key points of this paper, is that using this selection regimen, they find that Snowflake is fitter than Floc under these selective conditions. Thus, the authors use a roundabout way to demonstrate that this selective regimen selects for Snowflake, not Floc, a fact already demonstrated.</p><p>1b) Related to point #1a, the second issue not considered is developmental constraints. For reasons that are unclear, Floc- yeast overwhelming seems to be selected for Snowflake. Thus, the cellular arrangements that promote this morphology are part of the evolutionary fitness valley that this strain is in that is highly optimal for this selective regimen. Indeed, the authors describe this in excellent detail in the discussion (that cellular connections matter for evolving Snowflake vs. Floc). Likewise, Floc in this regimen selects for stronger Floc, which is also in a fitness valley of its own. The selection regimen pushes these further into their fitness valleys that are sub-optimal under these selective conditions. Thus, the authors are not comparing the fitness of cellular-based undifferentiated multicellular versus aggregative undifferentiated multicellularity, they instead are measuring the fitness differences of the valleys these selected strains are in (and pushed further into), which again, as in point #1a overwhelmingly selects for Snowflake, not Floc. Thus, comparing an evolved strain optimized for selective conditions versus an evolved strain sub-optimal to the selective conditions.</p><p>1c) The key missing experiment is to reverse the selection. I.e. put Snowflake and Floc into a selective regimen that selects for Floc and asks which strain is fitter. However, should Floc be fitter in these conditions, it would demonstrate the null hypothesis here, which is that &quot;you get what you select for&quot;. Without doing the experiment itself, however, interpreting the experiment as presented ends up being incomplete. This doesn't even get into more complicated selective regimens with something like predators and mouth/feeding size limits.</p><p>1d) One of the key points that do seem evident is that different modes of selection for the undifferentiated multicellular act at different levels (cell vs group). However, this is largely known as different developmental mechanisms of multicellularity are known to cell vs. group level selected. This experiment does demonstrate this point de novo, though the results are not unexpected.</p><p>2) This experiment, due to point #1, lacks generalizability. Modeling helps with generalizability, but I think empirical data is critical and easily obtainable here.</p><p>2a) Part of the way to address this would be by addressing point 1 above.</p><p>2b) The most logical experiment would be to repeat these experiments in a related system &quot;multicellular&quot; system under different selective conditions and ask which morphology is fitter. Some of the authors have previously selected multicellular <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Or transitioning the experiments to <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and selecting at different stages of its life cycle. One or both of these would be highly powerful in generalizing the potential findings.</p><p>3) What happens when selection is relaxed?</p><p>3a) One of the claims is that resources during growth vs. cell division are where selection is operating, but what happens when this is relaxed? Loss of the undifferentiated multicellularity at different rates when selection is relaxed would be highly informative as to which strain is fitter.</p><p>3b) One of the key things would be that in many organisms, motility will play a very large role in selection. As most unicellular Eukaryotes are motile (and their multicellular relatives – e.g. Chlamy and Dicty above), thus the fitness of group vs. individual may be substantially different when motility is taken into account.</p><p>3c) One potential aspect of this is the balance of epigenetic vs. genetic changes given the results of the genome re-sequencing analysis. I.e. group level trains may be selected at the genetic level, while epigenetic traits may be selected at the cellular level or vice-versa thereby complicating the conclusion of this work. The authors do indeed directly state this in lines 444-445 &quot;While floc and snowflake yeast differ starry in evolutionary mode, our experiment was too short to examine the long-term evolutionary consequences&quot;. Which, if these facts are unknown, makes interpretation of the findings in this paper difficult to place especially given the nature of only examining one selective condition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>L. 92: Given that you do not explain yet that you are selecting for sinking, this sentence comes a little out of the blue (there are many other possible drivers of multicellularity). And given the start of the next paragraph, maybe it makes sense to specify that size selection is performed through settling.</p><p>L. 147 How is this affected by cell density – I understand that you are using the coefficient of variation to standardize over different densities, but I wonder if your pixel opacity saturates at a certain density (this is not a problem in comparing your ancestor to evolved because the differences are very clear, but it could be a problem between similar looking flocculation efficiencies). I wonder if instead, you could normalize pixel heterogeneity by cell number in some way.</p><p>Figure 2. – Change the ancestor reference line to have smaller dashes, or make it a different color. Dashes are the same width as the error bars and very similar to the width of the bars in the bar plot, making it visually harder to read the plot.</p><p>Line 534 – How robust is the algorithm to bin size?</p><p>It is not clear to me how competitions of snowflakes were performed – cell counts on a flow-cytometer? How did you perform the counts?</p><p>Line 328 – explain better why this is the case</p><p>This is beside the point, but I found interesting the last sentence… how can one get at first principles from fieldwork? Fieldwork helps us constrain the parameter space to what happens in nature, but I do not know if it is possible to get first principles when many things are all varying at once.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84336.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

It might be interesting to add a few sentences on this to the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. We totally agree- these two paths, aggregation vs clonal development, are probably fairly close in origin in yeast. We explored just two mutational paths to get there, but there are many more (i.e., there’s a whole family of different flocculation genes, and mutations in many cell cycle genes result in snowflake-like clusters). However, it’s hard to say too much about the evolution of multicellularity in yeast in nature at this point- there’s still so much to learn about basic yeast ecology and their environmentally-dependent life cycles.</p><p>However, we think that your observation, that initially trivial differences in the mode of group formation can initiate divergent evolutionary dynamics that result in quite different long-term outcomes, is a general feature of clonal development vs. aggregation. The mechanistic underpinnings of either mode of group formation are likely relatively simple at first (e.g., its not hard to evolve to stick to other cells, forming aggregates, or remain attached after mitosis, forming clonal groups), even if the evolutionary dynamics that result from each mode of group formation are quite different. We added in a sentence to the discussion stating this explicitly:</p><p>Our two strains each differ from the common ancestor by a single mutation (loss of <italic>ACE2</italic> for snowflake yeast, and gain of <italic>FLO1</italic> functionality for floc), highlighting how initially trivial differences in the mode of group formation may underpin divergent evolutionary trajectories.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another general comment I had was whether sedimentation is so obviously a group trait (L. 190-191).

In this sense, I find a bit strong in L. 460 to call selection for sedimentation &quot;a shift in biological individuality&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point, and we don’t want to over-claim here. We are specifically referring to a type of biological individuality called “Darwinian individuality” by Peter Godfrey-Smith, which has been used quite elegantly as a framework for evolutionary transitions in individuality (see, for example, Rose and Hammerschmidt, 2021, Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution). Settling selection does indeed select directly on a group-level trait (speed of sedimentation), which can depend either additively or non-additively on underlying cell-level traits (see Bozdag 2023 Nature for a discussion of a non-additive case during longtermly evolution). However, it is important to clarify that it is not the selection on groups which indicates the origin of multicellular Darwinian individuality, but rather the capacity for the lineage to gain adaptations at that level via Darwinian evolution in response to this selection. While both snowflake and floc lineages underwent group-level selection during sedimentation, only snowflake yeast gained novel multicellular adaptations that increased fitness.</p><p>We clarified this in the paper by replacing “biological” individuality with “Darwinian”, and cite key papers on Darwinian individuality by Rose and Hammerschmidt, as well as Peter Godfrey-Smith.</p><p>The text was revised text is at line 475 and reads:</p><p>“In this paper, we show that only clonally-developing snowflake yeast exhibited a shift in Darwinian individuality<sup>21,41</sup>, such that multicellular groups were the primary unit of selection, with increased fitness arising mainly via the group-selection phase of the life cycle.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even though there is a section entitled &quot;bottlenecks in the life cycle&quot;, bottleneck size is not being varied. Given that one of the main hypotheses of the model is that a strong bottleneck is what results in drift, it would be interesting to run a few more simulations to show that an increased bottleneck would lead to the stronger selection. The result is of course already known from the literature, but it would be good to verify that this occurs here.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that we do not alter bottleneck size in the section entitled “bottlenecks in the life cycle”. Here the bottlenecks occur from the distribution of mutants across groups not necessarily the size by which the population contracts. Thus, clonal development experiences a stronger bottleneck than aggregation because its cells are in fewer groups. From this perspective, clonal development imposes the strongest bottleneck in terms of assortment and aggregation imposes the weakest—they are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p>Based on the reviewer’s comments it sounds like they are interested in the extent to which the population contracts from settling selection, which does impose a bottleneck. However, the model in this section of the paper uses an assumption that the population size does not experience a net change in size over a round of growth and settling selection. So if the population expands by a factor of <italic>X</italic> in growth, it will decrease by a factor of 1/<italic>X</italic> in settling selection. Based on our analytical model the probability a neutral mutant goes extinct is <italic>e</italic><sup>–<italic>kf</italic></sup>/(1–<italic>f</italic>), where <italic>k</italic> is the number of mutants and <italic>f</italic> is the fraction selected (which is 1/<italic>X</italic>). We note that if we start the growth round with 1 mutant there will be <italic>X</italic> afterwards which means <italic>k</italic>=<italic>X</italic>. Thus the (<italic>kf</italic>) term is <italic>X</italic> × <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 1which means that the probability a mutant goes extinct is simply <italic>e</italic><sup>–<italic>kf</italic>/(1–<italic>f</italic>)</sup> which equals <italic>e</italic><sup>–<italic>X</italic>/(<italic>X</italic>–1)</sup>, which is basically <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for <italic>X</italic> &gt; 25 =1 (the error in the approximation is about 4% and decreases as <italic>X</italic> increases). Increasing <italic>X</italic> which increases both the factor by which the population expands and the size of the bottleneck has a negligible effect on the probability that a mutant goes extinct. Thus, the bottleneck size in this section does not act like the reviewer’s expectation, but this is only because it also describes the extent to which the population expands in the growth phase.</p><p>That said, the factor <italic>X</italic> (which is both the bottleneck size and the extent to which the population expands) does have subtle effects on the graphs in Figure 5. We reran the simulations for <italic>X</italic>=50 and <italic>X</italic>=1000 (compared to <italic>X</italic>=100 in the original). We include them here along with the added Figure caption. One notable change is that the proportion of <italic>sg</italic> mutants that go extinct in aggregative life cycles decreases for <italic>X</italic>=1000 as compared to <italic>X</italic>=100 (see Figure 5B and 5C and J and K below) due to the odds of having multiple mutants in the same group increasing. This can greatly increase the probability that their group will survive. This same effect causes <italic>sg</italic> mutants to spread faster in both life cycles (see Figure 5D and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In addition, to make this clearer, we have change the title of this Results section to (line 329):</p><p>“Life cycles result in different genetic bottlenecks: modeling adaptation in aggregative and clonally developing life cycles”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A final point that could be discussed a bit more was the choice to pick single clones from each line.

As you said, we chose single-strain isolates so that our experiments would be reproducible, and we could correlate variation in behavior with genome sequence data. Given that our experiment is highly replicated, this approach should be quite robust to sampling error associated with selecting non-representative genotypes from these populations.</p><p>As for cheating, this is an interesting question. We generally don’t see any evidence for cheating in our system, as there are not ready public goods that are available for exploitation. Over 12 years of working on snowflake yeast, we’ve never seen a putative cheat (and indeed, cannot imagine what one would do to cheat in that system). Floc formation might be cheatable if a strain produced less Flo1 protein and yet found its way into groups of high Flo1 producers, but overall we do not see evidence for a reduction in flocculation efficiency. Quite the contrary, 19/20 of our Floc isolates evolve to flocculate more strongly, which is not consistent with cheating being common in these populations. Interestingly, flocculation was lost entirely in one population (line 20), which could have been due to pressure from a non-flocculating cheat. This is a question a new postdoc in our lab is examining, though to be clear, we do not have any data that suggests that cheats exist yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study has a few fundamental flaws that substantially limit what can be concluded.</p><p>1) The logic and interpretation of the selection and fitness experiments are circular.</p><p>1a) The logic of the experiment is circular.

Indeed, the authors describe this in excellent detail in the discussion (that cellular connections matter for evolving Snowflake vs. Floc). Likewise, Floc in this regimen selects for stronger Floc, which is also in a fitness valley of its own. The selection regimen pushes these further into their fitness valleys that are sub-optimal under these selective conditions. Thus, the authors are not comparing the fitness of cellular-based undifferentiated multicellular versus aggregative undifferentiated multicellularity, they instead are measuring the fitness differences of the valleys these selected strains are in (and pushed further into), which again, as in point #1a overwhelmingly selects for Snowflake, not Floc. Thus, comparing an evolved strain optimized for selective conditions versus an evolved strain sub-optimal to the selective conditions.</p><p>1c) The key missing experiment is to reverse the selection. I.e. put Snowflake and Floc into a selective regimen that selects for Floc and asks which strain is fitter. However, should Floc be fitter in these conditions, it would demonstrate the null hypothesis here, which is that &quot;you get what you select for&quot;. Without doing the experiment itself, however, interpreting the experiment as presented ends up being incomplete. This doesn't even get into more complicated selective regimens with something like predators and mouth/feeding size limits.</p><p>1d) One of the key points that do seem evident is that different modes of selection for the undifferentiated multicellular act at different levels (cell vs group). However, this is largely known as different developmental mechanisms of multicellularity are known to cell vs. group level selected. This experiment does demonstrate this point de novo, though the results are not unexpected.</p></disp-quote><p>The first issue is that previous work has already demonstrated that selection for settling selects for Snowflake, not Floc, which makes it unsurprising that Snowflake is fitter than Floc under these same selective conditions.</p><p>We do not actually compare the fitness of snowflake to floc in this paper, and we never claim that snowflake are more fit than floc (rather, we claim that, relative to their respective snowflake and floc ancestors, snowflake evolve to significantly increase their fitness during settling selection while floc do not). Further, floc yeast do not suffer any limitation in their ability to respond to settling selection. In fact, they actually respond better to this selection than snowflake yeast do.</p><p>The point that “settling/centrifugation-based selection overwhelmingly selects Snowflake, not Floc” likely stems from Pentz et al. (2021), where we compared the floc to snowflake yeast in competition. There, we found that snowflake yeast interacted with floc in a way that gave them an advantage during settling selection by nucleating flocs around themselves. In this paper, all of our competition experiments are done in isolation. Floc and snowflake yeast never interact directly. All fitness measures are relative to that strain’s own ancestor (i.e., evolved floc vs ancestral floc, and evolved snowflake vs. ancestral snowflake). In fact, we show in this paper that floc yeast <italic>readily</italic> respond to settling selection. While floc and snowflake started out settling at a similar rate, over 24 weeks of evolution, floc evolve to settle much more quickly than snowflake yeast, increasing by 1200%, while snowflake only increase by 30%. See Figure 1B:</p><p>Furthermore, the fitness of evolved floc yeast greatly improves (more than snowflake!) under our experiment regime, with a ~20% average fitness increase over three days of direct competition against their own floc ancestor with daily selection for settling (third panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The central argument of our paper is that, despite the evolution of fast sedimentation and increased fitness in floc, this group-level trait did not increase their fitness during settling selection in a measurable way when competing evolved yeast against their own floc ancestor. In contrast, snowflake yeast only increased in settling speed by 30% over the same 24 weeks, but this greatly increased their fitness during settling selection when competing against their own snowflake ancestor (see first two panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This is a result of how group formation (clonal development vs. floc) changes the ability for group-level selection to impact fitness: group-level selection is far more efficient in clonal groups than aggregative flocs, due to the much higher assortment of genotypes in clonal groups. Flocs form groups that contain both evolved and ancestral genotypes, so group-level selection does little to change allele frequencies. This result does not stem from confounding issues with how we did our experiment, but is a result of the difference in assortment between clonal and aggregative multicellular organisms. This is a fundamental result with broad applicability to the evolution of multicellularity, as it helps contextualize the differences in how aggregative and clonal multicellular organisms have evolved.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84336-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We clarified this in the main text, by adding in overall fitness data for floc and snowflake to Figure 3 (new data in the left panel of A), which makes it clear that floc is adapting more rapidly to these conditions than snowflake yeast.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This experiment, due to point #1, lacks generalizability.

Some of the authors have previously selected multicellular <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. Or transitioning the experiments to <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and selecting at different stages of its life cycle. One or both of these would be highly powerful in generalizing the potential findings.</p></disp-quote><p>While we would love to see the development of other model systems to address these important evolutionary questions, the experiments we conducted here cannot be done in any other model system. To the best of our knowledge, it is not currently possible to engineer otherwise isogenic genotypes of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> or <italic>Dictylostelium</italic> to form clonal groups or aggregative groups. Even if one knew how to do this, to engineer and evolve a different model system is surely the purvey of another paper- not a condition of acceptance for this paper. It would be, at a minimum, several years of work and several hundred thousand dollars of research costs, and only if it were even possible to do. This is a ‘what about-ism’ that is not germane to our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What happens when selection is relaxed?</p><p>3a) One of the claims is that resources during growth vs. cell division are where selection is operating, but what happens when this is relaxed? Loss of the undifferentiated multicellularity at different rates when selection is relaxed would be highly informative as to which strain is fitter.</p></disp-quote><p>Understanding how simple multicellularity is lost under relaxed selection is an interesting question, but this would not say anything about which strain is fitter. It is a different question entirely. To understand the fitness of floc and snowflake yeast, you have to measure fitness. Which we did, in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3b) One of the key things would be that in many organisms, motility will play a very large role in selection. As most unicellular Eukaryotes are motile (and their multicellular relatives – e.g. Chlamy and Dicty above), thus the fitness of group vs. individual may be substantially different when motility is taken into account.</p></disp-quote><p>Motility can be important for some multicellular organisms, but it is not part of our well-controlled evolution experiment. This is a ‘what about-ism’ that is not germane to our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3c) One potential aspect of this is the balance of epigenetic vs. genetic changes given the results of the genome re-sequencing analysis. I.e. group level trains may be selected at the genetic level, while epigenetic traits may be selected at the cellular level or vice-versa thereby complicating the conclusion of this work. The authors do indeed directly state this in lines 444-445 &quot;While floc and snowflake yeast differ starry in evolutionary mode, our experiment was too short to examine the long-term evolutionary consequences&quot;. Which, if these facts are unknown, makes interpretation of the findings in this paper difficult to place especially given the nature of only examining one selective condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that we do not attempt to disentangle the genetics of cell vs group-level adaptation in this paper (and doing so would be very non-trivial), adding in epigenetic data would not change our conclusions. This is a ‘what about-ism’ that is not germane to our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>L. 92: Given that you do not explain yet that you are selecting for sinking, this sentence comes a little out of the blue (there are many other possible drivers of multicellularity).

I wonder if instead, you could normalize pixel heterogeneity by cell number in some way.</p></disp-quote><p>Great point! There may be a degree of pixel saturation in regions with high cell densities (e.g., really dense flocs). Thus, we generated a histogram of pixel brightness from representative images of the two flocciest isolates (populations F7 and F18, see Figure 2G). The pixel opacity doesn’t seem to saturate at high pixel values representing cells in tight flocs or low pixel values representing cells in the planktonic culture, suggesting we have dynamic range to determine flocculation efficiency utilizing this approach, see panel C in Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>Additionally, cell densities are similar in each population as they are taken from stationary phase cultures (an average of 4.1x10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL with a standard deviation of 1.3x10<sup>7</sup> cells/mL; see first panel A in Figure 2—figure supplement 2).

We’ve run a sensitivity analysis by analyzing the flow data with various bin sizes.

We have edited the text to make this more clear, pasted below, at line 576:</p><p>“For snowflake competitions, whole cluster counts of the GFP-tagged ancestor and evolved isolate were obtained via flow cytometry using a CyFlow Space flow cytometer where GFP and non-GFP clusters can be distinguished using the FL1 fluorescence channel.
