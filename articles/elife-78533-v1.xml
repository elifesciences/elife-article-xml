However, assessing the impact of homologous recombination on accessory genes which are only present in a subset of strains of a given species remains challenging due to their complex phylogenetic relationships. Quantifying homologous recombination for accessory genes (which are important for niche-specific adaptations) in comparison to core genes (which are present in all strains and have essential functions) is critical to understanding how selection acts on variation to shape species diversity and genome structures of bacteria. Here, we apply a computationally efficient, non-phylogenetic approach to measure homologous recombination rates in the core and accessory genome using &gt;100,000 whole genome sequences from <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and several additional species. By analyzing diverse sets of sequence clusters, we show that core genes often have higher recombination rates than accessory genes, and for some bacterial species the associated effect sizes for these differences are pronounced. In a subset of species, we find that gene frequency and homologous recombination rate are positively correlated. For <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and several additional species, we find that while the recombination rate is higher for the core genome, the mutational divergence is lower, indicating that divergence-based homologous recombination barriers could contribute to differences in recombination rates between the core and accessory genome. Homologous recombination may therefore play a key role in increasing the efficiency of selection in the most conserved parts of the genome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM097356</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kussell</surname><given-names>Edo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Simons Foundation Awardee of the Life Sciences Research Foundation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Preska Steinberg</surname><given-names>Asher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional Files</title><sec id="s3" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Lists of SRA accession numbers corresponding to the raw reads used to build the multi-sequence alignments analyzed in this manuscript are included as Figure 2 - source data 1 and Figure 3 - source data 1.

For the PubMLST sequence collections, PubMLST was used to identify whole genome sequences (by filtering for strains in the 'Genome Collection' of each species where the sequence length is at least that of the reference genome), then the raw reads were downloaded from NCBI using their SRA numbers.
