Despite this requirement, how acinar cells are generated during organogenesis is unclear. Using the acini-ductal network of the developing human and murine salivary gland, we demonstrate an unexpected role for SOX2 and parasympathetic nerves in generating the acinar lineage that has broad implications for epithelial morphogenesis. Despite SOX2 being expressed by progenitors that give rise to both acinar and duct cells, genetic ablation of SOX2 results in a failure to establish acini but not ducts. Furthermore, we show that SOX2 targets acinar-specific genes and is essential for the survival of acinar but not ductal cells. Finally, we illustrate an unexpected and novel role for peripheral nerves in the creation of acini throughout development via regulation of SOX2. Thus, SOX2 is a master regulator of the acinar cell lineage essential to the establishment of a functional organ.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26620.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26620.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26620.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The salivary glands produce fluid that contains enzymes to help us to digest our food. These glands contain a tree-like network of cells – known as acinar cells – that produce the fluid, and cells that form ducts to transport the fluid out of the glands. Both types of cells form from stem cells as animal embryos develop. Like all developing organs, the salivary glands receive many different signals that guide how they grow. However, the identity of the cues that instruct a stem cell to produce a new acinar cell or duct cell are not known.</p><p>Emmerson et al. studied how the salivary glands develop in mouse embryos. The experiments show that a protein called SOX2 – which is an essential regulator of stem cells in embryos – is required for acinar cells to form. Loss of SOX2 inhibited the production of acinar but not duct cells. Furthermore, nerves that surround the gland provide support to cells that produce SOX2 and promote the formation of acinar cells.</p><p>Further experiments suggest that the nerves also play the same role in humans. Adult organs often use developmental signals to repair or regenerate tissue. As such, understanding how an organ develops may lead to new therapies that can stimulate salivary glands and other organs to regenerate after they have been damaged in adults.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26620.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26620.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>organogenesis</kwd><kwd>SOX2</kwd><kwd>acinar cells</kwd><kwd>epithelial morphogenesis</kwd><kwd>parasympathetic nerves</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE024188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emmerson</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name><name><surname>May</surname><given-names>Alison J</given-names></name><name><surname>Nathan</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name><name><surname>Cruz-Pacheco</surname><given-names>Noel</given-names></name><name><surname>Knox</surname><given-names>Sarah M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emmerson</surname><given-names>Elaine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Establishment of the acinar lineage in the salivary gland requires SOX2 and parasympathetic nerves.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acinar cells are essential to the function of exocrine organs including the pancreas, tracheonasal glands and salivary glands. These cells produce a mucin and/or protein-rich fluid that is transported through an interconnected ductal network to the external surface where it serves multiple roles including the protection and function of the epithelial mucosa. Although there have been extensive studies on the mechanisms of branching morphogenesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mattingly et al., 2015</xref>), the process by which most mammalian exocrine organs develop, very little is known about the mechanisms that control acinar cell development. Moreover, the factors required for the establishment of the acinar lineage in the developing salivary gland are not known.</p><p>As for the majority of exocrine organs, salivary gland acinar and duct cells form through the expansion and differentiation of a simple cuboidal epithelium. In the submandibular salivary gland (SMG), the most characterized of the three major salivary glands (considerably less is known about the development of the sublingual (SLG) and parotid (PG)), this begins with invagination of the epithelium into the condensing mesenchyme to form a single end bud containing SOX10-positive pre-acinar cells by embryonic day (E)12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lombaert et al., 2013</xref>). Branching of the single bud into 3–5 KIT-positive end buds occurs between E12.5 and E13.0 and is followed by rapid expansion and further differentiation between E13.5-E15.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lombaert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walker et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Acinar cell differentiation can be monitored by temporal expression kinetics of genes including aquaporin (AQP) 5 at E14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Family Member A15 (MIST1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pin et al., 2001</xref>) and demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) at E15.0; submandibular gland protein C (SMGc)/mucin 19 (MUC19) and parotid secretory protein (PSP) at E16.0, and MUC10 at E17.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>). In conjunction with acinar cell development is formation of the ductal lineage, which is marked initially by KRT19 at E12.0, followed by KRT7 at E13.5 (before lumenization) and prominin-1 at E14.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nedvetsky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walker et al., 2008</xref>). Both acinar and duct cells are derived from a reservoir of undifferentiated basal KRT5+ progenitors that are essential to SG development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>). However, the mechanisms regulating specification of KRT5+ cells toward these two lineages or how the proportion of duct to acinar cells is controlled are unknown.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26620.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SOX2 marks a progenitor cell population in the salivary gland that gives rise to acinar and duct cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing markers of acinar and duct cells at E12 and E15.

The SMG and SLG receive innervation from the parasympathetic submandibular ganglion that forms at E12.0 through coalescence of neuronal cell bodies around the primary duct. The ganglion begins to innervate newly forming end buds and ducts from E12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>), with unidirectional axon outgrowth from the ganglion toward the end buds being mediated by neurturin/GFRa2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knox et al., 2013</xref>). Acetylcholine is produced as soon as the ganglion forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coughlin, 1975</xref>) and activates muscarinic receptors on the epithelium to maintain an undifferentiated stem cell population marked by KRT5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to this function, muscarinic activation also induces epithelial branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Knox et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2010</xref>) but whether parasympathetic nerves are specifically required for the generation of the acinar lineage is unknown.</p><p>Using the acini-ductal network of developing murine and human salivary glands in combination with in vivo and ex vivo studies, we reveal that SOX2 is specifically required to generate the acinar cells necessary for the creation of a secretory organ. We show that SOX2 is essential for the establishment and survival of acinar cells and that its expression and the proliferative expansion of SOX2-positive cells depend on neuronal acetylcholine signaling by parasympathetic nerves. As such, we identify SOX2 as a master regulator of the salivary acinar cell lineage and uncover a conserved peripheral nerve-based mechanism for selectively generating the secretory acinar cell lineage during organogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>SOX2 is an important transcriptional regulator of development and maintenance in multiple organs including trachea, oesophagus and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gontan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Okubo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Que et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2007</xref>). In the murine E13 embryo, SOX2 is expressed by the invaginating oral epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), throughout the epithelium of the SLG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the proximal duct of the SMG and the developing parasympathetic ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lombaert and Hoffman, 2010</xref>). Genetic lineage tracing at E10.5 indicated that SOX2-positive cells are progenitors giving rise to both duct and acinar cells of the SMG and SLG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2011</xref>). However, we found that SOX2 becomes restricted to a subpopulation of AQP5+ acinar cells in the postnatal and adult SLG, the most poorly understood of the three major salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>), suggesting that SOX2 might function in the expansion and/or maintenance of the acinar lineage.</p><p>To study the role of <italic>Sox2</italic> in salivary gland morphogenesis, a tamoxifen-inducible Cre under the control of the epithelial <italic>Krt14</italic> promoter was used to ablate <italic>Sox2</italic> prior to the onset of gland ontogenesis (E10.5; see extensive loss of SOX2 expression in epithelia but not the ganglion in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Unexpectedly, despite SOX2-positive cells giving rise to both acinar and duct cells, genetic ablation of <italic>Sox2</italic> had a profound effect on the generation of acini but not ducts. The number of end buds in the SMG and SLG was significantly reduced from early stages of development and onwards, with the SLG exhibiting little to no branching (E13 to E16.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). Conversely, duct morphology, the number of KRT19-positive ductal cells and ductal gene transcripts <italic>Krt7</italic>, <italic>Krt19</italic> and <italic>Egfr</italic>, which are required for ductal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Häärä et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>), were similar to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, by E16.5, the number of SOX10-positive progenitors and differentiated AQP5-positive and MIST1-positive acinar cells were severely reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Given SOX10 expression was lost upon ablation of <italic>Sox2</italic>, we performed lineage tracing in conjunction with <italic>Sox2</italic> ablation to determine if SOX10 was specifically lost in cells derived from those in which <italic>Sox2</italic> was ablated (<italic>Krt14<sup>CreERT2</sup>;Sox2<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup></italic>). In this model, cells in which Cre recombinase has been activated (and consequently <italic>Sox2</italic> ablated) will be labeled with membrane-bound GFP+ (green), whereas cells where no recombination has occurred will retain membrane-bound Tomato (mT, red). We found that only ~5% of end bud cells deficient in <italic>Sox2</italic> expressed SOX10 or AQP5 in comparison to control glands (<italic>Krt14<sup>CreERT</sup>;Rosa26<sup>mTmG</sup>)</italic> in which &gt;90% express SOX10 or AQP5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We then determined whether SOX2 could directly regulate <italic>Sox10</italic> using ChIP-qPCR analysis of E17.5 SG. This time point was chosen due to the small size of the tissue limiting our analysis at earlier time points. We found significant enrichment of SOX2 within a specific region of the <italic>Sox10</italic> promoter (promoter region A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that SOX2 may promote the generation of the acinar lineage via transcriptional control of <italic>Sox10</italic>. Combined, these data indicate that the maintenance of SOX10-positive acinar progenitor cells and the generation of differentiated AQP5-positive acinar cells are dependent on SOX2.</p><p>Previous studies in other organ systems show that a deficiency in SOX2 results in a cell fate switch (23–26]). However, we did not find any evidence that <italic>Sox2-</italic>deficient cells in the end buds divert toward a duct cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, GFP+ cells do not express early ductal marker KRT19), indicating that the reduction in epithelial branching was not due to the accumulation of the ductal lineage. Therefore, we addressed if loss of end bud cells and reduced morphogenesis in <italic>Sox2</italic>-deficient SMG+SLG were due to apoptosis. In the absence of <italic>Sox2,</italic> there were activated Caspase-3-positive cells in the end buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>) and increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes (<italic>Bax, Bbc3</italic> and <italic>Pmaip1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>) at E16.5. Apoptosis was specific to end bud cells as no apoptosis was observed in the ducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting a preferential requirement for SOX2 in end bud cell survival. In addition to increased apoptosis, the proliferation of end bud cells was decreased ~70% in E16.5 salivary glands lacking <italic>Sox2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>; Ki67+ cells).

At this stage of development, the undifferentiated oral epithelium has begun to invaginate into the condensing mesenchyme. We observed an increase in apoptotic cells in the invaginating mutant epitheliums compared to wild-type controls (arrows indicate cleaved CASP3-p cells) but proliferation was not perturbed, suggesting that cell death rather than reduced proliferation impairs organ growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test if inhibiting apoptosis could rescue epithelial branching that is, cell death is a causative factor in the loss of morphogenesis, we cultured E11.5 mandibles from wild-type and <italic>Sox2</italic>-deficient embryos ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knosp et al., 2015</xref>) with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (50 µM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nedvetsky et al., 2014</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) for 60 hr.

Thus, these data reveal novel, independent roles for SOX2 in regulating epithelial cell survival and generating acini.</p><p>Our previous study indicated that KRT5+ progenitors are maintained in an unspecified state by parasympathetic nerves via acetylcholine/muscarinic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>). As a subpopulation of KRT5+ cells of the developing SMG co-express SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lombaert et al., 2011</xref>), we next asked if nerves also maintain SOX2+ progenitor cells by comparing SG where the ganglia had been mechanically or genetically ablated with nerve-containing controls. SMG+SLG in which the epithelium and mesenchyme was recombined without the ganglia and cultured for 48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>) exhibited a severe reduction in the number of acini, SOX2 protein and SOX2+ cells. However, not only were SOX2+ progenitors adversely affected, the acinar lineage was also greatly depleted in the absence of innervation. In the ganglia-free SG, we found a significant reduction in SOX10-positive acinar progenitors and differentiated AQP5-positive acinar cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>) compared to ganglia-containing controls. Similarly, acini, SOX10+ cells, <italic>Sox2</italic> and acinar gene expression were reduced in SMG+SLG derived from <italic>Phox2b</italic> mutant embryos that are deficient in the submandibular parasympathetic ganglion and other craniofacial ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). However, absence of innervation did not impair the expression of ductal marker KRT19 or ductal gene transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and F</xref>). Thus, peripheral innervation not only preserves the progenitor cell pool, as previously found, but also selectively preserves those progenitors that contribute specifically to the acinar cell lineage.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26620.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The acinar cell lineage and SOX2 are selectively depleted in the absence of parasympathetic nerves.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) E13 murine SMG+SLG cultured for 48 hr ± parasympathetic ganglion (nerves) and subjected to immunofluorescent analysis (<bold>A</bold>).

FACS analysis showed that 94% of the SOX2-positive epithelial cells in the SLG at E15.0 express the muscarinic receptor CHRM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), indicating that CHRM1 activation is a potential regulator of SOX2 cells. CHRM1 is also expressed throughout the epithelium including ~42% of SOX2-negative epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), indicating that this receptor is not exclusive to SOX2+ cells. In support of a direct role for muscarinic receptors in expanding SOX2+ cells, treatment of isolated E14.0 SLG epithelial rudiments devoid of nerves and mesenchyme with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (CCh) for 48 hr increased the number of SOX2+ cells as well as proliferating SOX2+EdU+ cells compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Furthermore, culture of mouse E14.0 SLG with the muscarinic antagonist 4-DAMP for 4 or 24 hr reduced SOX2 expression (gene and protein), the number of SOX2+ cells and SOX2+ cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Similar to the outcomes for SMG+SLG in which <italic>Sox2</italic> was ablated or nerves removed, inhibition of CHRM1 decreased end bud cell proliferation, differentiated AQP5-positive acinar cells and SOX10-positive acinar progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), whereas KRT19-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) or ductal lineage transcript levels were unchanged (<italic>Krt7)</italic> or increased (<italic>Krt19</italic> and <italic>Egfr;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In addition, there was decreased expression of acinar differentiation markers (<italic>Aqp5, Mist1</italic> and <italic>Chrm3;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, to determine if muscarinic activation was sufficient to restore the acinar lineage after denervation, we treated nerve-free SMG+SLG explants (containing mesenchyme) with CCh for 48 hr and compared to untreated ganglia-containing and ganglia-free controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, CCh was sufficient to return <italic>Sox2</italic> expression in the SLG, and restore AQP5+ cells, and transcript levels of acinar-specific genes including <italic>Sox10, Mist1</italic> and <italic>Aqp5</italic> to control levels in the SMG and SLG.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26620.022</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Muscarinic signaling regulates the acinar lineage and SOX2+ cells.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) E14 mouse SLG epithelia cultured with FGF10 ±CCh for 24 hr.

Culture of E14.0 SLG for 4 hr with the CaMK-II inhibitor KN-93 but not the EGFR inhibitor PD168393 decreased expression levels of <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In comparison, inhibition of EGFR or calcium signaling reduced expression of more differentiated acinar markers (<italic>Mist1, Aqp5</italic>) suggesting that early and late markers of salivary gland development are differentially regulated. In contrast, ductal genes were expressed at similar or higher levels than controls upon KN-93 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, CHRM1 and calcium signaling regulate epithelial SOX2 in the developing SLG and are required for generation of the acinar lineage.</p><p>Finally, we investigated whether neuronal signaling was an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for generating acini and preserving SOX2+ progenitors by analyzing the impact of nerves and muscarinic activation on SOX2 and the acinar lineage in human tissue. Although the murine and human glands differ in gross morphology, they undergo similar stages of morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Teshima et al., 2011</xref>) and are highly innervated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Due to the paucity of expression data on human fetal salivary gland, we first characterized expression of acinar and duct markers as well as the location of CHRM1, SOX10 and SOX2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, CHRM1 protein and proliferating SOX2+ and SOX10+cells are enriched in the acinar compartment of all major human fetal salivary glands, including the parotid gland (PG). We confirmed that human SMG/SLG/PG acinar cells are also enriched in SOX10, CHRM1 and MIST1 as well as CD44 and AQP3 protein (acini do not express AQP5 protein at these stages) and that the duct cells express KRT7 in addition to EGFR, KRT5, KIT and KRT14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, KRT19 was expressed in both acini and ducts, indicating that it is not a bona fide ductal marker in fetal human tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine if parasympathetic nerves promote acinar cell formation in developing human gland, we developed a co-culture assay in which human fetal SLG explants were mixed with murine ganglia or mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Unlike mice, the innervating human ganglion resides outside the organ and the tissue is thus denervated upon dissection. Co-culture of human SLG (20–22 w) with E13.0 parasympathetic ganglia for 7 days resulted in extensive remodeling and innervation of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). As for the murine SLG, innervation increased expression of SOX2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) as well as of acinar markers <italic>MIST1</italic> (~5–7 fold), <italic>AQP3</italic> (~1.6–1.9 fold), <italic>CHRM1</italic> (~2–10 fold) and <italic>CHRM3</italic> (~2.5–3.4 fold) compared to mesenchyme alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; n = 2 fetuses). Consistent with the hypothesis that parasympathetic nerves preferentially regulate the acinar lineage, levels of ductal gene transcripts <italic>KRT5, KRT7, KRT14</italic>, <italic>KIT</italic> and <italic>EGFR</italic> were similar to human SLG co-cultured with mesenchyme only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26620.031</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Parasympathetic regulation of SOX2 and the acinar lineage is conserved from mice to humans.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescent analysis of TUBB3+ nerves as well as SOX2-, SOX10-, CHRM1- and EGFR-expressing cells in fetal human submandibular (SMG) or sublingual (SLG) at 16–24 w.

As for the murine SLG, CCh treatment was sufficient to increase the expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> and acinar cell markers in human explants as well as dissociated cells (consisting of epithelium and mesenchyme; 20–22 weeks (w) of gestation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>). Furthermore, CCh treatment promoted SOX2-positive cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). CCh also increased expression of <italic>KRT5</italic> which is enriched in basal duct cells of human tissue and myoepithelial cells, suggesting these cell types are regulated by CHRM1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>). Thus, muscarinic stimulation is sufficient to rescue the acinar cell lineage and SOX2 expression and to promote the proliferation of SOX2-positive cells in the developing human SLG. Combined, these data support a conserved role for cholinergic innervation in the generation of the acinar lineage from mice to humans.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrates a critical role for SOX2 in the generation of the acinar lineage during SG development. SOX2 acts as a master regulator of the acinar lineage by modulating the expression of lineage-specific genes and controlling both cell proliferation and survival. However, SOX2 function in acinar cell production is dependent on parasympathetic nerves that maintain its expression via acetylcholine-muscarinic-calcium signaling. The observation of similar outcomes in the human SG-nerve co-culture system provides strong evidence that the regulation of SOX2 and acini by innervation is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that regulates the generation of acinar cells.</p><p>SOX2 also regulates cell lineage commitment in other organs such as the pituitary and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andoniadou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Driskell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldsmith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lesko et al., 2013</xref>). In the pituitary, loss of SOX2 expression in progenitors leads to a switch in cell fate between the two closely related cell types, melanotrophs and corticotrophs, in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Goldsmith et al., 2016</xref>). In the adult skin, SOX2 is expressed in dermal papilla cells that give rise to the three hair follicle subtypes and ablation of <italic>Sox2</italic> alters the proportion of these subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Driskell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lesko et al., 2013</xref>). Despite SOX2+ progenitors contributing to acini and ducts in the SMG+SLG, we unexpectedly found that <italic>Sox2</italic> is only required for the specification of the SOX10-positive acinar lineage. However, in contrast to the cell fate switch observed in the pituitary and skin, <italic>Sox2</italic>-deficient cells in the end buds do not divert to ductal cell fates. This suggests that acquisition of a duct cell fate requires active re-specification and that ductal identity is not the default cell fate in the absence of SOX2 or innervation. This contrasts with a previous proposal that progenitor cells, in the absence of induction, simply differentiate into duct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>). This conclusion is corroborated by recent genetic lineage-tracing studies in the adult SG showing that acinar cells give rise to more acinar cells but not duct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aure et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, despite SOX2 being expressed by some duct cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lombaert et al., 2011</xref>) and SOX2-positive cells being able to contribute to ducts during development, SOX2 functions in cell specification are limited to the acinar lineage.</p><p>How salivary acinar cells are established in the SG is not known. However, acinar cell expansion in the developing SG has previously been shown to be regulated by FGF10/FGFR2b signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lombaert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>). This indicates that FGF10/FGFR2b signaling is either adversely affected by loss of SOX2 or that SOX2 acts downstream of this pathway. As we did not observe a loss of FGF signaling in <italic>Sox2</italic>-deficient SMG+SLG and FGF10/FGFR2b signaling reduces SOX2 expression in isolated SMG epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lombaert et al., 2011</xref>), we conclude that SOX2 acts downstream of FGF signaling. As such, FGF signaling most likely regulates the differentiation of SOX2-positive acinar progenitors and/or their proliferative expansion.</p><p>SOX2 has been shown to promote the survival of cancer cells in vivo and has been linked to lens cell survival in Astyanax surface fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boumahdi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Herreros-Villanueva et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2014</xref>), but a role for SOX2 in cell survival during mammalian organogenesis has not been reported. In this study, we reveal that genetic ablation of <italic>Sox2</italic> but not denervation or muscarinic inhibition, which reduces but not eliminate SOX2, is sufficient to trigger cell death in the SMG+SLG. This is likely due to the levels of SOX2 remaining in epithelial cells from denervated or muscarinic receptor antagonized salivary glands being conducive to cell survival, although single-cell expression analysis is required to confirm such a mechanism. Levels of SOX2 may also influence lineage outcomes. It is possible that SOX2 may be activated in formerly SOX2-negative cells in response to cholinergic stimulation thereby specifying the acinar lineage. However, as both acinar and duct cells express SOX2, there must be other regulators at play besides SOX2 that specify this lineage. Furthermore, despite both duct and acinar cells expressing SOX2 during early gland development, apoptosis was restricted to cells in the end buds, which points to an essential and selective role of SOX2 in promoting survival of the acinar but not ductal lineage. A direct role for SOX2 in cell survival is supported by chromatin precipitation studies in skin tumor cells where a number of survival genes were directly regulated by SOX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boumahdi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We, and others, have previously shown that peripheral nerves maintain progenitors in an undifferentiated state, providing a pool of unspecified cells for developmental or regenerative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2015</xref>). We have also shown that nerves, through release of vasoactive intestinal peptide, regulate duct formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nedvetsky et al., 2014</xref>). Our current study demonstrates an unexpected role for peripheral innervation in furnishing the ductal system with acini to form a functional organ. Multiple signaling pathways such as those of the WNT and EGFR families have been reported to control epithelial differentiation and consequently tissue structure in a diverse range of organs. However, compared to neuronal signals that continuously operate during all stages of salivary gland (and organism) development, these cell/tissue intrinsic pathways tend to be transient in appearance, for example, FGF10 regulates acinar cell proliferation but is only expressed during early branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Steinberg et al., 2005</xref>). As such, peripheral nerves offer a way of shaping tissue architecture throughout the development of the organism, thereby providing continuity of signals during tissue morphogenesis.</p><p>In summary, our findings support a critical role for SOX2 and nerves in establishing the secretory end units of the salivary gland, thereby selectively generating the tissue architecture necessary for organ function. Given the majority of mammalian organs receive innervation from parasympathetic ganglia, and loss of functional innervation alters epithelia and/or epithelial stem cells in multiple organs including those that express SOX2 such as taste buds, prostate and seminar vesicles, stomach and cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Suzuki, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tatsuta et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ueno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wanigasekara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), our results may have significant implications for gaining insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying lineage specification and architectural outcomes in diverse systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse lines</title><p>All procedures were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

id="s4-11"><title>RNA-sequencing</title><p>RNA was isolated from whole tissue using RNAqueous Micro Kit (Ambion) and total RNA samples were DNase-treated (Ambion). Samples were processed for sequencing using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA sample kit (Illumina) using 0.5 ug of total RNA as starting material. First strand synthesis was performed using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher). Sample yield and integrity was analyzed using a Qubit (Thermo Fisher) and samples run on a 2% agarose gel. 5 nM RNA was submitted for sequencing on the Illumina platform. Reads of between 32,000 and 47,000 were obtained (n = 2 individual embryos for each genotype).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Embryonic mouse SGs (CD1; E15.5-E16.5) or human fetal SG tissue (22–23 w) was dissected and washed in PBS containing gentamycin. Cell isolation and flow cytometry was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muench et al., 2002</xref>). Briefly, a single-cell suspension was created by mincing tissue with a scalpel blade and incubating in a PBS solution containing Liberase TM (Roche) and DNaseI (Roche) at 37°C for 30–60 min. The enzyme reaction was quenched by the addition of FCS or BSA and the solution filtered through a 40 µm strainer (BD Falcon) and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min. The resulting cell pellet was washed with sterile PBS, centrifuged and resuspended in blocking buffer (5% serum and 0.01% NaN<sub>3</sub>, Biolegend). Cell surface staining was achieved by incubating cell suspensions with antibodies against CD324 (ECAD; eBioscience, 46-3249-80; AB_1834418), CD326 (EpCAM; Miltenyi, 130-098-113; AB_2660298) and CHRM1 (Santa Cruz, sc-7470; AB_2079955). Subsequently, intracellular staining was achieved following fixation and permeabilization using an intracellular staining kit (eBioscience) and antibodies against SOX2 (mouse: BD Pharmingen, 562195; AB_10895118; human: R and D Systems, IC2018P; AB_357273) and Ki67 (mouse: Biolegend, 652405; AB_2561929; human: Biolegend, 350513; AB_10959326). Flow cytometry was performed on a LSRII (BD) using the appropriate single stained controls and data collected using FACSDiva (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo. 100, 000 events were collected for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR</title><p>Embryonic SGs were collected at E17 from two female CD1-ICR mice and pooled in DMEM on ice. Tissue was dissociated into a single-cell suspension as for flow cytometric analysis. ChIP was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lizama et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, cells were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde, quenched with 0.125 M glycine and resuspended in lysis buffer. The chromatin was sonicated using a Biorupter sonicator (Diaganode). Rabbit anti-SOX2 antibody (Cell Signaling, #2748) or rabbit IgG control (Cell Signaling, #2729) was incubated with Pierce Protein A/G magnetic beads (Thermo Scientific) overnight at 4°C. The precipitates were washed and chromatin complexes eluted. The cross-linking was reversed (65°C for 4 hr), and the DNA was purified (QIAquick PCR Purification kit, Qiagen). 100 pg of DNA was used per PCR reaction. Primers used in PCR for quantitative ChIP are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>.<table-wrap id="tbl3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26620.039</object-id><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Sequences for primers used for SOX10 ChIP-qPCR.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26620.039">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26620.039</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Primer</th><th valign="top">Forward primer sequence</th><th valign="top">Reverse primer sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">A</td><td valign="top">GTGGAGGTTTGTTGATGGA</td><td valign="top">TTTGCGATGGGAGAGTCTGA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">B</td><td valign="top">ACAGTCAGAACCTGTTGCCT</td><td valign="top">TGATACCTACTGCAGGCTGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">C</td><td valign="top">GCAGCCTGCAGTAGGTATCA</td><td valign="top">CTTCTTGAAGAGTAGGGC</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">D</td><td valign="top">AAAAGACAGGAACTGCCCTG</td><td valign="top">AAGGGTGCCTTCACTGAGAA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">E</td><td valign="top">GATAGTGGGGACACAAAGAG</td><td valign="top">TCCTAATTCACTGGGCTCTG</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">F</td><td valign="top">TCTTGTTCGGGGCCTTGAAA</td><td valign="top">ATGCTTGCTGCTCCGTCCCT</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">G</td><td valign="top">AGACATCAATGAGCAGCAGG</td><td valign="top">CGCACACACACACTTTCCTA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>Data were analyzed for statistical significance using Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (two groups), one-way ANOVA (multiple groups) with post-hoc testing performed using Dunnett or Tukey tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (GraphPad Prism or SPSS).

The authors use a combination of state-of the art genetic lineage tracing in mice, molecular analysis and genetic deletion to show that <italic>Sox2</italic> marks precursors for acinar cells in the gland and necessary for the development of the gland. ChIP experiments confirm that Sox10 is a potential transcriptional target of <italic>Sox2</italic> in these progenitor cells. The authors further link neural regulation of <italic>Sox2</italic> progenitors. Overall, the study has clarified that <italic>SOX2</italic> is required for acinar cell maintenance and expansion but not ductal cells at the stages analysed, and that this expansion depends on ACh signalling from parasympathetic ganglia.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the authors should analyze proliferation and apoptosis in more detail.</p><p>The data suggest that apoptosis is involved in the <italic>Sox2</italic> null phenotype given the increase in caspase+ cells in the glands lacking Sox 2 but inhibition of apoptosis signaling does not rescue the buds. Can the decrease in acinar cell numbers be attributed only to a proliferation defect or additionally to (i) loss of acinar fate or (ii) a reduction in primordium size at earlier stages? At which point are defects first apparent? Results for proliferation at E16.5 demonstrate a clear reduction, but how soon after deletion at E10.5 is the proliferation defect detected? The survival experiments indicate that apoptosis is not responsible for this reduction in mutants, but the timing of the experiment is not clear- is there any possibility that a bout of apoptosis has already taken place shortly after deletion, prior to the effects of the ZVAD treatments?

Perhaps a caspase 3-specific inhibitor would be more effective (M-791)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26620.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>The reviewers agreed that the authors should analyze proliferation and apoptosis in more detail.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The data suggest that apoptosis is involved in the Sox2 null phenotype given the increase in caspase+ cells in the glands lacking Sox 2 but inhibition of apoptosis signaling does not rescue the buds.

We have performed additional experiments at earlier time points to delineate between apoptosis and proliferation as a cause of reduced primordium size. We find that apoptosis in the <italic>Sox2</italic>-deficient epithelium occurs as early as E11.5, 24 h after tamoxifen injection and the time at which the epithelium invaginates into the mesenchyme. However, proliferation at this stage is similar to the control. We also show that apoptotic markers, as well as reduced branching, are apparent by E13. We have added this additional data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B and F</xref>. These new data suggest that reduced size is due to an initial round of cell death, presumably after recombination at or after E11.</p><p>We apologize that the description of the methods for the mandible cultures was not clear. We isolated mandible slices at E11.5 following recombination at E10.5 (we assume recombination takes place at E11 given the need to activate tamoxifen) and immediately cultured these mandibles with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK thereby preventing any further apoptosis. The dose of Z-VAD used here has already been optimized in the salivary gland ex vivo model (Nedvetsky et al., 2014) and we are confident in the efficiency of inhibition, as shown by the absence of cell death in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. As we found that inhibition of cell death from E11.5 does not increase the number of acini, we conclude that <italic>SOX2</italic> regulates both cell survival and morphogenesis.</p><p>We have added text to the manuscript to clarify the timing of the phenotype (apoptosis and proliferation is included) as well as the timing of the cell death inhibitor assay as follows:</p><p>“As both apoptosis and reduced proliferation were apparent at E16.5, and there was reduced branching and increased apoptotic markers at E13-E13.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B and F</xref>) to further delineate between mitosis and cell death as a cause of reduced growth we analysed tissue at E11.5 (Cre induction at E10.5 by injection of tamoxifen). […] Thus, these data reveal novel, independent roles for <italic>SOX2</italic> in regulating epithelial cell survival and generating acini.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
