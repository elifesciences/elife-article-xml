The trafficking of LDLR is highly regulated in clathrin-dependent endocytosis, endosomal recycling and lysosomal degradation. Current studies focus on its endocytosis and degradation. However, the detailed molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying its endosomal recycling are largely unknown. We found that BLOS1, a shared subunit of BLOC-1 and BORC, is involved in LDLR endosomal recycling. Loss of BLOS1 leads to less membrane LDLR and impairs LDL clearance from plasma in hepatocyte-specific BLOS1 knockout mice. BLOS1 interacts with kinesin-3 motor KIF13A, and BLOS1 acts as a new adaptor for kinesin-2 motor KIF3 to coordinate kinesin-3 and kinesin-2 during the long-range transport of recycling endosomes (REs) to plasma membrane along microtubule tracks to overcome hurdles at microtubule intersections. This provides new insights into RE’s anterograde transport and the pathogenesis of dyslipidemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LDL receptor</kwd><kwd>endosomal recycling</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>kinesins</kwd><kwd>BLOS1</kwd><kwd>dyslipidemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0802104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31830054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91954104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Chanjuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91539204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDA12030211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shui</surname><given-names>Guanghou</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81670789</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hao</surname><given-names>Chanjuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BLOS1 is a new regulator of LDLR endosomal recycling through coordinating kinesins during long-range transport, and depletion of BLOS1 in mouse liver leads to aberrant lipid metabolism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is essential for cellular uptake of cholesterol-carrying low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and plays a crucial role in cholesterol homeostasis in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goldstein and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldstein and Brown, 2015</xref>). After the binding of LDL on the cell surface, LDLR enters early endosomes through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and is further recycled to the cell membrane by the RAB4-dependent fast recycling pathway or the RAB11A-dependent slow recycling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ullrich et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van der Sluijs et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wijers et al., 2015</xref>). In the slow recycling pathway, receptors are first sorted into the perinuclear endocytic recycling compartment (ERC) and then transported to the cell periphery by recycling endosomes (REs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Naslavsky and Caplan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamashiro et al., 1984</xref>). Due to the long distance in trafficking, the slow recycling pathway is subjected to complex regulation. Factors including RAB11A effectors (RAB11-FIPs) and Eps15-homology domain-containing proteins (EHDs) participate in the trafficking from early endosome (EE) to the ERC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Horgan and McCaffrey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Naslavsky and Caplan, 2011</xref>).</p><p>N-kinesins, the motor proteins that drive anterograde transport on microtubules, have also been reported to function in slow recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). A kinesin-3 member KIF13A cooperates with RAB11A to generate and drive the peripheral transport of RE tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delevoye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nakagawa et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, KIF13A is essential for cargo delivery from RE to maturing melanosomes in melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delevoye et al., 2009</xref>). KIF16B, another member of kinesin-3, functions in regulating the motility of early endosomes and degradation of EGF receptor, and in the transcytosis of transferrin receptor (TfR) in polarized epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoepfner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perez Bay et al., 2013</xref>). A kinesin-2 member KIF3B has also been implicated in the recycling of TfR through the interaction with RAB11-FIP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schonteich et al., 2008</xref>). Whether and how these different kinesins coordinate in the transport of REs are largely unknown.</p><p>BLOS1 is a shared subunit of BLOC-1 (biogenesis of lysosome-related organelles complex-1) and BORC (BLOC-one-related complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scott et al., 2018</xref>). BLOC-1 is required for the biogenesis of cell-type-specific lysosome-related organelles, such as melanosomes in melanocytes and dense granules in platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei and Li, 2013</xref>). BORC recruits ARL8 and couples lysosomes to kinesins for anterograde transport on specific microtubule tracks, and mediates the trafficking of synaptic vesicle precursors in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Niwa et al., 2017</xref>). There is increasing evidence that BLOC-1 is involved in the formation of endosomal tubular structures through cooperation with microtubule- and actin-associated machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delevoye et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ryder et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that BLOS1 regulates LDLR recycling in hepatocytes. BLOS1 acts as an adaptor of kinesin-2 and coordinates kinesin-2 and kinesin-3 in the anterograde transport of REs. Dysfunction of kinesin-2 or BLOS1 results in impaired trafficking of REs and KIF13A-positive tubular structures characterized by impassability at specific microtubule-microtubule intersections. Consequently, liver-specific <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> knockout mice exhibit reduced LDLR in the liver and elevated plasma LDL levels due to alternative lysosome degradation of LDLR after impaired endocytic recycling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Liver-specific knockout of <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> in mice leads to abnormal lipid metabolism</title><p>Previous studies have shown that constitutive knockout of <italic>Bloc1s1</italic> in mice produces embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).

Considering that many important constituents of plasma are secreted by liver, we examined plasma samples of cKO mice and their control littermates by non-reduced SDS-PAGE analysis. Although there were no changes in several abundant plasma proteins, such as albumin and transferrin, a protein band at about 34 kD was consistently increased in plasma samples from cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Mass spectrometry identified this protein as apolipoprotein E (ApoE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>), and immunoblotting confirmed the increase of ApoE in cKO mice plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>).</p><p>ApoE is a core protein component of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). For this reason, lipoproteins in plasma samples from cKO and loxp mice were pre-stained with Sudan Black B and then separated by gradient native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Using lipoproteins purified from pooled mouse plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation, we determined different lipoprotein bands in native gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>, left). We observed that in cKO mouse plasma, VLDL level was decreased, LDL was increased, and HDL had a tendency to increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). Native gels subjected to Oil Red O staining also showed similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>, right). The reduction of VLDL in cKO plasma apparently could not account for the increase of ApoE content. We wondered whether ApoE is increased in the HDL fraction of lipoproteins. To address this point, we separated unstained lipoproteins from cKO and loxp mice using native gels, and then performed a second dimensional SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting to the gel slices of target lanes containing separated lipoproteins. Indeed, we observed that there was more ApoE in the HDL slice of cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, these results suggest that cKO mice have abnormal lipid metabolism, mainly characterized by reduced lipid droplets in the liver, and altered plasma lipoprotein compositions with increase of LDL, reduction of VLDL, and increase of ApoE in HDL.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BLOS1 deficiency reduces membrane LDLR in hepatocytes</title><p>Despite the reduced VLDL content, a common constituent of LDL and VLDL, ApoB, was significantly increased in cKO mouse plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), suggesting that increase of LDL in cKO mouse plasma was likely the main effect of BLOS1 deficiency on lipoproteins. VLDL is largely converted to LDL in plasma. The reduced VLDL in cKO mouse plasma is unlikely the major cause of increased LDL. Liver is the primary site for plasma LDL clearance, the accumulation of LDL in cKO mouse plasma suggested that LDL clearance by cKO mouse liver could be impaired. To test this hypothesis, we examined the endocytosis of LDL in primary hepatocytes using purified mouse LDL labeled with DiI (LDL-DiI). We observed that LDL endocytosis in cKO hepatocytes was reduced at the initial stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>), suggesting that less LDL binds to the cell membrane of cKO hepatocytes. We then detected the LDLR protein level by immunoblotting.

Three motor proteins (KIF3B, KIF13A, and KIF16B) from the kinesin superfamily, which have been reported to function in the anterograde transport of vesicles in endocytic system, were taken as candidates. Among these three KIF proteins, KIF3B belongs to the kinesin-2 family, while KIF13A and KIF16B are classified in the kinesin-3 family.

When REs (and associated LDLR) arrive at specific microtubule-microtubule intersections, their motion will be paused by steric hindrance. At these sites, through the interaction with kinesin-3 (KIF13A) and LDLR, BLOS1 (and kinesin-2 heterodimers) assists the REs in overcoming obstacles probably by switching between microtubule protofilaments and finally causing the rotation of cargo along the microtubule surface. Dysfunction of KIF3 or BLOS1 results in the inability of REs to pass through these sites and frequently backward movements at specific microtubule intersections.

The role of BLOS1 in this process is considered to be independent of BLOC-1 or BORC for the following reasons: (1) neither BLOC-1-deficient <italic>pa</italic> mice nor BORC-deficient <italic>Kxd1</italic>-KO mice showed reduced LDLR level; (2) <italic>KIF3A</italic>-KD cells resembled BLOS1-deficient phenotype both in LDLR level and abnormal movement of REs, indicating a kinesin-2-related function. But it remains possible that BLOS1 deficiency caused by dysfunction of BORC may further enhance LDLR degradation due to the proximity of ERC and perinuclearly clustered lysosomes since it has been reported that clustering LEs/lysosomes at the MTOC would generally enhance aggregate degradation and macroautophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Korolchuk et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>As for the complexity in kinesin motors and cargoes, it has been reported that one kinesin could use different adaptor proteins for various cargoes and different kinesins may transport one cargo on distinct microtubule tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guardia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirokawa et al., 2009</xref>). We found here that KIF3 functions downstream of KIF13A in the same trafficking pathway of REs. This observation expands knowledge of how cargoes are transported by kinesins. We suspected that BLOS1 plays a key role in the cargo switch between KIF3 and KIF13A. First, BLOS1 could interact with both KIF3 and KIF13A, and thus acts as a bridge between these two motor proteins. Second, considering the fact that KIF3 lacks cargo-binding domain, BLOS1 could act as an adaptor for a cargo protein and then switch it with KIF13A through their interaction. Thus, we thought that the interaction between BLOS1 and KIF13A is important and necessary for the cargo switch between kinesins for passing through obstacles.</p><p>Previous <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that microtubule intersections may serve as the pausing site for cargoes transport by kinesins when the size of cargoes are comparable to intersection spacing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bálint et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Verdeny-Vilanova et al., 2017</xref>), and it has been suggested that both the intersection geometry and motor number influence cargo routing at these intersections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erickson et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, members of the heterodimeric kinesin-2 subfamily switch protofilaments during their processive movements, which may contribute to the overcoming of microtubule obstacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunnbauer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoeprich et al., 2017</xref>). Such off-axis mode motion of cargoes were also observed at microtubule intersections in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Verdeny-Vilanova et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, in the context of recycling endosome trafficking, KIF3 may be used to pass through these intersections by protofilament switching. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that BLOS1 puncta showed similar off-axis mode motion during the time period of live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video2">2</xref>). Although we found that KIF3 (and BLOS1) is essential for the circumvention of these intersections after paused anterograde transport of recycling endosomes, the detailed mechanism needs further investigation. It may involve other microtubule-associated proteins and the geometry changes of microtubule intersections. Three possible choices of cargo transport at the microtubule intersections are: 1) continuing movement after bypassing the hurdles, 2) switching to other microtubules by changing directions or destinations, 3) moving backward to the original site.

of the LDL receptor. Depletion of BLOS1 in mouse liver leads to reduced hepatocyte lipid droplets and elevated plasma LDL level, thus revealing an unexpected link between endosomal trafficking and lipid metabolism. Moreover, this study showed that BLOS1 acts as an adaptor for kinesin-2, which could be a new function of BLOS1 independent of BLOC1 and BORC complexes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;BLOS1 mediates kinesin switch during endosomal recycling of LDL receptor&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors described a defect of LDL clearance in liver-BLOS1-KO mice and found it was caused by reduced LDLR on cell surface due to the interrupted recycling endosome transport mediated by motor kinesin-3 and kinesin-2. Authors propose that BLOS1 served as the adaptor to switch the motors at microtubule intersections for recycling endosome long-range anterograde transport to cell periphery.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The distribution of LDLR and KIF3A should be shown in BLOS1 KO cells.</p><p>2) The co-localization of BLOS1 with LDLR, Rab 11A, and KIFs should be examined in primary hepatocytes.</p><p>3) Figure 4A: The authors showed the peripheral distribution of LDLR in the WT primary hepatocytes.

BLOS1 served as the adaptor to switch the motors at microtubule intersections for recycling endosome long-range anterograde transport to cell periphery. The novelty of this manuscript is BLOS1-caused dyslipidemia and BLOS1 acts as an adaptor for kinesin-2, which could be new functions of BLOS1 independent of BLOC1 and BORC complexes. The manuscript was well written, and most figures were well organized to convey the information. To make the hypothesis more convincing, there are several concerns:</p><p>1) The authors have shown PCSK9 level in the liver tissue of cKO mice (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). PCSK9 is a secreted protein and initiates the function to LDLR in plasma. Could the authors also test PCSK9 level in the plasma?</p><p>2) The authors have nicely shown LDLR is tightly associated with KIF13A (Figure 4C and E). Overexpressing KIF13A could accumulate the cargos LDLR and TfR at cell tips (Figure 3B, Figure 4B and D). It looks like KIF13A did not closely associate with BLOS1 (Figure 5D), and overexpressing KIF13A did not accumulate BLOS1 at cell tips (Figure 3K) as what happened to LDLR (Figure 4B). It could be explained as the model: KIF13A delivered LDLR and then passed the cargo to BLOS1-KIF3. After that, did KIF3-BLOS1 continue to transport LDLR to plasma membrane or turn the cargo back to KIF13A? If it's the former one, it is surprising that overexpressing KIF3A and KIF3B didn't bring much LDLR to cell tips, though a lot BLOS1 was brought there (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). So how important of BLOS1-KIF3 is in KIF3A-mediated LDLR transport? Could the authors show KIF3A and LDLR (or TfR) distribution in BLOS1 KO cells like in Figure 4D? If the endogenous proteins were too low to detect in the KO cells, could the authors try cDNA constructs?</p><p>3) Compared to KIF13A, KIF3 has much more affinity to BLOS1 (Figure 5D), but not very strong associated with LDLR (Figure 5B). Could the author test how KIF3A-R will affect KIF13 and LDLR? Another experiment the authors could consider is quantifying cell pheriphery-localized LDLR with and without overexpression of KIF3A, KIF3B, and BLOS1, like in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><p>4) Continuing to the first and second questions, the affinity between KIF13A and LDLR and between BLOS1 and KIF3A have been clearly shown, but the connection between these two chains was not directly addressed. In Figure 6, the authors addressed the defect of KIF3A and BLOS1 affected RE transport, but Rab11A was used as the RE marker. The authors did not show if the &quot;active RE&quot; that contains Rab11A is LDLR positive. In Figure 4H, KIF13A-R immobilized some of Rab11A, but there was still a lot of Rab11A not localized with KIF13A-R. In addition, dose Rab11A regulate the interactions of KIF13A-LDLR and/or BLOS1-KIF3A?</p><p>5) Is Figure 7C a 2D imagining?

Could the author characterize the BLOS1 puncta and tubule structures in the primary hepatocytes by co-staining BLOS1 with the cargo proteins and the motor proteins?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) The most concern of this reviewer is the discrepancy between data taken using primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. (i) LDLR vesicles were accumulated in the cell periphery in primary hepatocytes; however, they showed dispersed pattern in HepG2 cells (Figure 4A). (ii) Although KIF13A bound to BLOS1 in primary hepatocytes (and HEK293 cells) (Figure 3J,K), KIF13A did not bind to BLOS1 but bound to RE and LDLR to carry LDLR to the cell periphery in HepG2 cells (Figure 4D-J, Figure 5D). The authors concluded mainly from the data using HepG2 cells. Generally speaking, a primary culture is a more faithful tissue cell model than a cell line, and when their results do not match, those of primary culture is more reliable. In addition, the accumulation of LDLR to the cell periphery is not observed in HepG2 cells. Therefore, this reviewer believes that HepG2 cells are not suitable in analyzing the transport of LDLR from RE to the cell periphery.

But we found that, although some BLOS1 signals occurred at the cell periphery, the distribution of LDLR was not obviously compromised (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D). Thus, the former model is not supported by our observation.

This phenomenon is consistent with our previous results. We showed in our manuscript that overexpression of KIF3A, KIF3B or BLOS1 didn’t significantly affect LDLR distribution like what KIF13A did. Even co-overexpression of KIF3A, KIF3B and BLOS1 did not obviously redistribute LDLR (see reply to the second comment).

We updated a newer version of Figure 4H and Figure 4-video 1 (see revised Figure 4 and new Figure 4—video 1), as the details of KIF3B-R rigor near the cell periphery were not well detected in the original movie. For the involvement of Rab11A in KIF13A-LDLR or BLOS1-KIF3A, we didn’t have any direct evidence. We suspect that Rab11A should play some role in the overall process of LDLR transport by KIF13A, since Delevoye et al. reported that Rab11A interact with KIF13A, and is required for the periphery distribution of overexpressed KIF13A (Delevoye et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is Figure 7C a 2D imagining?

For the reason of BLOS1 tubules occurred in only primary hepatocytes, we thought that it may be related to the different pattern of LDLR distribution in these two kinds of cells. We found that the peripherally distributed LDLR in primary hepatocytes were mostly located on clathrin-coated vesicles (labeled by clathrin light chain A, CLTA), while only a portion of LDLR were colocalized with CLTA (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B), which means that LDLR in primary hepatocytes were recycled faster to the cell membrane to achieve their physiological role to recycle the majority of low-density lipoproteins in plasma. In our model, BLOS1 is used to overcome obstacles in the process of LDLR recycling. We suspect that the tubular distribution of BLOS1 in primary hepatocytes represents the dense distribution of BLOS1 along microtubules to ensure smooth and fast recycling of LDLR to the plasma membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) The most concern of this reviewer is the discrepancy between data taken using primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells.

Considering that most of LDLR in primary hepatocytes locates on clathrin-coated vesicles, it is very difficult to catch every recycling step in such a fast recycling system. In addition, we observed that LDLR in <italic>Hep</italic> G2 cells partially colocalizes with clathrin-coated vesicles, early endosomes (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C) and recycling endosomes, suggesting that <italic>Hep</italic> G2 cells may be a suitable model to observe the LDLR recycling process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 4A: The authors showed the peripheral distribution of LDLR in the WT primary hepatocytes.

This phenomenon has been reported by other literature (Delevoye et al., 2016; Delevoye et al., 2014).
