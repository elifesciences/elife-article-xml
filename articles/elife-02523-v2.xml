pathologies. Pharmacological agents that inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity with high potency have long been sought, but have remained elusive. In this study, we report that the small molecule erastin is a potent, selective inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>. RNA sequencing revealed that inhibition of cystine–glutamate exchange leads to activation of an ER stress response and upregulation of <italic>CHAC1</italic>, providing a pharmacodynamic marker for system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition. We also found that the clinically approved anti-cancer drug sorafenib, but not other kinase inhibitors, inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function and can trigger ER stress and ferroptosis. In an analysis of hospital records and adverse event reports, we found that patients treated with sorafenib exhibited unique metabolic and phenotypic alterations compared to patients treated with other kinase-inhibiting drugs. Finally, using a genetic approach, we identified new genes dramatically upregulated in cells resistant to ferroptosis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02523.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02523.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02523.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sugars, fats, amino acids, and other nutrients cannot simply diffuse into the cell. Rather, they must be transported across the cell membrane by specific proteins that stretch from one side of the cell membrane to the other. One such ‘transporter’—system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>—is of special interest. This transporter imports one molecule of cystine from outside the cell in exchange for one molecule of glutamate from inside the cell. Cystine, a variant of the amino acid cysteine, is essential for synthesizing new proteins and for preventing the accumulation of toxic species inside the cell. Not surprisingly, many cancer cells are dependent upon the transport activity of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> for growth and survival. Drugs that can inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> could therefore be part of potential treatments for cancer and other diseases.</p><p>Dixon, Patel, et al. have found that the compound erastin is a very effective inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function. Certain versions of erastin are over 1000 times more potent than the previously known best inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>, sulfasalazine. Dixon, Patel et al. found that using erastin and sulfasalazine to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> in cancer cells grown in a petri dish results in an unusual type of iron-dependent cell death called ferroptosis. By inhibiting the uptake of cystine, erastin and other system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibitors interfere with the cellular machinery that folds proteins into their final, three-dimensional shape. The accumulation of these partially-folded proteins in the cell causes a specific kind of cellular stress that can be used as a readout, or biomarker, for the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>. Such a biomarker will be essential for identifying cells in the body that have been exposed to agents that inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> and that are undergoing ferroptosis.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Dixon, Patel et al. also found that the FDA-approved anti-cancer drug sorafenib inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>. Other drugs in the same class as sorafenib do not share this unusual property. Dixon, Patel, et al. synthesized variants of sorafenib and identified sites on the drug that are necessary for it to be able to interfere with system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>. Alongside the erastin derivatives, these new molecules may help to develop new drugs that can inhibit this important transporter in a clinical setting.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02523.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02523.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>reactive oxygen species</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>SLC7A11</kwd><kwd>cystine</kwd><kwd>sorafenib</kwd><kwd>erastin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brent Stockwell Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stockwell</surname><given-names>Brent R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01CA097061, 5R01GM085081 and R01CA161061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stockwell</surname><given-names>Brent R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>New York Stem Cell Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C026715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stockwell</surname><given-names>Brent R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1K99CA166517-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dixon</surname><given-names>Scott J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Erastin and sorafenib inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> and induce ER stress, suggesting these may be useful tools for probing the functions of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> and its role in inducing ER stress and ferroptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transporters for small molecule nutrients, including sugars, nucleotides, and amino acids, are essential for cellular metabolism and represent potential targets for drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hediger et al., 2013</xref>). System x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> is a cell-surface Na<sup>+</sup>-independent cystine–glutamate antiporter composed of the 12-pass transmembrane transporter protein SLC7A11 (xCT) linked via a disulfide bridge to the single-pass transmembrane regulatory subunit SLC3A2 (4F2hc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conrad and Sato, 2012</xref>).

Aberrant system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function is implicated in tumor growth and survival, cancer stem cell maintenance, drug resistance, and neurological dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Okuno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckingham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ishimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Timmerman et al., 2013</xref>); inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> may prove useful in a number of therapeutic contexts.</p><p>Efforts to treat gliomas and lymphomas in human patients by modulating system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity with the low potency, metabolically unstable small molecule, sulfasalazine (SAS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gout et al., 2001</xref>), were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robe et al., 2009</xref>). While some progress has been made toward developing more potent compounds based on the SAS scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shukla et al., 2011</xref>), the identification of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibitors based on alternative scaffolds remains a pressing need and would be useful to test the hypothesis that system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition is therapeutically beneficial in glioma and other contexts. We previously demonstrated that the small molecule erastin prevents Na<sup>+</sup>-independent cystine uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that erastin may inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function and represent a novel scaffold targeting this transport system. Intriguingly, treatment of some cell lines with erastin or SAS triggers an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic form of cell death, termed ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). Ferroptosis is characterized by the accumulation of intracellular soluble and lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS), a process that is counteracted by the glutathione-dependent activity of the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dixon and Stockwell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Erastin, and other ferroptosis-inducing compounds of this class, are therefore of interest both for their effects on amino acid transport and their ability to induce a novel cell death pathway.</p><p>In this study, we show that erastin and its analogs specifically inhibit cystine uptake via system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>, trigger ferroptosis in a variety of cellular contexts and act much more potently than SAS. Surprisingly, we found that the clinically approved multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib can also inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> and trigger ferroptosis under some conditions, an observation that may be relevant to both the anti-cancer properties and the profile of adverse events associated with this drug. We further show that small molecule inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as indicated by the transcriptional upregulation of genes linked to the ER stress response. The upregulation of the ER stress response gene <italic>CHAC1</italic> (ChaC, cation transport regulator homolog 1) serves as a useful pharmacodynamic marker of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition. Finally, we found that resistance to system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition is correlated with dramatically increased expression of <italic>AKR1C</italic> family members that regulate the detoxification of oxidative lipid breakdown products, providing potential insight into the downstream consequences of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition, and the execution mechanism of ferroptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Consistent induction of ferroptosis in various cells under a variety of growth conditions</title><p>Erastin and SAS were previously shown to trigger ferroptosis in human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells grown on two-dimensional substrates with atmospheric levels of oxygen (i.e., 21% oxygen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). We endeavored to generalize and validate the lethality of erastin towards cancer cells in several ways. First, we tested whether the same effects were observed in other cell types using a ‘modulatory profiling’ strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolpaw et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). This method allows for the simplified detection and presentation of small molecule combination effects on cell viability (modulatory effect, M<sub>e</sub> &lt; 0, sensitization; M<sub>e</sub> = 0, no effect; M<sub>e</sub> &gt; 0, rescue). We observed that in five different human cancer cell lines, cell death induced by either erastin or SAS was rescued by the same canonical ferroptosis inhibitors: the iron chelator ciclopirox olamine (CPX), the lipophilic antioxidants trolox and ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), the MEK inhibitor U0126, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) and the reducing agent beta-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Thus, the ferroptotic death phenotype, whether induced by erastin or SAS, was similar in all cell lines tested. The inhibition of cell death by β-ME indicates that cell death most likely involves inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function, as β-ME treatment can generate mixed disulfides taken up by other transporters, thereby circumventing the need for system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishii et al., 1981</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02523.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell death is triggered by erastin and related compounds in different cell lines under a variety of physiological conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Modulatory effect (M<sub>e</sub>) profiles of erastin- and SAS-induced death in five different cell lines (143B, BJeHLT, BJeLR, Calu-1, and HT-1080) in response to six different cell death inhibitors (U0126, Trolox, Fer-1, CPX, CHX, β–ME) or the vehicle DMSO.

Specifically, we tested whether the ferroptotic lethal mechanism could be activated in multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs), three-dimensional cellular aggregates proposed to recapitulate key aspects of the structural and metabolic heterogeneity observed in tumor fragments and micrometastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedrich et al., 2009</xref>). We grew MCTSs from HT-1080 and Calu-1 cells for 72 hr and then investigated the effects of erastin ±β-ME or ±Fer-1 on MCTS growth and viability. For comparison, we also tested the growth inhibitory effects of (1<italic>S</italic>, 3<italic>R</italic>)-RSL3 (hereafter RSL3), a small molecule that triggers ferroptosis by inhibiting GPX4, which is downstream of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> in the ferroptotic cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), as well as staurosporine (STS), which triggers apoptosis. We observed that HT-1080 and Calu-1 MCTSs were killed by erastin and RSL3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The effects of both erastin and RSL3 were rescued by Fer-1, while β-ME suppressed the lethality of erastin, but not of RSL3, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Neither β-ME nor Fer-1 modulated the effects of STS on MCTS growth or viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These observations indicate that erastin, as well as RSL3, are able to trigger ferroptosis in a similar manner in both two- and three-dimensional culture conditions.</p><p>Finally, given that erastin triggers an oxidative form of cell death, we tested whether the lethality of erastin was affected by growth in low (1%) vs high (21%) levels of O<sub>2</sub>. Cells from two different erastin-sensitive cancer cell lines (HT-1080 and DU-145) were grown for 24 hr under low or high O<sub>2</sub> levels and then treated for a further 24 hr with various agents, prior to the analysis of cell death.

To assess in a parallel assay the correlation between lethal potency and inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity, we examined glutamate release using a high throughput, 96-well Amplex Red assay system in human CCF-STTG1 astrocytoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Erastin's quinazolinone core (Region A) is found in a number of biologically active compounds and is considered to be a ‘privileged’ scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Welsch et al., 2010</xref>). Modifications to this region (<bold>4</bold>–<bold>10</bold>), including substitution of the quinazolinone for quinolone (<bold>4</bold>) or indole (<bold>5</bold>), obtained using a Meth-Cohn quinoline synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), resulted in moderate to severe losses of lethal potency compared to <bold>3</bold>, suggesting that the quinazolinone core scaffold is essential for the lethality of erastin. Modifications to the piperazine linker (Region B, <bold>11</bold>–<bold>12</bold>) were not tolerated, with <bold>12</bold> being completely inactive in both the HT-1080 lethality and CCF-STTG1 glutamate release assays. We speculate that rigidification of this portion of the scaffold is essential for activity and that an increase in the number of rotatable bonds in this region results in a higher entropic cost of binding, decreasing lethal potency. Single atom changes to the acetoxy spacer (Region C, <bold>13</bold>–<bold>15</bold>) were likewise poorly tolerated, resulting in significant losses in potency that correlated with reduced inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity. Strikingly, subtle modifications to Region D, including replacement of the chlorine with a fluorine (<bold>16</bold>), replacement of the <italic>para</italic>-chloro substituent with a <italic>meta</italic>-chloro (<bold>17</bold>) or elimination of it altogether (<bold>18</bold>) reduced or abrogated both lethality and system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibitory activity. As suggested by the weakened potency of <bold>16</bold> and <bold>17</bold>, and the inactivity of <bold>18</bold>, the chlorine atom may make a key halogen bonding interaction with the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wilcken et al., 2012</xref>) that is essential for binding.</p><p>Finally, modifications to Region E, including addition of a bromo group (<bold>20</bold>), a phenyl (<bold>21</bold>) or a furanyl substituent (<bold>22</bold>) resulted in fivefold or greater improvements in lethal potency that were mirrored by fivefold to 10-fold improvements in the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity compared to <bold>3</bold>; the most potent compound, <bold>21</bold>, inhibited glutamate release with below 5 nM potency in the CCF-STTG1 assay. Crucially, these more potent compounds potently triggered lethality in HT-1080 cells via ferroptosis, as death was fully suppressed by β-ME. Previously, we have shown that erastin and lethal analogs thereof demonstrate selective lethality towards human BJ fibroblasts engineered to express human telomerase, SV40 large and small T antigen, and oncogenic HRAS<sup>V12</sup> (BJeLR) compared to isogenic cells expressing only telomerase (BJeH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolma et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). We tested the most potent lethal analog (<bold>21</bold>), along with the parent compound (<bold>3</bold>) and a representative non-lethal analog (<bold>14</bold>), in these cell lines. While <bold>14</bold> was inactive, we found that both lethal analogs (<bold>21</bold> and <bold>3</bold>) retained selectivity towards BJeLR vs BJeH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with the pattern of lethality observed in HT-1080 cells, <bold>21</bold> was a more than 20-fold more potent lethal molecule compared to <bold>3</bold> (BJeLR EC<sub>50</sub> of 22 nM [95% C.I. 20-25 nM] vs 490 nM [95% C.I. 350-690 nM], respectively). Together, these results demonstrate that it is possible to improve the potency of the erastin scaffold substantially while retaining oncogenic RAS-selective lethality, especially via modifications to Region E. The combination of these new structural insights, together with complementary results concerning modifications that enhance the metabolic stability of erastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), may result in suitable compounds for clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The effects of erastin on the transcriptome are due to depletion of cystine</title><p>Given the above results, we hypothesized that the effects of erastin were due entirely to inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function and the consequent depletion of cystine (and ultimately cysteine) from the intracellular milieu. If so, co-treatment with β-ME should reverse all effects resulting from erastin treatment. To test this hypothesis in a global manner, we examined patterns of changes in the transcriptome using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of mRNA harvested from HT-1080 cells treated for 5 hr with DMSO, erastin (10 µM), β-ME (18 µM) or erastin + β-ME. From two independent biological replicates, we obtained an average of ∼30.5 million unique mapped reads and 11,867 unique transcripts (with Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million reads [FPKM] ≥1 in both replicates) per condition. After data processing and averaging of replicates, we identified 33 mRNAs with two-fold more counts (‘up-regulated’) and four mRNAs with twofold fewer counts (‘down-regulated’) in erastin-treated samples vs DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; Data available as ‘Data Package 1’ from Dryad data Repository [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixon et al., 2014</xref>]).

We investigated further the connection between erastin treatment and activation of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway and observed that, relative to DMSO-treated controls, erastin treatment (5 μM, 7 hr) resulted in phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and up-regulation of ATF4 at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

First, we found that in HT-1080 cells sorafenib (10 μM, 24 hr) treatment-induced cell death was significantly inhibited by the known small molecule ferroptosis suppressors β-ME, Fer-1 and DFO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>); these same inhibitors suppress erastin (10 μM, 24 hr)-induced ferroptotic death, but not STS-induced apoptotic death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, sorafenib alone can trigger ferroptosis. The observed suppression of sorafenib-induced death by β-ME was striking and immediately suggested that sorafenib, like erastin and SAS, could be acting to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function. Indeed, we observed that sorafenib, like erastin, but not the kinase inhibitor imatinib, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function, as assessed using the glutamate release assay in HT-1080 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The ability of sorafenib and erastin to suppress system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity was not inhibited by co-treatment with Fer-1, demonstrating that this effect is upstream of Fer-1-sensitive ROS accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), as expected. Likewise, similar to erastin and SAS, we observed a robust transcriptional upregulation of <italic>CHAC1</italic> in HT-1080 cells in response to sorafenib treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We also observed upregulation of the same biochemical markers of ER stress observed previously with erastin, namely phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and increased levels of ATF4, without any change in XBP1 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Finally, as observed previously with erastin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), we found that sorafenib treatment (10 μM, 18 hr) of HT-1080 cells significantly depleted total glutathione and resulted in the accumulation of lipid peroxides as detected by flow cytometry using C11-BODIPY 581/591 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that, like erastin, sorafenib inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>-mediated cystine import, leading to ER stress, glutathione depletion and the iron-dependent accumulation of lipid ROS.</p><p>To test the generality of these results, we examined the ability of sorafenib to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity and trigger ferroptosis in additional cell lines. Consistent with the initial results, in all five cell lines examined, we observed that sorafenib and erastin treatments (20 μM) caused a comparable inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function, as assessed by glutamate release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, unlike erastin, we observed that sorafenib triggered Fer-1-suppressible ferroptosis in HT-1080 cells only within a narrow concentration window (sorafenib EC<sub>50</sub> = 18 μM, sorafenib+Fer-1 EC<sub>50</sub> = 43 μM), before causing Fer-1-insensitive death at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In the four other cells lines, we observed only slight (143B) or non-existent (TC32, Calu-1, U2OS) differences in sorafenib EC<sub>50</sub> values either with or without Fer-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, while sorafenib can inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity robustly, this manifests as a ferroptotic cell death phenotype only over a narrow range of concentrations; sorafenib appears to trigger additional lethal mechanisms that act in parallel to the ferroptotic response at higher concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Analyzing the concordance between inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> and lethality of sorafenib using structure activity relationship analysis</title><p>Sorafenib could conceivably inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity by modulating the activity of a kinase that controls system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function, or through ‘off-target’ modulation of a non-kinase target (e.g., SLC7A11 itself, a system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> regulatory protein, or a more indirectly related target). We took two approaches in an attempt to address this question. First, we examined the effects of functionally-related kinase inhibitors. The global pattern of kinase inhibition by sorafenib against 300 purified kinase domains is highly similar to that of nilotinib, masitinib, and imatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anastassiadis et al., 2011</xref>), yet none of these agents appear to trigger ferroptosis, as defined by sensitivity to ferroptosis-specific cell death inhibitors β-ME and Fer-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus, even kinase inhibitors with targets similar to those of sorafenib do not necessarily trigger ferroptosis.</p><p>Second, we attempted to dissociate the ability of sorafenib to trigger ferroptosis vs other lethal mechanisms. To do this we synthesized and tested a set of 87 sorafenib analogs for the ability to trigger β-ME- and Fer-1-suppressible death in HT-1080 cells in twofold, 10-point dilution series assays, starting at a highest concentration of 20 or 40 μM. In summary, while many analogs retained lethal activity (three examples of lethal compounds are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), none of the 87 analogs could trigger ferroptosis with enhanced selectivity for β-ME- and Fer-1-suppressible death over other lethal mechanisms compared to the parent compound itself. Several of the analogs that we synthesized were unable to trigger death (four example compounds are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These analogs (SRS13-67, SRS14-98, SRS13-48, and SRS15-11) contain modifications predicted to disrupt atomic interactions essential for the binding of sorafenib to kinase targets such as BRAF, including burial of the -CF3 group in a hydrophobic pocket and hydrogen bonding with the urea group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowinger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wan et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, the active analogs shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) mostly retain these features. Thus, one hypothesis is that sorafenib triggers ferroptosis by inhibiting an unknown kinase whose activity is necessary for constitutive system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity. Alternatively, sorafenib could modulate system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity by interacting with a non-kinase target that harbors a binding pocket resembling that found within the active site of sorafenib-sensitive kinases.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02523.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Analysis of sorafenib analog function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Sorafenib and 87 sorafenib analogs were prepared and tested in HT-1080 cells for the induction of cell death (EC<sub>50</sub>) and the suppression of this cell death by β-ME (18 μM) and Fer-1 (1 μM) over 48 hr.

Consistent with the above data, two lethal sorafenib analogs (SRS13-45 and SRS13-60) significantly inhibited glutamate release, while two non-lethal analogs (EC<sub>50</sub> &gt;40 μM), SRS13-67 and SRS14-98, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

We speculated that the ability of sorafenib to trigger both ferroptotic and non-ferroptotic death would result in a unique spectrum of clinical observations in patients treated with sorafenib compared to other kinase inhibitors. Specifically, a subset of patients for any drug typically experience adverse events that are dependent on the drug mechanism. Thus, we speculated that the pattern of adverse events could report on the similarity or differences of mechanisms across drugs. Previously, we applied a large-scale statistical analysis to the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) to systematically identify drug effects and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tatonetti et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we sought to use this approach to discover correlations between sorafenib exposure and human health unique to this drug. First, we identified those reports of patients with exposure to sorafenib, and a set of reports that could serve as controls; for this, we used a high dimensional propensity-score model previously validated for this use in the FAERS that has been shown to mitigate confounding bias and to improve the accuracy of statistical estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tatonetti et al., 2012</xref>). Using disproportionality analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4a">Bate and Evans, 2009</xref>), we identified adverse drug effects for sorafenib and for a set of comparison kinase-targeted drugs for which sufficient data was available in our data (dasatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, and sunitinib), none of which (at 20 μM) were found to trigger ferroptosis in HT-1080 cells or inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> activity as assayed using the glutamate release assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then filtered out effects that could be attributed to chemotherapy and grouped the drug-effect associations by the physiological system that the adverse event affected. For example, cardiovascular-related adverse events were grouped into the cardiovascular system category. For each kinase inhibitor, we counted the number of reports in each of 20 physiological system categories that involved the above drugs. We then compared this number to the counts obtained from the selected control cohorts. Using a Fisher's exact test, we evaluated significance of associations of each kinase inhibitor to each physiological system category, and then we plotted these data as a heatmap, clustering the data in an unsupervised, hierarchical manner using the computed p values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02523.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of adverse events reported with sorafenib and other kinase inhibitors.</title><p>Analysis of adverse events across 20 physiological system categories associated with kinase inhibitor treatment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02523.012">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02523.012</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02523-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig7s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02523.013</object-id><label>Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Test of the ability of various kinase inhibitors to induce ferroptosis and inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viability of HT-1080 cells in response to 48 hr treatment with erastin (as a control) or various kinase inhibitors ± β-ME and Fer-1.

These results suggest that, compared to other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors, sorafenib treatment has an increased propensity to generate unexpected adverse events in a variety of physiological systems. While these data are merely correlative at this point, one possibility, given the unique ability of sorafenib to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> among tested kinase inhibitors, is that this effect contributes to increase the chance of an adverse event in combination with one or more underlying modifying factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Upregulation of <italic>AKR1C</italic> family genes is associated with resistance to ferroptosis</title><p>Our results suggested that inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function by erastin, SAS and sorafenib (within a narrow concentration range) triggers ferroptosis. We sought to identify genetic modifiers of this process in erastin-resistant cell lines.

In this study, we have demonstrated that erastin is a potent and specific inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>-mediated cystine uptake and further elucidated the mechanism of action of this and other system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibitors that are able to trigger ferroptosis. Previous metabolomics analysis had suggested that erastin inhibited system L (SLC3A2 + SLC7A5)-mediated amino acid transport in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). It was therefore surprising to observe that in HT-1080 and Calu-1 cells erastin inhibited system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> (SLC3A2 + SLC7A11)-mediated cystine uptake, but not system-L-mediated phenylalanine uptake. These results rule out the possibility that erastin inhibits SLC3A2-dependent transporters non-specifically. Further, given evidence that Jurkat cells do not express system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kakazu et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesize that in cells lacking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>, erastin can inhibit structurally-related transporters (e.g., system L). An alternative hypothesis is that erastin binds to some indirect target that, in Jurkat cells, favors the inhibition of system L, while in HT-1080, Calu-1 and possibly other cells, favors the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>. A definitive resolution of this matter will require further study.</p><p>An important goal is to identify scaffolds capable of inhibiting system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> with greater potency than existing compounds typified by SAS and derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorrini et al., 2013</xref>). We found that erastin is a substantially more potent inhibitor of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function than SAS. Further optimization of the erastin scaffold yielded analogs with improved potency against this antiporter in the low nanomolar range that retained a degree of selectivity towards oncogenic mutant HRAS-expressing cells. Our work suggests that the ability of erastin, SAS and sorafenib to induce ferroptosis is tied to the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>-mediated cystine import, and the consequent depletion of glutathione and loss of GPX4 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). However, these compounds are also predicted to inactivate the cystine/cysteine redox cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banjac et al., 2008</xref>) and, by restricting the intracellular supply of cysteine, to inhibit new protein synthesis. Together, these effects may further reduce cell growth or cause cell death in certain contexts where the induction of ferroptosis per se is not possible. The ability of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibitors such as erastin to trigger ferroptosis at similar concentrations in both monolayer and three-dimensional MCTS cultures, and at both high (21%) and low (1%) O<sub>2</sub> levels, suggests that these compounds are capable of overcoming the ‘multicellular resistance’ phenomenon observed with many lethal molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desoize and Jardillier, 2000</xref>) and do not necessarily require high levels of ambient O<sub>2</sub> to be lethal.</p><p>Consistent with the hypothesis that erastin treatment deprives cells of cystine, RNA Seq expression profiling and subsequent follow-up studies of erastin-treated cells revealed transcriptional upregulation of <italic>DDIT3</italic> (CHOP), <italic>DDIT4</italic> (REDD1) and <italic>ATF3</italic>, canonical targets of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR)/ER stress pathway, which we also showed to be activated biochemically. These results are consistent with previous work showing upregulation of these genes in mammalian cells cultured in the absence of cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Intriguingly, ATF4 is thought to be an important regulator of <italic>SLC7A11</italic> expression and deletion of <italic>Atf4</italic> in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells results in an oxidative, iron-dependent death phenotype that is highly reminiscent of ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harding et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that the basal level of ATF4 may set the threshold for ferroptotic death. <italic>CHAC1</italic> is a downstream target of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mungrue et al., 2009</xref>) and our results suggest that <italic>CHAC1</italic> upregulation may be useful as a PD marker for cystine or cysteine-starved cells. Whether CHAC1 plays a role in the execution of ferroptosis remains unclear. ChaC-family proteins were recently reported to function in yeast as intracellular glutathione-degrading enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>). One possibility is that CHAC1 upregulation following system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition may actively contribute to glutathione depletion in cells deprived of cysteine, although inhibition of <italic>CHAC1</italic> transcription had only minimal effects on the viability of erastin-treated cells.</p><p>The finding that sorafenib can inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> was unexpected. Despite sorafenib's multi-kinase inhibitory activity, there is disagreement about whether the sorafenib lethal mechanism of action in cells involves kinase inhibition or binding to an alternative target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wilhelm et al., 2008</xref>). It has previously been shown that sorafenib treatment inhibits translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rahmani et al., 2005</xref>), induces ER stress and the expression of <italic>DDIT4</italic> (REDD1) via the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rahmani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2011</xref>), and causes caspase-independent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). Most recently, it was suggested that in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, sorafenib can trigger iron-dependent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Louandre et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>-mediated cystine import by sorafenib can lead to both the induction of an ER stress response (as indicated by phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and upregulation of both ATF4 and <italic>CHAC1</italic>) and ferroptotic cell death. Thus, our results provide a satisfying mechanistic explanation for previous observations: namely, that sorafenib can inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function, leading to ER stress and in some cells the induction of non-apoptotic, iron-dependent, ferroptotic cell death.</p><p>Data collected in Phase I clinical trials of sorafenib-treated patients demonstrate that at clinically recommended doses (400 mg), it is possible to achieve maximum plasma concentration of sorafenib from 5.2–21 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strumberg et al., 2005</xref>). This encompasses the range within which we observe the ferroptosis-inducing effects of sorafenib. Notably, sera collected from sorafenib-treated patients display evidence of protein oxidation, with higher levels of protein oxidation being correlated with improved patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coriat et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that sorafenib could be having effects in vivo related to the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> function and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species. Indeed, given that renal cell carcinomas are among the most sensitive of all cancer cell lines to the lethal effects of erastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), it may be of interest to re-evaluate whether the efficacy of sorafenib observed in patients could be due, at least in part, to inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>-mediated cystine uptake. Likewise, adverse events that are observed in a minority of patients treated with sorafenib may be due to inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup>. While not all patients treated with sorafenib experience adverse events, we suspect that specific underlying (and unknown) sensitizing factors will render a minority of individuals more sensitive to these events. It would be important to account for this potential toxicity in the design of future therapeutics.</p><p>As with many molecularly targeted compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holohan et al., 2013</xref>), the ultimate clinical utility of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition will be influenced by the ability of target cells to evolve resistance to these inhibitors. We found that exposure to erastin can result in the emergence of cell populations partially resistant to this compound due to dramatic overexpression of multiple <italic>AKR1C</italic> family members. These enzymes have a number of substrates but have been shown to detoxify toxic lipid metabolites such as 4-HNE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burczynski et al., 2001</xref>), which are likely produced by the oxidative lipid fragmentation processes that occur during the execution of ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Skouta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). The expression of the AKR1C genes is controlled by the antioxidant master regulatory transcription factor NRF2, which itself is under the negative regulation of KEAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agyeman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung and Kwak, 2013</xref>). Mutations of both these genes are observed in numerous cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaramillo and Zhang, 2013</xref>), and we would predict that these changes enhance AKR1C expression and possibly render cells resistant to the induction of ferroptosis downstream of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>Erastin was synthesized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yagoda et al., 2007</xref>).

The key findings include 1) RNA seq analysis following erastin treatment indicates upregulation of ER stress response genes like CHAC1, ATF4, and DDIT3 2) chemical optimization of the erastin structure results in more potent antiporter x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition, 3) data that suggest that the clinical agent sorafenib also inhibits x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> function, and 4) clinical database analysis that suggests that x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition may have a particular toxicological profile. The observation that erastin inhibits x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> was previously reported by the authors in Cell in 2012. Part of the current study corroborates this previous finding with additional data; while solid and valuable, this part of the study is more confirmatory and has less impact.</p><p>The more novel aspects of the work are the identification of ER stress as a potential marker for ferroptosis, which is distinct from apoptosis and other more well characterized forms of cell death, and the possibility that sorafenib may also inhibit system x- and that this inhibition may be responsible for or contribute to observed adverse clinical effects. These more novel and higher impact aspects of the study are not investigated to the same depth, in part because the manuscript covers so many different aspects of erastin and sorafenib. As a result, the study raises a number of questions that should be addressed. In addition, the various parts of the manuscript are not as well connected as they could be (e.g., the discovery of the new erastin analogs with significantly higher potency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> are not used in any subsequent experiments). The reviewers request you to address the questions listed below in your manuscript, either by new data or just by discussing them:</p><p>1) The study would have higher impact if a deeper mechanistic connection between the induction of ER stress genes and other features of ER stress could be explored. The demonstrated upregulation of CHAC1 is a minimal step. The authors should provide additional data that ER stress is indeed induced in ferroptosis. For instance, a correlation between the described upregulation of ER stress markers, as observed in tumor cell lines in response to erastin/sorafenib treatment, and in vivo xenotransplantation tumor models that the authors reported in Yang 2014 would strengthen the conclusion that certain ER stress genes may serve as biomarkers for pharmacodynamic investigations.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, the authors should check for statistical significance of upregulation of CHAC1 by erastin vs. STS – if there is no difference then this read-out may not be a clear discriminator.</p><p>3) With respect to sorafenib, the findings that a clinically used kinase inhibitor could function through x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition, either directly or indirectly, is critical since the clinical community may be alarmed by this report. However, the high concentrations used in this study, 10 and 20µM, may be beyond the blood concentrations reached in patients. The PK profile of sorafenib should be compared to the in vitro activity. Also, if sorafenib is significantly protein bound, the assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CDE</xref> should be repeated in the presence of normal human serum.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5 and 6</xref>: Sorafenib treatment causes cell death that can be rescued by ß-ME, ferrostatin-1 and DFO, suggesting a similar mode of action as erastin. Although the authors show that glutamate secretion is inhibited by sorafenib, a direct measurement of cystine uptake, which in turn leads to glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation, would strengthen their conclusion.</p><p>5) The structure activity relationship of the sorafenib analogs is very useful for distinguishing the relevant target. However, the authors need to measure the kinase inhibitory activity of the molecules to see if one of the active analogs has actually lost kinase binding.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> provides a highly interesting peace of information that was, at present, left mostly unexplored. Erastin resistant cell lines were shown to strongly up-regulate the AKR1C enzyme family. This family of enzyme is known to be partially responsible for the detoxification of reactive aldehyde like 4-HNE. Therefore, a few questions arise: Are the resistant clones still able to undergo ferroptosis in response to different inducers? Does modulation of AKR1C expression by RNAi re-establish sensitivity to erastin?</p><p>7) In previous work (Yagoda 2007), the authors showed that erastin bound to SLC7A5, a subunit of system L, and they mention in Dixon 2012 that treatment with erastin resulted in highly significant decreases in the levels of system L substrates. These findings appear to contrast to the observations in the current work that erastin is selective for system x- and did not affect system L. The authors should discuss these apparently contradictory results in the text.</p><p>8) The authors made 19 analogs including several with significantly improved potency. They do not show the selectivity of these compounds for RAS mutant cells, which would be important for therapeutic use. A previous study from this group did report selectivity for a smaller set of analogs (Yang 2014). The selectivity should be investigated for the best analogs.</p><p>9) A statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) reveals sorafenib to cause multiple side effects in patients that might be partially linked to System x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition beyond its well-documented kinase inhibitory effects. As these are mere statistical data, the statement that sorafenib indeed causes these side effects in patients partially due to system xc- inhibition is over-interpreted and should be de-emphasized. In that sense, the authors should consider that mice lacking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> are fully viable and only show subtle phenotypes (Sato et al., JBC 2005). Therefore, major adverse effects induced by system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition in “normal” cells are less likely, which questions the validity of the statement on page 22, second paragraph, last sentence. Furthermore, the paper by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Bundel et al 2011</xref> (referred to on page 27) describes that xCT knockout cells are in fact more resistant to against limbic seizures, and 6-OH dopamine lesioning in substantia nigra (Massie et al., FASEB 2011).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02523.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The study would have higher impact if a deeper mechanistic connection between the induction of ER stress genes and other features of ER stress could be explored.

In response, we have taken a multi-pronged approach, including new computational and experimental data to address this comment. First, we clarified that the genes upregulated by erastin are in the eIF2alpha-ATF4 branch of the ER stress response pathway, and in the updated text we now state explicitly:</p><p>“We noted that several of the genes upregulated by erastin were associated with activation of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 branch of the ER stress response pathway (e.g. ATF3, DDIT3, DDIT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whitney et al., 2009</xref>)).”</p><p>Secondly, we analyzed our RNA-Seq transcriptome data and found that the 33 gene ‘upregulated gene’ signature is significantly enriched for GO terms related to ER stress and the UPR, supporting our hypothesis that this process is activated in erastin-treated cells. This analysis is now included as part of the updated text.</p><p>Thirdly, we now report results showing that erastin and sorafenib treatment results in upregulation of canonical biochemical markers of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway, including phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and upregulation of ATF4 at the protein level. Consistent with the activation being specific to the eIF2alpha-ATF4 branch of UPR signaling, we observed no evidence for enhanced splicing of XBP-1, which is in a parallel branch of the UPR. These results are now included as part of a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>With respect to <italic>CHAC1</italic> in particular, we have made it clearer in the text that <italic>CHAC1</italic> expression is known to be regulated downstream of the eIF2alpha-ATF4 pathway (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mungrue et al. (2009)</xref> J Immunol), which we have now shown to be activated by erastin (and sorafenib) treatment.</p><p>We also report additional data in support of our hypothesis linking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition by erastin to upregulation of <italic>CHAC1</italic> expression. We show that, like the parent compound, several of the new erastin analogs reported here and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref> Cell) upregulate <italic>CHAC1</italic> mRNA levels, while less potently lethal erastin analogs result in more modest effects on <italic>CHAC1</italic> expression (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In response to the request that we perform an in vivo analysis of the efficacy of <italic>CHAC1</italic> as a PD marker, we respectfully submit that, while these will certainly be valuable studies to perform, this is a major undertaking that is beyond the scope of what can be accomplished in the time period available to respond to these comments. We would hope to undertake these studies in the coming years as we pursue the development of these compounds in a variety of mouse tumor models.</p><p><italic>2) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4E</italic></xref><italic>, the authors should check for statistical significance of upregulation of CHAC1 by erastin vs. STS – if there is no difference then this read-out may not be a clear discriminator</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point, which may have been confusing to readers. As part of our original analysis of variance (ANOVA) for this dataset we observed that <italic>CHAC1</italic> mRNA levels were, in fact, significantly higher in the erastin versus STS treatment condition (one-way ANOVA, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). However, we chose not to report this previously or to do so in the updated version as we are not looking for a marker to discriminate between cells exposed to erastin versus STS, but rather are searching for a marker that might be useful to indicate exposure to erastin. As long as <italic>CHAC1</italic> is significantly up-regulated by erastin compared to control treatments, even if this is also observed with other unrelated compounds, <italic>CHAC1</italic> upregulation would still have value for in vivo studies where erastin is the only agent being administered at any one time; thus even though this comparison is statistically distinct, we respectfully suggest it would be confusing to readers and would distract from our main point to highlight it as such.</p><p><italic>3) With respect to sorafenib, the findings that a clinically used kinase inhibitor could function through x</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> <italic>inhibition, either directly or indirectly, is critical since the clinical community may be alarmed by this report. However, the high concentrations used in this study, 10 and 20µM, may be beyond the blood concentrations reached in patients. The PK profile of sorafenib should be compared to the in vitro activity. Also, if sorafenib is significantly protein bound, the assays in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5CDE</italic></xref> <italic>should be repeated in the presence of normal human serum</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. Data collected in Phase I clinical trials of sorafenib (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strumberg et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awada et al., 2005</xref>) demonstrate that at clinically recommended doses (400 mg) it is possible to achieve maximum plasma concentration of sorafenib from 5.2 - 21 μM. This encompasses the range within which we observe the system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibiting effects of sorafenib. In this vein, it appears notable that in sera collected from sorafenib-treated patients that there is evidence for enhanced levels of oxidized proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coriat et al. (2012)</xref> Mol Cancer Ther), a consequence of enhanced ROS production. Together, these results support our hypothesis that sorafenib could be having effects in vivo related to the inhibition of cystine-glutamate exchange and the induction of oxidative cell death. In the Discussion section of the updated text, we now include reference to the above literature to further bolster our arguments as follows:</p><p>“Data collected in Phase I clinical trials of sorafenib-treated patients demonstrate that at clinically recommended doses (400 mg) it is possible to achieve maximum plasma concentration of sorafenib from 5.2 - 21 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Awada et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Strumberg et al., 2005</xref>). This encompasses the range within which we observe the ferroptosis-inducing effects of sorafenib. Notably, sera collected from sorafenib-treated patients display evidence of protein oxidation, with higher levels of protein oxidation being correlated with improved patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coriat et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that sorafenib could be having effects in vivo related to the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> function and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species.”</p><p>Regarding the second point, sorafenib, like many drugs, binds human serum proteins extensively (e.g., Tod et al (2011) Pharm Res, and references therein). And, as with other drugs, serum protein (e.g., albumin) binding can have myriad effects on drug distribution that are complex and challenging to predict and model. Our experiments were performed in 10% fetal bovine serum, which contains abundant albumin to approximate the situation observed in human plasma. We could find no evidence in the literature that bovine albumin and human albumin differ substantially in drug-binding properties; thus we believe the experiments reported are sufficiently relevant to the clinical situation as to warrant reporting as they are now described.</p><p><italic>4)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6"><italic>Figures 5 and 6</italic></xref><italic>: Sorafenib treatment causes cell death that can be rescued by ß-ME, ferrostatin-1 and DFO, suggesting a similar mode of action as erastin. Although the authors show that glutamate secretion is inhibited by sorafenib, a direct measurement of cystine uptake, which in turn leads to glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation, would strengthen their conclusion</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for allowing us to clarify this issue, and to organize our thoughts and data to make this easier for the reader to understand. In the previously submitted manuscript, we had demonstrated that (1) sorafenib inhibits glutamate release; (2) sorafenib-induced death could be inhibited by β-ME co-treatment, which implies that death is due to the blockade of cystine uptake; and (3) sorafenib upregulates <italic>CHAC1</italic> expression, a feature associated with the ER stress response observed upon system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition. In all of these respects, sorafenib behaved like erastin.</p><p>Unfortunately, the radiolabelled cystine uptake assay is extremely challenging for us to perform for a variety of technical and logistical reasons, and is no longer available to us at the present time. However, to address this Reviewer comment, we have now validated that we are seeing the same downstream effects with sorafenib observed previously with erastin, including glutathione depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al (2014)</xref> Cell) and lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al. (2012)</xref> Cell). These new data, included in the updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref> and referenced appropriately in the updated text, show that sorafenib treatment (10 μM) results in the depletion of glutathione and the accumulation of lipid ROS, both hallmarks of cystine depletion induced by erastin. Finally, as described above, we have also tested the effects of sorafenib on biochemical markers of ER stress and shown that in all respects, sorafenib behaves like erastin. These data are now included as part of the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>. Together these results strengthen our previous findings that sorafenib inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> and leads to oxidative ferroptotic cell death in a manner similar to erastin.</p><p><italic>5) The structure activity relationship of the sorafenib analogs is very useful for distinguishing the relevant target. However, the authors need to measure the kinase inhibitory activity of the molecules to see if one of the active analogs has actually lost kinase binding</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ comment here, as we have considered approaches to addressing this issue for some time. To recap, our current working model is that sorafenib is, in fact, most likely to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> activity through modulation of a kinase or kinase-like target. We do not believe that the active analogs have lost kinase binding. Rather, we argue that binding to a kinase or kinase-like target may be essential for the observed activity. Consequently, we would expect all active analogs to retain the ability to inhibit kinase activity. To help clarify this point we have re-written this section of the Results as follows:</p><p>“Several of the analogs that we synthesized were unable to trigger death (four example compounds are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These analogs (SRS13-67, SRS14-98, SRS13-48 and SRS15-11) contain modifications predicted to disrupt atomic interactions essential for the binding of sorafenib to kinase targets such as BRAF, including burial of the -CF3 group in a hydrophobic pocket and hydrogen bonding with the urea group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lowinger et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wan et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, the active analogs shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) mostly retain these features. Thus, one hypothesis is that sorafenib triggers ferroptosis by inhibiting an unknown kinase whose activity is necessary for constitutive system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> activity. Alternatively, sorafenib could modulate system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> activity by interacting with a non-kinase target that harbors a binding pocket resembling that found within the active site of sorafenib-sensitive kinases.”</p><p>We also recognize the reviewer’s concern for determining the source, kinase or non-kinase, for this activity. Sorafenib is known to bind to a number of kinase targets in diverse signaling pathways. We first attempted to determine the effects of active and inactive analogs on ERK phosphorylation, as it is a target of several growth signaling pathways, but we have been unable to draw definitive conclusions due to a variety of technical issues. However, analysis of effects on a particular kinase pathway would not in any case indicate whether other kinase binding activity is affected by various analogs. Comprehensive profiling across the kinome might be needed to determine whether kinase-binding activity has been altered in the active analogs. It is also possible that system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition by sorafenib is mediated by binding to an unknown or uncharacterized kinase, or a non-kinase target, neither of which would be resolved by a kinome-wide profiling experiment. We believe that resolving this issue requires substantial work and lies beyond the scope of this paper, which simply presents system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibitory activity of sorafenib, and the relevant moieties of its structural scaffold necessary for this activity.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref> <italic>provides a highly interesting peace of information that was, at present, left mostly unexplored. Erastin resistant cell lines were shown to strongly up-regulate the AKR1C enzyme family. This family of enzyme is known to be partially responsible for the detoxification of reactive aldehyde like 4-HNE. Therefore, a few questions arise: Are the resistant clones still able to undergo ferroptosis in response to different inducers?

Regarding whether the resistant cell lines are still able to undergo ferroptosis in response to different cell death inducers, we note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>, we showed that these resistant cell lines were resistant not only to erastin, but also to sulfasalazine and sorafenib, two additional validated ferroptosis-inducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., (2012)</xref> Cell and this report).</p><p>To investigate this question further, we analyzed the sensitivity of the parental cell line (DU-145) and three of the resistant clones (2.5E-1, 2.5E-3 and 2.6E-23) to several of the more potent erastin analogs described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, as well as to an additional structurally- and functionally-unrelated inducer of ferroptosis, (1S,3<italic>R</italic>)-RSL3, which triggers ferroptosis by inhibiting glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al. (2014)</xref> Cell). We found that the three resistant cell lines exhibit resistance to all tested ferroptosis inducers, including (1S-3<italic>R</italic>)-RSL3. These results are shown below and are now included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>. These data further supports our model that these cell lines are resistant to a broad spectrum of ferroptosis inducers, consistent with the resistance arising downstream in pathway, i.e., after lipid ROS generation.</p><p>Regarding the second point, in the resistant clones, we see high levels of expression of multiple <italic>AKR1C</italic> family members, as well as other antioxidant genes that may play a role in the resistance of these clones to ferroptosis. We suspect that it is unlikely that knock down of any single one of these genes will resensitize cells to erastin, as they likely have redundant function. Nonetheless, we attempted to re-sensitize erastin-resistant DU-145 clones by modulating <italic>AKR1C1</italic> levels through the use of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). We observed, as expected, that silencing of <italic>AKR1C1</italic> alone was insufficient to confer substantial re-sensitization (not shown), likely because the multiple <italic>AKR1C</italic> family members upregulated simultaneously have redundant function. Further analysis of the overlapping role of these family members will require substantially more work and we believe that this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) In previous work (Yagoda 2007), the authors showed that erastin bound to SLC7A5, a subunit of system L, and they mention in Dixon 2012 that treatment with erastin resulted in highly significant decreases in the levels of system L substrates. These findings appear to contrast to the observations in the current work that erastin is selective for system x- and did not affect system L. The authors should discuss these apparently contradictory results in the text</italic>.</p><p>AWe thank the reviewer for raising this point so that we can clarify this issue. We now address this point in the first paragraph of the Discussion section of the updated text, where we clarify our current understanding of the erastin mechanism of action as follows:</p><p>“Previous metabolomics analysis had suggested that erastin inhibited system L (SLC3A2 + SLC7A5)-mediated amino acid transport in Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). It was therefore surprising to observe that in HT-1080 and Calu-1 cells erastin inhibited system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> (SLC3A2 + SLC7A11)-mediated cystine uptake but not system L-mediated phenylalanine uptake. These results rule out the possibility that erastin inhibits SLC3A2-dependent transporters non-specifically. Further, given evidence that Jurkat cells do not express system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kakazu et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesize that in cells lacking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>, erastin can inhibit structurally-related transporters (e.g., system L). An alternative hypothesis is that erastin binds to some indirect target that, in Jurkat cells, favors the inhibition of system L, while in HT-1080, Calu-1 and possibly other cells, favors the inhibition of system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>. A definitive resolution of this matter will require further study.”</p><p><italic>8) The authors made 19 analogs including several with significantly improved potency. They do not show the selectivity of these compounds for RAS mutant cells, which would be important for therapeutic use. A previous study from this group did report selectivity for a smaller set of analogs (Yang 2014). The selectivity should be investigated for the best analogs</italic>.</p><p>In the updated version of the manuscript, we report the selectivity of the most potent analog (21), the parent compound (3) and an inactive analog (14) in the BJ cell system. Consistent with previous results and with our expectations, we find that 21 and 3 exhibit greater potency in BJeLR (BJ fibroblast + human telomerase + small T antigen + large T antigen + oncogenic HRAS<sup>V12</sup>) versus BJeH (BJ fibroblast + human telomerase) and that the improved analog 21 is substantially more potent, overall, than 3. These new data are shown below and in updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. In the accompanying text we now say:</p><p>“Previously we have shown that erastin and lethal analogs thereof demonstrate selective lethality towards human BJ fibroblasts engineered to express human telomerase, SV40 large and small T antigen, and oncogenic HRAS<sup>V12</sup> (BJeLR) compared to isogenic cells expressing only telomerase (BJeH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolma et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). We tested the most potent lethal analog (21), along with the parent compound (3) and a representative non-lethal analog (14), in these cell lines. While 14 was inactive, we found that both lethal analogs (21 and 3) retained selectivity towards BJeLR versus BJeH cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with the pattern of lethality observed in HT-1080 cells, 21 was a more than 20-fold more potent lethal molecule compared to 3 (BJeLR EC<sub>50</sub> of 22 nM [95% C.I. 20-25 nM] versus 490 nM [95% C.I. 350-690 nM], respectively).“</p><p><italic>9) A statistical analysis (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref><italic>) reveals sorafenib to cause multiple side effects in patients that might be partially linked to System x</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub><sup><italic>-</italic></sup> <italic>inhibition beyond its well-documented kinase inhibitory effects.

Furthermore, the paper by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11"><italic>De Bundel et al 2011</italic></xref> <italic>(referred to on page 27) describes that xCT knockout cells are in fact more resistant to against limbic seizures, and 6-OH dopamine lesioning in substantia nigra (Massie et al., FASEB 2011)</italic>.</p><p>Regarding the potential connection between sorafenib, system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition and adverse effects observed in patient records, we agree with the reviewer concerning the correlative nature of these data. All drugs have idiosyncratic side effects in a small number of patients—some of these are specific to the drug and some are specific to the mechanism of action of the drug. We speculate here that the small percentage of patients that exhibit side effects is linked to the lethal mechanism of sorafenib, and specifically that a kinase inhibitor that also inhibits system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> would cause a different spectrum of idiosyncratic side effects compared to a kinase inhibitor that does not cause system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> inhibition. Previously we demonstrated that none of the other comparison kinase inhibitors triggered ferroptosis. We have collected new data, shown below and incorporated as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1B</xref>, which demonstrates that none of these comparison kinase inhibitors inhibit glutamate release. In the revised text we now state:</p><p>“These results suggest that, compared to other clinically-approved kinase inhibitors, sorafenib treatment has an increased propensity generate unexpected adverse events in a variety of physiological systems. While these data are merely correlative at this point, one possibility, given the unique ability of sorafenib to inhibit system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> among tested kinase inhibitors, is that this effect contributes to increase the chance of an adverse event in combination with one or more underlying modifying factors.”</p><p>We believe that this statement is consistent with our results and suggests a viable hypothesis to explain the observed correlation. Further work will be required to investigate this correlation, but that lies beyond the scope of this report. In the updated Discussion we also remove the reference to the work of De Bundel (2011) as we agree that this could be confusing.</p><p>We would also like comment on the reviewers’ point concerning the subtle effects observed in mice lacking the system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> component <italic>Slc7a11</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato et al., 2005</xref> J Biol Chem; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chintala et al., 2005</xref> PNAS). One interpretation of these data is that no drug targeting system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> in vivo would be expected to result in any pronounced physiological effect. Certainly the effects of many drugs are effectively modeled by the corresponding deletion allele in mouse (discussed in Zambrowicz &amp; Sands, 2003 Nat Rev Drug Discovery). However, this need not always be true, especially for drugs that target metabolic networks. This is because metabolic networks frequently contain redundant synthetic routes to the same product (e.g., Kitami &amp; Nadeau, 2002 Nat Genet). Thus, inactivation of a single node can be buffered by the use of alternative pathways to the same end product. In fact, it is clear from our RNA Seq analysis that in response to erastin treatment (→ system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> blockade) cells upregulate a key enzyme in the transsulferation pathway (CBS), which provides an alternative route to the synthesis of cysteine from methionine. While speculative, in the <italic>Slc7a11</italic> knockout mouse it is likely that compensatory genes (such as Cbs) and pathways (such as transsulfuration) are gradually activated in cells lacking system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup> function, enabling cell survival. Conversely, acute drug treatment may not allow sufficient time for compensatory upregulation of alternative pathways to occur, resulting in cell death.</p></body></sub-article></article>
