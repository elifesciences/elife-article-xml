To maintain the conventional conditions of the pluripotent potential in an undifferentiated state, inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (iMEF) is used as a feeder layer. However, it has been suggested that hESC under this conventional condition (hESC-iMEF) is an artifact that does not correspond to the in vitro counterpart of the human epiblast. Our previous studies demonstrated the use of an alternative feeder layer of human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) to derive and maintain hESC. We wondered if the hESC-hAEC culture could represent a different pluripotent stage than that of naïve or primed conventional conditions, simulating the stage in which the amniotic epithelium derives from the epiblast during peri-implantation. Like the conventional primed hESC-iMEF, hESC-hAEC has the same levels of expression as the ‘pluripotency core’ and does not express markers of naïve pluripotency. However, it presents a downregulation of HOX genes and genes associated with the endoderm and mesoderm, and it exhibits an increase in the expression of ectoderm lineage genes, specifically in the anterior neuroectoderm. Transcriptome analysis showed in hESC-hAEC an upregulated signature of genes coding for transcription factors involved in neural induction and forebrain development, and the ability to differentiate into a neural lineage was superior in comparison with conventional hESC-iMEF. We propose that the interaction of hESC with hAEC confers hESC a biased potential that resembles the anteriorized epiblast, which is predisposed to form the neural ectoderm.</p></abstract><kwd-group

in which the embryonic cells can differentiate into all the lineages that will constitute an organism. In recent years, studies have described naïve and primed pluripotency representing the pre- and post-implantation epiblast, respectively. Both states can be captured in vitro, adapting the embryonic cells to grow under defined conditions. Thus, mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSC) arise as the in vitro counterparts of the naïve and primed identity in the mouse embryo, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boroviak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brons et al., 2007</xref>). As regards humans, conventional conditions to maintain human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in vitro involve the knockout serum replacement (KOSR) and Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) on the inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (iMEF) feeder layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ávila-González et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ávila-González et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, conventional hPSC are considered as the in vitro analogous of human primed pluripotency. However, their transcriptional state is equivalent to EpiSC and mouse post-implantation epiblast instead of human blastocyst. These data suggest that conventional hPSC could be an artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the mouse epiblast exhibits a regional pluripotency spectrum. The first cells to exit from the naïve state are localized in the anterior epiblast to generate the epiblast-ectoderm at E6.5. In contrast, the posterior epiblast’s pluripotent cells initiate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition to produce the streak primitive and primordial germ cell specification. Thus, pluripotency is a temporal process during development and has a spatial component that defines the anterior and posterior epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, hPSC can self-organize to form anteriorized or posteriorized embryonic-like sacs capable of recapitulating pattern events inherent to the anterior-posterior epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zheng, 2019</xref>). These findings support the notion that there are different regionalized human pluripotent states analogous to mouse epiblast that could be captured in vitro, representing the plethora of pluripotent stem cells during <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> development. Lastly, amniotic epithelium segregation occurs directly from the epiblast during implantation in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boroviak and Nichols, 2017</xref>), lacking process in murine development. Indeed, experiments where human embryos replicate implantation in vitro have confirmed that the human amniotic epithelium derives from the epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deglincerti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shahbazi et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, pluripotent cells interaction with the amniotic epithelium could be crucial to understanding the transition among different pluripotency states and the regionalization in the human epiblast. Here, we explore whether the human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-human amniotic epithelial cell (hAEC) co-culture could exhibit a pluripotent substate with a different potential from the primed or naïve. We reported that hESC-hAEC shares the basal pluripotent signature analogous to the hESC-iMEF conventional primed state without naïve pluripotent-related factor expression. However, hAEC interaction provides a unique molecular profile and differentiation potential similar to that of the anterior epiblast hESC in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>hAEC and their conditioned media support undifferentiated hESC</title><p>We previously reported the hESC line (Amicqui-1) derivation on hAEC using poor-quality embryos as a source, demonstrating its pluripotency by teratoma assay and lineage-specific marker detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ávila-González et al., 2015</xref>). Our first question was if this condition confers a pluripotent state similar or different to the conventional condition (AMIQ hESC-iMEF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we compared POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG expression in both conditions. Since hAEC have a ‘pluripotency core’ because of their epiblast origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deglincerti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shahbazi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avila-González et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">García-Castro et al., 2015</xref>), we included an hAEC sample to discard that the expression levels in the hESC-hAEC co-culture were partially due to the amniotic epithelium. Short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping was carried out to verify the authenticity of human cell lines (Amicqui-1, H1, and H9), indicating that gene expression results were exclusively from embryonic stem cells and not a mixture of both populations (data not shown).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of pluripotency in alternative human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-human amniotic epithelial cell (hAEC) and conventional hESC-inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (iMEF).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative phase-contrast micrographs of Amicqui-1 hESC on hAEC feeder layer (AMIQ hESC-hAEC) and Amicqui-1 hESC on iMEF feeder layer (AMIQ hESC-iMEF).

These results suggest that there are no differences in the hESC ‘pluripotency core’ regardless of whether they grow on an alternative hAEC or conventional iMEF feeder layer.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the hAEC feeder layer can maintain hESC without cell-to-cell interaction. hESC lines (Amicqui-1, H1, and H9) were cultured on Matrigel with hAEC conditioned media (hAEC-CM) or iMEF conditioned media (iMEF-CM) during 10 passages. In both feeder-free conditions, the cells changed their morphology, growing in a monolayer until they reached confluence, as reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The qPCR analysis showed no differences in the relative expression of hESC-hAEC-CM versus hESC-iMEF-CM, whereas the ‘pluripotency core’ immunodetection was similar between both conditions for the three evaluated lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The qPCR analysis showed no differences for ZFP42, TBX3, PRDM14, and KLF4 in the Amicqui-1 line under the four groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that the pluripotent global network remains unaltered regardless of the experimental environment. Then, we examined differences in lineage-specific gene expression (SOX17 and GATA6 for endoderm, T for mesoderm, and OTX2 for ectoderm). AMIQ hESC-hAEC, AMIQ hESC-iMEF-CM, and AMIQ hESC-hAEC-CM decreased SOX17 and GATA6 expression (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01; p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.01; p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) as compared with AMIQ hESC-iMEF.

Interestingly, OTX2 expression increased only in the AMIQ hESC-hAEC condition (p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This transcription factor is vital during mESC to EpiSC transition and anterior neural fate specification.

We then compared its profile with that of the AMIQ hESC-hAEC condition. As expected, since the first passage, AMIQ hESC changed their morphology to dome-shaped colonies with smaller cells in both naïve protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). POU5F1 (p&lt;0.01 and p&lt;0.001 versus Duggal and Zimmerlin conditions, respectively) and SOX2 (p&lt;0.0001 versus both conditions) expression levels increased in both naïve conditions as compared with AMIQ hESC-iMEF and AMIQ hESC-hAEC conditions. However, we did not find differences in NANOG expression in any of the conditions examined by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Interestingly, the lineage-specific gene expression related to primed pluripotency (GATA6, SOX17, OTX2, and T) was not downregulated under both naïve conditions; even the mesoderm marker T increased compared to conventional hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Moreover, although the AMIQ hESC-hAEC condition does not have the gene profile associated with the naïve state, it exhibited the lowest expression levels of endoderm markers (GATA6 and SOX17), and OTX2 exhibited the highest expression as compared with its naïve counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). These data indicate that AMIQ hESC-hAEC is not a culture condition that simulates the naïve pluripotent state in vitro. Its low lineage-specific gene expression is not analogous to the conventional primed hESC-iMEF molecular profile, suggesting that the hESC-hAEC condition may have a different molecular network representing a pluripotent identity other than naïve or primed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The hESC-hAEC condition displays a divergence in signaling pathways in contrast with the conventional culture</title><p>FGF2 is the main factor required to maintain undifferentiated hESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eiselleova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ludwig et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mossahebi-Mohammadi et al., 2020</xref>).

The absence of FGF2 for 48 hr induced the partial loss of OCT4 and NANOG in AMIQ hESC-hAEC, suggesting a differentiation process. In contrast, immunodetection of each pluripotent marker was not reduced in AMIQ hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that the FGF2 pathway is fundamental to maintain the AMIQ hESC pluripotency on hAEC. Also, the quick disappearance of the pluripotency factors signal in hESC-hAEC in the absence of exogenous FGF2 involves different signaling pathways that could trigger differentiation in our alternative condition. To prove it, we determined the protein phospho-kinase and cytokine levels throughout proteome arrays in Amicqui-1 with the hAEC and iMEF co-culture, H1 with iMEF (control), and hAEC alone.

When FGF2 was removed from the culture medium, the loss of pluripotency factors in AMIQ hESC-hAEC was faster than in hESC-iMEFs. Hence, it is likely that SRC pathways participate in differentiation processes in the AMIQ hESC-hAEC condition once the maintenance of exogenous FGF2-dependent pluripotency is disrupted.

The DEG analysis demonstrated that genes involved in these pathways, such as IGF2 and IGBP3 (for PI3K/Akt path), LAMA3 and LAMB3 (ECM-receptor interaction), increase their expression in AMIQ hESC-hAEC, unlike in all other groups. Intriguingly, concerning the Wnt pathway, WNT6 (involved in neural crest induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schmidt et al., 2007</xref>) was upregulated, while WNT3 (necessary for primitive streak establishment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>) was down-regulated in AMIQ hESC-hAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), supporting the low similarity score with the primitive streak from the computational deconvolution analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

We found several similar pathway clusters related to the regulation of morphogenesis (animal organ morphogenesis, anatomical structure morphogenesis, tissue morphogenesis, animal organ development, etc.) and other smaller clusters involved in cell adhesion, type I hemidesmosome and cell-junction assemblies and ECM organization upregulated in AMIQ hESC-hAEC versus H1 hESC-iMEF, H9 hESC-iMEF, and AMIQ hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Comparison with the TesR1 condition showed upregulation of morphogenesis processes, type I hemidesmosome assembly and cell adhesion, just like the comparison with H1 hESC-iMEF. Also, glucose metabolism, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, and Wnt and IGF pathways were upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B</xref>). When we compared AMIQ hESC-hAEC and the AMIQ hESC-iMEF-CM conditions, we found a similar profile against H1 hESC-iMEF and TesR1 conditions (upregulation of morphogenesis, type I hemidesmosome and cell-junction assemblies, ECM organization, and Wnt and IGF pathways) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>).

When we compared AMIQ hESC-hAEC with naïve conditions (2iL +Gö and 5iL/A), we found that morphogenesis, cell junction, cell adhesion, and ECM organization, like under the other conditions, were upregulated.

Although our enrichment analysis did not find differences for this pathway between AMIQ hESC-hAEC and H1 hESC-iMEF, we detected a higher release of IGFBP3 into the conditioned media through the proteome arrays exclusively in AMIQ hESC-hAEC and hAEC compared with H1 hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In harmony with these data, DEG analysis indicated that IGFBP3 and IGF2 were upregulated in AMIQ hESC-hAEC compared with all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, both genes were downregulated in AMIQ hESC-hAEC as compared with hAEC and the hPSC-derived amnion. Recently, single-cell characterization of the human embryonic gastrula identified IGFBP3 as part of the molecular identity of the amniotic ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tyser, 2021</xref>).

To demonstrate whether the co-culture of hESC-hAEC acquires functional properties of the formative pluripotency and not only POU3F1, OTX1, and SALL2 expression, we carried out a differentiation protocol toward human primordial germ cells (hPGC) in AMIQ hESC-hAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), AMIQ hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), and H9 hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) and compared their efficiency between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). hESCs were detached from their respective feeder layer and cultured on Matrigel under mesoderm-like cell (MeLC) induction conditions for 2 days. Subsequently, the cells were subjected to Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4), Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and Stem Cell Factor (SCF) treatment. On day 9 (D9) and day 12 (D12), after initiating the differentiation protocol, we evaluated the TFAP2C, BLIMP1, and STELLA germline markers. At D9, we observed a higher number of TFAP2C/STELLA double-positive cells in AMIQ hESC-hAEC compared with MEF conditions; it was also the only condition with BLIMP1/STELLA double-positive cells. Although all groups presented the three germline markers at D12, we did not observe the BLIMP1+/STELLA+ colocalization in the hESC-iMEF groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggested that hESC on hAEC have a better predisposition to differentiate toward the germline.</p><p>During the formative transition, cells acquired an epithelial phenotype and increased their interaction with the ECM, events displayed during the implantation period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith, 2017</xref>).

Furthermore, DEG analysis showed an upregulation of epithelialization and interactions with ECM genes in the AMIQ hESC-hAEC condition. Hence, we determined TRIM29, ITGB6, CST6, and VTCN1 expression. These genes were selected because TRIM29 and CST6 are enriched in the squamous epithelium, while the ITGB6 (fibronectin receptor) signals from the ECM to the cells, according to the Human Protein Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Uhlen, 2015</xref>). We found a higher expression in AMIQ hESC-hAEC as compared with the other groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, a recent study demonstrated the existence of an ‘intermediate’ subpopulation, which exhibited a specific gene signature involved in morphological structure formation and development in hESC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Messmer et al., 2019</xref>). We explored whether the AMIQ hESC-hAEC condition expresses these intermediate genes. Through DEG analysis, we found that CERCAM, DSC3, CLIC3, GBP2, KCNN4, IGFBP3, KANK4, C1orf21, KRT7, ODAM, WNT6, TGM2, RBBP8NL, and VTCN1, which correspond to the intermediate gene set, were upregulated in AMIQ hESC-hAEC (FC&gt;1.5, p&lt;0.05) as compared with primed (feeder and feeder-free conditions), naïve (2iL +Gö, 3iL, 5iL/FA and XAV939), and expanded hPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Indeed, these genes were expressed in cells exiting from the naïve state to continue with the formative pluripotency. Nonetheless, POU3F1, OTX2, and SOX3 expression (associated with formative pluripotency in mice) was not reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Messmer et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we found that the AMIQ hESC-hAE condition expressed POU3F1, OTX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and OTX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), and genes also enriched in the intermediate population. The ‘intermediate’ genes (except C1orf21) were downregulated in AMIQ hESC-hAEC compared to hAEC isolated from amnion at term; whereas the expression of IGFBP3, RBBP8NL, WNT6, and VTCN1 was higher in the hPSC-derived amnion than in AMIQ hESC-hAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>VTCN1 and CERCAM are localized in cell junctions of epithelial cells, while DSC3 is distributed in squamous epithelia (amnion cells are considered ‘squamous epithelia’), and ODAM can be detected in the epithelial cell nucleoplasm.

It has also been demonstrated that the derivation of amnion-like cells from hESC involves ‘intermediate’ gene upregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These data suggest that a subpopulation of pluripotent cells that express the intermediate genes could be predisposed to differentiate into the squamous epithelium or amniotic ectoderm.

As a first approach to investigate the processes involved in the transition of embryonic cells to the amnion, we compared the AMIQ hESC-hAEC condition with the hPSC-derived amnion and hAEC at term. We found an upregulation of morphogenesis, hemidesmosome assembly, and cell adhesion compared with the hPSC-derived amnion. Additionally, the degradation of extracellular collagen, glucose metabolism, phospholipase regulation, hydrolase, and endopeptidase activity predominated in these compared conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>).

The most constant downregulated processes (versus conventional, 2iL, and XAV) were ‘chromatin organization’ and ‘activation of HOX genes’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A and E, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). The earliest expression of HOX gene occurred in the most posterior segment of the primitive streak, a mechanism conserved in murines, fish, amphibians, and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deschamps and Duboule, 2017</xref>). The primary detection of OTX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), following forebrain development and other anterior structure genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), the downregulation of genes such as HOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>) as well as genes involved in primitive streak establishment such as WNT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), support the notion that the hESC-hAEC condition could represent transitional or regional pluripotency corresponding to the anteriorized epiblast and be more suitable for neural induction and the differentiation of anterior structures. hESC-hAEC showed a better capacity to produce TFAP2C+/STELLA+ and BLIMP1+/STELLA+ cells compared with hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The origin of hPGC is not all clear. Its specification begins on day 12 post-fertilization, from an intermediate pluripotent subpopulation between naïve and primed, called ‘germinal pluripotency’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, it could also arise from the dorsal amnion at day 11 post-fertilization in cynomolgus monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, the protocol to produce hPGC involves, as a first step, obtaining ‘incipient MeLC’ before expressing germline markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, signaling from the amnion is required for mesoderm formation in non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang, 2021</xref>). Therefore, in the hESC-hAEC condition, the cells would acquire a greater competence to derivate hPGC through non-embryonic mesoderm (they do not express some essential genes for establishing the primitive streak ) or an intermediate substate that generates both amnion and germline. However, this assessment needs further exploration.</p><p>Furthermore, the neural induction assay demonstrated that differentiation into cortical neurons (deep layers) was superior in AMIQ hESC-hAEC as compared with conventional hESC-iMEF, suggesting its preference to differentiate toward the anterior neuroectoderm (forebrain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p>Which are the signals provided by the amnion (intracellular signaling cascades activated either by amnion-secreted factors that bind to hESC-membrane receptors or embryonic cell-amniotic cell interactions) to trigger the slant toward the anterior ectoderm’s fate in hESC? Although we did not identify a significant molecule by which hAEC induce their effect to maintain the unique molecular identity of AMIQ hESC-hAEC (in convergence with exogenous FGF2), the proteome arrays showed a contrasted activation of pluripotency-related pathways, which have also been identified in the early human and pig embryo, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wamaitha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yilmaz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou, 2009</xref>) and JAK/STAT and MAPK paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ramos-Ibeas et al., 2019</xref>), respectively, as well as SRC family kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Differential response to the neural differentiation was evident with inhibitor treatments in hESC-hAEC compared with hESC-iMEF. First, PI3K/AKT inhibition did not affect either condition, while STAT3 inhibitor altered both conditions for neural induction efficiency. Lastly, SRC and MAPK blockade disrupted the biased neural potential of AMIQ hESC-hAEC, showing decreased NRG and fewer neural progenitors and mature neurons, unlike its AMIQ hESC-iMEF counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B and C</xref>).</p><p>Since the SRC pathway can trigger PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and MAPK downstream signaling, it can be considered a master pathway. PI3K/AKT induces adhesion, migration, growth, and survival during hESC pluripotency maintenance. In contrast, MAPK and JAK/STAT could have an essential role in differentiation, implantation, and embryogenesis rather than in maintaining pluripotency. For example, the IL6/JAK/STAT3 pathway is involved in the epiblast-trophectoderm interaction during implantation. Our data suggest an interaction between amnion and embryonic cells involves the SRC and ERK2 pathway. Therefore, SRC can be triggered by EGFR with its ligand EGF or focal adhesions. The amnion secretes EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koizumi et al., 2000</xref>), and the proteome showed a higher activity of EGFR in hESC-hAEC versus hESC-iMEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated an overrepresented focal adhesion pathway in hESC-hAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which may activate the SRC pathway. We did not find NRG upregulation in the hESC-hAEC-CM condition; it is more likely that the biased effect toward neural differentiation is due to the co-culture of both cell types. In AMIQ hESC-hAEC, the hemidesmosome and focal adhesion mechanotransduction signals were highly enriched, involved in adhesion and polarized migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jansen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, this phenomenon would play an essential role in embryogenesis and morphogenesis. For example, it has been suggested that the polar trophectoderm exerts mechanical forces to mold the disc-shaped epiblast characteristic of primate embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weberling and Zernicka-Goetz, 2021</xref>). Hence, we propose that the EGF pathway, a master pathway that activates PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, and MAPK pathways, and focal adhesion signals induce SRC-family activation.</p><p>These overrepresented paths could hinder the use of NRG transcriptional repression complexes in AMIQ hESC-hAEC, predisposing hESC to a pluripotent state directed toward lineages of anterior ectoderm-epiblast. For example, Akt can phosphorylate EZH2, displacing it from the PCR2 complex and switching from a repressor to a transcriptional activator on the previously silenced target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, interaction with amniotic epithelium upregulated a set of NRGs such as LHX5 and SIX3 in hESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), which are epiblast gene signatures in the pre-gastrula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tyser, 2021</xref>). These NRGs induce cortical phenotypes, as we corroborated in our differentiation protocol toward neural fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). However, temporary inhibition (pre-treatment 48 hr before neural induction) of SRC, ERK2, and STAT3 disrupted these neural biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>), and alternatively, the derived cells increased the expression of N2RF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), so depending on the signals received, hESC also could differentiate into the polar trophectoderm.</p><p>To explain the NRG upregulation in the pluripotent state of hESC-hAEC, we hypothesized two mechanisms: (1) a PCR2 depression in target genes via phosphorylation of EZH2. EZH2 might promote their transcriptional activation together with cofactors promoted by IGF2/PI3K/Akt/mTOR and JAK/STAT3 pathways. The selective NRG upregulation might be mediated through antisense non-coding RNAs that function as guide RNAs to depress or even activate their complementary protein-coding sense partner. (2) hESC-hAEC have different pluripotent sub-states, of which one of them presents a bias toward the ectoderm, characterized by specific miRNAs enrichment. Moreover, subunits of PCR2, such as SUZ12, are inhibited by the miR-200 family in cancer stem cells. Interestingly, miR-200c-3p was highly expressed in hAEC and hESC-hAEC under the feeder layer and CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Thus, miR-200c-3p is a candidate to regulate SUZ12 in NRG expressed in hESC-hAEC. Additionally, miR-200c-3p could inhibit molecules involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition to avoid the differentiation into mesoderm lineages.</p><p>The contrast between hESC-hAEC and conventional hESC-iMEF in differentiating toward anterior neural destinations could be due to epiblast regionalization in the most anterior part. The imperative model of neural induction during embryogenesis in vertebrates establishes that neural cells have an anterior identity by ‘default’ and differentiate into a posterior fate in response to extrinsic signals. However, this notion has recently been challenged, proposing a period between the pluripotency stages and neural induction where the embryonic cells acquire a regional identity (anterior versus posterior) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Metzis et al., 2018</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that the mouse epiblast presents regional and temporal states of pluripotency to generate the epiblast-ectoderm or the posterior epiblast at E6.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng et al., 2019</xref>). The primed pluripotency would be in the posterior region of the epiblast to form the primitive streak. In contrast, the formative pluripotency is maintained in the anterior epiblast by inhibiting pathways such as WNT. As has been proposed, this pluripotency substate would become restricted in the anterior epiblast to form the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith, 2017</xref>), and we suggested that in humans the amnion might play an organizing role to maintain formative pluripotency or skew the pluripotent potential toward the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for human embryogenesis with amnion as an organizer.</title><p>Simplified scheme of embryonic stages in humans and its in vitro counterparts of human pluripotent stem cell lines (hPSC) represent or possess some characteristics of each state. Totipotency can be represented by the expanded and extended hPSC (1). Different conditions to maintaining naïve hPSC have been characterized, which resemble the pre-implantation epiblast (2). The formative pluripotency has recently been proposed as an intermediate period between the naïve and primed states. hPSC treated with the WNT inhibitor XAV939 and FTW-hiPSC could exhibit some characteristics of this phase, although there is still no established consensus of the in vitro conditions that represent this period (3). At peri-implantation, pluripotency could be spatially disaggregated for epiblast anterior-posterior regionalization and specification of amnion and human primordial germ cells (hPGC) (4). The amnion could arise from a subpopulation of pluripotent cells of the formative or primed epiblast (5). Primordial germ cells (PGCs) could be derived from another subpopulation (called ‘germinal pluripotency’ by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), although it has been suggested that they could also be specified from amnion (6). The anteriorized post-implanted epiblast will generate the anterior structures such as the neuroectoderm (7). The posteriorized post-implanted epiblast will give rise to the primitive streak and the most posterior region of the neuroectoderm (8). Recent reports suggest that the polar trophectoderm derives from pluripotent cells that transit through amnion-like cells (9). The condition of human embryonic stem cells growing on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (hESC-iMEF) could share more characteristics of the posterior epiblast given the interaction with a fibroblast cell type to favor the epithelium-mesenchyme transition. hESC-human amniotic epithelial cells (hAEC) have a more significant bias to differentiate into anterior neuroectoderm, but they also have the capacity to form germline cells and probably polar trophectoderm. Therefore, hESC-hAEC could be composed of subpopulations that form a continuum from the formative phase, as well as an intermediate population for specification of the amnion and germ line, to finally segregate to the anterior part of the epiblast. The amnion secretes signals or interacts directly with the primed epiblast until the onset of gastrulation promotes the neural induction or primitive streak formation (dotted arrow, probably route of differentiation; dotted red arrow, probably interactions between lineages).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-68035-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) promotes the anterior regionalization and restricts the formation of the primitive streak to the posterior region of the epiblast in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoshida et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, the extraembryonic ectoderm promotes the induction and specific positioning of the AVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rodriguez et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the amniotic epithelium could be the equivalent to the extraembryonic ectoderm in primates and has a direct or indirect function in regulating the anterior regionalization of the epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rossant and Tam, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, hPSC can self-organize to develop an anteriorized embryonic-like sac where two types of cells co-exist: a population corresponding to the anterior epiblast-like cells and amniotic ectoderm-like cells. This suggests that in peri-implantation-stage human embryos, there is a lapse where the anterior epiblast co-exists with the nascent amniotic epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Because our differential expression data were obtained from bulk RNA-seq, it was impossible to identify whether AMIQ-hESC-hAEC was composed of two coexisting subpopulations, a primed-formative pluripotent with potential skewed toward the anterior neuroectoderm and the other with potential to transit toward the amniotic squamous epithelium. Three-dimensional models of human embryogenesis can elucidate whether ‘intermediate genes’ are related to the amnion’s specification from the epiblast and resolve the supposed importance of the amnion’s interaction with the embryonic cells. We theorize that this interaction is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways that could promote pluripotency regionalization with a predisposition to develop anteriorized structures such as the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the cerebrospinal liquid arises from the amniotic fluid, which is arrested in the amniotic cavity when the neural tube is enclosed, providing evidence of the intimate relationship between the amnion and the onset of neuroectoderm induction in the anterior epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chau, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In the mouse embryo, the transition from naïve to primed epiblast is characterized by Wnt inhibition and OTX2 induction, so the epiblast forms a rosette with a lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neagu et al., 2020</xref>). In humans, lumenogenesis forms the amniotic cavity during implantation. In this stage, the amnion derives from the epiblast. Thus, we propose that an epiblast subpopulation specified into the epithelium-amnion may be characteristic of gestation in humans and other primates. Moreover, hESC-hAEC expresses a set of genes described in an intermediate population between naïve and primed hPSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Messmer et al., 2019</xref>). VTCN1, DSC3, CERCAM, and ODAM are localized in epithelial phenotype cells; besides, the GO analysis of the AMIQ hESC-hAEC transcriptome indicated the upregulation of biological processes related to cell adhesion, epithelial development, and organization of the ECM, which agrees with the theory that the formative cells undergo epithelialization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smith, 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, the ‘intermediate gene’ expression involved in epithelialization was higher in hAEC alone and in the hPSC-derived amnion than in the hESC-hAEC condition. We propose that ‘intermediate genes’ are an expression signature to monitor the transition from a columnar epiblast to the squamous amniotic epithelium. Thus, we inquired whether during the transition between naïve and primed human stages, a subpopulation of epiblast or embryonic cells has the signature of these genes and could participate in the amniotic epithelium specification.</p><p>Interestingly, amnion nascent-related VTCN1 and epithelialization genes were decreased in SRC and ERK2 inhibition conditions in hESC-hAEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This data suggests that their inhibition avoided differentiation into neuroectoderm and non-neural/amniotic ectoderm. However, in AMIQ hESC-hAEC before and after being treated with SRC and ERK2 inhibitors, NR2F2 was upregulated, which is considered essential for the maturation of the polar trophectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The side of the embryo where the polar trophectoderm arises is the endometrium implantation site of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meistermann et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is postulated that there is an epiblast-trophectoderm interaction to ensure correct implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weberling and Zernicka-Goetz, 2021</xref>). Still, the role of the amnion is unknown, considering that during implantation, the amniotic cavity is formed, which would be a tripartite epiblast-amnion-trophectoderm relationship.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a fine line for identifying trophectoderm and amnion lineages in primate embryos. For example, a pre-print argues that in blastoids (human blastocyst-like structures derived from hPSC), the most external lineage cells do not form trophectoderm-like cells but are amnion-like cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.442980v3">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.07.442980v3</ext-link>). Other reports suggest that trophectoderm-like cells can derive from hPSC but first must transit through an amnion-like state (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.28.450118">https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.28.450118</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chhabra and Warmflash, 2021</xref>). Although the trophectoderm is specified when defining the pre-implantation blastocyst, the extraembryonic ectoderm derived from the amnion probably corresponds to the polar trophectoderm, necessary for embryo implantation.</p><p>A previous study suggested that primordial germ cells (PGCs) specified from the nascent amnion in the cynomolgus monkey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>), although a recent study indicates that progenitors of human PGCs present a gene expression signature of both amniotic and gastrulation lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the extraembryonic mesoderm is also closely related to the amnion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang, 2021</xref>). These results indicate that the amnion has a predominant role in developing extraembryonic lineages such as trophoectoderm, extraembryonic mesoderm, and germline specification. Our results in conjunction with these studies could be the basis to establish the amnion as a novel organizer for correct embryogenesis beyond implantation in humans and non-human primates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>hAEC isolation for use as a feeder layer</title><p>Fetal membranes were obtained after receiving informed consent from women with a pregnancy delivered at term gestation (37–40 weeks) by cesarean section and without a history of infection.

The principal components of all samples were calculated with R ‘prcomp’ function. To merge the different datasets, the common genes were selected, and all those with the value of zero in all samples were eliminated. The most variable genes across the samples were plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Validation of RNA-seq data by qPCR-based array analysis</title><p>An RT2 PCR Array (Qiagen, 330171) was customized for the detection of 12 selected genes that were the most upregulated in hESC-hAEC. Previously isolated RNA samples were used to synthesize cDNA using the RT2 First Strand Kit (Qiagen, 330401), which were mixed with RT2 SYBR Green ROX qPCR MasterMix to load them into RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays. The samples were run in a Rotor-Gene Q 7000 thermocycler (Qiagen) under the following cycling conditions: one cycle of 10 min at 95°C and then 40 cycles of 15 and 30 s at 95°C and 60°C, respectively. The threshold cycle (CT) for each sample was calculated using the real-time cycler software. The data were normalized with five housekeeping genes (GUSB, GAPDH, PGK1, TFRC, and ACTB), and the relative expression was calculated by 2-ΔΔCT method, using hESC-iMEF (Amicqui line) as a calibrator.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Induction of human primordial germinal-like cells</title><p>Two hundred thousand cells per well were plated on Matrigel-coated 12-well plates in GK15 medium: Glasgow media (Sigma-Aldrich, G6148) supplemented with 15% KSR, 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 3 μM CHIR99021, 50 ng/mL Activin A (R&amp;D Systems, 338-AC), and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor (StemCell Technologies, 72302). After 24 hr, cells were detached using Accutase and plated 4000 cells/well of GK15 medium supplemented with 200 ng/mL BMP4 (R&amp;D Systems, 314 BP), 20 ng/mL human LIF, 100 ng/mL SCF (R&amp;D Systems, 255-SC), 50 ng/mL EGF, and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.

The medium was changed daily, and on day 4 of the induction protocol (D4), the hESC were cultured with N2 medium (480 mL of DMEM/F12, 5 mL of N-2 supplement 100× [Gibco, 17502–048], 5 mL of GlutaMAX [Gibco, 35050–061], 5 mL of amino acid non-essentials, 5 mL sodium pyruvate, 500 μg/mL of BSA, 5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin [Gibco, 15070–063], 910 µL of mercaptoethanol, SB431542 [10 μM], and dorsomorphin [2 μM]). At D12, the cells were detached with 0.875 mg/mL Dispase II (Gibco, 17105–041) and plated in dishes treated with poly-L-ornithine and laminin (Sigma-Aldrich) at a density of 50,000 cells/cm<sup>3</sup> in N2 medium supplemented with 20 ng/mL FGF2, 20 ng/mL EGF, and Y27632 (10 µM, final concentration). The next day (D13) the medium was exchanged for a mixture (1:1) of N2 medium with B27 medium (490 mL of Neurobasal, 10 mL of B27 supplement 50× [Gibco, 12,587–010], 5 mL of GlutaMax, and 5 mL of penicillin-streptomycin) supplemented with FGF2 (20 ng/mL), and EGF (20 ng/mL). The following 3 days, N2B27 medium was changed daily, adding growth factors. From D16, growth factor treatment was suspended, and the N2B27 medium was exchanged every third day. At D20, the cells were passaged onto Matrigel-coated plates exchanging N2B27 medium daily. The cells were passaged again on D25 and D35. From this stage, the culture cells were maintained with N2B27 exchanged every 4–5 days until subsequent fixation and detection of neural and cortical lineage markers by immunofluorescence (D40–D60).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Inhibition of signaling pathways by small molecules</title><p>Amicqui-1 on iMEF or hAEC was treated separately with LY294002 (StemCell Technologies, 72152) (5 µM and 10 µM), PD0325901 (Tocris, 4192) (1 µM), A419259 (Tocris, 3914) (1 µM and 3 µM), or Stattic (Tocris, 2798) (2.5 µM and 5 µM).

literature. Ávila-González et al., show that human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) can be used to support a unique primed pluripotent state in which cells are biased towards an anterior neural identity. The authors explore the unique identity of these lineage-primed pluripotent cells suggesting they could be used for more efficient neural differentiation. The ability of hAECs to support a pre-patterned cell type that continues to express pluripotency markers also implies new roles for the aminion in patterning and supporting early human embryos.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68035.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Brickman</surname><given-names>Joshua M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02309jg23</institution-id><institution>University of Copenhagen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Denmark</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The amniotic epithelium triggers an alternative state of human pluripotency&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Better evidence that these cells represent a new pluripotent state. All three reviewers would like to see a better indication of what defines this state, improved gene expression analysis, in vivo comparsons and analysis of gene expression. What is the profile of hAEC vs hESC in these co-cultures? Two of the reviewers felt that the existing RNAseq analysis takes up large sections of the main figures, but add little to the narrative.</p><p>2) Some evidence that molecule(s) produced by hAEC cells can induce this pluripotent state and/or the mechanism by which they induce it would be essential for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>3) While the authors have focused on enhanced anterior neural specification, the notion that this is biased or regionalized state of pluripotency, would also suggest that differentiation to other lineages might be restricted. They should compare the relative efficiencies with which hAEC cultured hESCs and standard hESCs differentiate into primitive streak derivatives or primordial germ cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>González et al., chacterized the hAEC culture condition and found it was dependent on exogeneous FGF2 and then characterized specific signalling pathways there were unique to the hAEC supported pluripotency and cytokines produced by hAECs. In particular they observed an abundance of Src activation in hAEC supported ESCs. They follow this up with transcriptome analysis, where they compare hAEC supported cells to different published ESC culture systems. There are a lot of comparisons, but the bottom line is these cells appear anterior epiblast poised for neural differentiation. While the generation of neural progentintors from all lineages tested was similar, the hAEC cultured cells gave rise to enhanced differentiation towards neural lineages found in the forebrain. They conclude by suggesting hAEC-cultured ESCs exhibit upregulation of polycomb targets and propose that hAEC cells produce a factor that could repress polycomb activity. They suggest that this mechanism might by mediated by miR200b/c miRNA, highly expressed in hAEC and upregrulated in hESCs cultured with hAEC.</p><p>As suggested above, this paper suggests hAEC impart regionalation or developmental identity on hESC cultures, produces cells that resemble the anterior epiblast that is uniquely poised for anterior neural differentiation. The paper could be strengthened by providing a better assessment of the cell states formed by co-culture with hAECs, how do they cells compare to available primate RNAseq datasets and how homogeneously are they anterior epiblast? In a similar set of analysis they could address the nature of the hAECs used here and explore whether they represent regionalized amnion? In addition the paper suggests candidates for the molecules produced by hAECs that induce this phenotype, but they do not provide any functional evidence for their candidates.</p><p>This manuscript introduces a novel idea, that amnionic epithelial cells can instill positional epiblast identity onto human ESC cultures. However, there remain a number of issues that should be resolved prior to publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. The gene expression analysis in Figure 4-6 is incomplete and yet takes up a large part of the main figures. If these cells generally represent regionalized, pre-neural epiblast, normally found adjacent to the amnion, then some analysis of the single cell sequencing from the human and primate embryo data should be undertaken (Xiang et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2019; Nakamura et al., 2017), this analysis should also include the spectrum of ESC cell states that have been published. The authors perform a number of comparisons, but none of these place the hAEC supported cells in context of this spectrum; they could for example compare gene expression changes that occur as development progresses to the gene expression changes that occur in the different ESC cell states as they progress or alternatively try some sort of global analysis of developmental stage with the different ESC data.</p><p>2. The model in 8b implies that the amnionic epithelium has regionalized inductive properties. What cell type is represented by the hAEC cells. Using similar analysis to that described above, they could address this issue. It also might help them to refine their list of potential &quot;inductive,&quot; molecules.</p><p>3. There is a lot of discussion of potential candidates for induction of anterior epiblast fate by hAECs, but none of these are tested. To produce the level of advance required for <italic>eLife</italic>, some demonstration of a candidate produced by the hAEC cells that promotes anterior epiblast identity in ESCs, is important. Even better, if the authors could find a candidate that was also localized in the amnion based on the single cell transcriptome data and that was produced by their hAEC cells this would make the manuscript much stronger.</p><p>4. The demonstration that these cells are poised for anterior neural specification is very interesting. Are they less effective at generating primitive streak cell types?</p><p>5. There appears some confusion in the text about the term pluripotency. It is not really pluripotency that becomes regionalized, but epiblast. Or one could generate pluripotent cells with regional identity. The is also a bit of confusion between different stages of pluripotency. For example, the so called &quot;Rosette,&quot; state and &quot;Formative,&quot; state. The Rosette state requires only inhibition of Wnt signaling (Neagu et al., 2020), while Formative pluripotency is achieved based on relief of FGF/ERK inhibition as well (Kalkan et al., 2017) and trapped by Wnt and RAR inhibition(Kinoshita et al., 2021), and it is not clear how different &quot;formative,&quot; is from some variations of standard, primed human ESCs (Davidson, Mason, and Pera 2015). However, anterior neural differentiation can be directly accessed in the presence of a block to ERK from naïve pluripotency, suggesting it can occur via something like a Rosette state or pre-formative epiblast (Hamilton and Brickman 2014). When and how does anterior epiblast become primed for differentiation away from primitive streak derivatives? This is an excellent question, but the data in the paper doesn't really address this. As it is difficult to resolve so called &quot;formative,&quot; markers from anterior epiblast, perhaps it would be easier to avoid overuse of specific labels and stick with analogous embryonic structures. While these cells are FGF2 dependent, it would suggest they are more &quot;primed,&quot; rather than formative but as this is all in a human context it is difficult to resolve this and as eluded to above primed pluripotency in some human examples maybe closer to what is called formative. Moreover, I also find it hard to resolve &quot;formative,&quot; and anterior epiblast, based on the handle of markers assessed here. Perhaps they will be able to derive better evidence for this staged model of differentiation from the transcriptomic analysis requested in point 2, but I am not sure this will provide a clear answer. Experimentally they could ask how dependent these cells on ERK signaling? This would be interesting to resolve, as ERK activity is significantly lower in the anterior epiblast than on the posterior side in the region of the primitive streak. They could attempt to convert naïve cells to this state through a staged differentiation trajectory with specific inhibitors and demonstrate when these cells become uniquely anteriorized? While these are all interesting experiments, they could also just revise the discussion and Figure 8 and focus on epiblast-like, anterior epiblast-like.</p><p>Specific Comments</p><p>1. Otx2 upregulated in AEC feeder culture, but not with conditioned media (Figure 2B)? As Otx2 is one of the principle markers interpreted, perhaps the authors should give this some thought.</p><p>2. Increase size of labels on the figures, they are very difficult to read.</p><p>3. hAECs have some pluripotent gene expression and qualities. What is the extent that the data in Figure 3C, reflects the activity in hAECs or hESCs? Should these experiments not be using conditioned media?</p><p>References</p><p>Davidson, Kathryn C, Elizabeth A Mason, and Martin F Pera. 2015. 'The Pluripotent State in Mouse and Human.'

Two of the reviewers felt that the existing RNAseq analysis takes up large sections of the main figures, but add little to the narrative.</p></disp-quote><p>To define the in vitro pluripotent status of hESC-hAECs at the transcriptome level, we compared bulk RNA-seq data vs. other hPSC lines under conventional primed, feeder-free, expanded, and formative conditions. The data was represented in a principal components analysis (new Figure 3A) and in a heatmap (new Figure 3B). On the other hand, we carried out computational deconvolution analysis using CIBERSORT to estimate the relative similarity of the bulk RNA-seq of hESC-hAEC with the scRNA-seq of human epiblast (Xiang et al., 2020) and pre-gastrula embryo lineages (Tyser et al., 2021) (new Figure 3C).</p><p>The transcriptomic profile of hAEC vs hESC was compared and the DEG results were visualized in the pathway enrichment analysis by Cytoscape (Figure 3—figure supplement 5B).

In a new set of experiments, we separately inhibited each of these signaling pathways with small molecules in the hESC cultures on hAEC and the conventional primed counterpart hESC on iMEF. Inhibitors were added on two consecutive days in hESC medium supplemented with FGF2. Subsequently, we looked for differences in the presence of pluripotency factors and expression of the genes that we detected as upregulated in hESC-hAEC (new Figure 6). In addition, we carried out the neural induction protocol, to investigate whether an initial inhibition of any of these pathways could alter the previous results of increased neural potential in hESC-hAEC. The small molecules used were PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (5 µM and 10 µM), ERK2 inhibitor PD0325901 (1 µM and 2 µM), SRC inhibitor A419259 (1 µM and 3 µM), STAT3 inhibitor Stattic (2.5 µM and 5 µM). We found a differential response to iSRC and iERK2 treatments since the neural differentiation potential decreases in hESC-hAEC in contrast to hESC-iMEF (new Figure 7). Although we used at least two different concentrations for each inhibitor, the qualitative results of the immunofluorescences and the quantitative analyses shown in the figures correspond to the lowest concentration of each inhibitor. This new set of experiments was performed by Carla P Barragan-Álvarez.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the authors have focused on enhanced anterior neural specification, the notion that this is biased or regionalized state of pluripotency, would also suggest that differentiation to other lineages might be restricted. They should compare the relative efficiencies with which hAEC cultured hESCs and standard hESCs differentiate into primitive streak derivatives or primordial germ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In this new version of our manuscript, we carry out the protocol with some modifications of human primordial germinal cell (hPGC) induction reported by Sasaki et al., 2015 and Chen et al., 2019. We compared the efficiency to differentiate hPGC in hESC cultured on hAEC vs standard hESC on iMEF, by detection of germline markers BLIMP1, TFPA2C and STELLA by immunofluorescence. Representative micrographs and quantitative immunofluorescence analyses are in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>González et al., chacterized the hAEC culture condition and found it was dependent on exogeneous FGF2 and then characterized specific signalling pathways there were unique to the hAEC supported pluripotency and cytokines produced by hAECs. In particular they observed an abundance of Src activation in hAEC supported ESCs. They follow this up with transcriptome analysis, where they compare hAEC supported cells to different published ESC culture systems. There are a lot of comparisons, but the bottom line is these cells appear anterior epiblast poised for neural differentiation. While the generation of neural progentintors from all lineages tested was similar, the hAEC cultured cells gave rise to enhanced differentiation towards neural lineages found in the forebrain. They conclude by suggesting hAEC-cultured ESCs exhibit upregulation of polycomb targets and propose that hAEC cells produce a factor that could repress polycomb activity. They suggest that this mechanism might by mediated by miR200b/c miRNA, highly expressed in hAEC and upregrulated in hESCs cultured with hAEC.</p><p>As suggested above, this paper suggests hAEC impart regionalation or developmental identity on hESC cultures, produces cells that resemble the anterior epiblast that is uniquely poised for anterior neural differentiation. The paper could be strengthened by providing a better assessment of the cell states formed by co-culture with hAECs, how do they cells compare to available primate RNAseq datasets and how homogeneously are they anterior epiblast? In a similar set of analysis they could address the nature of the hAECs used here and explore whether they represent regionalized amnion? In addition the paper suggests candidates for the molecules produced by hAECs that induce this phenotype, but they do not provide any functional evidence for their candidates.</p><p>As eluded to in the public review, this manuscript introduces a novel idea, that amnionic epithelial cells can instill positional epiblast identity onto human ESC cultures. However, there remain a number of issues that should be resolved prior to publication in eLife.</p><p>1. The gene expression analysis in Figure 4-6 is incomplete and yet takes up a large part of the main figures. If these cells generally represent regionalized, pre-neural epiblast, normally found adjacent to the amnion, then some analysis of the single cell sequencing from the human and primate embryo data should be undertaken (Xiang et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2019; Nakamura et al., 2017), this analysis should also include the spectrum of ESC cell states that have been published. The authors perform a number of comparisons, but none of these place the hAEC supported cells in context of this spectrum; they could for example compare gene expression changes that occur as development progresses to the gene expression changes that occur in the different ESC cell states as they progress or alternatively try some sort of global analysis of developmental stage with the different ESC data.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with reviewer 1, the result of the expression analyses of Figures 4 and 5 were moved to the Supplementary Figures of the new Figure 3.</p><p>To identify in which part of the spectrum of pluripotency and developmental stage the hESC-hAEC condition can be located, we used scRNA-seq data from cells of the preimplantation and postimplantation epiblast (Xiang et al., 2019) and epiblast and extraembryonic lineages of a pregastrula human embryo (Tyser et al., 2020), as well as the bulk RNA-seq data of different hPSC, both primed, feeder-free, naïve, expanded and formative conditions. The comparison between in vitro hPSC lines is shown in the Figure 3A-B, with a PCA analysis and a heatmap of the matrix signature of the differential expression data. Additionally, we obtained the relative ‘composition score’ of the bulk RNA-seq of hESC-hAEC and of the other hPSC lines vs scRNA-seq of embryo data (Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The model in 8b implies that the amnionic epithelium has regionalized inductive properties. What cell type is represented by the hAEC cells. Using similar analysis to that described above, they could address this issue. It also might help them to refine their list of potential “inductive,” molecules.</p></disp-quote><p>In the sort of global analysis of RNA-seq to compare hPSC lines with the data embryo, we included the hAEC. Interestingly, hAEC transcriptome have similarity to the extraembryonic mesoderm and non-neural ectoderm (presumptive nascent amnion) (Tyser et al., 2020). To refine the list of potential mechanisms by which hAECs exert their effect on hESC, we focused on the signaling pathways we identified in proteome arrays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is a lot of discussion of potential candidates for induction of anterior epiblast fate by hAECs, but none of these are tested. To produce the level of advance required for eLife, some demonstration of a candidate produced by the hAEC cells that promotes anterior epiblast identity in ESCs, is important. Even better, if the authors could find a candidate that was also localized in the amnion based on the single cell transcriptome data and that was produced by their hAEC cells this would make the manuscript much stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>In this new version of our manuscript, we reported that the inhibition of the SRC and ERK2 pathways produces alterations in the identity of hESC-hAEC condition such as presence and expression of pluripotency factors (new Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1), expression of intermediary/epithelializing genes (new Figure 7—figure supplement 1), and in their potential for neural differentiation (new Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The demonstration that these cells are poised for anterior neural specification is very interesting. Are they less effective at generating primitive streak cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>Although we did not evaluate the expression of genes associated with the embryonic mesoderm lineage, specifically from the primitive streak nascent, in the new results we demonstrated that hESC-hAEC have the capacity to express some germline-associated markers, through a protocol in which the induction is via incipient mesoderm-like cells. We found that hAEC-hAEC presented a higher number of TFAP2C+/STELLA+ and BLIMP1+/STELLA+ cells than the standard hESC on iMEF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There appears some confusion in the text about the term pluripotency. It is not really pluripotency that becomes regionalized, but epiblast. Or one could generate pluripotent cells with regional identity. The is also a bit of confusion between different stages of pluripotency. For example, the so called &quot;Rosette,&quot; state and &quot;Formative,&quot; state. The Rosette state requires only inhibition of Wnt signaling (Neagu et al., 2020), while Formative pluripotency is achieved based on relief of FGF/ERK inhibition as well (Kalkan et al., 2017) and trapped by Wnt and RAR inhibition(Kinoshita et al., 2021), and it is not clear how different &quot;formative,&quot; is from some variations of standard, primed human ESCs (Davidson, Mason, and Pera 2015). However, anterior neural differentiation can be directly accessed in the presence of a block to ERK from naïve pluripotency, suggesting it can occur via something like a Rosette state or pre-formative epiblast (Hamilton and Brickman 2014). When and how does anterior epiblast become primed for differentiation away from primitive streak derivatives? This is an excellent question, but the data in the paper doesn't really address this. As it is difficult to resolve so called &quot;formative,&quot; markers from anterior epiblast, perhaps it would be easier to avoid overuse of specific labels and stick with analogous embryonic structures. While these cells are FGF2 dependent, it would suggest they are more &quot;primed,&quot; rather than formative but as this is all in a human context it is difficult to resolve this and as eluded to above primed pluripotency in some human examples maybe closer to what is called formative. Moreover, I also find it hard to resolve &quot;formative,&quot; and anterior epiblast, based on the handle of markers assessed here. Perhaps they will be able to derive better evidence for this staged model of differentiation from the transcriptomic analysis requested in point 2, but I am not sure this will provide a clear answer. Experimentally they could ask how dependent these cells on ERK signaling? This would be interesting to resolve, as ERK activity is significantly lower in the anterior epiblast than on the posterior side in the region of the primitive streak. They could attempt to convert naïve cells to this state through a staged differentiation trajectory with specific inhibitors and demonstrate when these cells become uniquely anteriorized? While these are all interesting experiments, they could also just revise the discussion and Figure 8 and focus on epiblast-like, anterior epiblast-like.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that pluripotency is not regionalized, but rather cells that have the pluripotent state (for example, formative or primed) are the ones that segregate (for example, in the anterior or posterior part of the epiblast). We also agree with the reviewer that there is currently no consensus to define the formative stage in either the human embryo or in vitro culture. Regarding the possible role of ERK in this condition, we detected by immunofluorescence an increase of ERK2 in hESC-hAEC compared to hESC-iMEF. Therefore, we inhibited ERK2 with PD0325901, and found that it alters the identity of hESC-hAEC, as mentioned in the answer to question 3. It would be interesting and enlightening to study the transition of naïve hPSC when cultured in interaction with the amniotic epithelium to identify whether the anterior epiblast-biased formative/primed state is obtained; these experiments would be part of a future publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific Comments</p><p>1.

Instead of considering it as a new additional pluripotent state within the naive-formative-primed spectrum, we could consider it a substate or subpopulations between the formative and primed pluripotency that would segregate to the anterior neuroectoderm.
