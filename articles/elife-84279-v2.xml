(ER)-mitochondria membrane contact sites (MCSs). These MCSs or nodes co-localize fission and fusion machinery. We set out to identify how ER-associated mitochondrial nodes can regulate both fission and fusion machinery assembly. We have used a promiscuous biotin ligase linked to the fusion machinery, Mfn1, and proteomics to identify an ER membrane protein, ABHD16A, as a major regulator of node formation. In the absence of ABHD16A, fission and fusion machineries fail to recruit to ER-associated mitochondrial nodes, and fission and fusion rates are significantly reduced. ABHD16A contains an acyltransferase motif and an α/β hydrolase domain, and point mutations in critical residues of these regions fail to rescue the formation of ER-associated mitochondrial hot spots. These data suggest a mechanism whereby ABHD16A functions by altering phospholipid composition at ER-mitochondria MCSs. Our data present the first example of an ER membrane protein that regulates the recruitment of both fission and fusion machineries to mitochondria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>organelle contact sites</kwd><kwd>membrane fission</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 Training Grants GM008759 and GM142607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Tricia T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voeltz</surname><given-names>Gia K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nguyen</surname><given-names>Tricia T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ABHD16A is a phospholipid-modifying endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein required for both mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery recruitment to ER-associated mitochondrial constrictions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells maintain a characteristic mitochondrial architecture important for cellular metabolism and function. Mitochondria maintain their overall architecture and morphology by undergoing cycles of fission and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Twig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). Disruption of these cycles results in fragmentation or elongation, which can be detrimental to cell health and is associated with various disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rambold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wai and Langer, 2016</xref>). Both processes are first initiated by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites (MCSs). Several factors have been linked to ER-associated mitochondrial fission, including two actin nucleators, INF2 and Spire1c, which are proposed to polymerize actin at ER-mitochondria MCSs to initiate constriction of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Manor et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequently, two GTPases (Drp1 and Dyn2) are recruited to the OMM at ER MCSs to further constrict the OMM, which leads to mitochondrial division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bleazard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Labrousse et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smirnova et al., 1998</xref>). ER-mitochondria MCSs also dictate sites where OMM fusion occurs via Mfn1/2 oligomerization in trans to drive membrane fusion upon GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Santel and Fuller, 2001</xref>). Subsequently, inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) fusion occurs via the GTPase, Opa1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ban et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herlan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Legros et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Misaka et al., 2002</xref>). However, how the ER contributes to defining a site on mitochondria that is primed for constriction and sufficient to coordinate the recruitment of both fission and fusion machineries and further how these two seemingly opposing activities are co-recruited and also balanced is unclear.</p><p>We have recently discovered that cycles of fission and fusion occur at the same location or hot spots that are spatially dictated by the ER. These predefined branch points, or nodes, are where both fission (Drp1) and fusion (Mfn1) machineries converge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>). However, it is not known how these nodes are formed or regulated. We hypothesized that an ER membrane protein facilitates the formation of these nodes. To identify an ER machinery involved in node formation, we have taken advantage of a promiscuous biotin ligase (TurboID) that can biotinylate proteins within a ~10–30 nm range upon biotin addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). We have fused TurboID to the known fusion machinery, Mfn1, to biotinylate and subsequently identify neighboring ER proteins that could regulate these nodes. Using this strategy, we have identified an ER membrane-localized lipid hydrolase, ABHD16A, that could alter lipid membranes for mitochondrial constriction after ER contact sites are established. ABHD16A is not only required for ER-associated mitochondrial constriction, but it is also the first ER protein to be shown to be required for both fission and fusion machinery to assemble at contact sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of ER-localized lipid hydrolase, ABHD16A, by proximal proteomics</title><p>MCSs between the ER and mitochondria define the position where mitochondria undergo fission and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, the fission and fusion machineries co-localize at the same ER-mitochondria MCSs, not separate ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>). It is not known how the ER functions mechanistically to define constriction sites on mitochondria for both fission and fusion machinery recruitment. Here, we sought to identify ER factors that regulate the assembly of ER-associated nodes where both mitochondrial fission and fusion machinery are recruited. Our strategy was to fuse TurboID, an optimized promiscuous biotin ligase, to the OMM fusion protein, Mfn1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which assembles at ER-mitochondria MCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>).

As a negative control, we similarly fused TurboID to a GTPase domain mutant Mfn1E209A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). This mutant is deficient in its ability to hydrolyze GTP, does not homodimerize, cannot drive fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sloat et al., 2019</xref>), and does not enrich at ER-mitochondria MCSs with wild type (WT) GFP-Mfn1 puncta (compare magenta to green, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom panels) consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized lipid hydrolase, ABHD16A, by proximal proteomics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon diagram and domain organization of V5-TurboID-Mfn1 and V5-TurboID-Mfn1E209A (human Mfn1 and indicated amino acid numbers).

Upon ABHD16A depletion, tip-to-middle fusion events are highly reduced (0.19 in siCTRL vs. 0.02 tip-to-middle fusion events per mitochondrion/min in ABHD16A depletion), whereas tip-to-tip fusion is less affected (0.06 in siCTRL vs. 0.04 tip-to-tip fusion events per mitochondrion/min in ABHD16A depletion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). What makes these results notable is that the ‘middle’ part of the tip-to-middle fusion event occurs at ER-associated mitochondrial constriction sites where fission and fusion machineries also assemble and co-localize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Next, we scored the effect of ABHD16A depletion on the rate of fission (within the same experiment that was used to score fusion rates). Indeed, fission rates were also significantly reduced upon ABHD16A depletion (a &gt; threefold reduction from 0.17 to 0.05 fission events per mitochondrion/min; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

These data show that ABHD16A depletion reduces fusion and fission rates concomitant with the reduced recruitment of fusion and fission machineries to ER-associated nodes.

To understand how ABHD16A functions mechanistically, it is thus important to understand whether the ER-localized or the trace mitochondrial-localized ABHD16A pool is responsible for regulating mitochondrial dynamics. We therefore tested whether expression of an exclusively ER-targeted or mitochondrial-targeted ABHD16A functions to rescue mitochondrial morphology. To target ABHD16A exclusively to the ER or to mitochondria, we replaced the N-terminal TMDs of ABHD16A with either the N-terminal TMD of the ER-localized protein Stim1 or the N-terminal TMD of the mitochondrial-localized protein Tom70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Both chimeric constructs localize as expected exclusively to the ER or mitochondria, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

We tested whether this is because ABHD16A is required for tethering between the ER and mitochondria. ABHD16A was depleted by siRNA, and a dimerization-dependent fluorescent protein (ddFP) reporter system was used to score ER-mitochondria MCS, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>). This reporter system consists of a heterodimeric fluorescent protein complex (dimly <underline>r</underline>ed fluorescent protein copy <underline>A</underline>, RA, and protein binding partner, B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2015</xref>). Upon dimerization of RA with B, RA fluorescence increases leading to a detectable red signal. The low binding affinity of the RA/B interaction (K<sub>d</sub>=~7 µM) ensures that the interaction is reversible and does not cause artificial wrapping, which allows for bona-fide MCSs to be visualized. RA was fused to an ER membrane protein, Sec61β, to target half of the dimer to the ER, and B was fused to the OMM protein Mff, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>). When the ER and mitochondria come into close proximity (tethering distance), an increased fluorescence intensity is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cells were co-transfected with either control or ABHD16A siRNA, mito-BFP (magenta), an ER marker (mNG-KDEL, blue), ddFP reporters (RA-Sec61β and B-Mff, dimer will fluoresce green) and were rescued with siRNA-resistant ABHD16A (ABHD16A-SNAP) or an EV control (SNAP-N1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Our data have shown that ABHD16A is a determinant of ER-associated mitochondrial constriction. ABHD16A has two compelling and highly conserved motifs/domains predicted to alter lipid shape in opposing ways: an acyltransferase motif and an alpha/beta hydrolase domain consisting of a histidine, aspartic acid, and catalytic serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). Previous work strongly suggests that the alpha/beta hydrolase domain mainly converts PS to lysoPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Montero-Moran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2018</xref>). The opposing predicted acyltransferase motif in ABHD16A is present in other ABHD family members and some integral ER membrane proteins and has been ascribed various related functions including the ability to either convert single-chain phospholipids, such as lysoPS, back into dual-chain phospholipids or alter the SN2 position of its phospholipid substrates to lysophospholipids/phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aguado and Campbell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eberhardt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lord et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). We hypothesized that both the acyltransferase and hydrolase domains could contribute enzymatic activities and alter phospholipid shape to promote ER-associated mitochondrial constriction. We therefore generated point mutants within each of these motifs that would be predicted to abrogate enzymatic function: H189A and D194N in the acyltransferase motif (AT mut) and S355A in the alpha/beta hydrolase domain (α/βHD mut; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

First, we scored ABHD16A motif/domain requirements for fission (Drp1) machinery recruitment to ER-mitochondria MCSs. Each mutant was tested for its ability to rescue Drp1 recruitment in cells depleted of endogenous ABHD16A with siRNA. These cells were co-transfected with siRNA-resistant mutant ABHD16A along with mito-BFP (magenta), mCh-Sec61β (ER, blue), and mCh-Drp1 (green; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

In complementary experiments, we also tested whether each mutant could rescue Mfn1 fusion machinery recruitment. Cells were co-transfected with either a control or ABHD16A siRNA, fluorescently tagged Mfn1 (GFP-Mfn1, green), a mito-BFP (magenta), and mNG-Sec61β (ER, blue) and were rescued with siRNA-resistant WT or mutant ABHD16A constructs (ABHD16A-Halo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Similar to what was seen for Drp1, only the WT protein could restore Mfn1 accumulation at ER-mitochondria MCSs in ABHD16A-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E and G</xref>). Thus, both acyltransferase and alpha/beta hydrolase activities are required for the recruitment of fission and fusion machinery to ER-associated nodes. Consistent with these results, only the WT ABHD16A can rescue overall mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In addition, the lipase-like motifs (GXSXXG) briefly noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> are predicted to function similarly to bacterial lipase motifs (GXSXG). However, we have determined that mutating the predicted catalytic serines of both motifs (S176A and S306A) could still rescue mitochondrial morphology similarly to WT ABHD16A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). We therefore concluded that these lipase-like motifs have either no function or no role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics. So, while the alpha/beta hydrolase domain is sufficient for ER-associated mitochondrial constriction, the acyltransferase motif is still required to form active nodes for fission and fusion. These data suggest that the mechanism of ER-associated mitochondrial node formation is a multistep process that requires several modifications of phospholipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>ORP8 is required to deliver ABHD16A-induced altered phospholipids to mitochondria</title><p>Since ER-localized ABHD16A is necessary to sustain mitochondrial fission and fusion, we identified potential candidates who could facilitate lipid exchange during ABHD16A-driven mitochondrial node formation. Two published ER-localized lipid transfer proteins were worthy candidates: ORP8, which has been proposed to transfer phospholipids, such as PS, to other organelles at ER-mitochondria and ER-PM MCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galmes et al., 2016</xref>) and the VPS13A/VPS13D paralogs, which have demonstrated roles in facilitating lipid transfer between the ER and other organelles at MCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guillén-Samander et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). To score whether these ER-localized lipid transport proteins contribute to steady state mitochondrial morphology, U-2 OS cells were co-transfected with a mitochondrial matrix marker (mito-BFP, magenta) and either control (siCTRL), OSBPL8 siRNA, or VPS13A/VPS13D siRNAs (which led to efficient protein depletion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>), and mitochondrial morphology was quantified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Neither ORP8 depletion nor VPS13A/13D depletion by siRNA treatment altered mitochondrial morphology compared to siCTRL-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, C, D and E</xref>). We next tested whether ORP8 or VPS13A/D were required for the dramatic mitochondrial fragmentation phenotype observed upon ABHD16A OE. Cells were transfected with either siCTRL, OSBPL8 siRNA, or VPS13A/VPS13D siRNAs and with either EV control (mCherry-N1) or ABHD16A-mCh, as indicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B and C</xref>). ABHD16A-mCh OE promotes mitochondrial fragmentation as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B and C</xref>). However, mitochondrial morphology is dramatically rescued upon ORP8 depletion and re-fragmented by exogenous siRNA-resistant ORP8 re-expression in the ABHD16AOE/ORP8-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>). In contrast, depletion of both VPS13A and VPS13D did not prevent ABHD16A OE-induced fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and E</xref>). Thus, ORP8, but not VPS13A/D, facilitates ABHD16A activity during ER-associated mitochondrial constriction. A likely hypothesis is that ABHD16A and ORP8 function to alter the lipid composition at ER-associated mitochondrial constrictions for fission and fusion machinery recruitment.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>ORP8 is required to deliver ABHD16A-induced altered phospholipids to mitochondria.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of mitochondrial morphology (labeled by mito-BFP, gray) of U-2 OS cells transfected with empty vector (EV) (mCherry-N1, magenta) and with either siCTRL and mNG-C1 EV (green, n=28 cells, left); OSBPL8 siRNA and mNG-C1 EV (green, n=21 cells, middle); or OSBPL8 siRNA and siRNA-resistant mNG-ORP8 (green, n=41 cells, right).

ABHD16A localizes to the ER membrane and to a lesser extent mitochondria. Interestingly, only the ER-localized form is necessary and sufficient to maintain mitochondrial morphology. We have shown that ABHD16A is required for mitochondrial constrictions prior to the formation of fission and fusion nodes. Without ABHD16A, nodes are not restored, leading to an overall elongated morphology due to overruling tip-to-tip fusion. Two critical motifs/domains required for these activities are the alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which mainly converts the dual-chain phospholipid, PS, to lysoPS, and the acyltransferase motif, which could convert the inverse reaction. We have identified that only the alpha/beta hydrolase domain is required for IMM constriction, which is required for efficient mitochondrial fission and fusion processes. However, the acyltransferase motif is also required for a step downstream of IMM constriction to allow fission and fusion machineries to accumulate on the OMM at ER-associated nodes. Indeed, both the alpha/beta hydrolase domain and acyltransferase motif are also required to restore mitochondrial morphology. Interestingly, yeast encodes a similarly localized and uncharacterized enzyme and potential ABHD16A homolog, YNL320W, containing an alpha/beta hydrolase fold. Future experiments are warranted to test whether at least part of this mechanism can be extended to yeast.</p><p>We propose a model whereby ABHD16A’s alpha/beta hydrolase domain functions mainly as a PS lipase to build up lysoPS along the mitochondrial membrane for positive membrane curvature. It is possible that the acyltransferase motif subsequently promotes dual-chain phospholipid build up or phospholipid acyl chain modification. One can imagine both single-chain and dual-chain phospholipids are required for positive and negative membrane curvature, respectively, which can promote efficient mitochondrial fission and fusion processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, model). Alternatively, several acyltransferase proteins can modify the SN2 position of phospholipids to increase acyl chain asymmetry to potentiate membrane bending and curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harayama et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hishikawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofmann, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Shindou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Through this mechanism, ABHD16A could promote membrane curvature for mitochondrial fission and fusion.

ABHD16A could alter lipids on the ER membrane, where a characterized or unidentified lipid transport protein could transport these altered lipids to mitochondria at ER-mitochondria MCSs. Alternatively, it is possible that ABHD16A’s cytoplasmic region (~4 nm wide) modifies mitochondrial lipids directly across the MCS bridge. Interestingly, whole cell analysis of S-palmitoylation indicates that ABHD16A contains a palmitoylated cysteine at residue 205 and two predicted palmitoylation sites at residues 284 and 285 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thinon et al., 2018</xref>); it will be worthwhile to test whether such modifications could alter its function during ER-associated mitochondrial node formation.</p><p>We have always considered that lipid composition and shape are likely contributors to protein localization and membrane architecture at MCSs, but by what mechanism was unclear. Lipid composition can modulate physicochemical properties of organelle membranes and shape due to the diversity of each phospholipid head group and hydrophobic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harayama and Riezman, 2018</xref>). For example, phosphatidylethanolamine exists as a cone-shaped lipid, which can create negative spontaneous curvature to promote hemi-fusion intermediates. Cone-shaped lipids have been shown to be required for SNARE-mediated fusion and osteoclast fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zick et al., 2014</xref>). Dynamin activity is also enhanced by acyl chain asymmetry and polyunsaturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Manni et al., 2018</xref>). These data fall in line with ABHD16A converting phospholipids to lysophospholipids and vice versa or altering the acyl chain symmetry to create spontaneous negative and positive membrane curvature necessary for hemi-fusion intermediates at MCSs for constriction, fission, and fusion.</p><p>Additionally, many known mitochondrial fission and fusion factors have been associated with specific phospholipids. In vitro and cryoEM studies of Drp1 showed that reconstituted Drp1 prefers to oligomerize around negatively charged phospholipids such as PS and cardiolipin (CL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kalia et al., 2018</xref>). In vitro reconstitution of OPA1 and CL membranes is sufficient for tethering and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ban et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, ABHD16A has the highest specificity for PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamat et al., 2015</xref>), which constitutes only about 1–2% of the total mitochondrial membrane phospholipid composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it is possible that PS and lysoPS conversion could be secluded to ER-mitochondria membrane contact sites deemed competent for constriction and fission/fusion machinery recruitment. These data also align in an appealing way with Mitofusin 2’s proposed capability to cluster PS on mitochondrial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hernández-Alvarez et al., 2019</xref>). These data could suggest that ABHD16A along with an unidentified lipid transport protein or tether induces PS shuttling to allow for Mfn1/2 to localize to nodes. Intriguingly, it is unclear how the adaptor proteins, Mff, Mid49, and Mid51, enrich in punctate localizations at ER-mitochondria contacts prior to Drp1 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palmer et al., 2011</xref>). Perhaps lipid alteration and the curvature sensing portions of these adaptor proteins could be responsible for its punctate localization, and it is ABHD16A that creates these lipid changes.</p><p>In addition, the ER and mitochondria also form contact sites to transfer phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achleitner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ardail et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vance, 1990</xref>). Several studies have shown that lipid transfer and mitochondrial morphology are highly interdependent. More specifically, in yeast, the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) complex, which is proposed to transfer ER PS and PC to mitochondrial membranes, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kojima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kornmann et al., 2009</xref>) assembles between the ER and mitochondrial membranes at MCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michel and Kornmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murley et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, a deletion in the single ERMES complex protein, Gem1, also fragments mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murley et al., 2013</xref>). In animal cells, Gem1 homologs are Miro1 and Miro2. Miro1/2 proteins regulate mitochondrial and peroxisomal trafficking on microtubules and can elongate both mitochondria and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fransson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">MacAskill et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MacAskill et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Modi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Okumoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Saotome et al., 2008</xref>). The De Camilli lab has shown that the lipid transport protein VPS13D is recruited by Miro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guillén-Samander et al., 2021b</xref>), suggesting that lipid transfer must be required for lipid membrane expansion and subsequent elongated mitochondrial morphology. Additionally, recent work from the Nunnari lab also suggests that a buildup of lysophosphatidic acid, which promotes positive membrane curvature, sensed by mitochondrial carrier homolog 2 (MTCH2) stimulates mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Labbé et al., 2021</xref>). These data are intriguing because ABHD16A could also promote positive membrane curvature for the formation of fission and fusion nodes. Taken together, these data suggest that lipid transfer and modification at ER-mitochondria MCSs have a direct involvement with mitochondrial elongation and fragmentation by affecting fusion and fission.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA plasmids and primer sequences</title><p>V5-TurboID-NES was a gift from Alice Ting (Addgene plasmid # 107169; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>).

On Fiji, 15×15 µm ROIs were drawn around resolvable regions of mitochondria to assess morphology. Then, mitochondria were individually counted using the ‘Multi-point’ tool. The total area of the mitochondria in the ROI was calculated by Otsu thresholding. Thresholded images were then assessed using the ‘Analyze Particles’ function to obtain the total area in the ROI. Finally, the total mitochondrial area was divided by the number of mitochondria in the ROI to obtain the average area per mitochondrion (µm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>For ER crossings containing Drp1 puncta, 2 min movies were taken at 5 s intervals. Resolvable ER-mitochondria crossings were marked with the ‘Multi-point’ tool on Fiji. Presence of a Drp1 puncta were counted (as assessed by puncta present throughout a 2 min movie), and the total number of Drp1 puncta was divided by the total number resolvable ER-mitochondria crossings to get the percentage of ER crossings containing Drp1 puncta.</p><p>For Mfn1 density quantifications, three lines were drawn along the length of resolvable mitochondrion per cell using the ‘Segmented line’ tool in Fiji to obtain mitochondrial length. Then, Mfn1 puncta were counted (as assessed by puncta present throughout a 2 min movie), and the total number of Mfn1 puncta along one mitochondrion was divided by length of the one mitochondrion to give number of Mfn1 puncta per micron (Mfn1 density).</p><p>For assessing fission and fusion rate, cells were transfected with mMAPLE-OMP25 as described. Single mitochondria were photoconverted from green to red fluorescence by stimulating with 20 iterations of 100% 405 nm light on the Zeiss LSM 880 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope. Apparent fusion/fission was scored during live 5 min time-lapse movies with 5 s intervals by the observation of fluorescence mixing or fluorescence separation. The fusion/fission rate was calculated by dividing the number of fusion/fission events per mitochondrion per minute. Mitochondrial fusion was binned in two categories: tip-to-tip and tip-to-middle fusion within these experiments.</p><p>For mitochondria overlap with ER or MCSs, 20×20 µm or 15×15 µm ROIs were selected for resolvable regions of ER, mitochondria, and ddFP signal. Then, the ‘JaCoP’ plugin for Fiji was used to manually threshold each image and calculate Mander’s correlation coefficient for the percentage of ER covering mitochondria signal or mitochondria covering ddFP signal.</p><p>For mitochondrial constriction line scans and quantifications, z-stacks consisting of 12 serial images that were each spaced by 0.2  μm were taken. Resolvable ER-mitochondria crossings were marked with the ‘Multi-point’ tool on Fiji. Line scans were performed using Fiji by drawing a line along the mitochondrion, and the fluorescence along the mitochondrion was measured. Constrictions were marked as a ≥40% decrease in mitochondrial signal intensity compared to the neighboring fluorescence peak. The number of mitochondrial constrictions was divided by the total number of resolvable ER-mitochondria crossings to get the percentage ER crossings containing constrictions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistics</title><p>All data presented in all figures are from at least three biological replications.

Protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Scientific). Disulfide bridges were reduced with 5 mM tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine at 30°C for 60 min, and cysteines were subsequently alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. Affinity purification was carried out in a Bravo AssayMap platform (Agilent) using AssayMap streptavidin cartridges (Agilent). Briefly, cartridges were first primed with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate and then proteins were slowly loaded onto the streptavidin cartridge. Background contamination was removed with 8 M urea, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate. Finally, cartridges were washed with Rapid digestion buffer (Promega, Rapid digestion buffer kit), and proteins were subjected to on-cartridge digestion with mass spec grade Trypsin/Lys-C Rapid digestion enzyme (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 70°C for 1 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy Schekman as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Benoît Kornmann as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Our recommendation is to consider and respond to the comments but we feel the work can be published with appropriate changes to the text alone.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) 1. The data in Figure 1 G are very convincing but we are left wondering about the identity of the other even more highly Dnm1-dependent ER-enriched proteins mentioned in line 98 on p. 4? How many of these 18 more highly enriched proteins are predicted to be integral ER membrane proteins and among them are any known enzymes or proteins that function in other processes? The absence of any proteomic data on this experiment was a little unsatisfying. Do the authors wish to reserve these others for future analysis or is there some other less interesting explanation for the absence of any discussion? Does <italic>eLife</italic> policy now require the complete disclosure of all such data?</p><p>2. Do yeast species have an Aphid homolog and if so, has its function in mitochondrial morphology or anything else such as ER shape change been noted?</p><p>3. The discussion of the organization of Aphyd in the ER membrane is incomplete and confusing. From Figure 1H we see that the membrane anchor domain is near the N-terminus but we are not given an explicit statement of the orientation of the protein with respect to the ER bilayer. I assume the C-terminal large domain is oriented to the cytoplasm but has this actually been established in published work? If not, I think establishing the topology of the protein is important for their work.</p><p>The cartoon in Figure 8 adds confusion to this issue. Here the ER membrane proximal acyl transferase domain is shown in the cytoplasm but the large, presumably very C-terminal hydrolase domain is shown embedded into the mitochondrial envelope, possibly even the cristae membrane. Surely the authors do not mean this. Figure 8 should be clarified.</p><p>4. It seems unnecessary to rename a protein that has already been studied, especially when the new name doesn't inform on a new function but rather is merely a collection of a different set of letters from the old name. This is not renaming of an uncharacterized, unstudied generically named gene (i.e., TMEM, KIAA, FAM, cXorfY, etc.), and it is not naming a gene with a phenotype from a genetic screen. ABHD16A is part of the aptly named ABHD family (α/β hydrolase domain). Further, other labs, in numerous publications, have previously studied the phospholipid hydrolase activity of ABHD16A and analyzed phenotypes and mechanisms using KO cells and mice in detail, as appropriately cited by the authors (e.g., Singh et al., Kamat et al.). Making an unneeded (and still pretty vague) extra name for this protein might ultimately confuse people and make it harder to search the literature without adding any extra obvious value. On the contrary, it turns a name that describes a relevant hydrolase fold (ABHD16A) into a neologism that, likely by design, is a homonym of (and conjures up the image of) an insect. To avoid confusion in the field, the authors may wish to consider keeping the original ABHD16A name.</p><p>5. This initial study conducts a rigorous analysis of the role of newly-identified Aphyd in controlling mitochondrial fission/fusion but does not provide any biochemical insights into its lipid-modifying activities – indeed, one can't expect to solve everything in one paper! This question seems complicated since Aphyd contains domains that could catalyze opposite reactions – conversion of a phospholipid such as PS to its lyso- version by a hydrolase activity and conversion of a lyso-phospholipid such as lyso-PS back to a two-chain phospholipid. The analysis of mutants suggests both activities may be needed, but in different ways. In the absence of further biochemical analysis, this last part of the study seems quite speculative to me and could be toned down. Related to this point, in absence of any data showing the lipid specificity of Aphyd activity, the generic fusion/fission model in Figure 8 doesn't add much and the paper would be fine without it.</p><p>6. Compared to the hydrolase domain, which has been well characterized biochemically by others to be a PS lipase (based on in vitro assays and lipidomics data from KO cells), the acyltransferase domain is much less well characterized. Overall, published data on ABHD16A KO cells suggest a primary role for this enzyme as a PS lipase. These prior findings are not appropriately reflected in the interpretations and discussions in this manuscript, and this is a particularly important omission to correct given the strong and specific implication of PS in this pathway as shown by the authors' compelling ORP8 data. The authors are encouraged to clarify their model to better take into consideration what is known about ABHD16A's role as a PS lipase.</p><p>7. The authors do not address how ABHD16A might have its activity regulated to only produce lipids at these sites. It is a constitutive ER-resident protein, and their model would be strengthened if a proposal and/or supporting evidence could be provided to answer some of the questions put forth by their model, including the following:</p><p>Does ABHD16A activity change local levels of PS or lysoPS within these organelles? PS levels could be addressed using imaging biosensors, whereas organelle-specific lipidomics is admittedly more challenging.</p><p>Are lipids proposed to be generated in cis on the ER by ABHD16A and transferred to the mitochondria or is lipid hydrolysis proposed to occur in trans? If the latter, the dimensions of the contact sites and the tethered enzyme consistent with the model?</p><p>8. Despite ABHD16A being the main focus of this manuscript, there are limited analyses of its spatial and temporal localization.</p><p>In Figure 1, it was identified by the difference between the Mfn1 and Mfn1E209A. Does ABHD16A co-localize with the Mfn1 puncta?</p><p>Based on Figure 2 and Figure 5, a hierarchy of &quot;MCS formation --&gt; ABHD16A activity --&gt; Drp1/Mfn1 recruitment&quot; can be inferred. Live-cell imaging would help authors to confirm this hierarchy. If ABHD16A does not accumulate in MCS before fission/fusion, what is mentioned in the comment #2 becomes even more important.</p><p>9. Three hours seems like a long time for proximity biotinylation with the optimized TurboID ligase, which is typically used in much shorter pulses (~10 min). The authors are encouraged to comment in the manuscript on the need for such long labeling times.</p><p>10. What do the &quot;lipase-like motifs&quot; indicated in gray in Figure 1H correspond to? Are they residues H189 and S355 in Figure 6B? The authors should explain more about what they mean by this phrase, as it is confusing that one of them exists in the acyltransferase domain and the other in the α/β hydrolase domain.</p><p>11. The rescue presented throughout is convincing, but all phenotypes derive from a single ABHD16A siRNA. Inclusion of a second siRNA + rescue for a select subset of experiments would help to increase the rigor of the phenotypic findings.</p><p>12. Line 250: Figure S6A-B callout should be S5A-B.</p><p>13. The data presentation in Figure 3F is confusing, with numbers not adding up (by design but still kind of misleading). I recommend that the authors present it in a different manner, perhaps with n values in the legend and numbers in the graph representing the values in the shaded graph bars? The point is that ABHD16A KD lowers tip-to-mid fusion the most, and rescue can overshoot, but the provided numbers are confusing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Nguyen and Voeltz have made a valuable contribution in the finding that Mfn1-Turbo-ID identified a known ER phospholipid hydrolase/acyl transferase as a key player in organizing the nodes of interaction between the ER and mitochondria. I found the experiments well-designed, logical, nicely quantitative and the conclusions convincing.</p><p>I have just a few small issues that could be better explained or developed and one general question that would be good to discuss among the set of reviewers.</p><p>1.

Surely the authors do not mean this. Figure 8 should be clarified.</p><p>4. Issue for discussion: Aphyd is shown to be broadly distributed along the ER membrane but the question remains are the lysophosphatides and reacylated phospholipids made at points of contact with mitochondria? Or are these phospholipids formed randomly and then phase separate to form the points of contact with mitochondria? Could Aphyd be regulated by contact to activate the hydrolase domain to initiate mitochondrial constriction or by contact with the full C-terminal domain to activate both enzyme activities? This may be an appropriate starting point for a subsequent investigation but one deficiency in this paper is the absence of any enzymatic activity assays to detect the production of lysophosphatides or reacylated phospholipids dependent on membranes engaged in the full range of ER-mitochondrial interactions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

However, we now include a list of the top 50 proteins sorted by high enrichment in the Mfn1 WT sample and low enrichment (zero) in the Mfn1 E209A mutant sample in Figure S1 (also discussed in the text on line 99-103). The top 18 proteins, prior to ABHD16A, are either not localized to the ER or in the case of ARL6IP1, is characterized as an ER-shaping protein (Yamamoto Y, et al. Biochem J. 2014). The method of ER membrane enrichment described in the methods is, unfortunately, not perfect. We can identify ER membrane enrichment via calnexin, reticulon-4, and OSBPL-8, in both the WT and the mutant samples; but no known proteins were enriched in only the WT sample that function at ER-mitochondria MCSs. However, we did see that fission machinery Drp1, which is known to localize at nodes containing Mfn1, enriched highly in the Mfn1 WT sample compared to the Mfn1 E209A sample in a separate fractionation by mass spectrometry (data not included).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have also done lipidomics on purified mitochondria of WT vs. ABHD16A KO U-2 OS cells with Lipotype and do not see any differences between the two conditions. However, upon discussion with labs familiar with lipidomics, it is quite difficult to detect “decent” levels of PS and lysoPS, especially on mitochondria, because it is such a small pool of the total lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are lipids proposed to be generated in cis on the ER by ABHD16A and transferred to the mitochondria or is lipid hydrolysis proposed to occur in trans?

We speculate that an ER tether could facilitate its immobilization at these contact sites, for focused activity. Future studies need to be done of endogenous tagging, single particle tracking, and/or ABHD16A immunoprecipitation to find the tether or lipid transfer protein responsible for its focused activity. Interestingly, the Zorzano lab has suggested that Mfn2 clusters PS on mitochondria (Hernandez-Alvarez MI, et al. Cell. 2019). These data suggest an appealing possibility which is that ABHD16A along with an unidentified lipid transport protein or tether could work with Mfn1/2 to induce PS clustering at nodes. These speculations have been added to the discussion in lines 422-426 and 450-460.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

The data now displayed is a table per condition of the following: total number of mitochondria counted, total fusion events counted, total tip-to-middle fusion events counted, total tip-to-tip fusion events counted, and then a comparison of the different rates of fusion with and without ABHD16A for: all fusion, tip-to-middle fusion and tip-to-tip fusion. We hope this clarifies that tip-to-middle fusion events are mainly affected. These changes are also present in lines 195-202.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Nguyen and Voeltz have made a valuable contribution in the finding that Mfn1-Turbo-ID identified a known ER phospholipid hydrolase/acyl transferase as a key player in organizing the nodes of interaction between the ER and mitochondria. I found the experiments well-designed, logical, nicely quantitative and the conclusions convincing.</p><p>I have just a few small issues that could be better explained or developed and one general question that would be good to discuss among the set of reviewers.</p><p>1. The data in Figure 1 G are very convincing but we are left wondering about the identity of the other even more highly Dnm1-dependent ER-enriched proteins mentioned in line 98 on p. 4? How many of these 18 more highly enriched proteins are predicted to be integral ER membrane proteins and among them are any known enzymes or proteins that function in other processes? The absence of any proteomic data on this experiment was a little unsatisfying. Do the authors wish to reserve these others for future analysis or is there some other less interesting explanation for the absence of any discussion? Does eLife policy now require the complete disclosure of all such data?</p><p>2. Do yeast species have an Aphid homolog and if so, has its function in mitochondrial morphology or anything else such as ER shape change been noted?</p><p>3. The discussion of the organization of Aphyd in the ER membrane is incomplete and confusing. From Figure 1H we see that the membrane anchor domain is near the N-terminus but we are not given an explicit statement of the orientation of the protein with respect to the ER bilayer. I assume the C-terminal large domain is oriented to the cytoplasm but has this actually been established in published work? If not, I think establishing the topology of the protein is important for their work.</p><p>The cartoon in Figure 8 adds confusion to this issue. Here the ER membrane proximal acyl transferase domain is shown in the cytoplasm but the large, presumably very C-terminal hydrolase domain is shown embedded into the mitochondrial envelope, possibly even the cristae membrane. Surely the authors do not mean this. Figure 8 should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>These points have been addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Issue for discussion: Aphyd is shown to be broadly distributed along the ER membrane but the question remains are the lysophosphatides and reacylated phospholipids made at points of contact with mitochondria? Or are these phospholipids formed randomly and then phase separate to form the points of contact with mitochondria? Could Aphyd be regulated by contact to activate the hydrolase domain to initiate mitochondrial constriction or by contact with the full C-terminal domain to activate both enzyme activities? This may be an appropriate starting point for a subsequent investigation but one deficiency in this paper is the absence of any enzymatic activity assays to detect the production of lysophosphatides or reacylated phospholipids dependent on membranes engaged in the full range of ER-mitochondrial interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>These points have been addressed above. It is definitely quite tricky to assess lipids via organelle lipidomics. Future studies would definitely delve into the mechanism of ABHD16A with biochemical assays. As mentioned above, we speculate that an ER tether could facilitate its immobilization at these contact sites, for focused activity. Future studies need to be done of endogenous tagging, single particle tracking, and/or ABHD16A immunoprecipitation to find the tether or lipid transfer protein responsible for its focused activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. I object to Aphyd as the name. This is not renaming of an uncharacterized, unstudied generically named gene (i.e., TMEM, KIAA, FAM, cXorfY, etc.), and it is not naming a gene with a phenotype from a genetic screen. ABHD16A is part of the aptly named ABHD family (α/β hydrolase domain). Further, other labs, in numerous publications, have previously studied the phospholipid hydrolase activity of ABHD16A and analyzed phenotypes and mechanisms using KO cells and mice in detail, as appropriately cited by the authors (e.g., Singh et al., Kamat et al.). Making an unneeded (and still pretty vague) extra name for this protein might ultimately confuse people and make it harder to search the literature without adding any extra obvious value. On the contrary, it turns a name that describes a relevant hydrolase fold (ABHD16A) into a neologism that, likely by design, is a homonym of (and conjures up the image of) an insect.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been changed back to ABHD16A in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Three hours seems like a long time for proximity biotinylation with the optimized TurboID ligase, which is typically used in much shorter pulses (~10 min). The authors are encouraged to comment in the manuscript on the need for such long labeling times.</p><p>3. What do the &quot;lipase-like motifs&quot; indicated in gray in Figure 1H correspond to? Are they residues H189 and S355 in Figure 6B? The authors should explain more about what they mean by this phrase, as it is confusing that one of them exists in the acyltransferase domain and the other in the α/β hydrolase domain.</p><p>4. The rescue presented throughout is convincing, but all phenotypes derive from a single ABHD16A siRNA. Inclusion of a second siRNA + rescue for a select subset of experiments would help to increase the rigor of the phenotypic findings.</p></disp-quote><p>These points have been addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The data presentation in Figure 3F is confusing, with numbers not adding up (by design but still kind of misleading). I recommend that the authors present it in a different manner, perhaps with n values in the legend and numbers in the graph representing the values in the shaded graph bars?

It seems unnecessary to rename a protein that has already been studied, especially when the new name doesn't inform on a new function but rather is merely a collection of a different set of letters from the old name. To avoid confusion in the field, the authors may wish to consider keeping the original ABHD16A name.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been changed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. This initial study conducts rigorous analysis of the role of newly-identified Aphyd in controlling mitochondrial fission/fusion but does not provide any biochemical insights into its lipid-modifying activities – indeed, one can't expect to solve everything in one paper! This question seems complicated since Aphyd contains domains that could catalyze opposite reactions – conversion of a phospholipid such as PS to its lyso- version by a hydrolase activity and conversion of a lyso-phospholipid such as lyso-PS back to a two-chain phospholipid. The analysis of mutants suggests both activities may be needed, but in different ways. In the absence of further biochemical analysis, this last part of the study seems quite speculative to me and could be toned down. Related to this point, in absence of any data showing the lipid specificity of Aphyd activity, the generic fusion/fission model in Figure 8 doesn't add much and the paper would be fine without it.</p></disp-quote><p>These points have been addressed above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
