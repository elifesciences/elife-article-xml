One obvious candidate is EEG, with high amplitude delta activity usually taken as an indicator of absence of consciousness, as during deep sleep, anesthesia, in vegetative state patients (also known as behavioral unresponsive wakefulness syndrome), or in coma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kobylarz and Schiff, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schiff et al., 2014</xref>). However, given the vast diversity of patients and their etiology, spontaneous EEG can show very unusual spatiotemporal patterns, with attendant high false alarm and miss rates in diagnosing individual patients with disorders of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farisco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Frohlich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Thibaut et al., 2019</xref>). More promising is the perturbational EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2021</xref>), in which the brain is probed by a brief pulse (generated via transcranial magnetic stimulation [TMS] applied to the skull or electrical stimulation applied intracranially), and the resulting cortical activity is recorded using a high-density EEG electrode array or stereo-EEG electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Casarotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Massimini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pigorini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rosanova et al., 2018</xref>). A simple algorithm then computes the <italic>perturbational complexity index</italic> (PCI) of the brain’s reverberations to this pulse from which the presence of consciousness can be inferred with unprecedented sensitivity (low false alarm rate) and specificity (low miss rate), at the level of individual patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kondziella et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>PCI has been comprehensively studied and validated in humans since its introduction by Massimini and colleagues in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Casarotto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Massimini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rosanova et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pigorini et al., 2015</xref> proposed that during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, when the brain is characterized by cortical bistability, neurons tend to fall into a down-state following activation (either endogenous or exogenous) preventing extended causal interactions that are typical during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hill and Tononi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rosanova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Timofeev et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Limitations in access to high resolution cellular recordings in humans have motivated recent efforts to translate the PCI technique to model systems for more detailed studies of the circuit mechanisms underlying complexity changes. In 2018, D’Andola et al. demonstrated that an approximation of PCI developed for in vitro measurements captured complexity differences in ferret cortical slices exhibiting sleep- and awake-like activity patterns. They showed that during a sleep-like state, electrical stimulation induced a down-state that disrupted the complex pattern of activation observed in the awake-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Andola et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arena et al., 2021</xref> were the first to recapitulate the human PCI results in vivo in rodents; they computed the complexity of electrically evoked EEG responses in rats and showed that PCI was high during wakefulness and low during anesthesia. In their comprehensive study, they found that in the anesthetized state (via propofol or sevoflurane), stimulation was followed by a widespread suppression of high frequencies in the EEG responses, suggestive of a down-state, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Andola et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pigorini et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dasilva et al., 2021</xref> measured PCI in vivo in anesthetized mice and showed that complexity can be modulated even within the anesthetized state. They showed that PCI was highest for mice under light isoflurane anesthesia (defined as a concentration of 0.1%), decreasing systematically at medium (0.34%) and deep (1.16%) concentrations. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref> validated the use of PCI in freely moving rodents across wakefulness, both REM and NREM sleep, and anesthesia by demonstrating that PCI calculated on cortical laminar local field potential (LFP) signals decreases in unconscious states (both natural and induced) in rats and mice. While pioneering, none of these studies simultaneously recorded micro- and macro-signals – neurons and LFP at hundreds of sites, together with EEG.</p><p>To investigate how cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamic activity influences the complexity of the evoked responses, we used EEG simultaneously with Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) to record brain-wide evoked responses to cortical electrical stimulation in head-fixed mice that were awake and, subsequently, anesthetized with isoflurane. Due to their ability to record spiking and LFP signals from hundreds of sites across cortical layers and subcortical structures at 20 μm resolution, Neuropixels probes provide unprecedented access to the intra- and interareal dynamics that underlie the macro-scale EEG signals. We show that cortical stimulation elicits a widespread, complex event-related potential (ERP) in the EEG signals in the awake state, but a much simpler ERP in the isoflurane-anesthetized state, in agreement with what has been shown in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casali et al., 2013</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arena et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>). We demonstrate a stereotyped pattern of activity to stimulation in deep (but not superficial) cortical layers – brief excitation, followed by a profound <italic>off</italic> period and a <italic>rebound</italic> excitation (‘rebound’ is a term often used to describe a period of enhanced spiking following a period of inhibition or silence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Guido and Weyand, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roux et al., 2014</xref>). This sequence is repeated in the thalamus, supported by burst firing in excitatory thalamic neurons. Based on relative timing between cortical and thalamic evoked activity, we infer that thalamic bursting is necessary for the late, evoked EEG component seen in response to electrical stimulation, a novel result that links the ERP to activity in the cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loop.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global evoked responses are modulated by the depth of the cortical stimulation site</title><p>We recorded global EEG-like neural signals using a multi-electrode surface array on the skull, but below the scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jonak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Land et al., 2019</xref>), in head-fixed mice. The multi-electrode array consisted of 30 electrodes situated over primary and secondary motor, somatosensory, visual, and retrosplenial areas in both hemispheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used an average reference montage that removed signals common to all EEG electrodes (see Methods). We inserted a bipolar wire electrode intra-cortically to repeatedly deliver a single electrical current pulse into the cortex and measured the evoked potentials with the EEG array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The current pulses were biphasic (200 μs/phase) with an amplitude between 10 and 100 μA (details in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> inset). Stimulation artifacts in the EEG signals were reduced by replacing the signal between 0 and +2 ms following each stimulus with the signal between –2 and 0 ms; this was done to all traces in all trials during an offline, signal pre-processing step. All subsequent analyses of the ERP (the trial-averaged EEG response) exclude the signal between –2 and +2 ms. During the experiment, we closely observed the animal for signs of electrically evoked motor twitches and chose lower stimulation amplitudes if we observed any.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evoked EEG responses to single pulse electrical stimulation in awake, head-fixed mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the 30-channel surface array (yellow circles) implanted on top of the skull over major brain areas: motor, somatosensory, retrosplenial, and visual areas (schematic created using <italic>brainrender</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Claudi et al., 2021</xref>).

Once the mouse reached a stable level of unconsciousness (no reaction to an alcohol swab placed in front of the nose; 4.0±0.3 min after induction onset at 5% isoflurane concentration), we delivered the same set of electrical stimuli.</p><p>We separated each trial by behavioral state based on whether the animal was stationary (<italic>quiet wakefulness</italic>), running (<italic>active wakefulness</italic>, defined here as an average running speed exceeding 0 cm/s in a window from –0.5 to 0.5 s from the stimulation onset), or anesthetized.

We observed large-amplitude evoked activity in the EEG and LFP in ipsilateral cortical regions close (0.5–1 mm) and up to 5 mm away from the stimulated site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>), consistent with complex evoked LFP responses in distal ipsilateral and contralateral cortical sites in response to electrical and optogenetic stimulation in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Given that the LFP reflects volume conduction and not only local activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kajikawa and Schroeder, 2011</xref>), we examined CSD and population spiking of both stimulated and non-stimulated cortical regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Deep cortical stimulation elicits measurable responses in both CSD and population spiking, whereas we were unable to detect such activations in non-stimulated cortical areas from superficial stimulation. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref> showed that evoked laminar LFP responses were either undetectable or smaller when electrical stimulation was applied to the most superficial layers of the rat cortex compared to deeper layers, reflected by smaller PCI<sup>ST</sup> values. The Neuropixels probes were inserted approximately perpendicular to the cortical surface. Deviation from perpendicular will impact the CSD derivation by increasing the ‘effective’ cortical thickness. This should not significantly affect the location of sources and sinks identified by the analysis.</p><p>The effects of electrical microstimulation are thought to be predominantly mediated by activation of axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gustafsson and Jankowska, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Histed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nowak and Bullier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tehovnik et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the stronger evoked responses to deep stimulation could be due to activation of layers 5 and 6 cortico-thalamic cells via direct activation of axons that primarily terminate in thalamic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), consistent with the literature suggesting that subcortical projecting, myelinated axons are more excitable than non-myelinated horizontal fibers within the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tehovnik and Slocum, 2013</xref>). Because most of the modulation in non-stimulated cortical regions occurs in the late time windows (25–300 ms after stimulation onset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), and the CSD analysis shows consistent sources/sinks across subjects only for late times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we speculate that involvement of non-stimulated cortical areas is due to bursting in common thalamic projections and underscores the role of the CTC loop in perturbational complexity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and benefits of studying ERPs in mice</title><p>There are qualitative differences between the ERPs we observed in mice and those in people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Casali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ferrarelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Massimini et al., 2005</xref>): most importantly, the two robust components (at 25 and 180 ms post-stimulation) in the ERPs from mice in quiet wakefulness are not apparent in human TMS-evoked EEG. Of course, there are several key differences between the brains of these two species, the most important being the three orders of magnitude difference in volume and number of neurons. The mouse brain is roughly 0.5 cm<sup>3</sup> and contains 71 million neurons, whereas the human brain is closer to 1200 cm<sup>3</sup> with 86 billion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">von Bartheld et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Walløe et al., 2014</xref>). The smooth mouse neocortex is 0.8–1 mm thick, with 14 million neurons, whereas the highly folded human neocortex is 2.5–3.0 mm thick with 16 billion neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Herculano-Houzel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Walløe et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakken et al., 2021</xref> published a comprehensive comparative analysis of cell types across human, marmoset, and mouse cortex. A key difference they highlight is more layer 2/3 intratelencephalic neurons in primates compared to mice, whereas layer 5 extratelencephalic and layer 6 corticothalamic neurons were significantly more common in mice. This is consistent with our findings that show pronounced cortico-thalamic activation and little evidence of wide-spread cortico-cortical activation in mice.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the striking difference in the ERPs between the two species is the different biophysical modes of stimulation – direct current flow from and to the inserted electrode vs. a magnetic-field induced current flow in the cortical tissue underneath the TMS coil resting against the scalp. Electrical stimulation directly activates axons that run near the stimulation site, which can lead to antidromic activation of cell bodies and/or orthodromic propagation to the axon targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borchers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gustafsson and Jankowska, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Histed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nowak and Bullier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sombeck et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tehovnik et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tehovnik and Slocum, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Terao and Ugawa, 2002</xref>), whereas TMS elicits indirect waves of cortical activation by exciting axons and neurons mainly trans-synaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pashut et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Siebner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Terao and Ugawa, 2002</xref>).

This is in line with the down-state we observed in mice, which highlights the role of the perturbational technique used for complexity measurements.</p><p>Despite these differences, this study led to novel and unexpected results linking the ERP to activity in the CTC loop. There are many additional open questions regarding the neural mechanisms underlying spontaneous and stimulus-evoked EEG signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen, 2017</xref>). Rodent models offer a unique opportunity to combine EEG recordings with high-density extracellular recording technology to shine light on the underlying microcircuit dynamics. This study opens the door for future work with rodents using different perturbational techniques (e.g. chemogenetics, optogenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cavelli et al., 2022</xref>], and TMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Senda et al., 2021</xref>]) to causally link the contributions of different cell types, brain regions, and network dynamics to EEG signals and ERP features commonly used in clinical and research settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Experimental procedures closely followed those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siegle et al., 2021</xref>. A summary of these methods and details of procedures that differ are provided below.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mice were maintained in the Allen Institute animal facility and used in accordance with protocols approved by the Allen Institute’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under protocols 1703 and 2003. All experiments used C57BL/6J wild-type mice (N=37). Male and female wild-type C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (JAX stock #000664) at postnatal day 28, and they were 9–28 weeks old at the time of all in vivo electrophysiological recordings.</p><p>After surgery, all mice were single-housed and maintained on a reverse 12 hr light cycle in a shared facility with room temperatures between 20 and 22°C and humidity between 30 and 70%. All experiments were performed during the dark cycle. Mice had ad libitum access to food and water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgical procedures and habituation</title><p>Each mouse went through the following order of procedures prior to the day of the experiment: (1) an initial sterile surgery to implant an EEG array and a titanium headframe for head-fixed electrophysiological experiments in vivo; (2) 5 days of recovery time post-surgery; (3) at least 3 weeks of habituation to head-fixation; (4) a second sterile surgery to perform small craniotomies to allow for insertion of the stimulating electrode and Neuropixels probes.</p><p>1–3 hr prior to each surgery, pre-operative injections of dexamethasone (3–4 mg/kg, IM), and ceftriaxone (100–125 mg/kg, SC) were administered. Mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (5% isoflurane induction and 1.5–2.5% maintenance) and placed in a stereotaxic frame. Vital signs were monitored, body temperature was maintained at 37.5°C with a heating pad under the animal (TC-1000 temperature controller, CWE, Inc), and ocular lubricant (I Drop, VetPLUS) was applied to maintain hydration of the eyes during anesthesia. Atropine (0.02–0.05 mg/kg, SC) and carprofen (5–10 mg/kg, SC) were administered at the start of the procedure. After the surgical procedure, mice received an injection of lactated Ringer’s solution (up to 1 mL, SC) and recovered on a heating pad. Animals received 2 days of analgesics and antibiotics post-surgery.</p><p>The initial surgery was performed on healthy mice that ranged in age from 5 to 20 weeks. Mice were deeply anesthetized prior to removing skin and exposing the skull. After leveling the skull, a 30-electrode mouse EEG array (NeuroNexus Technologies, Inc, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) was carefully positioned on top of the skull and fixed in place with Kwik-Cast (World Precision Instruments, Inc, Sarasota, Florida). Skull screws were implanted either over the right olfactory bulb or left and right cerebellum that functioned as reference and ground for the EEG signals. White C&amp;B Metabond (Parkell, Inc, Edgewood, NY, USA) was then used to secure a custom titanium headframe and the EEG array to the skull. After 5 days of recovery, mice spent at least 3 weeks being habituated to handling and head-fixation.</p><p>Following habituation and up to 1 day before the recording, mice underwent the second surgical procedure. Under a microscope, the skull was exposed by drilling through the outer layer of Metabond then removing the Kwik-Cast and a small portion of the EEG polymer substrate, carefully avoiding damage to the EEG contacts. Up to three small craniotomies (less than 0.5 mm in diameter) were drilled to allow access to the brain regions of interest for the subsequent experiment. A small piece of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF)-soaked gel-foam sponge was positioned on top of each craniotomy and Kwik-Cast was used to seal it. A 3D-printed plastic well was also fixed to the existing Metabond around the craniotomies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title><italic>In-vivo</italic> recording and stimulation</title><p>The day of the experiment, the mouse was placed on the running wheel and fixed to the headframe clamp with two set screws. Next, the thin layer of Kwik-Cast was removed to expose the craniotomies, and abundant ACSF was added on top of the skull to prevent the exposed brain tissue from drying out. A 3D-printed cone was lowered to prevent the mouse’s tail from contacting the probes, and a black panel was placed over the front of the rig, placing the mouse in complete darkness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EEG recording</title><p>All 30 EEG electrodes were connected to a 32-channel head-stage (RHD 32ch, Intan Technologies, Los Angeles, CA, USA) controlled by an Open Ephys acquisition board (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Siegle et al., 2017</xref>). EEG signals were sampled at 2.5 kHz with a low-frequency cutoff of 0.1 Hz and digitized with 16-bit resolution. Each circular, platinum electrode on the EEG array had a diameter of 500 μm and an impedance of 0.01 MΩ (impedance measured by the manufacturer). All subjects had a skull screw implanted over the right cerebellum (penetrating the skull but not the dura) that served as electrical ground. One of the following served as a common reference electrode for the EEG signals: a 0.7×0.7 mm square platinum surface electrode above the left cerebellum, a skull screw implanted over the right olfactory bulb, or a skull screw implanted over the left cerebellum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Neuropixels recording</title><p>In a subset of mice (N=26/37), simultaneous recordings from the EEG array and multiple Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jun et al., 2017</xref>) were performed. These experiments used Neuropixels 3a prototypes or standard Neuropixels 1.0 probes configured to record from the 384 electrodes closest to the tip of the probe. The signals from each recording site were split in hardware into a spike band (30 kHz sampling rate, 500 Hz high-pass filter, 500× gain) and an LFP band (2.5 kHz sampling rate, 1000 Hz low-pass filter, 250× gain), and data was acquired using the Open Ephys GUI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Siegle et al., 2017</xref>). Each probe was either connected to a dedicated field-programmable gate array streaming data over Ethernet (Neuropixels 3a) or a PXIe card inside a National Instruments chassis (Neuropixels 1.0).</p><p>The reference connection on the Neuropixels probes was permanently soldered to ground using a silver wire, and all recordings were made using either an external reference configuration (Neuropixels 3a) or a tip reference configuration (Neuropixels 1.0). All Neuropixels head-stage grounds, which were contiguous with the probe grounds, were connected in parallel to animal ground – a 32 AWG silver wire (A-M Systems, Sequim, Washington) placed in the ACSF on top of the craniotomies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Neuropixels insertion</title><p>During the acute electrophysiological experiment, up to three Neuropixels probes were inserted targeting motor (MO), anterior cingulate (ACA), somatosensory (SS), visual (VIS), and thalamic nuclei. We restricted our analysis of thalamic nuclei to those that had strong projections to and/or from motor and somatosensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harris et al., 2019</xref>): anteroventral (AV), central lateral (CL), mediodorsal (MD), posterior (PO), reticular (RT), ventral anterior-lateral (VAL), ventral posterolateral (VPL), ventral posteromedial (VPM), and ventral medial (VM). We refer to these collectively as the somatomotor-related thalamic nuclei (SM-TH), disregarding the distinction between first and higher order thalamic regions.</p><p>The probe insertion process followed the steps detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siegle et al., 2021</xref>. Briefly, each probe was individually inserted into the brain using a three-axis micromanipulator (New Scale Technologies, Victor, NY, USA) at a rate of 200 μm per min to a depth of 3.5 mm or less in the brain. After the probes reached their targets, they were allowed to settle for 10–15 min before starting the experiment. Before insertion, all Neuropixels probes were coated with a fluorescent dye (Vybrant DiI/DiO/DiD, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) by repeatedly immersing them in a well filled with the dye and removing each probe slowly allowing the dye to dry on the surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral data and synchronization</title><p>The angular position of the running wheel and the synchronization signal for the electrical stimulus were acquired by a dedicated computer with a National Instruments card acquiring digital inputs at 100 kHz, which was considered the master clock. A 32-bit digital ‘barcode’ was sent with an Arduino Uno (DEV-11021, SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA) every 30 s to synchronize all devices with the neural data from the EEG array and the Neuropixels probes.

During each stage of the experiment, up to 120 biphasic, charge-balanced, cathodic-first current pulses (200 μs per phase, 3.5–4.5 s inter-stimulus interval) were delivered at three different current intensities (360 pulses total). The current intensities were chosen for each animal while it was awake before starting the experiment based on the following criteria: (1) the electrical pulse did not evoke any visible twitches and (2) the medium current elicited visible averaged evoked responses for most of the EEG electrodes (n&gt;15) defined as three SDs above baseline for at least 100 ms following the stimulus onset.</p><p>The stimulation electrode was acutely inserted using a three-axis micromanipulator, like the Neuropixels probes. We targeted four locations for stimulation: MOs, layer 2/3 (N=10 mice, 0.37±0.04 mm below the brain surface); MOs, layer 5/6 (N=11 mice, 1.15±0.06 mm below the brain surface); SSp, layer 2/3 (N=8 mice, 0.47±0.06 mm below the brain surface); and SSp, layer 5/6 (N=11 mice, 0.92±0.05 mm below the brain surface). Some mice received stimulation in multiple locations (N=10). Before insertion, the stimulation electrode was coated with a fluorescent dye, like the Neuropixels probes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Experimental timeline</title><p>The paired EEG/Neuropixels recordings were acute, lasting 2–3 hr. At the beginning, awake head-fixed mice (free to run on or rest on the running wheel) were exposed to electrical stimuli after 5 min of baseline recording without stimulation. After the awake session, mice were anesthetized via inhaled isoflurane (5% induction) delivered through a small tube placed in front of the mouse’s nose. Once a surgical level of anesthesia was reached, the animal was maintained unconscious by keeping the isoflurane level at 1–1.5%. The unconscious state was verified by lack of reaction to noxious stimuli such as toe or tail pinch and alcohol pad close to the nose of the animal. The EEG signals were also continuously monitored to avoid the burst suppression mode indicative of very deep anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Purdon et al., 2015</xref>). Then the same electrical stimuli session was repeated. While under anesthesia, we recorded the precise concentration of isoflurane delivered over time, in addition to the data streams listed above. Finally, the isoflurane was turned off and the mouse recovered. In a subset of mice (N=16), the electrical stimuli were delivered for a third (and sometimes a fourth) time during the recovery period. The resulting dataset allowed a direct comparison of the evoked neural responses across different brain states (quiet wakefulness, running, anesthetized, recovery).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Probe removal and cleaning</title><p>Upon completion of the experiment, probes were retracted from the brain at a rate of 1 mm/s. The craniotomies were protected with a small piece of ACSF-soaked gel-foam sponge and a thin layer of Kwik-Cast before mice were removed from head fixation and returned to their home cages overnight. The probes and the stimulating electrode were immersed in a well of 1% Tergazyme for around 2–6 hr to remove residual tissue, and then rinsed in purified water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quality control for the EEG experiments</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Overall EEG signal quality</title><p>Before the experiment, the EEG signals were tested by exposing the animal to visual flashes and evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG evoked responses.

The brains were then processed in one of two ways: brains were sliced into 100 µm coronal sections using a vibratome (Leica VT1000S) and imaged with a fluorescent microscope (Olympus VS110/120) at 10× magnification, or whole brains were imaged using serial two-photon tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ragan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Images of the 100 µm coronal sections were aligned to the Allen Institute Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3) following the process detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McBride et al., 2023</xref> and images from serial two-photon tomography were aligned to the CCFv3 following the process detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oh et al., 2014</xref>. Fluorescent tracks corresponding to the location of the Neuropixels probes and the stimulation electrode were manually identified in the aligned images. Because each CCFv3 coordinate corresponds to a unique brain region, the precision of brain region assignments is determined by the resolution of the CCFv3, which was 25 µm per pixel. For each Neuropixels probe, the locations of major structural boundaries along the track was manually aligned with the physiology data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Siegle et al., 2021</xref>).

The magnitude of the response was calculated by integrating under the global field power (z-score) but above z=3 in the response window and dividing it by the area under the baseline window (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-3"><title>LFP, CSD, and population spiking magnitude</title><p>To quantify the magnitude of the evoked LFP and CSD response, the spatial average of the rectified, trial averaged signals for all channels in the respective cortical region, all layers except for layer 1. Then the AUC was calculated for the post-stimulus period (0 to +0.5 s) of the grand average (z-score of the baseline). A similar procedure was used for the population spiking, except the signals used were single neuron spike density functions. For all data types, the magnitude of the background activity was determined using a permutation test to shuffle the event onset time per trial (n=1000 shuffles), thus creating a distribution of null values representing the AUC of the background activity. The response magnitude was then calculated by subtracting the mean of the onset-shuffled values and dividing by the SD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-4"><title>Significantly modulated neurons</title><p>The fraction of neurons modulated by the electrical stimulation was quantified following the method detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McBride et al., 2023</xref>. Briefly, for each neuron, pre- and post-stimulus spikes were counted on a trial-by-trial basis for the specified windows: 2–25 ms, 25–150 ms, and 150–300 ms. The duration of the window was always matched for pre- and post-stimulus. Then a Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed on the trial-wise pre- and post-stimulus spike counts to obtain a p-value. The p-values obtained for all RS neurons in all areas of interest were corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg correction with the false discovery rate set at 0.05. Neurons with an adjusted p-value&lt;0.05 were considered significantly modulated. They were labeled as ‘increased’ or ‘decreased’ based on whether their spike count increased or decreased, respectively, in the post-stimulus window relative to the pre-stimulus window on average.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-5"><title>Population CSD</title><p>To compare CSD across mice, we transformed each CSD trace to a homogeneous space (10 bins per layer) through a non-linear transform. Significantly consistent activations were assessed through a Wilcoxon signed-rank test (threshold p&lt;0.05). Isolated significant bins (i.e. not surrounded by significant bins in both space and time) were removed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14-6"><title>PCI, state-transition</title><p>PCI<sup>ST</sup> was used to evaluate the spatiotemporal complexity of the EEG ERPs for each brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Comolatti et al., 2019</xref>). PCI<sup>ST</sup> was computed using the code available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/renzocom/PCIst">https://github.com/renzocom/PCIst</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Comolatti, 2021</xref>), and the parameters were set as follows: baseline window = (–0.8, –0.002) s; response window = (0.002, 0.8) s; minimum SNR = 1.6; maximum variance = 99%; and the parameter k=1.2. In all calculations, the number of trials per state within subject was matched.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed in Python. All data was tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test from the SciPy package (scipy.stats.shapiro). For normally distributed datasets, we used the unpaired t-test (scipy.stats.ttest_ind) or the paired t-test (scipy.stats.ttest_rel). For non-parametric datasets, we used the Mann-Whitney U test (scipy.stats.mannwhitneyu) or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (scipy.stats.wilcoxon). All comparisons using t-tests are two-sided. Statistical comparisons between multiple groups were performed using both parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Friedman) tests with post-hoc, pairwise comparisons corrected for multiple comparisons using Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Correlational analyses were performed using Pearson correlation coefficients.</p><p>In all figures, the convention is * weak evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.05&gt;p&gt;0.01), ** strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.01&gt;p&gt;0.001), and *** very strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.001&gt;p). The values in the text indicate the mean and SEM (mean ± SEM) or the median and IQR (25th and 75th percentiles) for normally distributed and non-parametric datasets, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>CK is a Board Member and has a financial interest in Intrinsic Powers Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Allen Institute under protocols 1703 and 2003.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-84630-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data generated and analyzed in this manuscript are publicly available in Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rübel et al., 2022</xref>) in the DANDI Archive.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Claar</surname><given-names>LD</given-names></name><name><surname>Rembado</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuyat</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name><name><surname>Russo</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name><name><surname>Olsen</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Simultaneous electroencephalography, extracellular electrophysiology, and cortical electrical stimulation in head-fixed mice</data-title><source>DANDI Archive</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://dandiarchive.org/dandiset/000458">DANDI:000458/0.230317.0039</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Anton Arkhipov, Matias Cavelli, Chiara Cirelli, Graham Findlay, Saurabh Gandhi, Soo Yeun Lee, Rong Mao, Marcello Massimini, Dana Mastrovito, Ethan McBride, David McCormick, Stefan Mihalas, Andrea Pigorini, Simone Sarasso, and Giulio Tononi for helpful discussions and intellectual contributions.

To show this association, the authors used high-density EEG together with multiple deep electrophysiological recordings combined with electrical stimulation of superficial and deep cortical layers. Stimulation of deep layers elicits a late ERP component that is closely related to bursts of thalamic activity during quiet wakefulness. This relationship is quite noticeable when deep layers of the cortex are stimulated, and it does depend on arousal state, being maximal during quiet wakefulness, diminished during active wakefulness, and absent during anesthesia.</p><p>The study is very well performed, with a high number of subjects and appropriate methodology. Performing simultaneous recording of EEG and several neuropixels probes together with cortical microstimulation is no small feat considering the size of the mouse head and the fact that mice are freely behaving in many of the experiments. It is also noticeable how the authors use a seemingly outdated technique (electrical microstimulation) to produce compelling and significant research. The conclusions regarding the thalamic contributions to the ERP components are strongly supported by the data.</p><p>The spatiotemporal complexity is almost a side point compared to what seems to me the most important point of the paper: showing the contribution of thalamic activity to some components of the cortical ERP. Scalp ERP's have long been regarded as purely cortical phenomena, just like most of EEG, and this study shows convincing evidence to the contrary.</p><p>The data presented seemingly contradicts the results presented in Histed et al. (2009), who asserts that cortical microstimulation only affects passing fibers near the tip of the electrodes, and results in distant, sparse, and somewhat random neural activation. In this study, it is clear that the maximum effect happens near the electrodes, decays with distance, and it is not sparse at all, suggesting that not only passing fibers are activated but that also neuronal elements might be activated by antidromic propagation from the axonal hillock. This appears to offer proof that microstimulation might be much more effective than it was thought after the publication of Histed 2009, as the uber-successful use of DBS to treat Parkinson disease has also shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84630.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Claar</surname><given-names>Leslie D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Allen Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rembado</surname><given-names>Irene</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Allen Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kuyat</surname><given-names>Jacqulyn R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Allen Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Russo</surname><given-names>Simone</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Allen Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Lydia C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Allen Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Olsen</surname><given-names>Shawn R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Allen Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Christof</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Allen Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors investigated state-dependent changes in evoked brain activity, using electrical stimulation combined with multisite neural activity across wakefulness and anesthesia.

We do not believe that the average reference montage is obscuring an evoked slow wave in the isoflurane-anesthetized mice. Electrical stimulation did elicit a brief activation in nearby neurons that was followed by roughly 200 ms of quiescence, but no significant changes in firing in the other regions we recorded from (Author response image 1).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ERP and evoked population activity during isoflurane anesthesia do not show evidence of global responses.</title><p>(Top).

(2021), a study similar to ours because they also performed cortical electrical stimulation in mice anesthetized with isoflurane. They show widespread evoked multi-unit activity (derived from LFP) in isoflurane-anesthetized mice in response to electrical stimulation, but critical experimental differences may underlie the conflicting results presented in our study. Both works use similar levels of isoflurane to maintain anesthesia (we use a level roughly equivalent to their “deep” level). However, our experiments use only isoflurane, whereas Dasilva et al. induced anesthesia with ketamine and medetomidine followed by isoflurane. It has been shown that isoflurane and ketamine have different effects on neural dynamics (Sorrenti et al., 2021). Typically, isoflurane causes reduced spontaneous firing rates and decreased evoked response amplitudes compared to wakefulness, whereas ketamine has been shown to increase firing rates and evoked response amplitudes (Aasebø et al., 2017; Michelson &amp; Kozai, 2018). Perhaps a more relevant difference are the electrical stimulation parameters used to perturb the brain. Dasilva et al. used 1 ms pulses of 500 μA, which would have a much larger effect than the stimulation used in this work, 0.2 ms pulses of 10-100 μA.</p><p>Additionally, we would like to clarify that the average reference montage is not impacting the main findings of this work. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, the average reference montage does change the appearance of the ERP in the butterfly plots (Top panel in Author response image 1). However, all the quantitative analyses of the EEG-ERPs are performed on the global field power, computed by taking the standard deviation across all EEG channels, which is not affected by the average reference montage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>[…] The conclusions regarding the thalamic contributions to the ERP components are strongly supported by the data.</p><p>The spatiotemporal complexity is almost a side point compared to what seems to be the most important point of the paper: showing the contribution of thalamic activity to some components of the cortical ERP.

We appreciate and agree with the reviewer’s perspective that the thalamic contribution to the cortical ERP is one of the key points of this study. We also thank the reviewer for their comment on the apparently contradictory results reported by Histed et al. (2009). This gives us the opportunity to further highlight the important contribution of our study to the field.</p><p>First, we would like to highlight some key experimental differences between the two studies. In our study we used single pulse stimulation with currents between 10 and 100 μA, whereas Histed et al. used trains of pulses (100 ms in duration at 250 Hz) with lower current intensities (between 2 and 50 μA). We varied the depth of stimulation, targeting superficial and deep cortical layers; Histed et al. exclusively stimulated superficial cortical layers. In addition, the two studies used recording methods that are orthogonal in nature. We used Neuropixels probes that record from neurons that span all cortical layers depth-wise while Histed et al. used two-photon calcium imaging to record from a horizontal plane of neurons (again, in the superficial cortical layers).</p><p>Because of these important methodological differences, it is more appropriate to compare the Histed et al. results to our results from superficial stimulation at comparable current intensities. In this case, we believe the two studies show similar results: stimulation activated a small fraction of neurons even hundreds of microns away from the stimulating electrode (see Figure 4A from our manuscript). However, our study adds an important observation pointing to the critical role of the depth of the stimulating electrode. We observe significant excitation of local cortical neurons (Figure 4D) and trans-synaptic activation of the thalamus only when we delivered deep stimulation (Figure5A). This effect is likely mediated by activation of large, myelinated cortico-thalamic fibers, which are thought to be more excitable that non-myelinated horizontal fibers (Tehovnik &amp; Slocum, 2013).</p><p>To summarize, Histed et al. (2009) concluded that microstimulation causes a sparse activation of a distributed set of neurons with little evidence of synaptically driven activation. Instead, we showed that microstimulation can robustly activate local neurons and trans-synaptically activate distant neurons when stronger stimuli are directed to deep cortical layers. Based on this, we conclude that electrical stimulation is indeed highly effective, and is a valid tool that can be used to probe and characterize the cortico-thalamo-cortical network of any behavioral state.</p><p>----------</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer</bold><italic>#</italic><bold>1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>1. I am not clear how &quot;putative pyramidal&quot; or RS and &quot;putative inhibitory&quot; fast-spiking neurons were identified. Please provide some further details on that, including average spike wave shapes, and distribution of firing rates, and it would be interesting to know the proportion of &quot;putative&quot; RS and FS neurons in your recorded population. Obviously, caution is warranted here because, without further work, you cannot be sure that those are indeed pyramidal cells or interneurons! Is this subdivision necessary at all?</p></disp-quote><p>We added details regarding the cell-type classification to the Results (lines 136-140) and the Methods section. This classification is common practice in cortical extracellular electrophysiology recordings given that cell-type specific analyses can reveal important differences between the two putative populations (Barthó et al., 2004; Bortone et al., 2014; Bruno &amp; Simons, 2002; Jia et al., 2016; Niell &amp; Stryker, 2008; Sirota et al., 2008). Based on our findings that the two populations respond to electrical stimulation in similar ways (excitation followed by a period of quiescence and rebound excitation), we agree the subdivision is not necessary to support our conclusions. However, we believe that some readers will appreciate seeing the two putative populations presented separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I wonder how the authors know whether the animals were awake, specifically when they were not running. Did you observe animals falling asleep when head-fixed? Providing some analyses of spontaneous EEG/LFP signals in each state could add some reassurance that only wakefulness was included, as intended.</p></disp-quote><p>While we cannot conclusively rule out that mice were asleep during the “quiet wakefulness” periods we analyzed, we believe they were likely to be awake for two main reasons: (1) all the experiments were performed during the dark phase of the light/dark cycle, when the mice are less likely to enter a sleep state (Franken et al., 1999); (2) the animals did not undergo specific training to promote drowsiness or sleep. Indeed, many sleep-focused studies in head-fixed mice are performed during the light phase of the animal’s cycle to maximize the likelihood of capturing sleep states (Kobayashi et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2020; Yüzgeç et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2022). We have added this note to the Discussion section (lines 402-406).</p><p>Because we do not specifically record during sleep states and our recording does not include electromyography, which is commonly used in conjunction with EEG to classify sleep stages, we cannot accurately perform spectral comparison between “quiet wakefulness” and sleep states in our recordings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I was unsure about the meaning of some of the terminology, specifically &quot;rebound&quot;, &quot;rebound spiking&quot;, &quot;rebound excitation&quot; etc. Why do you call it &quot;rebound&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>“Rebound” is a term often used to describe a period of enhanced spiking following a period of prolonged silence or inhibition (Guido &amp; Weyand, 1995; Roux et al., 2014). Grenier et al. list “postinhibitory rebound excitation” as an intrinsic property of cortical and thalamic neurons (1998). We added this description to the text (lines 79-80).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Regarding analysis, I would make three main points:</p><p>Regarding the CSD analysis, I think the authors have done a good job of circumventing several of the known issues of this technique, especially by using ERPs rather than ongoing activity. However, although I do not immediately have access to the literature to back up this claim, I've heard that many assumptions behind CSD require a laminar structure with electrodes positioned perpendicular to these layers. In Figure 1B it seems like the neuropixels probe is not really perpendicular to the cortical layers, and I wonder if this might be an issue. I am also wondering how to interpret the thalamic CSD, as this structure is not laminar, lacks the mass of neatly stacked neuronal dipoles present in the cortex, and does not have an orderly array of synaptic inputs and outputs. I understand that CSD analysis helps minimize the contributions of volume conduction, but in this case, I also wonder if the thalamic CSD is even necessary to back up the paper's claims.</p></disp-quote><p>One-dimensional CSD is computed assuming that the electrode is inserted perpendicular to cortex. This is mainly important for the interpretation of sinks and sources, since CSD can be also computed on radial voltages (e.g., EEG [Tenke &amp; Kayser, 2012]). In general, our Neuropixels probes do not significantly deviate from perpendicular (mean deviation from perpendicular 15.3 degrees, minimum 5.2 degrees, and maximum 36.6 degrees). The probe represented in Figure 1B deviates from perpendicular by 31.2 degrees, which is an outlier compared to the rest of the insertions. Any deviation from perpendicular would result in the “effective” cortical thickness being larger by a factor of 1/cos(angle deviation from perpendicular) and thus would not affect the relative location of sources and sinks. We have added a statement to clarify this in the text (lines 126 and 454-456).</p><p>We agree with the statement regarding CSD analysis in the thalamus. We originally included the CSD for the thalamus in Figure 2F for completeness. As the reviewer pointed out, thalamic CSD was not used to perform any subsequent analysis and is, therefore, not necessary to back up any claims. As such, we have removed CSD plot from Figure 2F to avoid any confusion and made a comment to this effect in the legend (lines 1175-1177).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the merits of using the z-score normalization for spike rates vs. other strategies like standardizing to maximum firing, I am aware that both procedures have limitations, but the z-score changes the range of the firing rate from [0, +Inf] to [-Inf, +Inf]. This does not seem correct considering that negative spiking rates do not exist. The standardization to maximum rate keeps the range within [0, 1], not creating negative rates. Another point that it will be worth discussing is the reported values of the z-scored values. For example, what does it mean to be 54 standard deviations away from the mean? 6 standard deviations is already a big distance from the mean.</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 2, we chose to represent the neural firing rates as z-scores because we found it important to report the magnitude of both the increase and decrease of the evoked firing rates in the post-stimulus period relative to the pre-stimulus rate. The normalization we used helps to visualize the magnitude of the effects of electrical stimulation in neuronal activity for both directions, which is an important result of the study. Despite the differences between the two normalization methods, the normalization based on the maximum firing does not significantly change the qualitative interpretation of Figure 2 in the manuscript (Author response image 2).</p><p><bold>Author response image 2</bold></p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Evoked firing rates for neurons in the areas of interest in response to deep stimulation in MO during the awake state.</title><p>(Left) Firing rates of all neurons normalized by the average, pre-stimulus firing rate.

This can help explain why we see values of ~50 SD∙s. We chose to z-score firing rates, LFP, and CSD to normalize across the different signals and magnitudes of the evoked responses. We often observed the largest responses in the LFP (see Figure 3A), which may be partly due to the signal naturally having a larger dynamic range than the measured neural firing rates. Then we integrated the z-score response time series to capture the dynamic of the signal over the response window, rather than a static value such as the mean or maximum z-score. After performing a thorough literature search, we found no other ways to capture and compare the magnitudes of the different signals. We have added language to clarify the magnitude metric (lines 155-156) and added the appropriate units.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In reporting the p-values, I recommend increasing the number of significant digits to four because the p-value seems to be the same for different tests in several places (e.g.: lines 207 to 218), which seems odd. I also wonder whether this could be an artifact of the z-scoring procedure. In the figures, I would like to advise the use of 1 asterisk to denote &quot;weak evidence to reject the null hypothesis (0.05 &gt; p &gt; 0.01)&quot; and two asterisks to denote &quot;strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis (0.01 &gt; p)&quot;, and make a note of it accordingly in the manuscript and/or figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have changed the statistics language to “* weak evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.05 &gt; p &gt; 0.01), ** strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.01 &gt; p &gt; 0.001), *** very strong evidence to reject null hypothesis (0.001 &gt; p)” throughout the manuscript.</p><p>We have also increased the number of significant digits to four throughout the manuscript. It is true that some of the p-values reported for Figure 3 (lines 169-180) are the same for different tests. This is not an artifact of the z-scoring, but rather a consequence of performing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (an ordinal statistical test) with small sample numbers. Because the p-value depends only on the relative ordering, not the continuous distribution of values, the small sample size (N=6-14) increases the likelihood of obtaining the exact same p-value if the relative ordering of samples is the same.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 202: If the magnitude corresponds to z-score data, please add &quot;s.d.&quot; after the number, as z-scored values are expressed in standard deviation units.
