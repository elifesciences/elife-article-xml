We describe a method, based on magnetic sensing, for measuring eye movements in head-fixed and freely moving mice. A small magnet was surgically implanted on the eye, and changes in the magnet angle as the eye rotated were detected by a magnetic field sensor. Systematic testing demonstrated high resolution measurements of eye position of &lt;0.1°. Magnetic eye tracking offers several advantages over the well-established eye coil and video-oculography methods. Most notably, it provides the first method for reliable, high-resolution measurement of eye movements in freely moving mice, revealing increased eye movements and altered binocular coordination compared to head-fixed mice. Overall, magnetic eye tracking provides a lightweight, inexpensive, easily implemented, and high-resolution method suitable for a wide range of applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eye movements</kwd><kwd>oculomotor mechanics</kwd><kwd>vestibulo-ocular reflex</kwd><kwd>binocular vision</kwd><kwd>spatial vision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21-EY026152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>Hannah L</given-names></name><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Simons Foundation/SFARI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>543031</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raymond</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An accurate, robust, and lightweight technique for measuring eye movements in mice was developed using magnetic sensing, yielding the first high resolution recordings of eye movements in freely moving mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many behaviors, from navigation and predation to avoidance of danger and pursuit of mates, are guided by vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapillon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coen and Murthy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mather and Baker, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Olberg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>). Vision is actively controlled by eye movements, which localize and stabilize images on the retina. Therefore, eye movements are often measured in studies of visually guided behaviors, both for documentation and control of the visual inputs impinging on the retina, and as a behavioral output. The analysis of eye movements can provide a window on a variety of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, such as attention, learning and memory, and decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duhamel et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kustov and Robinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raposo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raymond and Lisberger, 1996</xref>). Moreover, abnormal eye movements are associated with numerous cognitive disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avanzini et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeJong and Jones, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holzman et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rosenhall et al., 1988</xref>). Thus, the measurement of eye movements can advance our understanding of the sophisticated neural processes underlying a wide range of functions in healthy and diseased brains.</p><p>Given their broad utility, measurements of eye movements have been routinely implemented in neuroscientific studies of primates. In contrast, such measurements are uncommon in mice, a species that is widely used in molecular and genetic studies of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>). Although less dependent on vision than primates, mice encode visual input with high selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niell and Stryker, 2008</xref>), and use vision for a variety of functions including navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapillon, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hopkins, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Saleem et al., 2013</xref>), avoidance of predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yilmaz and Meister, 2013</xref>), and recognition of territorial boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mackintosh, 1973</xref>). Eye movements can alter the visual experience during these behaviors, and thus provide key information about how these behaviors are controlled. However, measurement of eye movements in mice is technically challenging.</p><p>The main obstacle to measuring eye movements in mice is their diminutive size. In particular, the small eye restricts what can be implanted on the eye’s surface: average eye diameter is only 3.4 mm in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Remtulla and Hallett, 1985</xref>), compared to 6.4 mm in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhuri et al., 1983</xref>), 9.2 mm in chicken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwarz et al., 2013</xref>), 18 mm in rabbit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hughes, 1972</xref>), and 21 mm in rhesus macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schultz, 1940</xref>). The small size of the head and body also impede measurement of eye movements, especially during free motion, by restricting what can be affixed to the skull and carried by the mouse. Whereas neuroscientific studies of awake, behaving primates are typically conducted in head-fixed animals, behavioral paradigms in mice often leverage locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fyhn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Machado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yoder and Taube, 2009</xref>), nose pokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raposo et al., 2012</xref>), foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devito and Eichenbaum, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>), social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Silverman et al., 2010</xref>), or other complex behaviors that require freedom of motion. The power of such behavioral paradigms has motivated significant efforts to analyze head and body kinematics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fyhn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goulding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardcastle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Machado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wiltschko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yoder and Taube, 2009</xref>) and to image the activity of neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barretto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flusberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>) in freely moving mice. However, measurements of eye movements have been lacking in these studies, even for visually guided behaviors such as navigation. Thus, a method for analyzing eye movements in unrestrained mice would be a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of the murine behavioral repertoire and its neural underpinnings. Previously, the only eye tracking method compatible with free motion in small animals was the electro-oculogram, which is susceptible to inaccuracies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arden and Kelsey, 1962</xref>). Recently, video-oculography was used to measure visually driven eye movements in mice without head restraint, however the mice were constrained to a small platform, and only 20% of the measurements were useable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kretschmer et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we address the need for an accurate and reliable technique to measure eye movements in mice during the broad range of freely moving behaviors used in neuroscience research.</p><p>Our approach was designed to overcome the major limitations of previous eye tracking methods in mice, the most popular of which are the eye coil method and video-oculography. The eye coil, or scleral search coil, technique is considered the gold standard for measuring eye movements in most species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyden and Raymond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collewijn et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Judge et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Koekkoek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Remmel, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robinson, 1963</xref>). A small coil of wire is surgically implanted beneath the conjunctiva on the surface of the eye, and eye position is determined from the current generated in the wire by an external magnetic field. A major advantage of the eye coil method is that it has high spatial (~0.1°) and temporal (&lt;1 ms) resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collewijn et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>). Disadvantages arise from the difficulty of implementation, particularly in species with small eyes. The surgery requires lengthy training to master, and the fragile wires leading subcutaneously from the eye coil to a skull-mounted connector can break, requiring additional surgeries for repair or additional animals. Moreover, during measurements of eye movements, it is optimal for the animal’s head to remain stationary and centered within large magnetic field coils, so this approach has been applied almost exclusively in head-fixed animals (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collewijn, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ogorodnikov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sánchez-López and Escudero, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A second, common method for measuring eye movements is video-oculography, which uses a high-speed camera to record the position of the pupil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mitchiner et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 2013</xref>). The primary advantage of this approach is that it is non-invasive. However, there are also several disadvantages. Its spatial resolution is lower than that of the eye coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houben et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimmel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McCamy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>). Inaccuracies can arise from changes in pupil diameter due to fluctuations in luminance or behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaufman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimmel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McCamy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>). A camera or mirror must be placed in the animal’s field of view, which limits the experimenter’s control of visual stimuli. Finally, the head must remain stationary relative to the camera, which precludes use in freely moving mice, since even the miniaturized video-oculography system developed for the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 2013</xref>) significantly exceeds the size of the mouse head.</p><p>A promising alternative to the eye coil and video-oculography techniques is an approach based on magnetic sensing. If a magnet is implanted on the surface of the eye, its magnetic field will rotate with the eye, allowing eye movements to be detected with a sensor that measures either the angle or the strength of the magnetic field. Three previous reports, two in goldfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodríguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salas et al., 1999</xref>) and one in chickens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwarz et al., 2013</xref>) have demonstrated the potential of magnetic sensing for measuring eye movements. We extended these initial efforts in several ways. First, we miniaturized the implant for the smaller mouse eye, while achieving spatial resolution comparable to the eye coil benchmark. Second, we rigorously tested robustness to the relative placement of the magnet and sensor. Third, we developed an improved method for calibrating the magnetic eye tracking system. These advances yielded the first high resolution recordings of eye movements in freely moving mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We developed a system for measuring eye movements in mice using magnetic sensing technology.

Hence, during normal eye movements in mice, which are typically within ±10–20° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Alphen et al., 2010</xref>), at least one of the two channels should operate close to its range of greatest sensitivity and linearity (near 0° for Channel 1, and 45° for Channel 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>center</italic>).</p><p>Robustness to deviations in magnet-sensor alignment is necessary for magnetic eye tracking in vivo, since surgical implantation of the magnet and sensor will inevitably result in some variation in placement. Most notably, the magnet cannot be directly adjacent to the sensor when implanted in the mouse eye. Therefore, we tested the effect of increasing the distance to the magnet on the sensitivity of the sensor to the angular position of the magnet. Sensitivity was calculated as the slope of the relationship between magnetic sensor voltage and angular position of the magnet, averaged in a ±22.5° range centered on the zero-crossings of each channel. Sensitivity decreased from 224.7 ± 0.3 mV/° at 0 mm to 28.1 ± 1.0 mV/° at 5 mm (average sensitivity of the two channels; sensitivity for each channel is shown separately in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Notably, at 3 mm, a distance readily achievable in mice (see Materials and methods), the sensitivity was 127.0 ± 1.2 mV/°. This corresponded to a spatial resolution, as measured by the standard deviation of the signal at rest, of 0.016° ± 0.005°, which is nearly an order of magnitude below the noise floor measured by the best eye tracking methods in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>). Results obtained using a 1.5 × 0.5 mm disc magnet were similar to those for the cylinder magnet, with a sensitivity of 90.9 ± 0.7 mV/° at a distance of 3 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because of its marginally greater sensitivity, we focused on the cylinder magnet for all subsequent measurements.</p><p>In addition to characterizing how sensitivity varied with the vertical distance between the magnet and sensor, the effect of horizontal distance (displacement within a plane parallel to the plane of the sensor) was tested. In the animal, the magnet will not rotate exactly about its center, but instead will be horizontally offset by the radius of the eye. We tested the impact of this offset by fixing the vertical distance between magnet and sensor at 3 mm, and then horizontally displacing the magnet from the midpoint of the sensor and from its axis of rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sensitivity decreased with distance; nevertheless, the signals were still more than half maximum at 1.5 mm of horizontal offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which corresponds to the radius of the mouse eye. When the sensor, rather than the magnet, was displaced from the axis of rotation, sensitivity decreased in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, the sensor’s ability to detect magnet angle is robust to horizontal as well as vertical variations in magnet-sensor alignment of magnitudes that would be expected in vivo.</p><p>Finally, we tested the effect of tilting the N-S axis of the magnet relative to the plane of the sensor, which also may occur during implantation. Tilting the magnet by 45° did not affect sensitivity (127.8 ± 4 mV/° no tilt, 128.0 ± 2.0 mV/° with 45° tilt, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Magnetic tracking of eye movements in mice</title><p>After characterizing the performance of the magnetic eye tracking system outside the mouse, we implemented magnetic eye tracking in head-fixed mice.

To evaluate whether the magnet implant has any effect on eye movements, video-oculography was used to compare the eye movements measured one day before versus six days after implantation of the magnet and sensor. Eye movement responses to vestibular stimuli at a range of stimulus frequencies were measured in the dark. Because the eye movements driven by the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in the dark are open-loop, they should provide a particularly sensitive measure of any disruption of normal oculomotor dynamics.

Thus, bilateral eye movements in mice are highly dependent on the motion of the animal, with the eyes both more active and more divergent in freely moving compared to head-fixed mice.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Magnetic eye tracking opens up exciting new scientific opportunities by providing a high-resolution (&lt;0.1°) method for measuring eye movements that overcomes the challenging physical constraints of small and freely moving animals. The methods described here extend previous reports of magnetic eye tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodríguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwarz et al., 2013</xref>) by miniaturizing the implant for use in mice, increasing the resolution, assessing tolerance for various magnet-sensor alignments, and improving the calibration procedure. Magnetic eye tracking has important advantages over the commonly used eye coil and video-oculography techniques, and hence could replace these older techniques in many current applications. We developed the magnetic eye tracking system in mice due to the widespread use of this species, but there are no obvious barriers to extending this technique into larger species, such as rats or monkeys. A larger eye and orbit may require that the sensor be implanted farther away from the magnet, however, this should be offset by the ability to implant a larger magnet.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Comparison to the eye coil</title><p>Magnetic eye tracking achieved performance similar to that of the eye coil technique, which is widely considered the gold standard for measuring eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robinson, 1963</xref>). The spatial resolution of magnetic eye tracking (0.098°) was comparable to the resolution of the eye coil technique in mice, as measured by our lab (0.091°; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and other labs (0.09°, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>), and was also comparable to the resolution of the eye coil technique in larger species such as monkeys (&lt;0.1°, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimmel et al., 2012</xref>) and humans (0.096°, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houben et al., 2006</xref>). Further, the linearity of magnetic eye tracking was indistinguishable from that of the eye coil technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>The performance of the magnetic eye tracking system benefited from the use of angular magnetic field sensors containing anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwarz et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to Hall effect sensors, which measure magnetic field strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodríguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salas et al., 1999</xref>), AMR sensors are designed to measure the angle of a magnetic field. AMR sensors can achieve high resolution, while satisfying the constraints of low power, low cost, and small sensor size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lenz and Edelstein, 2006</xref>). Despite the small size of the magnet required for mice, high resolution was achieved by placement of the magnet and sensor within the range established by systematic testing outside the animal.</p><p>With comparable spatial resolution, magnetic eye tracking offers several advantages over the eye coil technique. Most notably, the minimal equipment required for magnetic eye tracking permits its use in freely moving animals, as discussed further below. Magnetic eye tracking is also far less expensive than commercially available eye coil systems, making this approach available to more investigators. A third key advantage of magnetic eye tracking is the lack of fragile wires leading to the eye, which minimizes the difficulty of surgical implantation, greatly reducing the time required for the experimenter to learn and perform the procedure. The lack of fragile wires also extends the long-term reliability of the magnet implants. Only two out of ten mice followed for half a year after surgery had failed magnet implants, whereas the wires used for eye coil recordings often fail after several weeks following implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>; Raymond lab, unpublished observations). Improved reliability allows for larger sample sizes with less attrition, which is particularly important when using valuable transgenic mice.</p><p>A concern has been raised that the weight of an eye coil or the presence of wire leads might physically impair eye movements in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>). We found no evidence for an effect of magnet implantation on oculomotor performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, we do find that the experience and skill of the surgeon improves the outcome of both magnet and eye coil implantation surgeries in mice.</p><p>We replicated the general finding of an increase in VOR gain and decrease in OKR gain as well as an increase in VOR and OKR phase lag with stimulus frequency, which is observed across species. The gain and phase of the VOR and OKR measured with magnetic eye tracking fall within the range reported previously in mice using video and eye coil techniques, although there is considerable variability in the previously reported values, arising, at least in part, from sensitivity to the parameters of the vestibular and visual stimuli used to elicit eye movements, as well as behavioral factors related to handling and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwashita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kimpo and Raymond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tabata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Alphen et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">2010</xref>).</p><p>Magnetic eye tracking has many advantages, but also some disadvantages relative to the eye coil method. One current limitation is that the magnet-sensor configuration we used measures angular eye position about only one axis. A single axis is sufficient for many applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwashita et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimpo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Medrea and Cullen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prusky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wurtz, 1968</xref>), moreover further development to incorporate either a second sensor or a 3D magnetic field sensor should enable simultaneous measurement of eye movements along multiple axes simultaneously. A second disadvantage of magnetic eye tracking is that it requires a separate calibration device, whereas the eye coils can be calibrated by rotating the external magnetic field coils relative to the mouse. Early efforts at magnetic eye tracking employed an invasive calibration method involving physical rotation of the eye using a needle under a microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rodríguez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salas et al., 1999</xref>). We have minimized the difficulty of the calibration step by developing a rapid (&lt;10 min), accurate, noninvasive calibration procedure using an improved video-oculography method, which can be performed in awake mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dual-angle video-oculography</title><p>Standard video-oculography approaches are challenging in mice and other afoveates because of the difficulty in estimating <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic> (the distance from the plane of the pupil to the center of corneal curvature), which is typically used to determine angular eye position from video images. <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic> has been approximated as the average radius of the eye in a species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Katoh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mangini et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schwarz et al., 2013</xref>). However, this is an imperfect measure of <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic> because the curvature of the cornea is different from the rest of the eye, and because the eye does not rotate exactly about its center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>). In addition, a single <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic> value doesn’t account for variation across age, gender, genotype, or individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wisard et al., 2010</xref>). Methods have been devised for estimating <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic> in individual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zoccolan et al., 2010</xref>), but these methods extend the time the animal must be head-restrained for an experimental session. Most notably, the above methods assume that <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic> is constant over time, whereas <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic> is known to change rapidly with shifts in arousal or light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaufman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimmel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McCamy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>), which introduces inaccuracies.</p><p>Dual-angle video-oculography eliminates the need to estimate <italic>R<sub>p</sub></italic>, by calculating eye position from frame-by-frame comparison of the images from the two cameras. The result is highly linear and sufficiently accurate for the purpose of calibrating the magnetic eye tracking system. If enhanced with high-speed cameras and faster image processing, the dual-angle method could also stand alone as a powerful video-oculography technique.</p><p>Despite the improvements in video-oculography achieved by the dual-angle technique, magnetic eye tracking provides key advantages that make it preferable to video-oculography for many applications. First, the spatial resolution of magnetic eye tracking (0.1°) is superior to what has been reported for video-oculography in rodents (0.23°, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>; ~1°, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 2013</xref>), in monkeys (video resolution 2‒3 × worse than eye coil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kimmel et al. (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McCamy et al., 2015</xref>) and in humans (0.56°, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Houben et al., 2006</xref>). Second, magnetic eye tracking achieves high temporal resolution with less expense. Although some video-oculography systems can sample at 1,000 Hz, they are costly and typically sacrifice image resolution. Since the dual-angle system is used only for calibration, high-speed cameras are not required. Third, removal of the bulky video-oculography equipment after calibration allows free, unobstructed interaction of the animal with the environment during eye tracking. Technological advances have reduced the size of cameras to fit on the head of a rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 2013</xref>), but the hardware required for magnetic eye tracking is more than an order of magnitude lighter (0.05 cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.180 g total) and is therefore trivial for a mouse to carry, allowing much greater mobility than possible with video-oculography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kretschmer et al., 2017</xref>). Also, either the video cameras themselves, or the edges of infrared-reflective mirrors, are visible to the animal during video-oculography, limiting experimental control of the visual environment. Thus, magnetic eye tracking is preferable for experiments in which spatial resolution, low cost, unobstructed vision, or compatibility with free motion is a priority.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Applications</title><p>Magnetic eye tracking makes it possible to obtain reliable, high-resolution measurements of eye movements in small, freely moving animals, thereby creating new opportunities for studies of sensation, motor control, and cognition under more natural conditions. Neuroscientists are increasingly interested in studying the neural basis of behavior under conditions where the animal is free to move, particularly in rodents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Licata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kepecs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaramillo and Zador, 2014</xref>). Free motion allows animals to perform orienting movements, which are a key part of any animal’s behavioral repertoire. During visually guided behaviors, coordinated movements of the trunk, head, and eyes can direct the animal’s gaze towards relevant visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belton and McCrea, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Erlich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freedman and Sparks, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mather and Baker, 1980</xref>). Body location and head direction are routinely measured during visually guided behaviors such as navigation, and have been shown to be encoded by the activity of neurons in relevant circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fyhn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardcastle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yoder and Taube, 2009</xref>). However, the technical challenges associated with measuring eye movements have limited the analysis of gaze control in freely moving animals. Our finding of robust eye movements in freely moving mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) suggests that gaze direction deviates substantially from head direction, as previously reported in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wallace et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, gaze direction may be an additional variable represented and controlled by the relevant neural circuits.</p><p>The magnetic eye tracking system facilitates investigation of many open questions regarding the neural control of gaze, and its role in guiding the acquisition of visual information and control of visually-guided behaviors. Eye movements provide a window into many sensory, motor, and cognitive processes in healthy and diseased brains. Technical challenges have limited the application of this experimental measure in the increasingly common neuroscientific studies of freely moving rodents. Magnetic eye tracking provides a high-resolution, low cost, and easily implemented method, which can enable more investigators to capitalize on the power of eye movement analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Magnetic eye tracking and video-oculography were performed in 35 C57BL/6 mice and two hybrid C57BL/6 × 129S1/SvImJ F2 mice.

All procedures were approved by Stanford University’s Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Surgery</title><p>A plastic head post was secured to the skull with three screws and dental cement, for use in immobilizing the head. In most animals, a magnet was implanted in one or both eyes. Different magnets were assessed. Most mice were implanted with two neodymium magnets of size 0.75 × 1 mm (diameter × height, grade N50, axially magnetized, SuperMagnetMan.com), which were stacked end-to-end for a total size of 0.75 × 2 mm (weight: 6.8 mg). These magnets were coated in the biocompatible polymer parylene. The magnetic force firmly held the two magnets together, and the resulting shape is referred to as the ‘cylinder magnet’. Cylinder magnets were implanted in a single eye in 24 mice, and bilaterally in an additional seven mice. Mice were excluded from the analysis if reliable video-oculography was not possible following implantation due to scarring on the surface of the eye, or if an eye movement gain of less than 0.1 was recorded by the magnetic sensor during calibration, suggesting that the magnet-sensor alignment was inadequate. A 1.5 × 0.5 mm disc magnet was implanted in four additional mice, and performed similarly (data not shown). In pilot experiments, a smaller, 1.0 × 0.5 mm disc magnet was implanted in two mice, however, because the signals recorded using these magnets were very small (data not shown), we discontinued their use. Magnets were implanted following a procedure similar to that described previously for eye coil implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyden and Raymond, 2003</xref>). The conjunctiva was blunt dissected to form a pocket on the temporal side of the eye, slightly dorsal to the midline of the eye and anterior to the lateral rectus muscle. The magnet was inserted into this pocket using non-magnetic forceps (Dumoxel #5, FST) and the pocket was sealed shut with VetBond. To minimize any chance of obstructing or otherwise affecting vision, care was taken to implant the magnet well away from the cornea and to restrict the VetBond to the area surrounding the magnet. The cylinder magnet was implanted with the N-S axis aligned roughly perpendicular to the axis about which the eye rotates during horizontal (nasal-temporal) eye movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The disc magnet was implanted flat on the surface of the eye, with the N-S axis pointing towards the eye’s center.</p><p>An angular magnetic field sensor (HMC1512, Honeywell Inc., size: 4.8 × 5.8 mm; weight: 76 mg) was secured to the skull above the eye using dental cement anchored to the same skull screws as were used to secure the head post. The HMC1512 sensor converts the direction of an external magnetic field into an analog voltage output. The magnetic field is sensed by anisotropic magnetoresistive (AMR) elements, which change their electrical resistance according to the angle <italic>θ</italic><sub>m</sub> of an applied magnetic field. Each set of AMR elements is configured as a Wheatstone bridge to produce a differential voltage proportional to sin(2<italic>θ<sub>m</sub></italic>). The HMC1512 contains two sets of AMR elements, rotated by 45° relative to each other.</p><p>The magnetic sensor was affixed to the skull above the implanted magnet, with its surface in a plane roughly parallel to the nasal-temporal axis of the eye and to the N-S axis of the implanted magnet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This positioning allowed detection of horizontal eye movements. The sensor was positioned as close as possible to the eye (2.7 ± 0.2 mm, n = 8 mice, distance from the bottom surface of the sensor to the nasal-temporal axis defined by the two corners of the eye).</p><p>In seven mice, magnets and magnetic sensors were implanted in both eyes. To assess cross-talk between a magnet in one eye and the sensor above the opposite eye, three of these mice were first implanted with a magnet in the left eye alone, with sensors above both eyes. A magnet was later implanted in the right eye as well.</p><p>In nine mice, eye coil implantation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyden and Raymond, 2003</xref>).

Magnet angle was precisely controlled using a servo-controlled turntable (angular resolution 0.053°, standard deviation at rest), and the position of the magnet relative to the sensor was controlled with a micromanipulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Repeated measurements were performed by removing the magnet from the apparatus and then repositioning it. Signal strength was compared across magnet-sensor configurations by calculating the sensitivity of the magnetic sensor to the angular position of the magnet, in mV/°.

The head of the mouse was restrained, via the surgically implanted head post, in a natural position with the nose tilted down approximately 30° relative to the stereotaxic plane, which put the nasal-temporal axis of the eye in a roughly earth-horizontal plane. To elicit horizontal eye movements, vestibular stimuli were delivered by a servo-controlled turntable (Ideal Aerosmith, Inc.) that rotated the mouse about an earth-vertical axis. During the freely moving experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the stationary drum surrounding the animal had black and white stripes, each subtending 7° of visual angle. For OKR measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), the drum was patterned with a random checkerboard, each square colored black or white with 50% probability and subtending 3° of visual angle. The vestibular and visual stimuli had sinusoidal motion profiles, at frequencies of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, or 5 Hz, with ±10°/s peak velocity. The gain of the eye movements driven by the vestibular and visual stimuli was calculated by dividing the amplitude of a sinusoidal fit to the eye velocity response by the amplitude of the stimulus (10°/s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Magnetic sensor calibration</title><p>Magnetic eye tracking requires calibration to convert the raw voltage signals from the magnetic sensor into eye position in degrees. Calibration was performed for each mouse by comparing signals from the magnetic sensor with eye movements recorded using a dual-angle video-oculography system developed for this purpose and described below. Once calibrated, the magnetic sensor could then be used alone, without the video system, allowing for testing in complete darkness, with higher temporal resolution, and while the mouse was freely moving.</p><p>During a calibration session, video frames and magnetic sensor voltages were collected simultaneously while eye movements were elicited in awake, head-fixed mice using a sinusoidal vestibular stimulus in the light (0.5 Hz or 1 Hz, ±10°/s peak velocity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Video frames were analyzed as described below to extract horizontal eye position. The vestibular stimulus and raw voltage traces from the magnetic sensor were recorded in Spike2 (CED, Cambridge, England). An infrared LED, driven by a TTL signal generated and recorded in Spike2, delivered 30 ms flashes of light at 1 Hz during the calibration session for use in aligning video and magnet traces.</p><p>Eye position data derived from the video recordings were upsampled to match the magnetic sensor data, and then differentiated by calculating the slope in a 50 ms sliding window to obtain eye velocity. Uncalibrated magnet data were differentiated in the same manner. An automatic velocity-threshold algorithm (video threshold: 50°/s, magnet threshold: 5 mV/ms) was used to detect saccades and motion artifacts in the video and magnet data.

The procedure includes placing the mouse in the head restraint (1–2 min), positioning the video cameras (1–3 min), data collection (1–3 min), and adjustment of video-oculography software parameters (0–2 min). Once calibration was complete, the video cameras were removed from the experimental setup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of spatial resolution</title><p>To compare the spatial resolution of the magnetic eye tracking and eye coil techniques, calibrated eye position signals were recorded while the mouse was head-fixed in the light. Two-second epochs when the eye movements were minimal were selected for analysis. Spatial resolution was calculated as the standard deviation of eye position during each stationary epoch, with three epochs selected and averaged for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Magnetic eye tracking in freely moving mice</title><p>Seven mice implanted bilaterally with magnets and sensors were allowed to freely explore a 12&quot; circular arena for 10–15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The stationary arena was surrounded by a stationary, illuminated, vertically-striped drum. To quantify whether the mouse’s body was actively moving or relatively still, an overhead video acquired infrared images of the mouse in the arena. A motion index was calculated by first subtracting an average background image from all frames, and then quantifying the mean absolute difference in pixel values between each frame and the next. The resulting motion trace was smoothed with a 2 s moving average to create a motion index. The upper third of motion index values were classified as ‘Active’, and the lower third were classified as ‘Still’. Eye position variability and mean eye speed measured in both eyes of a given mouse were first averaged together before comparing the population means.</p><p>To measure head movements in freely moving mice, a lightweight (1.8 g) six degree-of-freedom inertial measurement unit (SEN-10121, Sparkfun Electronics) was attached to the mouse’s headpost with a screw. Roll, pitch, and yaw angles were converted into analog signals using an Arduino Mega (Arduino AG) and recorded simultaneously with eye position in Spike2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dual-angle video-oculography</title><p>We developed a dual-angle video-oculography system for use in calibrating the magnetic eye tracking system. This system was designed to improve upon previous video-oculography systems in terms of accuracy, cost, and speed of use. The infrared-blocking filter was removed from two web cameras (Logitech C310) and replaced with a visible light-blocking filter. Small infrared LEDs (875 nm, radiant power 20 mW, angle of half intensity 20°, TSHA4400, Digi-Key) were positioned above each camera to create two corneal reflections (CRs), one for each camera, appearing along the radius of the cornea parallel to the axis of the camera.</p><p>The dual-angle system depends on two conditions. First, the two cameras must be fixed at a known angle relative to each other, for use in the calculation below. Second, they must be equidistant from the eye, so that the images from the two cameras have the same spatial scale. To achieve these requirements, the cameras were fixed to a platform separated by an angle of 40°, with each lens equidistant (in our setup, A = 5 cm) from a small placeholder target. Correct positioning was confirmed by verifying that the image of the target was the same size in the two cameras, and appeared at the horizontal midpoint of each camera’s image. For use in mice, the placeholder target was removed, and the entire platform was positioned so that the pupil appeared roughly centered between the two CRs, to ensure that the pupil remained fully in the image when the eye rotated. The position of the platform was further adjusted so that for each camera, the CR generated by that camera’s infrared LED appeared at the center of the h camera’s image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and the camera platform was then fixed in place. This ensured that the center of the eye’s corneal curvature was close to the point at which the two camera axes intersected, thus placing each camera equidistant from the eye as required by the configuration of the platform.</p><p>The pupil was visualized by illuminating the cornea with infrared light, which causes the pupil to appear dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DiScenna et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaufman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stahl et al., 2000</xref>). Sufficient contrast of the pupil relative to the cornea was provided by the two infrared LEDs used to create the CRs. Most measurements with video-oculography were conducted with additional, visible light, which constricted the pupil sufficiently to provide a clear image of pupil boundaries. A few video-oculography experiments were conducted in low light conditions, with only the two infrared LEDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), which caused the pupil to dilate and become occluded by the eyelid. To constrict the pupil for these recordings, a single drop of 4% pilocarpine (Henry Schein, Melville, NY) was placed on the eye 3–5 min before the experiment.</p><p>Images were acquired in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA) at 30 frames per second, and were analyzed offline. The locations of the pupil center (P) and CRs in the images were extracted using modified code from OpenEyes, an open source eye tracking library (www.‌thirtysixthspan.com‌/openEyes). OpenEyes uses the Starburst algorithm to locate the pupil edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li and Parkhurst, 2006</xref>). We modified the code by employing a Hough transform, a feature extraction technique, to provide more accurate CR localization. The CRs were then masked before processing the pupil image to avoid false detection of pupil edges. Code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hpay/eyetrack">https://github.com/hpay/eyetrack</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/eyetrack">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/eyetrack</ext-link><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hpay/eyetrack">)</ext-link>.</p><p>The locations of the pupil and reference CRs in the images were used to calculate eye position by leveraging the geometry of the dual-angle setup. In each camera’s image, motion of the pupil location is due to both rotation and translation of the eye relative to the camera.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Geoffrey Schoenbaum (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Matt Gardner (Reviewer #2) and José María Delgado-García (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers and Reviewing Editor have discussed the reviews with one another and drafted a decision letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors present a novel method using magnetic sensing that allows them to track eye movement in mice. This is timely given the increasing interest and in fact implementation of visual and touchscreen based tasks in rodents.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please confirm that there are no substantial effects on vision (or discuss this potential issue) and the requirement for head restraint. While this is a general statement, it is particularly relevant with respect to the start of subsection “Surgery”.</p><p>2) Is there any issue moving into rodents with the approach outlined? Discussion of this is relevant when considering potential impact of this methodological advance.</p><p>Secondary suggestions for revision:</p><p>1) A technique's usefulness is dependent on several characteristics such as the scope of application, the necessity of a solution, its effectiveness and its ease of use. The authors' have comprehensively demonstrated its effectiveness, and the scope and need for a solution are more up to the reader to consider. Nonetheless, the authors' should provide a bit more detail on the ease of use of the technique for researchers who might be considering whether to try it. The authors' state that the daily calibration only takes a short bit of time, yet does require head-restraint. Does the calibration require the mice to be anesthetized-- we expect not, but the authors should make this explicit. It would be useful to add details on the daily calibration procedure in reference to steps and time taken for the full procedure.</p><p>2) The comparisons of eye movements on the head retrained and freely moving mice are intriguing. Is it possible that some of this additional movement could be from forces which are not generated by the eye muscles themselves such as eye movement due to acceleration of the head? Of course this would still be eye movement, but the more interesting question that the authors appear to be addressing is whether there is increased eye movement initiated by the animal, not whether the additional forces which necessarily occur during free movement cause the effect. This might be hard to address, but should be brought up due to the claims made in the paper.</p><p>3) The low frequency shifts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are puzzling. Are these due to a slow shift in gaze, a measurement artifact or something else?</p><p>4) Given the many contributions of David Robinson to the study and understanding of the oculomotor system, including the precise quantification of eye motor responses and neural organization of the system, it would be appropriate to cite this work (especially since many of the references build on Robinson's contributions).</p><p>5) Subsection “Magnetic tracking of eye movements in mice&quot; paragraph two and three. For comparative purposes with other recording systems and with other species, the gain and phase (in degrees) of evoked VOR and OKN should be quantified and represented.

While this is a general statement, it is particularly relevant with respect to the start of subsection “Surgery”.</italic> </p><p>With respect to potential effects of the implant on vision:</p><p>1) As we now indicate in the Materials and methods (subsection “Surgery”), we minimize the chance for any effect on vision by surgically implanting the magnet away from the pupil, in a pocket of the conjunctiva on the lateral portion of the eye. Notably, the magnet implantation surgery involves less manipulation of the eye than the eye coil implantation surgery that is performed in many studies of vision.</p><p>2) We now include additional data showing that visually-driven eye movements are normal in mice implanted with a magnet and sensor. First, we show that the gain and phase of the eye movements driven by combined visual and vestibular stimuli, as measured with video-oculography, are the same before vs. after magnet and sensor implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, we show that the eye movement responses to a visual (optokinetic) stimulus alone are intact after magnet and sensory implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Eye movements are a fairly sensitive behavioral measure of visual processing. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that more complex visual tasks could be affected by the magnet implantation, the observation that visually-driven eye movements are normal suggests that vision is largely intact.</p><p>With respect to the requirement for head restraint during calibration:</p><p>A major advantage of the magnetic eye tracking technique is that, once the system is calibrated, measurements of eye movements can be made without head restraint. However, as pointed out by the reviewers, head restraint is still required during the brief calibration procedure. As detailed below and in subsection “Magnetic sensor calibration” of the revised manuscript, the duration of restraint required for calibration is only 5-10 min, and the implantation of a head post for use in restraint adds minimally to the effort and invasiveness of the surgery.</p><p><italic>2) Is there any issue moving into rodents with the approach outlined? Discussion of this is relevant when considering potential impact of this methodological advance.</italic> </p><p>There are no obvious barriers to extending this technique to other species, such as rats or monkeys. A larger eye and orbit may require that the sensor be implanted farther away from the magnet, however, this should be offset by the ability to implant a larger magnet. We now include this point in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Secondary suggestions for revision:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) A technique's usefulness is dependent on several characteristics such as the scope of application, the necessity of a solution, its effectiveness and its ease of use. The authors' have comprehensively demonstrated its effectiveness, and the scope and need for a solution are more up to the reader to consider. Nonetheless, the authors' should provide a bit more detail on the ease of use of the technique for researchers who might be considering whether to try it. The authors' state that the daily calibration only takes a short bit of time, yet does require head-restraint. Does the calibration require the mice to be anesthetized-- we expect not, but the authors should make this explicit. It would be useful to add details on the daily calibration procedure in reference to steps and time taken for the full procedure.</italic> </p><p>To help potential users of the magnetic eye tracking technique assess the effort involved, we now provide additional detail about the time required for each step (subsection “Magnetic sensor calibration”). The calibration procedure includes placing the mouse in the head restraint (1 minute), positioning the video cameras (1-3 minutes), calibration data collection (1-3 minutes), and adjustment of video-oculography parameters (0-2 minutes). Overall, the calibration procedure adds less than 10 minutes to an experiment.</p><p>We also clarify that calibration does not involve subjecting the mice to anesthesia, by adding the word “awake” to the calibration description.</p><p>Finally, we note in the description of the implant surgery (subsection “Surgery”) that the addition of a headpost for the purpose of head restraint is a minor additional step during surgery. Anchoring the magnetic sensor directly to the skull using dental cement achieved the most stable recordings, so some form of skull implant is necessary-- adding a head post in addition to the sensor doesn’t increase the invasiveness of the procedure.</p><p><italic>2) The comparisons of eye movements on the head retrained and freely moving mice are intriguing. Is it possible that some of this additional movement could be from forces which are not generated by the eye muscles themselves such as eye movement due to acceleration of the head? Of course this would still be eye movement, but the more interesting question that the authors appear to be addressing is whether there is increased eye movement initiated by the animal, not whether the additional forces which necessarily occur during free movement cause the effect. This might be hard to address, but should be brought up due to the claims made in the paper.</italic> </p><p>The magnetic eye tracking technique opens up the opportunity to study this and many other questions about the control of eye movements, as indicated in the Discussion (subsection “Applications”). In the present manuscript, our primary goal was to introduce and validate this new measurement technique, and to illustrate its potential for addressing the many open questions about eye movements in freely moving animals. As such, our study was not designed to address the specific question of how the passive properties of the eye plant contribute to eye movements in freely moving mice. However, we have measured eye movements during head acceleration in anesthetized animals (unpublished observations), and see little eye movement response. Hence, we expect that the eye movements observed in freely moving mice are, to a great extent, actively driven by neural commands to the eye muscles.</p><p><italic>3) The low frequency shifts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are puzzling. Are these due to a slow shift in gaze, a measurement artifact or something else?</italic> </p><p>These low frequency shifts in eye position are not a measurement artifact, nor are they unique to measurements made with the magnetic eye tracking technique. Slow shifts in eye position are well documented in the oculomotor literature and are observed across species (Stahl, 2004; Koekkoek et al., 1997; Stahl and Thumser, 2014; Tan and Collewijn, 1991). Importantly, this drift is observed in studies that use the noninvasive video-oculography technique to measure eye movements (Stahl, 2004; Koekkoek et al., 1997), so is not a measurement artifact of the magnetic eye tracking system (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>The signals controlling eye position are actively generated by the oculomotor circuitry. The “oculomotor integrator”, which holds the eyes at eccentric positions, is not a perfect integrator, hence the eyes tend to drift back toward null position. In mice, the oculomotor integrator has a short time constant, hence, drift is more pronounced (van Alphen et al., 2001). In the dark, this drift is also more pronounced because it is not opposed by visual feedback.</p><p>To avoid distracting the reader with this point, which is an important issue in oculomotor control, but is independent of the techniques used to measure eye movements, which are the focus of this manuscript, we have replaced some of the example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> with traces that exhibit less position drift (still all from the same mouse).</p><p><italic>4) Given the many contributions of David Robinson to the study and understanding of the oculomotor system, including the precise quantification of eye motor responses and neural organization of the system, it would be appropriate to cite this work (especially since many of the references build on Robinson's contributions).</italic> </p><p>We agree that the work of David Robinson has laid the foundation for quantitative analyses of the oculomotor system, and we have added another reference to his work.</p><p><italic>5) Subsection “Magnetic tracking of eye movements in mice “paragraph two and three. For comparative purposes with other recording systems and with other species, the gain and phase (in degrees) of evoked VOR and OKN should be quantified and represented. Indicating that &quot;the magnetic sensor detected robust eye movements&quot; is not enough!</italic> </p><p>We did not quantify the gain and phase of the VOR and optokinetic response (OKR) at this specific point in the text, because we had not yet described the calibration procedure, which is necessary to calculate the gain. The example traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are included to provide motivation for the development of the video calibration system. After describing the calibration procedure, we now quantify the gain and phase of the VOR measured with magnetic eye tracking in a population of mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (blue, dashed lines). Moreover, we have conducted additional experiments to quantify the gain and phase of the OKR in a population of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The gain and phase we measured with magnetic eye tracking at frequencies from 0.2 Hz to 5 Hz is in the range reported previously by our lab and other labs using the video or eye coil techniques (Iwashita et al., 2001; van Alphen et al., 2001; Kimpo and Raymond, 2007), although the VOR and OKR gain and phase have been shown to vary considerably with factors such as the spatial and temporal frequency, amplitude, and contrast of the vestibular and visual stimuli used to elicit the eye movement responses.</p><p><italic>6) Subsection “Calibration of magnetic eye tracking using dual-angle video-oculography&quot; paragraph four. The system seems to be suitable for horizontal eye movements, but what about the vertical component? The point is that eye movements in a free moving mouse will probably be the result of angular (horizontal + vertical) eye movements.</italic> </p><p>The control of eye movements is organized largely along three orthogonal axes (horizontal eye movements about an earth vertical axis and vertical eye movements about two earth horizontal axes, oriented at 45° and 135° relative to the midsagittal plane). Many oculomotor labs, including ours, have focused on the neural signals controlling eye movements along a single axis. It should be trivial to measure eye movements along a different axis (vertical vs. horizontal) by rotating the magnet and sensor positions. With additional technical development, incorporating either a second sensor or a 3D magnetic field sensor, it also should be possible to measure eye movements along multiple axes simultaneously, as mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Please provide information regarding gain and phase (in degrees) of recorded eye reflexes.</italic> </p><p>We report quantitative information regarding the gain and phase of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the visually enhanced VOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the optokinetic response (OKR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) for a range of stimulus frequencies.</p><p><italic>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6. A</xref> comparison with previous description of gain and phase (expressed in degrees) in mice would be appropriate.</italic> </p><p>There is considerable variability in previous reports of the gain and phase of the VOR and OKR in mice, measured with eye coil (van Alphen et al., 2001; Kimpo and Raymond, 2007) or video (Iwashita et al., 2001; van Alphen et al., 2010; van Alphen et al., 2009; Tabata et al., 2010) techniques. These values are known to depend on parameters of the vestibular and visual stimuli, including temporal frequency, amplitude, and visual stimulus spatial frequency and contrast, as well as the age and gender of the animals. It is likely that additional behavioral variables related to handling, stress, and experience of the mouse also affect the eye movement responses. The values we measure with the magnetic eye tracking and video techniques fall within the range reported previously with video and eye coil methods. Moreover, there are certain consistencies across all studies, including an increase in VOR gain and decrease in OKR gain, plus an increase in VOR and OKR phase lag with stimulus frequency, which we also observe with magnetic eye tracking. We now include a brief discussion of this in the final paragraph of subsection “Linearity and spatial resolution of the magnetic eye tracking system”.</p><p><italic>9) One reviewer stated, &quot;I think that Vetbond is not indicated for a direct contact with the eye.&quot;</italic> </p><p>Cyanoacrylate has been safely used on the eye in humans (Lal et al., 2015), rabbits (Ollivier et al., 2001), dogs (Fridman et al., 2010), chickens (Carey et al., 1996) and mice (Boyden and Raymond, 2003). It was approved by our IACUC for use in magnetic eye tracking. Care is taken to restrict application of VetBond to only the pocket in the conjunctiva immediately surrounding the magnet, and we have observed no significant adverse effects. We have added a line about this to the Materials and methods.
