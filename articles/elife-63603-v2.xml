This behavior enables the expansion of epithelial tissues during organismal growth without compromising the barrier function created by intercellular junctions. Importantly, however, proliferation is not indefinite but terminates at a preset cell density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fomicheva et al., 2020</xref>). Stretching or wounding an epithelial sheet, which reduces the cell density, can reinitiate cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aragona et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, compression, which increases density, can result in extrusion and apoptosis of cells so as to bring the epithelial layer back to its homeostatic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>). This control mechanism that prevents tissue overgrowth is essential for normal development, and it is lost in hyperplasia and in cancer. However, the mechanisms that underlie homeostatic cell density maintenance remain incompletely understood.</p><p>One system through which epithelial cells can respond to changes in density is the Hippo pathway and its effectors YAP and TAZ. These transcriptional co-activators are nuclear at low cell density or under conditions of high mechanical strain, but become phosphorylated and are cytoplasmic (or junction-associated) and nonfunctional at high density and/or low strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>). Independently of YAP/TAZ, however, the polarity proteins LGL1/2 can also control density-dependent proliferation by inhibiting proteasomal degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CKI) CDKN1B (p27). Loss of LGL1/2 reduces the expression of p27, which is often upregulated at high cell density to arrest proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>). Numerous studies on Hippo/YAP have demonstrated the complexity of this pathway, and several novel Hippo pathway components have been revealed over the past few years. In addition, as mentioned previously, Hippo-independent mechanisms have also been recently reported, such as the LGL/p27 pathway. It is, therefore, likely that other Hippo pathway components and/or currently unknown Hippo-independent signaling mechanisms exist; however, no strategy has been designed to identify such mechanisms.</p><p>With the goal of discovering novel factors that regulate epithelial homeostasis, we developed a powerful new assay based on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) approach that we integrated with a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 sgRNA knockout (KO) screen to select for genes that are essential for cell cycle arrest at high density, but which do not impact proliferation of cells below the threshold for arrest. The screen employs a fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) system to mark proliferating cells in S/G2/M phases of cell cycle with a green fluorescent protein, and cells in G1/G0 with a red fluorescent protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sladitschek and Neveu, 2015</xref>). We found that mammary EpH4 epithelial cells robustly arrest in G1 or G0 by 4 days post-confluency. When these cells were transduced with a pooled whole-genome CRISPR KO library, and then sorted 4 days post-confluencyfor cycling cells, we identified several candidate genes that may regulate cell density-dependent proliferation activity. The top hit was <italic>Nf2</italic> (also called <italic>Merlin</italic>), a known tumor suppressor that negatively regulates YAP/TAZ, which validated our approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petrilli and Fernández-Valle, 2016</xref>). A second, unexpected hit was <italic>Traf3</italic>, a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling, which has never previously been reported to regulate cell density-dependent proliferation. We demonstrate that loss of <italic>Traf3</italic> robustly and specifically activates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway. This in turn triggers an innate immune response and cell autonomously drives cell division independently of both YAP/TAZ signaling and CKIs, overriding these classical mechanisms of density-dependent proliferation control and preventing cells at high density from entering quiescence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A FUCCI-based screen for density-dependent cell cycle arrest</title><p>Our goal was to design a screen for the rapid and efficient selection of epithelial cells that continue to proliferate inappropriately at high cell density. For the screen, we needed to identify a cell line that retained epithelial features, including homeostatic density control. We chose the murine EpH4 mammary epithelial cell line for this screen, because EpH4 cells are highly polarized, form confluent epithelial sheets, and, most importantly, we confirmed that they efficiently arrest at high density. We also needed a tool to specifically identify and select cells that maintain proliferative activity at high density. To distinguish cycling from non-cycling cells, we established a stable EpH4 line that expresses ES-FUCCI, which labels cells in G1/G0 with mCherry and cells in S/G2/M with mCitrine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sladitschek and Neveu, 2015</xref>). As expected, the EpH4-FUCCI cells remain proliferative at 1 day post-confluency but very few cells cycle at high density, with only about 1% of cells expressing mCitrine at 4 days post-confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Whole-genome screening for genes that inhibit proliferation at homeostatic cell density.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI) color transitions through cell cycle.

To test this concept, we used a shRNA lentiviral construct to deplete the CKI <italic>p27</italic>, which is known to be associated with cell cycle arrest post-confluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>). Quantitative PCR for the <italic>p27</italic> transcript showed that ~60% of <italic>p27</italic> mRNA was lost in cells expressing the <italic>p27</italic> shRNA compared to EpH4-FUCCI cells expressing scrambled shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The p27-depleted cells display increased cell proliferation after 4 days post-confluency in contrast to cells expressing scrambled shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As a proof-of-principle experiment, we next mixed wild-type (WT) EpH4-FUCCI cells and sh-<italic>p27</italic> EpH4-FUCCI cells at a 10:1 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The mixed cells were then plated at a cell density of 100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup>, such that they reached confluency 24 hr after seeding. We grew the mixture of cells for 4 days post-confluency and sorted mCitrine-positive (mCitrine+) cells by FACS. After sorting, we isolated genomic DNA (gDNA) and performed qPCR using primers against the puromycin gene, located in the lentiviral plasmid insert, to assess the fraction of p27-depleted cells in the cell mixture. We observed an average of 1.4× and 3.5× enrichment of the puromycin gene after the first and second rounds of sorting, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data support the validity of our screen design.</p><p>Based on these encouraging results, we proceeded to developing an EpH4-FUCCI cell line, in which every cell has lost a single gene. We transduced EpH4-FUCCI cells with the pooled GeCKO CRISPR v2 KO lentivirus library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The library contains six sgRNAs against each of 20,611 genes, plus 1000 non-targeting controls, for a total of 130,209 sgRNAs. To ensure that our EpH4-FUCCI cells would receive only one sgRNA on average, we transduced cells with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.3. It is critical to maintain a large enough cell population to ensure that all sgRNAs in the library are retained. Therefore, we aimed to have 150–300 cells per sgRNA in each step of the screen. Based on these values, 6.7 × 10<sup>7</sup> EpH4-FUCCI cells were transduced to obtain about 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells that had acquired viruses (~150 cells per sgRNA). Cells that were not infected with virus were eliminated by puromycin selection. We plated the cells at 100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and grew them for 4 days post-confluency. To maintain library representation, we sorted 4 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells (300 cells per sgRNA) by FACS to select mCitrine+ cells. We re-grew cells for the next round of selection and for gDNA isolation. In total, we performed three FAC sorts. We observed a steady increase in the number of mCitrine+ cells after each round of FACS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). gDNA was purified, and integrated sgRNA cassettes were amplified from the DNA by PCR, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shalem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). A second PCR reaction attached Illumina index primers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>), and the pooled product was then sequenced.</p><p>We used the MAGeCK program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Li et al., 2014</xref>) to map sequencing reads to the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D and D’</xref>). Read count distribution was relatively uniform in the control (unsorted) sample, with depletion of those sgRNAs that target essential genes. After each round of selection, more sgRNAs were depleted, but a small portion of sgRNAs was highly enriched. We utilized the MAGeCK algorithm to find genes that were enriched after sorts compared to control. MAGeCK takes into account changes in the abundance of all sgRNAs targeting a single gene, measured by the robust ranking aggregation (RRA) score. The most enriched genes have the smallest RRA scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E and E’</xref>). We selected genes with FDR below 0.25 and with three or more sgRNAs/gene selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F and F’</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The CRISPR screen identifies a component of the Hippo pathway, a lymphocyte proliferation control factor, and NEDD8-conjugating E2 enzyme</title><p>Interestingly, the top enriched target was <italic>Nf2/Merlin</italic>, which is a known tumor suppressor gene and a regulator of Hippo signaling necessary for cell density control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petrilli and Fernández-Valle, 2016</xref>).

UBE2M is a NEDD8 conjugation E2 enzyme, which neddylates CULLIN-RING ligases to stimulate their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lydeard et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, stress induces UBE2M expression and promotes its ubiquitylation of UBE2F, the degradation of which can suppress cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that loss of our top candidates indeed results in over-proliferation at high density, we developed two new sgRNA CRISPR v2 plasmids per gene. The sgRNA sequences were different from those in the GeCKO library. We transduced EpH4 cells with these sgRNA lentiviruses and confirmed efficient KO of each gene by immunoblotting for NF2, TRAF3, and UBE2M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C’</xref>). To test if loss of the target genes leads to a failure in cell cycle arrest at high density, we analyzed BrdU incorporation at 1 and 4 days post-confluency. BrdU was added to cells for 1 hr, then cells were fixed and stained. When cells had just reached a confluent state, we found that BrdU incorporation was similar for the non-targeted sgRNA control (NT) and each of the KO cell lines, but that at high density the KO cells incorporated more BrdU than did the NT control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These differences were statistically significant at high density, as determined by cytometric analysis of BrdU+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Together, these data demonstrate that our screen successfully identified genes that are essential for the restriction of proliferation at high cell density.

We hypothesized that TRAF3 might be involved in the same pathways as in blood cells, where it negatively regulates both the canonical and noncanonical NF-κB pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ramakrishnan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zarnegar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun, 2017</xref>). In the noncanonical pathway, TRAF3 constitutively promotes proteasomal degradation of MAP3K14 (NIK), a kinase that is essential for activation of the downstream signaling cascade. Ligand recruitment to an upstream receptor triggers TRAF3 poly-ubiquitinylation and degradation. As a result, NIK levels increase, and it phosphorylates its downstream target IKKα, which in turn phosphorylates NFKB2 (p100). Phosphorylated p100 is partially degraded to p52, which enters the nucleus in association with RELB and regulates the transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sun, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To test if loss of TRAF3 activates noncanonical NF-κB signaling, we examined the location of RELB in control and TRAF3 KO EpH4 cells and primary mammary gland organoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). As expected, RELB was predominantly cytoplasmic in control cells and organoids. However, loss of TRAF3 caused a substantial nuclear accumulation, indicative of noncanonical NF-κB activation. We also performed immunoblotting for noncanonical NF-κB signaling components in control and TRAF3 KO cells at 1 and 4 days post-confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). TRAF3 KO cells at both 1 and 4 days post-confluency had substantially increased NIK levels and enhanced processing of p100 to p52 compared to NT control cells. However, cell density differences had no impact on NIK, RELB, TRAF3, and p100/p52 protein levels. Therefore, TRAF3 KO leads to activation of noncanonical NF-κB signaling, but regulation of these pathway components is independent of cell density.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Loss of TRAF3 specifically activates noncanonical but not canonical NF-κB pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Simplified schematic of noncanonical NF-κB pathway.

Through this mechanism loss of TRAF3 should give a proliferative advantage to cells not only at high density but also under other challenging conditions, such as starvation, that also promote entry into G0. To test this idea, we grew NT and TRAF3 KO cells in normal medium or medium devoid of FBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We observed no difference in proliferation between NT and TRAF3 KO cells in normal medium after 1 day post-confluency. However, starvation decreased proliferation in control cells but not in TRAF3 KO cells. These data suggest that loss of TRAF3 prevents cells from entering G0.</p><p>To further explore this possibility, we labeled control and TRAF3 KO cells with markers to differentiate quiescent and cycling cells. Cells exiting the cell cycle and entering G0 are known to have very low CDK2 activity. To determine if loss of TRAF3 prevents entry into G0, we used a previously validated biosensor, DHB-mVenus, which can quantitatively reveal CDK2 activity in live cells based on its distribution between the nucleus (G0/G1) and cytoplasm (G2/M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gookin et al., 2017</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>, at high density control cells enter quiescence, with almost exclusive nuclear localization of the biosensor. In contrast, cells lacking TRAF3 show an increased percent of cytoplasmic DHB-mVenus localization at high density, consistent with them continuing in cycle instead of entering quiescence.</p><p>Finally, we stained the cells for phospho-RB (Ser807/811). The retinoblastoma protein is a central regulator of the cell cycle and becomes dephosphorylated in G0, but is progressively phosphorylated and inactivated as cells leave G0 and move through G1 into S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spencer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gookin et al., 2017</xref>). RB phosphorylation was very low in NT control at high density but loss of TRAF3 induced a dramatic increase in phospho-RB positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and G</xref>). Together, these data strongly argue that the key effect of loss of TRAF3 is a failure to enter G0 under conditions that normally promote quiescence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Epithelial cells possess intrinsic mechanisms to achieve and maintain an appropriate cell density, which is essential for normal tissue morphogenesis and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fomicheva et al., 2020</xref>). Mechanisms of homeostatic cell density establishment are not fully understood. One of the most recognized pathways controlling cell density-dependent proliferation is the Hippo/YAP signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>). However, there are other mechanisms that control cell density independently from Hippo/YAP; for instance, LGL1/2 controls p27 levels in a density-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>). With the goal of identifying novel components that control homeostatic cell density, we used an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR KO screen, in which we selected for cells that over-proliferate at high density. We uncovered a known (NF2) and two novel (TRAF3 and UBE2M) regulators of epithelial cell density. Loss of any of these genes results in increased cell proliferation at high density and multilayering of cells; however, proliferation at low cell density remains unaltered.</p><p>TRAF3 was of particular interest because this protein is essential for blood cell expansion and regulation of the immune response, but its functions in other tissues still remain unclear, although it is ubiquitously expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yue et al., 2014</xref>). We discovered that loss of TRAF3 results in cell overgrowth in both mouse and human mammary gland cell lines, and mesenchymal cells (NIH 3T3 fibroblasts) as well as in primary mouse mammary gland organoids. We interrogated the mechanism of TRAF3-dependent proliferation control in mammary gland epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and found that loss of TRAF3 specifically activates the noncanonical branch of NF-κB signaling, while having no effect on canonical NF-κB signaling. We further discovered that the noncanonical pathway is necessary for over-proliferation at high density in cells lacking TRAF3.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for the role of TRAF3 in density-dependent proliferation.</title><p>Cells at high density rarely proliferate (on the left). They have active Hippo signaling (YAP is cytoplasmic), inactive canonical NF-κB (p65/p50 is cytoplasmic) and inactive noncanonical NF-κB signaling (NIK is low, p100 is not processed to p52, and RELB is cytoplasmic). Upon loss of TRAF3, Hippo and canonical NF-κB signaling remain unaltered, but noncanonical NF-κB signaling is activated (on the right). NIK levels rise in the absence of TRAF3, activates the downstream cascade, resulting in increased p100 processing to p52. The RELB/p52 complex activates innate immune response genes, including antigen presentation and interferon pathway components. It also overrides CKIs, induces CYCLIN D1 expression, and prevents entering G0 as shown by increased number of cells with active CDK2 and phosphorylated RB. Altogether it results in cell over-proliferation at high density.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63603-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our RNAseq data revealed that loss of TRAF3 does not induce the transcription of classical proliferation pathway components, including YAP/TAZ, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, TGF-β, and WNT signaling. We also demonstrated that over-proliferation caused by loss of TRAF3 is cell autonomous, as control cells did not over-proliferate when co-cultured with TRAF3 KO cells. Together, these data suggest that noncanonical NF-κB signaling does not positively drive proliferation but instead suppresses the ability of cells to exit the cell cycle. One key exit mechanism operates through induction of CKIs. For instance, in some epithelial cells p27 levels increase with density and high levels of p27 inhibit cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>). However, we found no differences in levels of p27 or other CKIs (p21, p19, and p18) in cells lacking TRAF3 versus control EpH4 cells, although p21 levels do increase with increased cell density. Therefore, either EpH4 cells do not respond to CKIs or constitutive activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway overrides CKI-mediated cell cycle exit. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that loss of TRAF3 prevents cells from entering quiescent state G0 as shown by increased CDK2 activity and RB phosphorylation.</p><p>RNAseq analysis revealed that loss of TRAF3 leads to the activation of immune response pathways, at least in part through noncanonical NF-κB signaling. Activated genes include antigen presentation, interferon response pathways, and genes responsible for foreign DNA and RNA recognition. Expression of these genes was reduced when p100 was deleted in theTRAF3 KO cells. However, certain genes induced in the TRAF3 KO cells, including adhesion molecules, superoxide-producing enzymes, and chemokines, were not reduced by deletion of p100. These data reveal that a mechanism independent of noncanonical NF-κB signaling can drive gene expression responses activated by loss of TRAF3.</p><p>The literature suggests that the loss or reduction of <italic>Traf3</italic> expression or activation of noncanonical NF-κB signaling might be important for hyperplasia in response to infection or contribute to cancer development. It is known that epithelial cells can respond to infection by mounting an innate immune response. The noncanonical NF-κB pathway can be activated by contact with pathogens, and bronchial, intestinal, and mammary gland epithelia can each express a variety of innate immune factors that protect the organisms against infectious agents and attract immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Strandberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Philpott et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic>, a bacterium associated with the development of gastritis and gastric cancer, activates noncanonical NF-κB signaling in a stomach epithelial cell line and in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-associated gastritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feige et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, activation of the noncanonical NF-κB pathway in response to infection correlates with hyperplasia of the ear mucosa following otitis infection, although the mechanism was not investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cho et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As discussed above, <italic>Traf3</italic> is mutated, though at low frequency, in different cancers of epithelial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>), and low expression is associated with worse outcomes.

Library lentiviruses were produced as described below. EpH4-FUCCI cells transduced with the library were grown for 10 days to allow time for gene-editing and depletion of the target proteins. The cells were then seeded at 100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and cultured for 4 days, then trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco) and 4 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells (about 300 cells per sgRNA) were sorted on a FACSAria III for mCitrine+ (proliferating) cells. This population was replated, expanded, and resorted for mCitrine+ cells. This process was repeated for a total of three sorts. Genomic DNA from 4 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells before sorting, and after the first, second, and third rounds of sorting was purified using Blood and Cell Culture DNA Midi Kit (Qiagen). The sgRNA sequences were PCR amplified (26 × 100 μl reactions) from genomic DNA (~260 μg) using adaptor primers developed by the Zhang laboratory. The products of the first PCR reactions were amplified again with Illumina index primers to add barcodes and Illumina adaptors.

HEK293T, MCF10a, and NIH 3T3 were obtained from the ATCC. Cells are routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination by Hoechst DNA staining, and all were found to be negative. EpH4, NIH 3T3, and HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). MCF10a cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 media (Gibco) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Gibco), EGF 20 ng/ml (Sigma), hydrocortisone 0.5 mg/ml (Sigma), cholera toxin 100 ng/ml (MP Biomedicals), insulin 10 μg/ml (Sigma), and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies). EpH4 cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and cultured for 1 or 4 days. MCF10a cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> and cultured for 5 days. Lentiviruses were produced by calcium phosphate transfection of HEK293T cells with lentivectors and lentiviral packaging vectors psPAX2 and pMD2.G. Lentiviruses were collected and concentrated 48 hr after transduction, utilizing Amicon centrifugal filter units. EpH4 and MCF10a cells were transduced by lentiviruses by shaking cells and viruses in suspension at 400 rpm, 37°C for 1 hr. Transduced cells were selected by puromycin (CRISPR v2 vectors) or FACS (pWPI mScarlet, pLVTHM GFP, and DHB-mVenus vectors).

proliferation from a cell-based CRISPR screen. The authors further show that loss of Traf3 specifically activates non-canonical NF-κB signaling, which in turn triggers an innate immune response and drives cell division independently of known density-dependent proliferation mechanisms, including YAP/TAZ signaling and cyclin kinase inhibitors.

Several key issues should be clarified to further strengthen the manuscript as follows:</p><p>Major points</p><p>1) It has been known that unlike other Traf family members, Traf3 plays an essential role in regulating the noncanonical NF-κB activity in vivo and in vivo, which has been studies in other systems (such as J Biol Chem. 2007 Feb 9;282(6):3688-94). That's being said, mechanism novelty is less empowered.</p></disp-quote><p>We were aware that the function of TRAF3 as a negative regulator of non-canonical NFκB signaling is well known, but the novelty of our study concerns the impact of this pathway on density-dependent cell proliferation, which we believe to be novel and unexpected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The largest part of manuscript heavily relies on the EpH4 cell line including the CRISPR screen, validation and mechanism study. Although human MCF10A and primary mouse organelles were used to confirm the phenotype, it is still not quite clear whether the phenotype presented here is specific to epithelial cells. More cell lines and control cell lines should be included to clarify this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and in response we have knocked out <italic>Traf3</italic> in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, as an example of a non-epithelial cell line. We observed that TRAF3 KO 3T3 cells lose contact inhibition and over-proliferate in dense monolayers, compared to control (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D’).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It's interesting such screening did not identify typical tumor suppressors such as Trp53. I then realize that EpH4 is an immortalized mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line (Fialka et al., 1996), which may undergo selective deletion or mutation of Trp53 or Rb1. If so, the dispensable role of cyclin kinase inhibitors is expected. Authors should characterize the cell line. Again, as stated in 2#, more cell lines and controls should be validated.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell cycle arrest at high density is not normally controlled by Trp53, so it is unsurprising that this gene did not show up in our screen. Although the EpH4 cell might not contain functional p53, we confirmed the over-proliferation phenotype and activation of noncanonical NF-κB in primary mammary gland organoids. This result demonstrates that the response is not dependent on mutant p53.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I will not recommend the tone of &quot;Epithelial Homeostasis&quot; given the entire study is based on pure cell culture work unless in vivo data could be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have changed the title to avoid the term “epithelial homeostasis”. However, we discuss homeostatic cell density control in the text of the manuscript because this term is not specific to in vivo situations but describes a collective cell behavior that is also observed in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) It will be helpful to include a schematic diagram of FUCCI vector and working model in Figure 1A to keep readers who do not have related background to follow the design.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have included a schematic of FUCCI in Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) P value should be provided between groups in Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not provide a p value because this was a single representative experiment with 3 technical repeats, just used as a proof-of-principle experiment.

The authors either choose to employ stress model, or independent cells with optimal test window. Point 3# targeted on the same mechanism concern, which would benefit from additional experiment underlying whether cIAP inhibition by a SMAC-mimetic exert the same effect as TRAF3 KO</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Fomicheva and Macara designed a CRISPR/Cas9 screen that allows the identification of genes functioning as negative regulators of density-controlled cell cycle in epithelial cells. They found that loss of TRAF3 prevents epithelial cells from halting division at high density. By increasing expression of NIK, TRAF3 ablation induces p100/p52 processing and non-canonical NF-κB signaling in epithelial cells. By generating TRAF3/NIK or TRAF3/p100 DKO cells, they demonstrate that non-canonical NF-κB activation is mediating loss of cell density control upon ablation of TRAF3. The authors present data that exclude autocrine/paracrine activation, involvement of the Hippo pathway or deregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKI) as mechanisms for loss of density control in TRAF3 KO epithelial cells.</p><p>The paper describes a very interesting strategy for identifying negative regulators of cell density control and it provides a new link to non-canonical NF-κB. Technically, the manuscript is very good and the DKOs make a strong link between uncontrolled proliferation upon TRAF3 loss and non-canonical NF-κB activation. However, the functional role of TRAF3 and activation of non-canonical NF-κB remains unresolved. Further, I think the data are not convincingly showing that TRAF3 is selectively affecting epithelial homeostasis by loss or cell density-dependent cell cycle arrest. Thus, the authors need to address the following questions and concerns:</p><p>Major points</p><p>1) The authors suggest that the TRAF3-NIK-IKKa-p100/p52 axis is selectively regulating density-controlled cell proliferation, but I think the data are not strong enough to support this conclusion. The only data set that supports this conclusion is presented in Figure 2D – F, showing that Brdu incorporation in rapidly cycling low density cells is not enhanced by TRAF3 KO. However, while 50% of the cells are Brdu-positive at low density, only 5% are Brdu-positive at high density. Thus, there is hardly any window to enhance proliferation of fast dividing cells and TRAF3 could simply limit proliferation under restrictive conditions. Thus, the authors should determine if loss of TRAF3 enhances proliferation after serum reduction/withdrawal or other conditions of nutrient restriction. Further, it needs to be addressed if p100 and NIK loss is affecting rapidly dividing cells at low density (low or high serum). Cell cycle analyses by FACS should be performed to clearly determine at what stage of the cell cycle TRAF3 and non-canonical NF-κB are blocking/promoting cell cycle progression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have performed serum withdrawal experiments. Serum starvation causes significant reduction in proliferation in NT control cells but not in TRAF3 KO cells (Figure 8C).</p><p>Regarding the suggestion that flow cytometry be used to determine what stage of the cell cycle is impacted, we already know from the FUCCI data that at high density the cells are predominantly in G0/G1. When Traf3 is knocked out, some of these cells exit quiescence and enter the cell cycle. We are unclear what additional information flow cytometry would provide. However, we have now tested whether the control cells are actually in G0 and if loss of Traf3 blocks entry into G0. We demonstrated this to be the case through use of a live cell CDK2 biosensor, DHB-mVenus, and by staining with antiphospho-Rb (Ser807/811) (new Figure 8). These data are explained in more detail below</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors state that “… TRAF3 roles in epithelial cells has not been widely investigated….” This may be true, but there is quite an extensive literature on the role of non-canonical NF-κB in epithelial cells and also its role in cell cycle progression through the induction of cyclin D1 during G1-S phase transition (see Demicco et al., 2005, Park et al., 2006, Rocha et al., 2003, Zhang et al., 2007, Cao et al., 2001, and PMID16713561, 11713278, 20420878). My best explanation would be that p52, potentially in concert with BCL3, is inducing D-type cyclins and enforcing G1/S phase transition. This needs to be tested and it needs to be investigated if this regulation is cell density-dependent (see point 1).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We tested if TRAF3 KO cells have changes in CYCLIN D1 levels by immunofluorescent staining. Quantifications of CYCLIN D1 intensity showed modest but significant increase of CYCLIN D1 in TRAF3 KO cells (Figure 8A, B). As mentioned above, we also tested whether the loss of TRAF3 prevents cells at high density from entering G0. Cells exiting the cell cycle and entering G0 are known to have very low CDK2 activity, and to determine if loss of TRAF3 prevents entry into G0, we used a previously validated biosensor, DHB-mVenus, which can quantitatively reveal CDK2 activity in live cells based on its distribution between the nucleus (G0/G1) and cytoplasm (G2/M) (new Figure 8D). As shown in new Figure 8E and G, at high density control cells enter quiescence, with almost exclusive nuclear localization of the biosensor. In contrast, cells lacking TRAF3 show an increased percent of cytoplasmic DHB-mVenus localization at high density, consistent with them continuing in cycle instead of entering quiescence.</p><p>Additionally, we stained the cells for phospho-Rb (Ser807/811). The retinoblastoma protein is a central regulator of the cell cycle, and becomes dephosphorylated in G0, but is progressively phosphorylated and inactivated as cells leave G0 and move through G1 into S phase (Figure 8D). Rb phosphorylation was very low in NT control at high density but loss of TRAF3 induced a dramatic increase in phospho-Rb positive cells (new Figure 8E, F). Together, these data strongly argue that the key effect of loss of TRAF3 is a failure to enter G0 under conditions that normally promote quiescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Even though TRAF3 KO relieves cell density control, it remains unclear how the system would be regulated under physiological conditions. Is TRAF3 expression induced at high density? How are the TRAF3 interactors TRAF2 and cIAP1/2 regulated? Does cIAP inhibition by a SMAC-mimetic exert the same effect as TRAF3 KO? SMAC-mimetics deplete cIAP1/2 rapidly and thus effects could be determined at low density or after epithelial cells have been grown to high density.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not examined <italic>TRAF2</italic> or cIAP1/2. We did perform western blots for canonical and non-canonical NF-κB components at high and low density. We observed that levels of non-canonical NF-κB signaling proteins are independent of density. Immunoblotting for the canonical NF-κB pathway components showed activation of IKKα/β phosphorylation at high density both in control and TRAF3 KO cells; but no increase in p65 phosphorylation or IκB degradation was observed in control and TRAF3 KO cells either at low or at high density.</p><p>We have also added data on the effect of cIAP inhibition by a SMAC-mimetic BV6 at low and high density. BV6 caused over-proliferation of EpH4 cells at high density but not at low density (New Figure 5H, I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points:</p><p>The short summary on the putative functions of TRAF3 is rather incomprehensive and not very helpful here.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this section of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: What is the effect of an NF2 KO in primary mammary organoids?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not focused on NF2 in our study because NF2 was previously shown to inhibit cell overgrowth through its regulation of HIPPO signaling. Therefore, we do not believe that knocking out NF2 in the organoids would be relevant to this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: It is well established that TRAF3 is primarily regulating non-canonical NF-κB signaling, but this may exert secondary effects on canonical NF-κB. Actually, the enhanced expression of IkBa indicates that the canonical NF-κB inhibitor may be transcriptionally induced by RelB/p52. As shown for p100/p52 in Figure 4G, the authors should provide a more comprehensive analyses of NFkB/IkB family members (e.g. p65, RelB, p100/p50, IkBa), their activity (p-p65, pIkBa) and some upstream regulators (such as IKKa/b, TRAF3, TRAF2 – see also main point 3), to get a conclusive picture on the impact of TRAF3 loss under low and high density.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree but do not detect any activation of canonical NF-κB signaling, as we show in Figure 4 G. We have now also added Western blots for NF-κB components at high and low cell density (Figure 4D, E, H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6. I think by sorting mCherry G0/G1 phase for transcriptomic analyses, the authors may have unintentionally sorted out the relevant candidate genes from their analyses, such as D- or E-type cyclins, which are induced for G1-S phase transition.</p></disp-quote><p>Because cells lacking Traf3 are more likely to enter the cell cycle at high density, then we would fully expect there to be all the expected changes in gene expression associated with progression through S/G2/M phases. This does not, however, explain why the cells are more likely to enter the cell cycle. We predict that loss of TRAF3 must induce some constitutive change in gene expression in all the cells in the culture, which increases the probability of cell cycle entry (or escape from G0 into G1). We have now testing whether escape from G0 is increased by staining for phosphorylated Rb and using a live cell CDK activity biosensor, as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The methodology of CRISPR/Cas9 screening for density-dependent cell cycle arrest is very interesting, powerful and provides a strong advance, because it may be utilized under different conditions. However, it is less clear whether the identified candidate TRAF3 is indeed solely involved in cell density control or more generally restricting proliferation of epithelial cells. Further, the lack of functional data connecting TRAF3 and non-canonical NF-κB to density control is a drawback. Thus, in its current form the study provides mainly a methodological advance. I think more functional data are needed to also provide a conceptual advance and strong visibility for the audience interested in cell cycle and NF-κB regulation in epithelial cells and cancer.</p><p>Expertise: Signal transduction, immune response, oncogenic signaling in cancer</p><p>Reviewers cross commenting:</p><p>I agree with rev#1 that “epithelial homeostasis” may be overstated, especially</p><p>since it is not clear, if the TRAF3-NIK-p100 axis may not promote proliferation in other cells as well. Thus, I think adding other cell lines (also non-epithelial) (see rev#1) and providing data, if TRAF3-NIK-p100 is more generally regulating cell cycle or selectively density-controlled proliferation (my comments) is important. Other more mechanistic studies such as Trp53 status, TRAF3 and cyclinD/E regulation and effects of SMAC-mimetics can be done in parallel and results will certainly improve the understanding how loss of TRAF3 influences cell-density control.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
