Using microfluidics to trap and image single cells throughout their lifespans, we find that lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression is accompanied by formation of cytoplasmic Ssd1 foci. The age-dependent Ssd1 foci are condensates that appear dynamically in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, and their failure to resolve during mitosis coincided with the end of lifespan. Ssd1 overexpression was epistatic with calorie restriction (CR) for lifespan extension, and yeast overexpressing Ssd1 or undergoing CR were resistant to iron supplementation-induced lifespan shortening, while their lifespans were reduced by iron chelation. The nuclear translocation of the Aft1 transcriptional regulator of the iron regulon occurred during aging in a manner that predicted remaining lifespan but was prevented by CR. Accordingly, age-dependent induction of the Fit2 and Arn1 high-affinity iron transporters within the iron regulon was reduced by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Consistent with age-dependent activation of the iron regulon, intracellular iron accumulated during aging but was prevented by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Moreover, lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression or CR was epistatic to inactivation of the iron regulon. These studies reveal that CR and Ssd1 overexpression extend the yeast replicative lifespan by blocking deleterious age-dependent iron uptake, identifying novel therapeutic targets for lifespan extension and providing insight into how CR may extend the lifespan and healthspan in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iron regulon</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>calorie restriction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 AG079883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM139816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyler</surname><given-names>Jessica K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live imaging analyses in budding yeast reveal that calorie restriction and overexpression of the mRNA binding protein Ssd1 both block deleterious age-dependent iron uptake as a mechanism to extend lifespan.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is a gradual and irreversible biological process that results in the progressive decline in physical function of cells and tissues. The fundamental processes that go awry during aging are conserved across eukaryotes, exemplified by the fact that anti-aging regimens such as calorie restriction (CR) and mTOR/Tor1 pathway inhibition using rapamycin function to extend lifespan in species ranging from budding yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Weindruch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blagosklonny, 2019</xref>). There is a great deal of interest in the identification of common features, or hallmarks, of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>) and in determining which of these hallmarks are reversed by anti-aging regimens.</p><p>Loss of cellular homeostasis is a hallmark of aging, characterized by the gradual decline in the ability to regulate intracellular conditions leading to accumulation of cellular damage, impaired stress responses, and functional deterioration across tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>). Age-associated dysregulation of transcription and translation may contribute to this loss of homeostasis during aging as it can cause imbalanced protein production, impaired stress responses, and metabolic disruption leading to accumulation of damaged proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anisimova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, Ssd1, a yeast mRNA-binding protein involved in modulating the stability, localization, or translation of specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Luukkonen and Séraphin, 1999</xref>), may play a pivotal role in preserving cellular homeostasis during aging given that its deletion shortens the yeast replicative lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaeberlein et al., 2004</xref>) while its overexpression extends lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Yeast is the only type of eukaryotic cell where the length of the replicative lifespan (RLS), the number of times that a cell divides before death, can be measured accurately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Steinkraus et al., 2008</xref>). Previously, we have shown that overexpression of Ssd1 extends yeast RLS by suppressing global translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2018</xref>) possibly involving its stress-induced role in mRNA sequestration into cytoplasmic mRNA storage granules termed P-bodies and stress granules where the mRNAs can be stored or degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurischko et al., 2011</xref>). Ssd1 has been shown to bind a large number of mRNAs, with some reports identifying up to 300 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hogan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dutcher and Gasch, 2024</xref>). However, whether sequestration of a subset of these mRNAs by overexpressed Ssd1 is sufficient for lifespan extension remains unclear. Additionally, the identity of the mRNAs whose translation is suppressed by overexpressed Ssd1 to extend lifespan is unknown.</p><p>By contrast to yeast lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression, CR has been shown to extend lifespan in many organisms including primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caristia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colman et al., 2014</xref>). However, CR reprograms metabolism affecting a large portion of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Weindruch, 2010</xref>), making it difficult to determine the precise molecular mechanism of CR-mediated lifespan extension. One putative mechanism for improved cellular homeostasis by CR leading to lifespan extension implicates CR’s ability to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, thereby decreasing oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ungvari et al., 2008</xref>). Studies in yeast have suggested that CR reduces ROS levels by mechanisms including activating superoxide dismutases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mesquita et al., 2010</xref>) as well as by improving mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choi and Lee, 2013</xref>). Another mode for reduction of oxidative stress by CR, at least in the mouse heart, is decreased cellular iron uptake to improve iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2020</xref>). In this situation, mechanistically, CR resulted in the downregulation of transcription of genes encoding iron transporters that mediate iron import and upregulation of ferritin to sequester iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2020</xref>). Whether CR downregulates iron uptake to lead to lifespan extension is an open question.</p><p>Iron is an essential cofactor for numerous enzymatic processes, being required for the proper function of enzymes involved in oxygen transport, electron transfer, DNA replication and repair, and various metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben Zichri-David et al., 2025</xref>). However, in its free form (free labile iron, Fe<sup>+2</sup>), iron is highly reactive and induces the production of ROS, thereby generating oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chutvanichkul et al., 2018</xref>). For this reason, iron uptake is a tightly regulated process such that when the levels of cellular iron are sufficient, iron transport into the yeast cells is mediated by only low-affinity iron transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martínez-Garay et al., 2016</xref>). When iron levels in the cell are deficient, the transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamaguchi-Iwai et al., 2002</xref> to induce the iron regulon: a set of genes encoding machinery that coordinates iron uptake (including high-affinity iron transporters and transporters of siderophores that scavenge iron from the extracellular environment), vacuolar mobilization, and metabolic adaptation to maintain cellular iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramos-Alonso et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rutherford et al., 2005</xref>). Recent reports indicate that the activation of the iron regulon occurs during yeast replicative aging as a result of reduced levels of mitochondrial iron-sulfur clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patnaik et al., 2022</xref>). We hypothesized that age-dependent activation of the iron regulon would lead to accumulation of free labile iron in cells during aging that would be detrimental to lifespan.</p><p>Here, we sought to identify the molecular mechanisms whereby Ssd1 overexpression and CR extend the yeast RLS. Using fluorescent imaging of single cells immobilized in microfluidic devices throughout their lifespans, we find that lifespan extension by overexpression of Ssd1 is accompanied by formation of cytoplasmic Ssd1 foci. These foci appear dynamically after DNA replication and resolve by cytokinesis, while their failure to resolve by cytokinesis coincides with the end of lifespan. Furthermore, Ssd1 overexpression is epistatic with CR for lifespan extension. Our results indicate that both CR and Ssd1 overexpression prevent the activation of the iron regulon during aging, which in turn prevents the increased uptake of iron that usually occurs during aging. Furthermore, we show that derailing age-dependent activation of the iron regulon is the molecular mechanism whereby CR and Ssd1 extend replicative lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lifespan extension by overexpression of Ssd1 is accompanied by age-dependent appearance of Ssd1 condensates</title><p>The Ssd1 mRNA-binding protein has a prion-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurischko and Broach, 2017</xref>) which has been shown to be involved in the localization of overexpressed Ssd1 to cytoplasmic condensates including P-bodies and stress granules in response to glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurischko and Broach, 2017</xref>). Because the conditions in which Ssd1 overexpression extends the yeast lifespan are glucose replete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2018</xref>), we asked whether Ssd1 even forms foci/condensates during replicative aging. Therefore, we generated a yeast strain overexpressing eGFP-tagged Ssd1 by integrating <italic>SSD1</italic>-eGFP under the control of a strong <italic>GPD1</italic> promoter (P<sub>GDP1</sub>-SSD1-GFP).

We also made a strain expressing eGFP-tagged Ssd1 from the endogenous <italic>SSD1</italic> promoter (SSD1-GFP). We confirmed by flow cytometry that overexpression of Ssd1 occurred in seemingly all P<sub>GDP1</sub>-SSD1-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Using microfluidics combined with fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutierrez and Tyler, 2024</xref>), we tracked single cells from the SSD1-GFP (control) or P<sub>GDP1</sub>-SSD1-GFP strains throughout their entire lifespan, acquiring images every 20 min over approximately 4 days. We observed that in P<sub>GPD1</sub>-SSD1-GFP cells, but not in the control strain, transient Ssd1 foci appeared during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1 fig1video2 fig1video3 fig1video4">Figure 1—videos 1–4</xref>). The abundance of the Ssd1 protein increased over the first 4–6 cell divisions of the RLS before reaching a plateau, both in control and P<sub>GPD1</sub>-SSD1-GFP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), where the overall fluorescence intensity in P<sub>GPD1</sub>-SSD1-GFP cells was approximately tenfold higher than in the control strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). No Ssd1-GFP foci were observed in P<sub>GPD1</sub>-SSD1-GFP cells during the early cell divisions in the lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that either a threshold concentration of Ssd1 may be required for foci formation and/or that alterations in cell homeostasis during aging promote Ssd1 foci formation in cells overexpressing Ssd1. During aging, Ssd1 foci appeared in all cells overexpressing Ssd1, and the number and frequency of Ssd1 foci appearance varied between cells, with the highest number of foci per cell apparent at the end of the lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data show that the lifespan extension that results from overexpression of Ssd1 is accompanied by age-dependent formation of Ssd1 foci, suggesting that the ability to form Ssd1 foci correlates with increased longevity while the appearance of five or more Ssd1 foci may be either a cause or consequence of end of lifespan.</p><p>Similar to the starvation-induced Ssd1-GFP foci in Ssd1 overexpressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurischko and Broach, 2017</xref>), age-induced Ssd1-GFP foci in Ssd1 overexpressing cells are also cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Moreover, Ssd1-GFP foci can be dissolved by 1,6-hexanediol, suggesting that they are condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, age-induced Ssd1-GFP foci underwent fusion and fission (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video5">Figure 1—video 5</xref>), consistent with them also being condensates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ssd1 condensates form in cells overexpressing Ssd1 during aging in a cell-cycle-regulated manner and are distinct from age-induced P-bodies and Hsp104 foci</title><p>To investigate further the transient nature of appearance of the Ssd1 condensates during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), we used bud size as a proxy for cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Sodium azide, which inhibits the electron transport chain, induced P-body formation in ~65% of cells, as marked by mCherry-tagged Edc3. Approximately 20% of cells showed Ssd1 localized to P-bodies in response to sodium azide treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

As such, we were curious whether overexpression of Ssd1 or CR may lead to a muted iron response during aging. If this were the case, we would expect the lifespan of cells overexpressing Ssd1 or undergoing CR to be less sensitive to iron supplementation. Indeed, the control strain had a significantly reduced RLS upon supplementation with 10 µM iron(III) chloride (FeCl₃), while the extended RLS of P<sub>GPD1</sub>-SSD1 and CR-treated cells was unaffected by 10 µM FeCl₃ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Under low-iron conditions, Aft1 translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of the iron regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamaguchi-Iwai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These epistasis analysis results indicate that the absence of activation of the iron regulon during aging, or muted iron regulon activation, is the mechanism whereby CR and Ssd1 overexpression, respectively, extend the RLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for molecular mechanism of RLS extension by Ssd1 overexpression and CR.</title><p>During normal aging, cells have limited intracellular iron, potentially due to mitochondrial dysfunction reducing the assembly of iron-sulfur clusters, which leads to nuclear translocation of Aft1 and activation of the iron regulon. This subsequent deleterious increase in intracellular iron limits lifespan. CR also extends lifespan in a manner dependent on failure to activate the iron regulon; mechanistically, CR indirectly prevents nuclear localization of Aft1, preventing production of the mRNAs from the iron regulon and the subsequent age-dependent increase in deleterious iron accumulation. In aging cells overexpressing Ssd1, transient cytoplasmic Ssd1 condensates appear that correlate with lifespan extension, where the lifespan extension is due to failure to activate the iron regulon preventing deleterious iron accumulation.

Here, we report that yeast replicative aging is accompanied by the accumulation of free labile iron, due to activation of the iron regulon – an event that foretells the end of lifespan. We reveal that CR and overexpression of the yeast mRNA binding protein Ssd1 both extend the yeast replicative lifespan by preventing activation of the iron regulon during aging, in turn preventing deleterious age-dependent accumulation of free labile iron that limits lifespan.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Age-induced cell cycle-regulated Ssd1 condensates and lifespan extension</title><p>Lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression resulted in the age-induced transient appearance of Ssd1 cytoplasmic foci in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The fact that the Ssd1 foci could be dissolved with 1,6-hexanediol and showed fusion properties is consistent with their being condensates. The cell-cycle-dependent nature of formation and dissolution of the age-dependent Ssd1 condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is reminiscent of stress-induced formation of Ssd1 foci in cells overexpressing Ssd1 being triggered by Ssd1 dephosphorylation by the Sit4 phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurischko and Broach, 2017</xref>). Sit4 functions in late G<sub>1</sub> phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sutton et al., 1991</xref> to promote a timely G<sub>1</sub>/S transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang, 2006</xref>), aligning nicely with the timing of appearance of age-induced Ssd1 foci after G<sub>1</sub> phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Moreover, stress-induced Ssd1 foci in cells overexpressing Ssd1 are dissolved by the Cbk1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurischko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurischko and Broach, 2017</xref>), whose peak activity occurs immediately before cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brace et al., 2011</xref>). This agrees with the fact that virtually all Ssd1 condensates that occurred in aging cells overexpressing Ssd1 dissolved by cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that not only is the cell cycle-dependent nature of the appearance of the Ssd1 foci beneficial for longevity, but perhaps also their dissolution by cytokinesis may be important, given that when Ssd1 condensates were retained through mitosis, it coincided with that being the last cell division of their lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>The age-induced Ssd1 foci appear to be a novel type of condensate, because even though we could reproduce the colocalization of overexpressed Ssd1-GFP with stress-induced P-bodies and stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kurischko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurischko and Broach, 2017</xref>), no such colocalization occurred during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). This implies that the lifespan extension that occurs due to Ssd1 overexpression is likely mediated by the Ssd1 condensates themselves rather than by coaggregation with other stress-induced structures. It will be interesting to determine in the future exactly the nature of this novel type of Ssd1 condensate during aging and what kind of stress is triggering its formation during aging but not in young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Whatever the mechanism of their formation, age-dependent Ssd1 condensate formation is dependent on the overexpression of Ssd1, as it does not occur in cells expressing Ssd1-GFP from the endogenous promoter during aging, perhaps reflecting a disrupted balance between the molecular ratio of mRNAs and Ssd1 that may promote Ssd1 condensate formation. Notably, previous studies indicate that the fate of Ssd1-bound mRNAs depends on Ssd1’s aggregation state, where the mRNAs bound to Ssd1 within a condensate are targeted for degradation or sequestration, while the mRNAs bound to diffusive Ssd1 are targeted for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurischko and Broach, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jansen et al., 2009</xref>), consistent with our proposed mechanism whereby Ssd1 overexpression extends lifespan through beneficial targeted mRNA degradation/segregation to age-induced Ssd1 condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ssd1 overexpression and CR block the iron regulon to extend lifespan</title><p>The induction of Fit2 and Arn1 that occurs during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) was greatly reduced by overexpressing Ssd1 and CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), indicating that both anti-aging interventions are reducing activation of the iron regulon during aging. In agreement with induction of the iron regulon during aging, nuclear translocation of Aft1, one of the transcriptional activators of the iron regulon, occurs during aging and is a predictor of on average five remaining cell divisions in the lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, the earlier the activation of the iron regulon in the lifespan, the shorter the lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Notably, CR prevented nuclear translocation of Aft1 during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that cells undergoing CR do not receive the signal to turn on the iron regulon during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The signal for turning on the iron regulon during aging is likely the depletion of iron-sulfur clusters that occurs during aging as a consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Veatch et al., 2009</xref>). We speculate that the mechanism whereby CR prevents activation of the iron regulon is related to the fact that CR promotes mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">López-Lluch et al., 2006</xref>) such that cells undergoing CR may not have depleted levels of iron-sulfur clusters during aging. CR releases the glucose-mediated repression of the heme activator protein (HAP) transcriptional activator complex required for transcription of key nuclear and mitochondrial genes needed for mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2002</xref>), while overexpression of the activating component of the HAP complex, Hap4, itself is sufficient to extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2020</xref>) even in cells grown in glucose. It will be interesting to determine in the future whether overexpression of Hap4 also extends lifespan by preventing the induction of the iron regulon and deleterious accumulation of iron during aging. The ability of CR to activate mitophagy may also play a role in promoting mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mehrabani et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While Ssd1 overexpression also reduces activation of the iron regulon to extend lifespan, we predict that a different mechanism is at play to block iron regulon activation than during CR. We speculate that the reason why Ssd1 overexpression reduces accumulation of Fit2 and Arn1 during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) is that overexpressed Ssd1 may cause the degradation or sequestration of their mRNAs in the cytoplasmic age-induced Ssd1 condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Fit2 and Arn1 are not among the known mRNAs that bind to Ssd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hogan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dutcher and Gasch, 2024</xref>) but this is to be expected as these previous studies were performed in conditions in which the iron regulon, and hence these transcripts, would not have been induced. Also, the Ssd1 mRNA binding partner studies had endogenous levels of Ssd1 not overexpressed which may bind to additional transcripts. Furthermore, it has been reported that Ssd1 can lead to the decay of mRNAs that it does not even bind to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jansen et al., 2009</xref> and this may be related to the reduced global protein synthesis that occurs due to Ssd1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Future studies are required to determine exactly how Ssd1 overexpression leads to reduced levels of Fit2 and Arn1 expression in aged cells.</p><p>Once the iron regulon is induced during aging, the production of high-affinity iron transporters such as Fit2 and Arn1 would lead to the subsequent rise in free labile intracellular iron during aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Notably, free labile intracellular iron remains low during aging in strains with Ssd1 overexpression and under CR, consistent with failure to activate the iron regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that age-related increases in iron uptake resulting from activation of the iron regulon are detrimental to replicative lifespan and that CR and Ssd1 overexpression extend lifespan by using different mechanisms to avoid activation of the iron regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In agreement with their functioning through a shared pathway to extend lifespan, Ssd1 overexpression and CR are epistatic for lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The fact that pre-activating the iron regulon prevents lifespan extension by either CR or Ssd1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) is consistent with their preventing activation of the iron regulon being their sole mechanism of lifespan extension. Moreover, the key role of the iron regulon in limiting lifespan is apparent from the robust lifespan extension resulting from deletion of <italic>AFT1</italic>, which is also epistatic to the lifespan extension achieved by CR or Ssd1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Iron levels and lifespan regulation</title><p>Activation of the iron regulon during aging has been proposed previously to shorten lifespan by repressing mitochondrial respiration via Cth2, a protein product of the iron regulon targeting the mRNAs of non-essential iron binding proteins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patnaik et al., 2022</xref>). However, we found that deletion of <italic>CTH2</italic> does not extend RLS to the same extent as overexpression of Ssd1 or CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Independent studies report that besides deletion of the gene encoding the iron regulon transcription factor <italic>AFT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2021</xref>), single deletion of the <italic>FIT2</italic> or <italic>ARN1</italic> genes encoding high-affinity iron transporters also extends lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2021</xref>). Although <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> lacks iron export mechanisms, cytosolic iron can be sequestered into storage or iron-sulfur clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramos-Alonso et al., 2020</xref>). It is important to note that the iron regulon is composed of several genes with, in some cases, opposite functions; for instance, <italic>CCC1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2001</xref> promotes vacuolar storage of iron, while <italic>SMF3</italic> promotes mobilization out of the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Portnoy et al., 2000</xref>). Coherently, Ssd1 binds to <italic>SMF3</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dutcher and Gasch, 2024</xref>). As such, overexpressing Ssd1 <italic>may</italic> be modulating iron homeostasis beyond iron intake. Our data reveal that the amount of free labile iron tends to increase as yeast age, whereas the level of free labile iron in cells lacking <italic>ATF1</italic> is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), indicating that age-related iron regulon activation drives iron overload. We hypothesize that this excess free labile iron generates oxidative stress, damaging mitochondrial proteins, lipids, and DNA, ultimately impairing respiration. This mechanism is relevant to humans, as age-related iron accumulation in tissues, including the brain, is linked to cognitive decline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biel et al., 2021</xref> and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ndayisaba et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>), underscoring its importance for healthspan.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Effects of CR on human iron metabolism</title><p>CR robustly extends lifespan from yeast to mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontana et al., 2010</xref>). While it is yet to be demonstrated that CR extends lifespan in humans, it is safe to say that it promotes healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caristia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kebbe et al., 2021</xref>). Several studies have shown age-related iron accumulation in human tissues, including the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sato et al., 2022</xref>). Notably, recent studies demonstrate that CR reduces age-related iron accumulation in the brains of rhesus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kastman et al., 2010</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cook and Yu, 1998</xref>). In humans, CR and intermittent fasting improve memory and cognitive function during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Witte et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leclerc et al., 2020</xref>). Whether these benefits stem from reduced iron accumulation remains to be investigated. We asked if there is any evidence that CR ameliorates toxic iron accumulation in humans. To investigate this, we analyzed published data. While we were unable to find proteomic data from specific tissues such as human brain under CR, we assessed the blood/plasma proteomics change of two studies from overweight donors subjected to CR leading to weight loss and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goudswaard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capel et al., 2009</xref>), two studies identifying proteins that correlate with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>) and one study analyzing protein signatures of centenarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sebastiani et al., 2021</xref>). Transferrin (TF), a blood plasma glycoprotein that binds and transports iron throughout the bloodstream to cells and tissues in the body, was upregulated in CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goudswaard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capel et al., 2009</xref>), while decreases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that an increase in TF may reflect enhanced capacity to bind and sequester free iron, reducing its toxic potential. CR also upregulates hepcidin (HAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goudswaard et al., 2023</xref>), a peptide hormone that serves as the master regulator of systemic iron homeostasis by inhibiting iron absorption and release from cells, consistent with people under CR potentially absorbing less iron from their diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pagani et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that low levels of hepcidin lead to chronic liver disease as a result of iron accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Milic et al., 2016</xref>). HAMP was slightly but not significantly downregulated with age in both studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>). On the other hand, the transferrin receptor (TFRC) was downregulated in people under CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goudswaard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capel et al., 2009</xref>). TFRC is present on cell surfaces to mediate iron uptake through transferrin-iron complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gammella et al., 2021</xref>. A decrease under CR suggests that human cells reduce iron uptake from the plasma, limiting excess iron storage. TFRC is downregulated in centenarians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sebastiani et al., 2021</xref>, and is slightly, but not significantly, increased with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Siino et al., 2022</xref>). Downregulation of ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) occurs in CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goudswaard et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capel et al., 2009</xref>), given that FTH1 is a component of ferritin, the iron storage protein, this downregulation could be a consequence of putative lower iron abundance in the plasma of people under CR. These findings highlight the potential for targeting iron-related proteins to influence iron homeostasis and lifespan in humans. However, further studies will be needed to determine whether modulating the expression of these genes or proteins in humans could help reduce age-related iron accumulation in tissues, offering potential therapeutic strategies for conditions associated with iron dysregulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Unless otherwise indicated, cells were grown overnight in Synthetic Complete Media (SCD) composed of yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (Difco 233520), complete drop-out mix without YNB (US Biological D9515), ammonium sulfate (Fisher Chemical A702-3), and glucose (Sigma-Aldrich G8270). Cultures were grown to an optical density (OD)<sub>600</sub> between 0.2 and 0.6, then diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.1, vortexed for 30 s, and loaded into microfluidic (described below in more detail) and as we recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutierrez and Tyler, 2024</xref>). For experiments involving artemisinin (Art) supplementation, cells were cultured in yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) media containing the indicated concentration of dextrose (Grainger 31GE61; 31GC58), with artemisinin (Thermo Scientific J65406.03) added directly to fresh YPD prior to sterilization. RLS was determined using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ibiochips.com/product/automated-dissection-screening-chip/">microfluidic chips from iBiochips</ext-link> according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Where indicated, iron(III) chloride (Sigma 157740–100 G) and bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium salt hydrate (BPS; Sigma 146617–1 G) were added directly to SCD media before sterilization using a Corning filter bottle system with a 0.22 µm pore 54.5 cm² PES membrane (Corning 431098), at the specified final concentrations. All experimental conditions and compound concentrations are detailed in the relevant figure legends.</p><p>Each strain was analyzed in the microfluidic chamber under non-fluorescent conditions in three independent experiments, each yielding consistent results, with 30–50 cells counted per condition or strain in each experiment. Cells that were lost from the microfluidic traps during the course of the experiment were recorded as censored. For strains expressing fluorescent markers, experiments were conducted under the appropriate fluorescent illumination, also in three independent replicates with consistent results, with 20–40 cells counted per experiment. For these fluorescent strains, the total number of cells from all three experiments is presented in the histograms, and only cells that completed their full replicative lifespan were included in the analysis, with cells lost from the traps excluded. Replicative lifespan survival curves were generated using the OASIS 2 platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sbi.postech.ac.kr/oasis2/">https://sbi.postech.ac.kr/oasis2/</ext-link>) as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2016</xref>, and p-values for RLS curves were calculated using the log-rank test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>The settings used on an LSR II flow cytometer were for detection of FITC (excitation 494, emission 520) and TxRed (excitation at 595 nm, emission at 613 nm). For each sample, data from at least 10,000 events were collected, and fluorescence intensity was quantified using pulse area (integral) measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image collection</title><p>All imaging in this study, including replicative lifespan (RLS) experiments, was performed using an EVOS II microscope (Thermo Fisher). For colocalization experiments, Ssd1-GFP was imaged using the EVOS Light Cube GFP 2.0 (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher, AMEP4951) with light intensity set to 0.053, exposure time to 0.047 s, and gain to 1. Hsp104-mCherry, Edc3-mCherry, and Pab1-mCherry were imaged using the EVOS Light Cube TxRed 2.0 (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher, AMEP4955) with light intensity at 0.6, exposure time at 0.06 s, and gain at 5. For RLS experiments without fluorescence microscopy, imaging was performed at ×40 magnification on V-shaped chips (iBiochips; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutierrez and Tyler, 2024</xref>), with images acquired every 20 min for 96 hr. Brightfield illumination was adjusted individually for each experiment, and z-stacks were collected over a physical length of 19 μm in 5 steps of 3.8 μm each. When RLS was measured in conjunction with fluorescence microscopy, imaging was conducted at ×60 magnification with immersion oil on Y-shaped AD chips (iBiochips; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gutierrez and Tyler, 2024</xref>), with images taken every 20 min for 96 hr. Ssd1-GFP was imaged as above, but with an exposure time of 0.045 s. Hsp104-mCherry, Edc3-mCherry, and Pab1-mCherry were imaged with light intensity at 0.3, exposure time at 0.06 s, and gain at 5. Fit2-mCherry and Arn1-mCherry were imaged with light intensity at 0.105, exposure time at 0.05 s, and gain at 4. Aft1-GFP was imaged with light intensity at 0.053, exposure time at 0.04 s, and gain at 1. For measurements involving the GFP channel in PGFL experiments, the same light cube was used with light intensity at 0.053, exposure time at 0.07 s, and gain at 1. In general, higher exposure times and lower light intensities were preferred to minimize phototoxicity, and all media used for fluorescence imaging was supplemented with 20 mM ascorbic acid (LabChem LC115309) to reduce photobleaching. Fluorescence imaging experiments used z-stacks spanning 8.5 μm in 5 steps of 1.7 μm. All imaging parameters were optimized to achieve the desired temporal resolution while minimizing phototoxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image analysis and data representations</title><p>The number of cell divisions in each RLS was determined manually by analyzing images captured at ×40 magnification every 20 min, using the image sequence function in ImageJ. Fluorescence microscopy images were also analyzed manually in ImageJ, with appropriate background corrections applied. For Ssd1 foci quantification, a minimum threshold of 200-pixel intensity above background was used to score foci; structures below this threshold were disregarded. Multiple foci per cell cycle were recorded if two or more foci were observed simultaneously in the same cell, or if a focus disappeared and a new focus appeared in subsequent images within the same cell cycle. For single-cell trajectory histograms, individual values for fluorescence intensity or foci number, depending on the experiment, were compiled from three independent experimental repeats and visualized in Excel by replacing values with the corresponding color codes in the cells. Dot plots were generated using Prism, while box-and-whisker plots were created in Excel. Statistical significance for dot plots and box-and-whisker plots was assessed using the two-sided Student’s t-test. All analyses were performed in at least three independent experiments with reproducible results, and the combined data are presented in the figures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Iron measurements</title><p>Intracellular free iron (Fe<sup>+2</sup>) levels were measured using Phen Green FL, Diacetate, cell permeant (Thermo Fisher P6763), following a yeast-adapted protocol as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomez-Gallardo et al., 2018</xref>. Briefly, cells were aged in the microfluidic chamber as previously described, and at approximately 30 hr, the chip was loaded with 5  µg/mL Phen Green FL in DMSO. GFP fluorescence was measured using the EVOS Light Cube GFP 2.0 (Invitrogen Thermo Fisher, AMEP4951). The chip was then loaded with 1  mM of the iron chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma 131377–5 G), and fluorescence was measured again. The ratio of fluorescence before and after chelator addition is proportional to the concentration of intracellular free labile iron in the cell.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Table of Yeast strains used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-108892-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-108892-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Figure 1- source data 1, Figure 2- source data 1, Figure 3- source data 1, Figure 4- source data 1, and Figure 5- source data 1 contain the numerical data used to generate the figures.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are indebted to Cornelia Kurischko for extensive thoughtful discussions about Ssd1 condensates, and the Weill Cornell Flow Cytometry Core for technical support.

Here, the authors provide initial evidence that overproduced Ssd1 might act via sequestration of mRNAs of the Aft1/2-dependent iron regulon. Ssd1 overexpression restricts activation of the iron regulon and limits accumulation of Fe2+ inside cells, thereby likely lowering oxidative damage. The effects of Ssd1 overexpression and calorie restriction on lifespan are epistatic, suggesting that they might act through the same pathway.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is well-designed and involves analysis of single yeast cells during replicative aging. The findings are well displayed and largely support the derived model, which also has implications on lifespan of other organisms including humans.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The model is largely supported by the findings, however they remain correlative at the same time. Whether the knockout of ssd1 shortens lifespan by increased intracellular Fe2+ levels is unknown and the shortened lifespan might be caused by different Ssd1 functions. The finding that increased Ssd1 levels form condensates in a cell-cycle dependent is interesting, yet the role of the condensates in lifespan expansion remains untested and unlinked.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>In their revised version and response letter the authors have largely addressed my previous concerns. I would have liked to see an experimental response to some of the points of criticism, but I accept that they have been addressed purely in writing. There are some aspects that should be further elaborated by the authors. I agree that determining the mRNAs that co-sequester with Ssd1 foci will be part of an independent study, yet whether Ssd1 foci are relevant for lifespan expansion remains unclear and I would have hoped for some more detailed consideration on this point in the discussion section. Similarly, it should be clearly stated that the impact of Ssd1 overexpression is unlinked from the cellular function of Ssd1 produced at authentic levels and that the short-lived phenotype of a ssd1 knockout is likely not caused by overactivation of the iron regulon (based on the author´s reply). I will appreciate it if the authors include these aspects more clearly in the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108892.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This manuscript describes the use of a powerful technique called microfluidics to elucidate the mechanisms explaining how overexpression (OE) of Ssd1 and caloric restriction (CR) in yeast extend replicative lifespan (RLS). Microfluidics measures RLS by trapping cells in chambers mounted to a slide. The chambers hold the mother cell but allow daughters to escape. The slide, with many chambers, is recorded during the entire process, roughly 72 hours, with the video monitored afterwards to count how many daughters each of the trapped mothers produces. The power of the method is what can be done with it. For example, the entire process can be viewed by fluorescence so that GFP and mCherry-tagged proteins can be followed as cells age. The budding yeast is the only model where bona fide replicative aging can be measured, and microfluidics is the only system that allows protein localization and levels to be measured in a single cell while aging. The authors do a wonderful job of showing what this combination of tools can do.</p><p>The authors had previously shown that Ssd1, an mRNA-binding protein, extends RLS when overexpressed. This was attributed to Ssd1 sequestering away specific mRNAs under stress, likely leading to reduced ribosomal function. It remained completely unknown how Ssd1 OE extended RLS. The authors observed that overexpressed, but not normally expressed, Ssd1 formed cytoplasmic condensates during mitosis that are resolved by cytokinesis. When the condensates fail to be resolved at the end of mitosis, this signals death.</p><p>It has become clear in the literature that iron accumulation increases with age within the cell. The transcriptional programs that activate the iron regulon also become elevated in aging cells. This is thought to be due to impaired mitochondrial function in aging cells, with increased iron accumulation as an attempt at restoring mitochondrial activity. The authors show that Ssd1 OE and CR both reduce the expression of the iron regulon. The data presented indicate that iron accumulation shortens RLS: deletion of iron regulon components extends RLS, and adding iron to WT cells decreases RLS, but not when Ssd1 is overexpressed or when cells are calorically restricted. Interestingly, iron chelation using BPS has no impact on WT RLS, but decreases the elevated RLS in CR cells and cells overexpressing Ssd1. It was not initially clear why iron chelation would inhibit the extended lifespan seen with CR and Ssd1 OE. This was addressed by an experiment where it was shown that the iron regulon is induced (FIT2 induction) when iron is chelated. Thus, the detrimental effects of induction of the iron regulon by BPS and iron accumulation on RLS cannot be tempered by Ssd1 OE and CR once turned on.</p><p>Comments on Revised Version:</p><p>I am content with the authors' responses to my prior comments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108892.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this paper, the authors investigate how the RNA-binding protein Ssd1 and calorie restriction (CR) influence yeast replicative lifespan, with a particular focus on age-dependent iron uptake and activation of the iron regulon. For this, they use microfluidics-based single-cell imaging to monitor replicative lifespan, protein localization, and intracellular iron levels across aging cells. They show that both Ssd1 overexpression and CR act through a shared pathway to prevent the nuclear translocation of the iron-regulon regulator Aft1 and the subsequent induction of high-affinity iron transporters. As a result, these interventions block the age-related accumulation of intracellular free iron, which otherwise shortens lifespan. Genetic and chemical epistasis experiments further demonstrate that suppression of iron regulon activation is the key mechanism by which Ssd1 and CR promote replicative longevity.</p><p>Overall, the paper is technically rigorous, and the main conclusions are supported by a substantial body of experimental data. The microfluidics-based assays in particular provide compelling single-cell evidence for the dynamics of Ssd1 condensates and iron homeostasis.</p><p>My main concern, however, is that the central reasoning of the paper-that Ssd1 overexpression and CR prevent the activation of the iron regulon-appears to be contradicted by previous findings, and the authors may actually be misrepresenting these studies, unless I am mistaken.

The authors could test whether OE of FIT2 reduces RLS in WT cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data indicate that the iron regulon gets turned on naturally in old cells, presumably due to reduced iron sensing, limiting their lifespan. Although we haven’t tested it experimentally, BPS would also turn on the iron regulon presumably in wild type cells and therefore would have a redundant effect with the activation of the iron regulon that occurs naturally during normal aging. It may be interesting in the future to see if higher levels of BPS can shorten the lifespan of wildtype cells. Similarly, we would predict that overexpression of FIT2 may reduce the lifespan, as its deletion has been shown to extend RLS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should add a brief explanation for why the GDP1 promoter was chosen for Ssd1 OE.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the same promoter that was used to overexpress Ssd1 in all previous studies. This is now stated in the text along with the relevant citations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) On page 12, growth to saturation was described as glucose starvation. This is more accurately described as nutrient deprivation. Referring to it as glucose starvation is akin to CR, which growing to saturation is not. Ssd1 OE formed condensates upon saturation but not in CR. Why do the authors think Ssd1 OE did not form condensates upon CR?</p></disp-quote><p>Too mild a stress?</p><p>This is a fair comment, and we have now changed glucose starvation to nutrient deprivation, as it is more accurate. The effects of nutrient starvation are profound: the cell cycle stops, autophagy is induced, cells undergo the diauxic shift, metabolism changes. None of these changes occur during calorie restriction (0.05% glucose) such that it is not too surprising that Ssd1 does not form condensates during CR. We speculate that the stress is just too mild.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors conclude that the main mechanism for RLS extension in CR and Ssd1 OE is the inhibition of the iron regulon in aging cells. The data certainly supports this. However, this may be an overstatement as other mutations block CR, such as mutations that impair respiration. The authors do note that induction of the iron regulon in aging cells could be a response to impaired mitochondrial function. Thus, it seems that the main goal of CR and Ssd1 OE may be to restore mitochondrial function in aging cells, one way being inactivation of the iron regulon. A discussion of how other mutations impact CR would be of benefit.</p></disp-quote><p>While some labs have shown that respiration impacts CR, this is not the case in other studies. For example, an impactful paper by Kaeberlein et al., PLOS Genetics 2005 showed that CR does extend lifespan in respiratory deficient strains using many different strain backgrounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The cell cycle regulation of Ssd1 OE condensates is very interesting. There does not appear to be literature linking Ssd1 with proteasome-dependent protein turnover. Many proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and genome stability are regulated through ubiquitination. It is not necessary to do anything here about it, but it would be interesting to address how Ssd1 condensates may be regulated with such precision.</p></disp-quote><p>we see no evidence of changes in Ssd1 protein intensity during the cell cycle. The difference therefore we speculate is at the post translational level rather than Ssd1 degradation and there are known cell cycle regulated phosphatase and kinase that regulates Ssd1 phosphorylation and condensation state whose timing of function match when the Ssd1 condensates appear and dissolve in the cell cycle. We have now discussed this and elude to it in the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) While reading the draft, I kept asking myself what the relevance to human biology was. I was very impressed with the extensive literature review at the end of the discussion, going over how well conserved this strategy is in yeast with humans. I suggest referring to this earlier, perhaps even in the abstract. This would nail down how relevant this model is for understanding human longevity regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have now mentioned in the abstract the relevance to human work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In conclusion, I enjoyed reading this manuscript, describing how Ssd1 OE and CR lead to RLS increases, using different mechanisms. However, since the 2 strategies appear to be using redundant mechanisms, I was surprised that synergism was not observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind comment. We propose that Ssd1 overexpression impacts the levels of the iron regulon transcripts, which would be downstream of the point in the pathway that is affected by CR, i.e., nuclear localization of Aft1. The lack of synergy fits with this model, as Ssd1 overexpression cannot impact the iron regulon transcripts if they are not induced due to CR. We have now improved the model to make the impact of these different anti-aging interventions on activation of the iron regulon more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>My main concern is that the central reasoning of the paper-that Ssd1 overexpression and CR prevent the activation of the iron regulon-appears to be contradicted by previous findings, and the authors may actually be misrepresenting these studies, unless I am mistaken.

Upon further consideration, we have now removed all mention of this paper from our manuscript as it is irrelevant to our situation, because the mRNA abundance studies during CR or with and without Ssd1 were not performed in situations in which the iron regulon is even activated such as aging, so there would not be any opportunity to detect reduced transcript levels due to CR or Ssd1 presence. Also, none of these studies were performed with Ssd1 overexpression which is the situation we are examining. Our data clearly show that Ssd1 overexpression and CR reduced / prevented, respectively, production of proteins from the iron regulon during aging.</p><p>We do not feel that the iron regulon being activated by nutrient depletion at the diauxic shift is a fair comparison to the situation in cells happily dividing during CR. The levels of nutrient deprivation used in those studies have profound effects including arresting cell growth, activating autophagy, altering metabolism. The levels of CR that we use (0.05% glucose) does not activate any of these changes nor the iron regulon in young cells or old cells (Fig. 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The role of Ssd1 condensate formation in mRNA sequestration and lifespan expansion remains unclear. Thus, the study involves two parts (Ssd1 condensate formation and lifespan expansion via limiting Fe2+ accumulation), which are poorly linked. The study will therefore benefit from further data linking the two aspects.</p></disp-quote><p>Future experiments are planned to determine what mRNAs reside in the age-induced Ssd1 overexpression condensates, to determine if they include the iron regulon transcripts. This will require us to optimize isolation of old cells and isolation of the Ssd1 condensates from them, and is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The beneficial effects of Ssd1 overexpression and calorie restriction (CR) on lifespan are epistatic, yet the claim that both experimental conditions act via the same pathway should be further documented. It is recommended to combine Ssd1 overexpression with a well-defined condition that expands lifespan through a mechanism not involving changes in Fe2+ levels. A further increase in lifespan upon combining such conditions would at least indirectly support the authors' claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have more than epistatic evidence to indicate that Ssd1 overexpression and CR are in the same pathway. Ssd1 overexpression and CR result in failure to properly induce the iron regulon during aging and subsequent reduced levels of iron, resulting in lifespan extension, supporting that they act via the same pathway. We do appreciate the point though and epistasis analyses are on our list for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is highly recommended to analyze ssd1 knockout cells: Is the shortened lifespan caused by intracellular Fe2+ accumulation, as predicted by the model? Does the knockout lead to an overactivation of the iron regulon? Such analysis will also document the physiological relevance of authentic Ssd1 levels in controlling yeast lifespan. The authors could test this possibility by determining intracellular Fe2+ levels (as done in Figure 5) and testing whether the mutant cells are partially rescued by the presence of an iron chelator (as done in Figure 5C).</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t think the normal role of Ssd1 is to sequester the iron regulon mRNAs to prevent its activation, given that wild type yeast with endogenous Ssd1 activates the iron regulon during aging. Rather, the failure to activate the iron regulon during aging is unique to when Ssd1 is overexpressed not at endogenous Ssd1 levels. As such, it may not be the case that the short lifespan of ssd1 yeast is due to iron accumulation (if that happens); yeast lacking SSD1 also have cell wall biogenesis problems and the defects in cell wall biogenesis shorten the replicative lifespan (Molon et al., Biogerentology 2018 PMID 29189912).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 4: The authors could not analyze the impact of Ssd1 overexpression on the localization of GFP-Aft1 due to synthetic sickness. This was not observed under calorie restriction (CR) conditions and is therefore unexpected. Why should Ssd1 overexpression and CR have such diverse impacts on cellular physiology when combined with GFP-Aft1? Isn`t that observation arguing against CR and increased Ssd1 levels acting through the same pathway? A further clarification of this point is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Without further experimentation, we can only speculate that cellular changes that are unique to overexpression of Ssd1 and not shared with CR cause a negative interaction with GFP-Aft1. Of note, Aft1 has functions in addition to its role in activating the iron regulon (aft1∆ strains have a growth defect independent from its role in iron regulon activation [27]) and we have shown previously that overexpressed Ssd1 has a reduction in global protein translation. Future experiments would be necessary to delineate the basis for this synthetic sickness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Lowering Fe2+ levels upon Ssd1 overexpression is predicted to reduce oxidative stress. It is suggested to determine ROS levels upon Ssd1 overexpression to bolster that point.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. The lowering of Fe2+ in the Ssd1 mutants is something that happens at the end of the lifespan and therefore we would need to do experiments to detect reduced ROS using a live dye on our microfluidics platform. We are not aware of any live fluorescent reporters of ROS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Page 6, 7th line of Replicative lifespan analyses, there is a double bracket.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.

Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3D vs Figure 3B: it appears that Fit2 activation occurs substantially earlier than Aft1 translocation, which reduces the predictive value of Fit2 compared to Aft1. This is puzzling given that Fit2 is expected to be a direct target of Aft1. Could this discrepancy be related to the thresholding used for Fit2-mCherry display? The color scale in Figure 3D is also somewhat misleading, as most of the segments appear greenish. A continuous color gradient, perhaps restricted to the [10-120] interval, might give a clearer picture of iron regulon activation.</p></disp-quote><p>For the Aft1-mcherry experiment, we are only able to accurately annotate nuclear localization when Aft1 has been fully (or mostly) translocated into the nucleus from the cytoplasm such that this data is likely to be on the conservative side. However, activation of the iron regulon likely occurs as Aft1 is translocated into the nucleolus, so a minimal initial amount of Aft1 (for which we don’t have enough resolution in this system to detect) could be enough for FIT2 and ARN1 induction. By contrast, the Fit2 and Arn1 signal is measuring increase over a background of nothing, so is very easy to detect even at low level induction. To allow the readers to see all our data without over thresholding, we prefer to present the induction of Fit2 and Arn1 at all intensity levels even the very low level induction (green).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) &quot;In control strains, expression of Fit2 and Arn1 varied across the population, but generally increased with age&quot;: for the right panel, normalization might be more appropriate.
