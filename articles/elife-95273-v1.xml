However, the variability between individual iPSC lines and the lack of efficient technology to comprehensively characterize iPSC-derived cell types hinder its adoption in routine preclinical screening settings. To facilitate the validation of iPSC-derived cell culture composition, we have implemented an imaging assay based on cell painting and convolutional neural networks to recognize cell types in dense and mixed cultures with high fidelity. We have benchmarked our approach using pure and mixed cultures of neuroblastoma and astrocytoma cell lines and attained a classification accuracy above 96%. Through iterative data erosion, we found that inputs containing the nuclear region of interest and its close environment, allow achieving equally high classification accuracy as inputs containing the whole cell for semi-confluent cultures and preserved prediction accuracy even in very dense cultures. We then applied this regionally restricted cell profiling approach to evaluate the differentiation status of iPSC-derived neural cultures, by determining the ratio of postmitotic neurons and neural progenitors. We found that the cell-based prediction significantly outperformed an approach in which the population-level time in culture was used as a classification criterion (96% <italic>vs</italic> 86%, respectively). In mixed iPSC-derived neuronal cultures, microglia could be unequivocally discriminated from neurons, regardless of their reactivity state, and a tiered strategy allowed for further distinguishing activated from non-activated cell states, albeit with lower accuracy. Thus, morphological single-cell profiling provides a means to quantify cell composition in complex mixed neural cultures and holds promise for use in the quality control of iPSC-derived cell culture models.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>morphological phenotyping</kwd><kwd>cyclic imaging</kwd><kwd>iPSC culture</kwd><kwd>neural differentiation</kwd><kwd>deep

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Modelling the complexity of the human brain and its (dys)function has proven to be notoriously challenging. This is due to its intricate wiring, the cellular heterogeneity, and species-specific differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Strooper and Karran, 2016</xref>). To increase the translational value of neuroscientific research, there is a need for physiologically relevant human models. With the advent of human iPSC technology, it has become possible to generate a wealth of brain-resident cell types including neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2019</xref>), astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neyrinck et al., 2021</xref>), microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haenseler et al., 2017</xref>), oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nevin et al., 2017</xref>), and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abutaleb and Truskey, 2021</xref>), allowing the study of complex polygenic pathologies that cannot be modelled in animals, opening avenues to precision pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the ability of iPSC to develop into organoids renders them attractive for studying multi-cellular interactions in a 3D context that is closer to the in vivo situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin and Paşca, 2018</xref>). However, genetic drift, clonal, and patient heterogeneity cause variability in reprogramming and differentiation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rouhani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salomonis et al., 2016</xref>). The differentiation outcome is further strongly influenced by variations in protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2022</xref>). Together, it leads to inconsistent and potentially misleading results and consequently, it hinders the use of iPSC-derived cell systems in systematic drug screening or cell therapy pipelines. This is particularly true for iPSC-derived neural cultures, as their composition, purity, and maturity directly affect gene expression and functional activity, which is essential for modelling neurological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kuijlaars et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hernández et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, from a preclinical perspective, there is a need for a fast and cost-effective quality control (QC) approach to increase experimental reproducibility and cell type specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D’Antonio et al., 2017</xref>). From a clinical perspective, in turn, robust QC is required for safety and regulatory compliance (e.g. for cell therapy). To address this lack of standardisation, large-scale collaborative efforts have been set up such as the International Stem Cell Banking Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>), which focusses on clinical quality attributes and provides recommendations for iPSC validation testing for use as cellular therapeutics, or the CorEuStem network, aiming to harmonize iPSC practices across core facilities in Europe. Current culture validation methods include combinations of sequencing, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D’Antonio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). These methods are often low in throughput, costly and/or, destructive. Hence, we set out to develop a method for evaluating the composition of such cultures based on high-content imaging, which is fast, affordable, and scalable. The primary goal was to facilitate cell type identification in dense cultures, while ensuring compatibility with subsequent immunocytochemistry or molecular assays for further biological inquiries. To this end, we employed the cell painting (CP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gustafsdottir et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray et al., 2016</xref>) method, which is based on labelling cells with simple organic dyes and analysing the resulting phenotypes. CP has proven to be a powerful and generic method for predicting the mode-of-action of pharmacological or genetic perturbations, and this sheerly using a cell morphology readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cimini et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Way et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schiff et al., 2022</xref>). Thus far, CP has primarily been used to predict conditions associated with pharmacological treatments or genetic modifications using images as input. This way, CP has allowed predicting patient diversity in lung adenocarcinoma-associated somatic variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caicedo et al., 2022</xref> or genetic variation across donors in iPSC cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tegtmeyer et al., 2024</xref>). Methods such as PhenoRipper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rajaram et al., 2012</xref> and CP-CHARM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uhlmann et al., 2016</xref>) use whole-image features for classification, which circumvents the difficulty of cell segmentation and allows the classification of images with cells of similar phenotype or class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caicedo et al., 2017</xref>). However, they do not consider differences in cell density and disregard the inter-cellular heterogeneity within the field of view. Therefore, we explored the amenability of CP to predict individual cell types in dense and mixed cultures. By combining deep learning for cell segmentation and classification, we established an approach that allows recognizing of cell types with high accuracy, even in very dense cultures. We employed the approach to evaluate the composition of iPSC-derived neural cultures as they are often quite dense and composed of heterogenous cell types. Varying the density, composition, and cell state allowed us to benchmark the discriminatory potential of cell-based profiling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neural cell lines have a unique morphotextural fingerprint</title><p>Several groups have demonstrated that morphological cell profiling can be used to discriminate pharmacogenomic perturbations based on phenotypic similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cimini et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Way et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schiff et al., 2022</xref>). We asked whether a similar approach could be leveraged to unequivocally distinguish individual cell types as well. To this end, we implemented a version of CP based on 4-channel confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and first applied it to monocultures of two neural cell lines from a different lineage, namely astrocyte-derived 1321N1 astrocytoma cells and neural crest-derived SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. First, we explored whether traditional morphotextural feature extraction provided sufficient distinctive power. The features were calculated for each channel in three regions of interest, namely the nucleus, cytoplasm, and whole cell. They describe the shape, intensity, and texture features of each ROI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Representation of the resulting standardized feature set in UMAP space revealed a clear separation of both cell types along the first UMAP dimension. Clustering of instances was less pronounced after principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), but UMAP better preserves local and global data structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>). Despite some separation of replicates across the second UMAP dimension, the absence of clear replicate clusters showed that the morphological differences between cell types were consistent across biological replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). When projecting individual features onto the UMAP space, we found that both texture (e.g. Nucleus Channel 3 Energy) and shape (e.g. Cellular Area) metrics contributed to the cell type separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The contribution of intensity-related features (e.g. Channel 3 Intensity) to cell type separation was less pronounced as they were more correlated with the biological replicate. Thus, we conclude that cell types can be separated across replicates based on a morphotextural fingerprint.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Shallow classification using manually defined features.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image overview of 1321N1 (top) and SH-SY5Y (bottom) cells after cell painting (CP) staining acquired at higher magnification (Plan Apo VC 60xA WI DIC N2, NA = 1.20).

id="s2-2"><title>Convolutional neural network outperforms random forest in cell type classification</title><p>To evaluate whether the morphotextural fingerprint could be used to predict cell type, we performed Random Forest (RF) classification using the full feature dataset, using different seeds for splitting up the data into training and validation sets. This resulted in a rather poor accuracy (F-score: 0.75±0.01), mainly caused by the significant (46%) misclassification of 1321N1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The imbalance in recall and precision was surprising given the clear separation of cell populations in UMAP space using the same feature matrix. When inspecting the main contributions to the RF classifier using the mean decrease in impurity, we found very similar features as highlighted in UMAP space to add to the discrimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Where the most important features (e.g. Cellular Area, Channel 1 Contrast) showed the expected gradient along the first UMAP direction, lower ranked parameters (e.g. Cellular Channel 3 Mean Intensity) had no contribution to UMAP separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Reducing noise by removing redundant features (correlation &gt;0.95) could not ameliorate RF classification performance, which may be due to the documented bias in feature selection for node splitting in high-dimensional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). This result drove us to evaluate a different classification approach based on a ResNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">He et al., 2015</xref>) convolutional neuronal network (CNN). Here, we no longer relied on the extraction of ‘hand-crafted’ features from segmented cell objects for training the shallow RF classifier. Instead, we used isotropic image crops of 60 µm centred on individual cell centroids and blanked for their surroundings as input for the CNN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Using this approach, we found a significantly higher prediction performance (F-score of 0.96±0.01), with a much more balanced recall and precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The UMAP space built from the CNN feature embeddings showed a clear cell type separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Even with only 100 training instances per class, the CNN outperformed RF, but optimal performance was attained with 5000 training instances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Both RF and CNN models trained on a combination of three biological replicates (‘Mixed reps.’) performed similarly as models that were trained on only a single replicate (‘Single reps.’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, a model trained on a dataset containing multiple replicates (‘Mixed reps.’) outperformed CNN models that were only trained on a dataset with less variability (‘Single rep.’) when predicting instances of an independent unseen replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This emphasises the need for including sufficient variation in the training set. Although much more performant, CNN classification does not allow direct retrieval of intuitive features, which complicates model interpretation. To gain a visual understanding of image information contributing most to the classification we resorted to Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Selvaraju et al., 2020</xref>). This revealed that the attention of the CNN was mainly focused on cell borders (edge information), and nuclear and nucleolar signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When scrutinizing CNN misclassifications, we found that these are mainly caused by faulty cell detection (e.g. oversegmentation of cell ramifications), unhealthy/dead cells, debris or visibly aberrant cell shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) - errors not necessarily attributed to the CNN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Convolutional neural network classification of monoculture conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of image pre-processing for convolutional neuronal network (CNN) classification.

For all cases (each individual channel), the prediction performance was below or equal to 85,0% indicating that no single channel contains all relevant information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Combinations of two or three channels could not match the prediction accuracy of the full four-channel image either. Thus, we concluded that all channels contribute to the successful classification. As the CNN directly uses image crops as input, the image quality will determine the classification performance. Therefore, we assessed the impact of resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We simulated the effect of decreasing spatial resolution through progressive pixel binning from 192 pixels (original, pixel size 0.3 µm) to 9 pixels (pixel size 6 µm). For each iteration, three CNN models were trained and evaluated. A reduction in pixel size from 0.3 µm to 0.6 µm did not result in a significantly lower prediction performance, but decreasing the spatial resolution further caused a progressive decrease in F-score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In a similar manner, we tested the impact of decreasing SNR (by increasing the level of Gaussian noise) on classification accuracy. Starting from an original SNR value of 20.05 dB, we found that the F-score started to decrease when lowering the SNR below 14.27 dB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Required input quality for cell type classification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Performance of the convolutional neuronal network (CNN) when only a selection of image channels is given as training input.

We attribute this to the predictive power of the nuclear size, which is a dominant discriminating feature between the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the relatively overt phenotypic difference between 1321N1 and SH-SY5Y cells, we asked whether the CNN could also discriminate more subtle phenotypes. To this end, we used 1321N1 cells and two related retinal pigment epithelial cell lines, hTERT-immortalized RPE1 and the spontaneously immortalized variant ARPE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The CNN discriminated all three cell lines with a high accuracy of 95,06±2,51%. Unsupervised UMAP dimensionality reduction using the CNN feature embeddings revealed three clusters of ROIs, with the two RPE lines located closer together - but still well separated - in comparison to the morphologically more distinct 1321N1 cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Together, this work illustrates that a CNN approach can be used to distinguish diverse cell types within a given image quality window.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Nucleocentric predictions remain accurate regardless of culture density</title><p>Morphological profiling relies on accurate cell detection. This may become difficult in dense cultures such as iPSC-cultures, clustered cells, tissues, and tissue-mimics. Having established a method to distinguish cell types with high accuracy, we next asked how robust the classification was to increasing cell density. To this end, we acquired images of 1321N1 and SH-SY5Y monocultures, grown at densities ranging from 0 to 100% confluency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on the nuclear count, we binned individual fields into 6 density classes (0–20%, 20–40%, 40–60%, 60–80%, 80–95%, 95–100%) and trained a CNN with equal sampling of cell numbers per density class to avoid bias. No decrease in accuracy was observed until the culture density reached 80% confluency. At very high densities (95–100%), we found a significant decrease in the prediction accuracy (F-score: 0.92±0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We reasoned that under these conditions cell shape would be predominantly determined by neighbouring cells and cell segmentation performance would decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nuclei are less malleable and even in dense cultures remain largely separated, allowing their robust segmentation and avoiding CNN misclassifications resulting from segmentation errors. Hence, we asked whether using the nuclear ROI as input would improve classification performance at high densities. However, despite the relatively high average F-score of 0.91±0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the performance was consistently lower than whole cell ROI across the density range and the performance still decreased with full confluency. To understand these results, we inspected the GradCAM output for these predictions and found that an important part of the attention of the CNN was diverted to the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">7</xref>). We interpret this result as the CNN using the background as a proxy for nuclear size. To rule out bias by setting the background to zero in nuclear crops, the CNN was also trained on the same crops with randomly speckled backgrounds, but despite a shift in attention to the nucleus, similar prediction performance was attained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The classification performance was not biased by segmentation errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8A</xref>) but may be influenced by the fact that the nuclear area is affected by culture density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8B</xref>). In highly dense cultures, the dynamic range of the nuclear size reduces as all nuclei become more compact and the nuclear size range decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8B</xref>). Thence, we tested an intermediate condition which exploits the more robust nuclear segmentation but also includes part of the (sub-)cellular local surrounding information as input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8C</xref>). To identify the optimal patch size, we varied the size of a square box centred around the nuclear centroid from 0.6 to 150 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Within a range of 12–18 µm, we found a maximal F-score of 0.96±0.02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Further increasing the nucleocentric patch size did not majorly affect the F-score but significantly decreased the precision and variability of recall for CNN predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Hence, for further experiments, a nucleocentric patch size of 18 µm was used. GradCAM images revealed that this latter approach led the CNN to focus on perinuclear structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">7</xref>). Interestingly, when using this nucleocentric approach, the prediction performance was maintained at almost confluent cell densities in contrast with whole cell approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, we conclude that using a nucleocentric region as input for the CNN is a valuable strategy for accurate cell type identification in dense cultures and that this method is not very sensitive to the patch size.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Required regional input for accurate convolutional neuronal network (CNN) training in cultures of high density.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Selected images and insets for increasing culture density with the density categories used for CNN training.

As our goal was to allow cell type prediction in complex, heterogeneous cultures, we next switched to a more faithful situation in which we co-cultured both cell types. Ground-truth for these predictions was generated by either performing post-hoc immunofluorescence (IF) staining with cell-type specific antibodies (CD44 for 1321N1 and TUBB3 for SH-SY5Y cells), or by differential replication labelling (i.e. by incubating the two cell types with EdU and BrdU, respectively, prior to mixing them), after dye quenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Radtke et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Replication labelling proved significantly more successful for binary ground truth classification (through intensity thresholding) than IF staining for the cell lines we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When training a CNN to recognize the cell types using these markers as ground truth, we found that the prediction accuracy on the left-out dataset of the co-culture (Co2Co) was almost as high as when a model was trained and tested on monocultures (Mono2Mono) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We then tested whether it was possible to train a classifier based on monocultures only, for cell type prediction of cells in co-culture (Mono2Co). This resulted in an F-score of 0.86±0.01%. This drop in performance may be caused by the effect on cell phenotype exerted by the presence of other cell types in mixed cultures which is not captured in monocultures. As the images from monocultures and co-cultures were obtained from different plates, we suspected inter-replicate variability in culture and staining procedures to contribute in part to the lesser performance. Therefore, we tested whether we could improve the performance of the CNN by including monocultures from the same plate as the co-cultures. This finetuning indeed improved the average performance to 0.88±0.01%, and more importantly, it significantly reduced the variability (coefficient of variation) of the predictions making it more reproducible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

Thence, we applied our nucleocentric phenotyping pipeline to stage the maturity of a neuronal cell culture based on its cell type composition. Using a guided protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell et al., 2019</xref>), two differentiation stages were simulated: a primed stage, where most cells are assumed to be cycling neural progenitors (NPCs), and a differentiated stage where most cells are post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The two cell types were discriminated by post-hoc IF staining for the cell cycle marker Ki67 (NPC) and the microtubule marker ß-III-tubulin (TUBB3, neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Not all cells in the CP image could be assigned with a ground truth label due to cell detachment upon re-staining or sheer absence of the tested marker. Since no single monoculture consists of 100% of either cell type, we applied gates to retain only those cells that showed unequivocal staining for either one of both markers. Based on these gates, ROIs were either classified as neuron (Ki67-/TUBB3+), NPC (Ki67+/TUBB3-), or undefined (outside of gating boundaries). We assume the latter category to represent transitioning cells in intermediate stages of neural development, un- or dedifferentiated iPSCs. This gating strategy resulted in a fractional abundance of neurons vs. total (neurons+NPC) of 36.4% in the primed condition and 80.0% in the differentiated condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In a first attempt to classify cells within the guided culture, we trained a CNN on individual cell inputs using the culture condition (primed or differentiated) as ground truth, which given the heterogeneity, can be considered as a weak label. This resulted in an F-score of 0.86±.,01%. When we used the cell-level IF ground truth labels instead, we obtained a classification performance of 0.96±0.00%. For comparison, a shallow learner (RF), showed a significantly lower F-score of 0.87±0.02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Applying this cell-based (as opposed to condition-based) CNN to the two culture conditions resulted in a predicted fractional abundance of neurons to NPC of 40,5% in images of the primed condition and 74.2% in images of the differentiated condition – aligning well with the manually defined ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Both supervised and unsupervised UMAP dimensionality reduction on the feature embeddings of the cell-based classifier revealed a clear clustering of both phenotypes suggesting that the CNN captures the differences in morphotextural fingerprint between neurons and NPCs well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We then went on to evaluate the established cell-based classifier to a primed neuronal cell culture undergoing gradual spontaneous differentiation after dual SMAD inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2012</xref>. We examined cell cultures at 13, 30, 60, and 90 days in vitro (DIV) after the start of the differentiation process and visually confirmed a gradual change in neural maturity by the progressive increase of cells with smaller somas and long, thin ramifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

Therefore, we tested whether the cell-based approach could be extended to these cell types as well. We generated monocultures of iPSC-derived astrocytes, neurons, and microglia from the same parental iPSC line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and trained a nucleocentric CNN to identify each cell type. This led to a prediction accuracy of 96.81±0.95% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Recognizing that these cell types are visibly morphologically distinct, we tested the robustness of the model to experimental perturbations in cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To this end, we induced reactivity in the iPSC-derived microglial culture by LPS treatment. A CNN trained on monocultures of neurons, unchallenged or LPS-treated microglia showed high accuracy in differentiating neurons from microglia (98% accurate), although the difference between reactive and resting-state microglia in this tripartite model proved more challenging (71% and 90% accuracy, resp.). Repeating those experiments in mixed cultures of neurons and microglia (using Tubb3, resp. Iba1 as ground-truth IF markers), yielded an F-score of 0.98±0.01 for the classification of neurons vs. microglia (for comparison, a classical RF approach only returned an F-score of 0.86±0.03) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In the presence of LPS, the CNN model yielded a high F-score of 0.97±0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This implies that the shift in cell state does not significantly affect the CNN’s ability to distinguish neurons from microglia. When implementing a tiered approach, in which after neuron-microglia recognition a second model was tasked with the classification of reactive vs. resting state microglia without the presence of neurons, this phenotype proved more challenging for the CNN to predict, as evidenced by an F-score of 0.80±0.01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that nucleocentric phenotyping can be used to gauge the cell type composition of iPSC-derived cultures.

With our work, we have developed a method to identify neural cell types in mixed cultures to aid in their validation and application in routine screening settings. We first benchmarked our approach using neural cell lines and found that a CNN-based approach outperforms shallow learning (RF) based on handcrafted feature extraction, even with a limited number of input images. This aligns well with recent data showing CNN-based feature representations outperform shallow techniques for condition-based drug response prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dincer et al., 2018</xref>). To assess the robustness and sensitivity of deep learning for cell-type prediction, we evaluated the CNN performance as a function of input data size and quality. Next, we tested the performance of predictions for dense single and multi-cellular cultures. Finally, we assessed its performance in the presence of different cell states.</p><p>Although benchmarking revealed a minimal image resolution of 0.6 µm/pixel and SNR of approximately 10 dB for optimal CNN performance, lower-quality images may still yield acceptable performance, especially with the use of advanced image restoration algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weigert et al., 2018</xref>). We found that all channels contribute to the overall prediction accuracy but that the whole cell is not required to obtain the highest performance. In line with earlier studies that highlight the biomarker potential of the nucleus for patient stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">De Vos et al., 2010</xref>), cell state identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heckenbach et al., 2022</xref>), or drug response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cimini et al., 2023</xref>), we found that the nuclear ROI as such already carries highly distinctive information for cell type prediction. However, extension to its direct surroundings proved to be the best and most robust input across a range of cell densities. The nucleocentric approach is based on more robust nuclear segmentation, reducing segmentation errors whilst still retaining input information from the structures directly surrounding the nucleus. At higher cell density, the whole-cell segmentation becomes more error-prone, while also losing morphological information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The nucleocentric approach is more consistent as it relies on a more robust segmentation and does not blank the surrounding region. This way it also buffers for occasional nuclear segmentation errors (e.g. where blebs or parts of the nucleus are left undetected). GradCAM maps on nucleocentric crops highlight specifically those structures surrounding the nucleus (reflecting ER, mitochondria, Golgi) indicating their importance in correct cell classification. Stepwise in- and decreasing the size of the nucleocentric window in a range between 12 and 60 µm revealed that this approach is not sensitive to alterations in patch size. We therefore conclude that the superior performance of the nucleocentric approach in dense cultures stems from a reduced susceptibility to segmentation errors. It opens possibilities for applying cell profiling in the future to even more complex 3D cell systems such as tissue or organoid slices, where accurate cell segmentation becomes extremely challenging. Indeed, our results indicate that it might be possible to discriminate individual cells in extremely crowded environments. For specific applications such as the classification of healthy vs. tumour tissue, binary classification models can prove useful. It has been shown that a dual-task graph neural network can classify epithelioid and sarcomatoid tumor cells with the cellular resolution for accurate mesothelioma subtype determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eastwood et al., 2023</xref>). However, the diversity of cell types and intermediates present in tissue may complicate classification and demand richer ground truth to refine such predictions. In the future, it may even be possible to include volumetric information, but this will require optimisation of the sample preparation procedures as well. To increase the accuracy, one could resort to intelligent data augmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mikolajczyk and Grochowski, 2018</xref>) or transfer learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>) strategies.</p><p>One crucial realisation of this work is that cell types can be identified in mixed cultures solely using the input from monocultures. This implies that cells retain their salient characteristics even in more complex heterogeneous environments. While for now, predictions are still superior when training directly on mixed cultures, we found that the prediction accuracy of monoculture-trained models can be increased by employing replicate controls. This suggests that it may become possible to apply or adapt existing models without the need for a cell-level ground truth as provided by post-hoc labelling. This technique could potentially be of use for cultures or tissues where no antibody- or pre-labelling is possible (e.g. no unique IF marker is available, non-replicating cells). While a ground-truth independent method holds promise for bulk predictions (e.g. for quality control purposes), the use of post-hoc labelling allows the building of more refined models that can distinguish multiple cell types, and/or cell states at once. Especially using cyclic staining or spatial transcriptomics, much richer information content can be gained. Multiplexed imaging has previously shown its utility in gaining in-depth information on culture composition and differentiation status in iPSC-derived neural cultures progenitor, radial glia, astrocytes (immature and mature) and neurons (inhibitory and excitatory) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomov et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, this could be expanded to cell states (apoptosis, DNA damage), although current prediction performance strongly varies with the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Way et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Applying the method to iPSC-neuronal cultures revealed its potential to score their differentiation state. Although guided protocols managed to speed up the differentiation process and lead to enhanced culture purity, the neural differentiation process was not binary, as evidenced by the mixed presence of Ki67+/TUBB3- and Ki67-/TUBB3 + cells. The spontaneous differentiation protocol on the other hand illustrated the unpredictable nature and slow nature of the differentiation process. Many groups highlight the difficulty of reproducible neural differentiation and attribute this to culture conditions, cultivation time, and variation in developmental signalling pathways in the source iPSC material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Strano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galiakberova et al., 2023</xref>). Spontaneous neural differentiation typically requires around 80 days before mature neurons arise that show circuit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shi et al., 2012</xref>), but the exact timing and duration vary. This variation negatively affects the statistical power when testing drug interventions and thus prohibits the application of iPSC-culture derivatives in routine drug screening. We have shown that CP captures the morphological changes associated with neural differentiation, allowing us to reliably predict the gradual transition from NPC to a more differentiated state. We recognize that differentiating iPSC cultures are highly heterogenous and are composed of a landscape of transitioning progenitors in various stages of maturity that our binary models currently fail to capture. We filtered out these cells with a ‘dubious’ IF profile as they would negatively affect the model by introducing noise. In future iterations, one could envision defining more refined cell (sub-)types in a population based on richer post-hoc information (e.g. through cyclic immunofluorescence or spatial single-cell transcriptomics). While we emphasize the value of identifying fixed states as a fast-track to gather the composition of an iPSC-derived culture, an equally valuable angle consists of embracing the continuum of states that such cultures represent. Here, predictions would then demand regression-based approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du and Xu, 2017</xref>). Pioneering efforts using live-cell imaging and machine learning have allowed predicting gradual cell state transitions, for example in the context of myoblast, adipocyte, or osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shakarchy et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mai et al., 2023</xref>). Label-free timelapse imaging has also shown potential in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shakarchy et al., 2024</xref>). Given that many of the cell painting dyes are compatible with live cells, it is conceivable that our approach is amenable to further refining the assessment of iPSC differentiation status in real-time, e.g., with the inclusion of brightfield or phase contrast images.</p><p>After testing the CNN performance on heterogenous cultures, we have added an additional layer of complexity by inducing microglial reactivity in a coculture of neurons and microglia. We found that we could still predict the cell type regardless of the treatment. The increased variability within the microglial subpopulation did not impact the CNNs’ ability to discriminate cell types in mixed culture. Furthermore, using the layered approach, the resting-state and reactive subgroups within the microglial population could also be classified, albeit with a lesser prediction accuracy. This could be explained by the fact that microglia grown in vitro are not completely homeostatic, even in the absence of LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gosselin et al., 2017</xref>), and may require different cell types to adopt a more natural state. Having more faithful mixed cultures with cells in their endogenous states, and an apt tool to recognize both cell type and state, holds promise to enhance the relevance of preclinical screens, to increase the accuracy of drug targets, and ultimately, to lead to more precise therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engle et al., 2018</xref>). For now, we have tailored models to the individual datasets, but it is conceivable that a more generalized CNN could be established for multiple culture types. This would obviously demand a much larger dataset to encompass the variability encountered in such models (e.g. various starting iPSC lines, and various differentiation protocols). Publicly available datasets (e.g. JUMP-cell painting consortium) can aid in creating an input database containing a large variability (different iPSC lines, different neural differentiation protocols, …), which would ultimately lead to a more robust predictor. Our results showing the prediction accuracy of a guided differentiation model on spontaneously differentiating cultures indicate that the approach can be transferred to other differentiation protocols as well. Inclusion of more input images and variability should thus enable the developing of a generalist model for other differentiation protocols without the need for ground truth validation and further CNN training.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a novel application for unbiased morphological profiling by extending its use to complex mixed neural cultures using sequential multispectral imaging and convolutional network-informed cell phenotype classification. We show that the resulting predictors are robust with respect to biological variation and cell culture density. This method holds promise for use in the quality control of iPSC cultures to allow their routine use in high-throughput and high-content screening applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 1321N1 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID::CVCL_0110">CVCL_0110</ext-link>; cat. nr.: 86030402) and SH-SY5Y (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_0019">CVCL_0019</ext-link>; cat.nr.: 94030304) cell lines were maintained in DMEM-F12 +Glutamax (Gibco, 10565018) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Gibco, 10500064).

Lifting the plate of the microscope stage and imaging in sequential rounds after several days results in small linear translations in the exact location of each image. These linear translations need to be corrected to align morphological with ground truth image data within the same ROI. All images were aligned using Fourier-based image cross correlation on the intensity-normalized multichannel images.

Image2 was then moved according to the predetermined shift to align morphological with ground truth images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Ground truth phenotyping</title><p>The true cell phenotype was determined by the fluorescence intensity of the post-hoc immunostaining with class-specific markers or pre-labelling with Edu/Brdu. In this latter case, the base analogues were incorporated into each cell line prior to mixing them, i.e., when they were still growing in monoculture so they could be labelled and identified after co-seeding and morphological profiling. Each ground truth image was imported alongside the corresponding cell mask for that image. For each cell label, the fluorescence intensity was determined and tabulated.

Due to the harsh sample preparation and repeated washing steps, cells could detach from the imaging substrate thus resulting in lack of ground truth information for those cells. As a result, all ROIs for which there was no DAPI signal detected in the ground truth image, were removed from the dataset as incomplete. (2) Cells for which the ground truth fluorescence intensity was ambiguous. Ground truth labels were determined based on the presence of specific IF staining in either of the phenotype classes. If no class-specific IF staining was detected by thresholding, no true label could be assigned. These ROIs were, therefore, discarded due to uncertainty. (3) Likelihood of faulty ROI detection. The DAPI signal was used to discard ROIs that do not represent (complete) cells by thresholding on minimal DAPI intensity (mean nuclear DAPI intensity &gt;500) and minimal nuclear size (nuclear area &gt;160).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ROI classification</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Train-validation-test split</title><p>Model training requires splitting the available data in three subsets: training (60%), validation (10%), and testing (30%). The training dataset was used to train the machine learning models (either RF or CNN). The validation dataset, composing of 10% of the total data, was used to determine the hyperparameters and intermediate testing. The remaining 30% of the dataset was kept apart and used to test the final model when training is completed. For both RF and CNN, the testing dataset was never shown to the model during the training phase, but only used after training to determine the accuracy of predictions to the ground truth. The number of instances for each class was equalized by sampling equal number of instances from each predicted class. To account for variation between technical replicates, the train-validation-test split was stratified per well. As a result, no datapoints arising from the same well could appear simultaneously in the training, validation and testing subset. This data stratification was repeated 3 times with different random seeds (see Methods – Reproducibility).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Random forest</title><p>For each ROI, a set of manually defined parameters was extracted corresponding to cell shape (area, convex area, filled area, length minor axis, length major axis, centroid, eccentricity, equivalent diameter area, ferret diameter max, orientation, perimeter, solidity), texture (GLCM: contrast, dissimilarity, homogeneity, energy, correlation, ASM) and intensity (maximal intensity, minimal intensity, mean intensity, standard deviation intensity). This was done for three regions (nucleus, cytoplasm and complete cell), and for all channel dimensions. Redundant parameters could be removed if above a 0.95 correlation threshold.

In contrast to classical machine learning techniques, no handcrafted features were extracted. Crops were defined based on the segmentation mask for each ROI. The bounding box was cropped out of the original image with a fixed patch size (60 µm for whole cells, 18 µm for nucleus and nucleocentric crops) surrounding the centroid of the segmentation mask. For the whole cell and nuclear crops, all pixels outside of the segmentation mask were set to zero. This was not the case for the nucleocentric crops. Each ROI was cropped out of the original morphological image and associated with metadata corresponding to its ground truth label. Images alongside their labels were fed to the network. Tensors were normalized per channel. Models are trained on a minimum of 5000 training inputs of each class for 50 epochs (training iterations). Each batch consisted of 100 samples. The training input was augmented by linear transformations (horizontal and vertical flip, random rotation). Each epoch, the current model was tested against a validation dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The performance of the model on this validation subset determined whether the model was stored as new best (if the new accuracy exceeded the accuracy of the previous best model) or discarded. The learning rate at the start was set at 0,0001 and automatically reduced with a factor of 0,1 during training when no improvement was seen after 10 epochs. After 50 epochs, the best resulting model was tested on a separate test dataset to determine the accuracy on previously unseen data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>GradCAM</title><p>GradCAM analysis was used to visualize the regions used by the CNN for classification.

These models were trained on 3 independent experiments where ground truth pre-labelling (Edu/BrdU) was performed at least once on either of the cell lines in coculture.

Machine learning models were trained to classify single cell types according to either &quot;engineered&quot; features derived from the image or from the raw CP multiplexed image. The authors systematically evaluated experimental (e.g., cell density, cell types, fluorescent channels) and computational (e.g., different models, different cell regions) parameters and convincingly demonstrated that focusing on the nucleus and its surroundings contain sufficient information for robust and accurate cell type classification. Models that were trained on mono-cultures (i.e., containing a single cell type) could generalize for cell type prediction in mixed co-cultures, and to describe intermediate states of the maturation process of iPSC-derived neural progenitors to differentiation neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Automatically identifying single cell types in heterogeneous mixed cell populations hold great promise to characterize mixed cell populations and to discover new rules of spatial organization and cell-cell communication. Although the current manuscript focuses on the application of quality control of iPSC cultures, the same approach can be extended to a wealth of other applications including in depth study of the spatial context. The simple and high-content assay democratizes use and enables adoption by other labs.</p><p>The manuscript is supported by comprehensive experimental and computational validations that raises the bar beyond the current state of the art in the field of highcontent phenotyping and makes this manuscript especially compelling. These include (i) Explicitly assessing replication biases (batch effects); (ii) Direct comparison of featurebased (a la cell profiling) versus deep-learning-based classification (which is not trivial/obvious for the application of cell profiling); (iii) Systematic assessment of the contribution of each fluorescent channel; (iv) Evaluation of cell-density dependency; (v) explicit examination of mistakes in classification; (vi) Evaluating the performance of different spatial contexts around the cell/nucleus; (vii) generalization of models trained on cultures containing a single cell type (mono-cultures) to mixed co-cultures; (viii) application to multiple classification tasks.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>I have consulted with Reviewer #3 and both of us were impressed by revised manuscript, especially by the clear and convincing evidence regarding the nucleocentric model use of the nuclear periphery and its benefit for the case of dense cultures. However, there are two issues that are incompletely addressed (see below). Until these are resolved, the &quot;strength of evidence&quot; was elevated to &quot;compelling&quot;.</p><p>First, the analysis of the patch size is not clearly indicating that the 12-18um range is a critical factor (Fig. 4E). On the contrary, the performance seems to be not very sensitive to the patch size, which is actually a desired property for a method. Still, Fig. 4B convincingly shows that the nucleocentric model is not sensitive to the culture density, while the other models are. Thus, the authors can adjust their text saying that the nucleocentric approach is not sensitive to the patch size and that the patch size is selected to capture the nucleus and some margins around it, making it less prone to segmentation errors in dense cultures.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is a significant tolerance to different patch sizes, and have therefore reformulated the conclusion as suggested in the results and the discussion sections (page 10 and 16). As very large patch sizes (&gt;40µm) do increase the variability of the predictions and the imbalance between recall and precision, we have left this observation in the results section, as it also motivates for using smaller patch sizes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the GitHub does not contain sufficient information to reproduce the analysis. Its current state is sparse with documentation that would make reproducing the work difficult. What versions of the software were used? Where should data be downloaded? The README contains references to many different argparse CLI arguments, but sparse details on what these arguments actually are, and which parameters the authors used to perform their analyses. Links to images are broken. Ideally, all of these details would be present, and the authors would include a step-by-step tutorial on how to reproduce their work. Fixing this will lead to an &quot;exceptional&quot; strength of evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional information to the GitHub to increase the reproducibility of the analysis.</p><p>• The README now contains additional documentation and more extensive explanations. A flowchart has been added, making the dataflow and order of analyses more clear.</p><p>• The accompanying dataset is 20GB in size and can be downloaded as a .zip-file from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Nucleocentric-Profiling/27141441?file=49522557">https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Nucleocentric-Profiling/27141441?file=49522557</ext-link>. This file contains 2x480 raw images and a layout file.</p><p>• The used software versions are included in the manuscript in table 4. To increase the reproducibility, a Conda environment file (.yaml) has been added to the GitHub. This can be installed and contains the correct package versions.</p><p>• The README now contains for each script and its arguments a short description on its meaning, on whether it is required or optional and its default setting.</p><p>• A step-by-step tutorial on the use of the test dataset has been included. This tutorial includes the arguments used to run the code from the command line terminal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>There are no reference from the text to Fig. 2D and to Fig. 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been changed. The text has been added to the manuscript at page 6 (fig. 2D) and the reference to Fig. 3C has been included at page 8.</p></body></sub-article></article>
