They endanger over 600 native species and have driven 14 to extinction. Additionally, they pose a significant zoonotic disease risk, carrying pathogens such as Brucella, leptospirosis, and Japanese encephalitis. Understanding and controlling disease spread relies on models of social dynamics, but these vary widely across regions, limiting the transferability of findings from the USA and Europe to other locations like Australia. This study addresses this gap by analysing the social interactions of 146 GPS-tracked feral pigs in Australia using a proximity-based social network approach. Findings reveal that females exhibit stronger group cohesion, while males act as key connectors between groups. Contact rates are high within groups, facilitating rapid intra-group disease spread, whereas inter-group transmission is slower. Seasonal variations further impact dynamics, with increased contact in summer. These insights suggest that targeting adult males in control programs could help limit disease outbreaks. Given the rising economic and public health concerns associated with animal diseases, the study highlights the need for localized strategies based on feral pig social behaviour to enhance global control efforts.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sometimes pigs and other domestic animals escape from farms and live independently in a similar way to their wild ancestors. Such animals and their offspring are referred to as âferalâ. In Australia, USA and many other countries across the world, feral pigs damage ecosystems and farmland, and carry Japanese encephalitis and other diseases that can spread to humans, livestock, and wildlife.</p><p>To understand and control these threats, researchers study how feral pigs move around and interact with each other, which is referred to as &quot;social dynamics&quot;. However, previous studies have focused on groups of feral pigs living in Europe and may not be applicable to pigs living in Australia and other parts of the world. This lack of local data on social dynamics has made it difficult to optimise models of how diseases spread amongst feral pigs in certain areas. Optimising such models is crucial for enabling government agencies to prepare and respond to potential disease outbreaks in humans and other animals.</p><p>Proboste et al. analysed tracking data collected over a 7-year period from satellite transmitters attached to 146 feral pigs in eastern Australia. The analysis assessed how often the animals came close to each other and how this might influence the spread of diseases, revealing that females tended to remain within the same groups of pigs, while males were more likely to move between groups. The levels of contact between individual pigs varied across the year, with more contact during the summer months.</p><p>These findings show that male pigs play a key role in connecting different groups of feral pigs and may therefore be important targets for managing diseases in these animals. The findings also highlight that contact varies across the year, which might help pinpoint the best time to carry out management practices. In the future, this will help government agencies develop more effective strategies for managing feral pigs in Australia and other areas where their presence poses a risk to humans, livestock and native wildlife.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sus scrofa</kwd><kwd>feral pigs</kwd><kwd>network analysis</kwd><kwd>contact rate</kwd><kwd>disease modeling</kwd><kwd>australia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2008937</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soares-Magalhaes</surname><given-names>Ricardo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010000</institution-id><institution>NSW Department of Primary Industries</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Proboste</surname><given-names>Tatiana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Distinct seasonal peaks and sex-specific interactions reveal that cohesive female groups drive rapid local spread while male connectors facilitate intergroup transmission, underscoring the need for tailored disease control strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Feral pigs (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>) threaten biodiversity in 54 countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Risch et al., 2021</xref>), and cause an estimated $120 billion of damage annually in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pimental, 2007</xref>). Feral pigs imperil over 600 native species, and have directly driven 14 species to extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Risch et al., 2021</xref>), and cause significant economic loss to agricultural industries through negative impacts on water quality, extensive ground rooting, lamb predation, and crop and pasture consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bengsen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Feral pigs can be reservoir hosts of multiple infectious diseases of economic and/or animal health significance. This is particularly important for the continent of Australia, where many diseases are exotic, including foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), swine vesicular disease, Aujeszkyâs disease, and African and Classical swine fever (ASF and CSF). The potential economic impact of these diseases is substantial. For instance, an incursion of FMD is estimated to cost Australia $50 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buetre, 2013</xref>) and the incursion of ASF can cost up to 2.5 billion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Slatyer, 2023</xref>). Feral pig populations in Australia can also be a source of zoonotic pathogens of public health importance including <italic>Brucella suis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pearson, 2012</xref>), <italic>Leptospira interrogans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Orr et al., 2022</xref>), <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>), and Japanese encephalitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Northern Territory Government, 2022</xref>). Despite ongoing control measures that aim to reduce feral pig impacts, the threat of spillover of infectious diseases to domestic animals, wildlife, and human populations in Australia remains significant due to persistent feral pig populations.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>What is Australia doing to avoid the impact?</title><p>National preparedness for the incursion of diseases that are spread by feral pig activity relies on the development and validation of disease transmission models. Australia invests significant resources as part of the planning and prevention of new disease incursions and has developed the Australian Animal Disease Spread (AADIS) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradhurst et al., 2015</xref>) for ASF and FMD. However, the performance of AADIS relies on adequate parameterisation of real-world feral pig contact rates, which is particularly challenging to obtain an estimate in wild pig populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craft, 2015</xref>). Currently, contact rate estimates needed to optimise the AADIS were obtained from European feral pig population studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">PodgÃ³rski et al., 2018</xref>), and remain unavailable for Australian feral pig populations. Locally relevant data on feral pigs contact rates will provide more reliable parameters to model the disease transmission rate in feral pig populations.</p><sec id="s1-1-1"><title>Contact rates are imperative for disease models</title><p>To estimate disease spread, the force of infection is needed (Î²), which can be estimated by knowing the population of the contact rate (Î³), the probability that contact is made with infected individuals, and the probability of pathogen transmission given a contact (<italic>K</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craft, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and May, 1992</xref>). Using individual movement network data, we can estimate the contact between individuals in wild populations. Contact rates between individual feral pigs are affected by feral pig social structure and spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005</xref>). Historically, estimating contact rates from GPS tracking data of individuals has been challenging due to the need to set arbitrary time or distance thresholds to define a âcontactâ or from limitations in the interval of the GPS collar recording location. New approaches have been recently developed to refine these calculations and to account for spatial autocorrelation, like continuous-time movement modelling (CTMM), which downscales the recording interval and improves the detection of contacts between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calabrese, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Understanding how animals move in space and time is critical to estimating the rate of infectious disease transmission and to optimising disease transmission models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albery et al., 2021</xref>), to improve the confidence in projected impacts of modelled population control measures. Currently, there is a lack of understanding of contact rates between and within feral pigs, information that is necessary for the development of exotic disease model and contingency plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it is vital to examine feral pig movement behaviours in a heterogeneous landscape, contact rates between individuals, differences in contact rates within and between pig social units (sounders), and to identify sex and age classes which are the most likely to transmit infections in case of an outbreak.</p><p>Contact heterogeneities for feral swine or wild boar have been estimated in different regions. In Poland, significant clustering of individuals was detected and differences in the duration of these associations depended on the sex of the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">PodgÃ³rski et al., 2014</xref>). This reaffirms that dominant boars are primarily solitary, while reproductively active sows and their offspring largely remain in sounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Titus et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayer, 2009</xref>). Feral pig movement and interactions have also been explored with network analysis to estimate contact rates of populations in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pepin et al., 2016</xref>), Germany, and Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">PodgÃ³rski et al., 2018</xref>). For example, the US study found the contact rate between sounders was affected by the distance between the home range, with less contact when home ranges were separated by more than 2 km (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pepin et al., 2016</xref>). The European study found similar results and described that the most frequent association occurred at distances of 0â1 km and more sporadic association at more than 4 km (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">PodgÃ³rski et al., 2018</xref>). However, such data have not been analysed for feral pigs in Australia.</p><p>This study aims to fill a continental gap in our understanding of feral pig social dynamics within and between sounders in eastern Australia, and to investigate differences between direct and indirect contacts. Our goal is to identify specific characteristics, such as demographic variables, which are common among individuals who are central to these networks. The findings from this research will enhance existing ASF models, as well as other pig disease transmission models, by providing empirical data on the structure of feral pig contact networks. Importantly, this approach allows us to identify key individuals that are central to these networks and, therefore, more likely to facilitate the spread of pathogens. This crucial information will greatly enhance the precision and relevance of disease modelling within feral pig populations to inform persistence, spread, and the design and implementation of management actions.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 139,940 location fixes were collated from 146 GPS-monitored feral pigs, 61 females, and 85 males, tracked from 2017â2023 across QLD and NSW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

The incursion of an exotic enzootic disease such as African Swine Fever (ASF) or Foot-and-mouth Disease (FMD) could result in devastating impacts on animal health and welfare, food production systems, and the economy in Australia. Feral pig populations are capable of spreading and maintaining these diseases in the environment, so it is critical to understand what level of contact occurs within and between feral pig populations to better inform disease preparedness. Here, we developed a proximity-based social network for feral pigs in eastern Australia, which elucidates the contact rate among individual pigs, both within and between sounders. The data procured from this network are critical for refining disease models and enhancing preparedness strategies in Australia. This study further revealed that the contact rate among feral pigs is dependent on two primary factors: the sex of the dyad and the season. It was observed that contacts were more prevalent among female dyads. Additionally, a seasonal pattern was discerned in the contact rate, with summer registering the highest frequency of contact. This research is the first of its kind in Australia, offering new insights into the social behaviour of feral pig populations.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Network</title><p>In our comparison of global network measures between direct and indirect networks, we observed that the global transitivity, average local transitivity, and edge density were marginally higher for the indirect networks. This outcome aligns with our expectations, given that indirect networks permit a greater number of connections. This is due to the inclusion of associations between animals that occur when they share the same space within a window of 5 d. Understanding this indirect network is crucial for assessing the risk of pathogen dispersal, particularly when the pathogens exhibit prolonged persistence in the environment.</p><p>On the other hand, for the node-level networks measures, we found that females had higher strength in the direct network in comparison with males, likely due to greater group cohesion of females within a sounder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, males had a positive effect on betweenness in the indirect network, indicating that they are likely to connect independent groups through individuals with a higher tendency to move between different groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farine and Whitehead, 2015</xref>). The role of male feral pigs in connecting sounders should have important implications for the design of disease or population management strategies. For example, removal of adult females is typically seen as more important for sustained control programs aiming to reduce density-dependent damage caused by feral pigs because these individuals make the greatest contribution to population growth. However, the removal of adult males may be more important for control programs that aim to contain outbreaks of infectious disease because these individuals are likely to make the greatest contribution to disease transmission between sounders. Intensive population control can also cause surviving animals to change their spatial behaviour, resulting in increased risk of transmission or spillover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ham et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Home range</title><p>Previous research that studied four of the feral pig populations included in this study, found that home range was not affected by season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wilson et al., 2023a</xref>). In this study, we did not explore the effect of season on feral pig home range, but rather focused on home range overlap between a dyad. The results of our analyses indicated that dyad (pair of individuals) had a greater home range overlap during summer and followed by autumn.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Contact rate</title><p>The ability for disease to spread relies on many factors. Both direct and indirect contact with pathogens can have significant impact on disease transmission, and so it is important to consider both for epidemiological modelling. Direct contact, where an infected pig is in physical contact with a susceptible pig, is the primary method of transmission for diseases such as ASF and Food Mouth Disease. However, these diseases (e.g. ASF being viable for up to 5 d at 25 CÂ° <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mazur-Panasiuk and WoÅºniakowski, 2020</xref>), may also have indirect methods of transmission, for example, through ingestion of contaminated feed, survival of the pathogen in the soil or water sources or possible vectors, such as ticks. Understanding rates of indirect contacts are, therefore, highly relevant in understanding the risk of disease transmission.</p><p>Most <bold>contact occurred within sounders</bold>. We also found that the sex of the dyad statistically affects the contact rate. In our study, we found that female-female dyads were most frequent within the same sounder, which can be partly explained by the fact that sounders are composed mainly of adult females, sub-adults, and juveniles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Spencer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boitani et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabor et al., 1999</xref>). Our results differ from a previous study on feral pigs in the United States, which described no significant effect of sex for either direct contact or indirect contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pepin et al., 2016</xref>). This could be partly explained by the tendency of females to travel significantly less distance per day, with an average of 3.6 km compared to 4.9 km for males and, therefore, having more frequent female-female contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilson et al., 2023b</xref>).</p><p>The estimated contact rate was higher within animals from the same sounder than between sounder, which mean that disease could spread quickly within a sounder and may take longer between sounders. This result has been previously reported for wild boar populations in Europe, where they also found that contact rates between sounders were dependent on the distance between the groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">PodgÃ³rski et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, within the sounder, the sex of the dyad played a significant role in the direct contact rate, while between sounder this dyadâs sex is not statistically significant.</p><p>For <bold>contact rates between sounders</bold>, we found that sex influenced the rate for indirect contact only, with fewer contacts between males when compared to female-female. These results are in contrast to a study on wild boars in Europe that described no effect of animal sex on the association between sounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">PodgÃ³rski et al., 2018</xref>). For both direct and indirect contact rates between sounders, male-male dyad and female-male dyad had a negative effect.</p><p>We found that the contact rate within and between sounders was dynamic across the different seasons, which is similar to what has previously been described in wild boars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). We found significant differences between seasons with a higher contact rate in summer. This difference in seasonality is critical for understanding management of feral pig populations, but are also important for optimising disease transmission models such as the AADIS model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradhurst, 2021</xref>). The incursion and transmission of a new virus into a susceptible feral pig population may spread differently under varying conditions depending on season. For example, controlling an outbreak during summer would potentially require more resources than an outbreak in other seasons due to the higher number of contacts between individuals during summer. The findings from this study suggest that the incursion of a virus in summer would have a higher impact on the feral pig population (between and within sounders) than comparatively if it were introduced in autumn.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>Different populations in our study had varying numbers of collared individuals, with some populations having only two individuals at certain times. This variability in sample size across populations is a limitation when interpreting the results. Small populations are often the result of a few individuals being trapped and collared, and this does not necessarily reflect the actual number of individuals in those groups. This issue creates bias when calculating connections between individuals. For those populations with only a few collared animals, we may observe very few connections and low network measures. However, this could be due to sparse information rather than a true reflection of the populationâs structure.</p><p>One of the populations (Gebar) is on a small island, which also may incorporate some bias to the network for this location as individuals in that population may have higher contact due to the limited space available.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study highlights the role of sex and seasonality in contact rates, with implications for disease spread and control strategies. Specifically, the higher betweenness of males suggests their crucial role in disease transmission between groups, indicating that removal of adult males may be more effective in containing disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the higher contact rate observed in summer suggests that a virus introduced during this season could have a more significant impact on feral pig populations. These findings have important implications for disease modelling and management of feral pig populations in Australia, aiding in the development of more effective and targeted strategies for disease control and population management.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical approval for the study</title><p>Data from feral pigs fitted with GPS-tracking collars were provided by the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries (DAF) and the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (DPI).

ASF is estimated to remain infectious in the environment for 5 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2023</xref>) and, therefore, for the purpose of our study an indirect contact was defined when two individuals interacted within a 2 or 5 metre buffer within a 5 d interval. These spatiotemporal interaction thresholds aimed to represent indirect contact at populated locations (e.g. waterholes) that are potential hotspots for pathogen exposure. Temporal groups for direct and indirect contact were calculated with R package spatsoc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robitaille et al., 2019</xref>) group_times() function using the temporal thresholds listed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robitaille et al., 2019</xref>).

In the networks, each individual represents a node, and the contact between two individuals represents an edge. A spatial matrix was then created for direct and indirect contact by calculating the edge distances of each individual with the r package spatsoc edge_dist() function using the same degree threshold and split parameters as listed above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Robitaille et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Network analysis</title><p>To estimate the contact between individuals, networks were created for each population and year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farine and Whitehead, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dougherty et al., 2018</xref>).

Node-level network metrics were further calculated with the R package <italic>igraph</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>) including degree centrality, strength, and betweenness for each node. Degree centrality quantifies the number of connections an individual has. The more connections an individual has, the higher their degree of centrality. Strength, on the other hand, encapsulates the robustness of these connections. The more time two individuals spend connected, the greater the strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farine and Whitehead, 2015</xref>). Lastly, node betweenness measures the number of paths that pass through a node (or individual) to connect two other nodes. In other words, it quantifies how often an individual serves as the quickest link between two other individuals in a network. Betweenness is a crucial measure in the context of disease transmission, as it indicates how frequently an individual could potentially transmit a disease between two others. Global network measures were also calculated, including, average local transitivity, global transitivity, edge density, number of nodes, mean distance, and number of edges for each population and by year. Transitivity measures the likelihood that the adjacent edges of a node are connected (ratio of count of triangles). The local transitivity gives a measure of how interconnected a nodeâs neighbours are, and the global transitivity measure the overall level of transitivity in the network. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Csardi and Nepusz, 2006</xref>). We also calculated these measures for the three thresholds (2, 5 and 350m) and compared the differences between the structures of the networks based on the thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Home range estimation</title><p>Home range is defined as the area utilised by each animal for its normal activities of foraging, mating, and caring for young (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burt, 1943</xref>). Average seasonal home ranges for each individual in each recorded season (Summer: December-February; Autumn: March-May; Winter: June-August; Spring: September-November) were estimated for populations with more than three individuals. Home ranges were determined by first calculating the kernel density with 95% confidence with the <italic>amt</italic> R package hr_kde() function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Signer et al., 2019</xref>). The home range overlap was then determined by comparing the proportions of kernel densities that overlap between each pair of individuals using the amt R package hr_overlap() function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Signer et al., 2019</xref>). To determine if dyads were comparing individuals within or between sounders, dyads with home range overlaps over 50% were considered to belong within the same sounder, and dyads with home range overlaps under 50% were considered to belong to different sounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabor et al., 1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Contact rates</title><p>Direct and indirect contact rates within and between sounders at each site, as well as overall expected contact rate, were estimated for each year, season, and pig population. The contact rate refers to the frequency at which two specific individuals come into contact per unit of time. Contact rates were determined by first calculating how many days each individual was recorded in the direct and indirect spatial and temporal threshold and then determining if the dyad being compared was within or between different sounders, and the type of contact based on sex (female-female, male-male, or female-male). Contact rates were then calculated for each dyad by dividing the number of contact observations from the dyad distance matrix by the minimum number of days for the individual with the least recordings. Mean direct and indirect contact rates and standard deviation were calculated for each type of contact or dyad, which refers to a pair of individuals (female-female, male-male, female-male) between and within sounders for each population for every season and year.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We used three linear mixed-effects models to estimate the effects of sex, season, and type of contact (between or within sounders) on direct contact rates. Parameters were selected based on the results of null hypothesis testing. The first model specified overall contact rate (between and within sounders) as the dependent variable and included fixed effects for type of contact (between or within sounder), sex of the dyad, and season. Pig population was included as a random effect. The second model used direct contact rates within sounders as the dependent variable and included the same fixed and random effects as the first model, excluding type of contact. The third model included the same fixed and random effects as the second model, using direct contact rates between sounders as the dependent variable. We then repeated the process using indirect contact rates for the dependent variables. Models were fitted using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates, 2015</xref>) for R. To determine if sex influences the network measures (degree, centrality, betweenness, and strength) we performed a Wilcoxon ran-sum test, using the networks build with 5 metres threshold and for direct and indirect networks.

The authors analyzed GPS tracking data from across various populations to determine patterns of contact that could support the transmission of a range of zoonotic and livestock diseases. The analysis then focused on the effects of sex, group dynamics, and seasonal changes on contact rates that could be used to base targeted disease control strategies that would prioritize the removal of adult males for reducing intergroup disease transmission.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>It utilized GPS tracking data from 146 feral pigs over several years, effectively capturing seasonal and spatial variation in the social behaviors of interest. Using proximity-based social network analysis, this work provides a highly resolved snapshot of contact rates and interactions both within and between groups, substantially improving research in wildlife disease transmission. Results were highly useful and provided practical guidance for disease management, showing that control targeted at adult males could reduce intergroup disease transmission, hence providing an approach for the control of zoonotic and livestock diseases.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Despite their reliability, populations can be skewed by small sample sizes and limited generalizability due to specific environmental and demographic characteristics. Further validation is needed to account for additional environmental factors influencing social dynamics and contact rates.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a really good point, and we thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. We will discuss the potential biases due to sample size in our discussion. We agree that environmental factors need to be incorporated and tested for their influence on social dynamics, and this will be added to the discussion as we have plans to expand this research and conduct, the analysis to determine if environmental factors are influencing social dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) Consider moving some key figures from supplementary materials to the main text to strengthen the presentation of results.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a new figure to strengthen the presentation of results (Figure 3a-b), which shows the node level measures by sex and for direct and indirect networks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Expand discussion of limitations, particularly addressing potential biases from varying sample sizes across populations.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more detail and clarity about this potential bias into the limitation section within the discussion: âDifferent populations in our study had varying numbers of collared individuals, with some populations having only two individuals at certain times. This variability in sample size across populations is a limitation when interpreting the results. Small populations are often the result of a few individuals being trapped and collared, and this does not necessarily reflect the actual number of individuals in those groups.â Moreover, while reviewing the effect of the potential bias, we found that a General Linear Mixed Effect Model (Table 1) was not optimal for analysing the effect of sex on the network measures, and therefore this analysis has been done again using a non-parametric test (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) for direct and indirect networks based on a 5 metres threshold (Table 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) If available, include Australia-specific economic impact data in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the impact figures that are available for Australia (for FDM) in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Clarify the rationale for chosen spatial and temporal thresholds for defining contacts.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been added in the methodology: âDirect contact was defined when two individuals interacted either at 2, 5, or 350-metre buffers within a five-minute interval [36].

The trapping and collaring of these animals have been conducted following the stringent animal welfare requirements necessary to obtain animal ethics approval in Australia. However, it is important to consider the broader ethical implications. Animal welfare during collaring is a critical aspect and involves minimising stress and physical harm to the animals. The collars used are lightweight and properly fitted only on adults due to welfare issues collaring juveniles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Add a statement about data availability/accessibility.</p></disp-quote><p>The GPS data cannot be shared; however, the R codes will be deposited in GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Tatianaproboste/Feral-Pig-Interactions">https://github.com/Tatianaproboste/Feral-Pig-Interactions</ext-link>) and the link has been added in the final version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Expand on the implications of seasonal variation in contact rates for disease management strategies in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this information in the discussion: âFor example, controlling an outbreak during summer would potentially require more resources than an outbreak in other seasons due to the higher number of contact between individuals during summer.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The typographical errors in the abstract to be corrected are:</p><p>(1) Line 22: Remove the &quot;are&quot; before &quot;threaten&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 24: Replace the &quot;to&quot; before &quot;extinction&quot; with &quot;into&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 28: Rephrase the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>âYet social dynamics are known to vary enormously from place to place, so knowledge generated for example in USA and Europe might not easily transfer to locations such as Australia.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 29: Insert a &quot;comma&quot; after &quot;Here&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Lines 33 -34: Explain, clearly, the contact rates; is it between females to females or females to males?</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved this phrase and now it reads: ââ¦. with females demonstrating higher group cohesion (female-female) and males acting as crucial connectors between independent groups.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 36: Make yourselves clear about what you mean by &quot;targeting adult male&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe âtargeting adult malesâ is correct in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 22 and 44, I think are threaten &quot;are&quot; should be removed for better clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 71, the source and not &quot;force&quot; of infection.</p></disp-quote><p>The force of infection is correct here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 72, population &quot;of&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Under statistical analysis, the software version should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>R has changed to multiple versions since we started this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Terminological consistency: as far as possible try to be consistent with the terms used in the text, such as using &quot;contact rate&quot; instead of &quot;interaction rate&quot; in order not to puzzle the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed most of the âinteractionsâ to âcontactâ instead as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Correct Typos: Identify typos and grammatical inconsistencies of any kind, especially in those complex sentences that may be hard to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>The typos have been checked.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Under the methodology, briefly describe why specific thresholds were chosen and any limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following into the method: âDirect contact was defined when two individuals interacted either at 2, 5, or 350-metre buffers within a five-minute interval [36].
