II (MII) stage. After fertilization, the embryo degrades parts of the maternal components via lysosomal degradation systems, including autophagy and endocytosis, as zygotic gene expression begins during embryogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that endosomal-lysosomal organelles form large spherical assembly structures, termed endosomal-lysosomal organellar assemblies (ELYSAs), in mouse oocytes. ELYSAs are observed in GV oocytes, attaining sizes up to 7–8 μm in diameter in MII oocytes. ELYSAs comprise tubular-vesicular structures containing endosomes and lysosomes along with cytosolic components. Most ELYSAs are also positive for an autophagy regulator, LC3. These characteristics of ELYSA resemble those of ELVA (endolysosomal vesicular assemblies) identified independently. The signals of V1-subunit of vacuolar ATPase tends to be detected on the periphery of ELYSAs in MII oocytes. After fertilization, the localization of the V1-subunit on endosomes and lysosomes increase as ELYSAs gradually disassemble at the 2-cell stage, leading to further acidification of endosomal-lysosomal organelles. These findings suggest that the ELYSA/ELVA maintain endosomal-lysosomal activity in a static state in oocytes for timely activation during early development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Mammalian egg cells, known as oocytes, store the nutrients and materials required for early embryo development. Before fertilisation, they exist in a low-energy, almost hibernation-like state. However, once fertilised, oocytes break down their stored nutrients to support embryo growth.</p><p>This process partly relies on the digestive activity of organelles called lysosomes, which contain proteins that can break down cell contents. Nutrients and unnecessary cell contents are delivered to lysosomes via compartments known as endosomes and autophagosomes, where they are then recycled to be used in development. However, it is important that these compartments become active at precisely the right time in development. If they are activated too soon, the stored nutrients will be depleted. On the other hand, if they are activated too late, the embryo will not have the nutrients it needs to develop.</p><p>To investigate how the oocyte controls activation of endosome and lysosome activity, Satouh et al. used live imaging techniques to observe mice oocytes as they matured, were fertilised and developed into early embryos. This revealed that early in oocyte development, a large spherical structure forms, which grows as the egg matures.</p><p>Naming the structure an Endosomal-Lysosomal Organellar Assembly (or ELYSA for short), Satouh et al. showed that before fertilisation, endosomes and lysosomes are grouped within ELYSAs, which keeps them mostly inactive. After fertilisation, the ELYSAs break apart, with normal endosomal and lysosomal activity beginning at the same time.</p><p>These findings shed light on an important, previously unknown regulatory process in oocyte maturation and early embryonic development. Recently, it has been suggested that endosomal activity may be involved in determining the developmental potential of an embryo. Therefore, studying assembly and disassembly of ELYSAs in ageing oocytes may provide insights into how fertility changes, with the potential to help improve fertility assessments and treatments in the future.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lysosomal maturation</kwd><kwd>oocyte dormancy</kwd><kwd>oocyte activation</kwd><kwd>vacuolar

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fertilization triggers the dynamic remodeling of cellular components via zygotic gene expression as well as the degradation of cellular components from both maternal and paternal gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2010</xref>). After fertilization, maternal cytosolic proteins and RNAs are selectively degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Verlhac et al., 2010</xref>) and specific RNA degradation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jiang and Fan, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Schier, 2007</xref>), respectively. Treatment with a proteasome inhibitor or knockdown of the zygote-specific proteasome assembly chaperone gene inhibits cytokinesis in zygotes, suggesting an essential role for the UPS in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shin et al., 2010</xref>). Membrane components derived from each gamete are degraded by the lysosomal degradation system via autophagy and endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Sato, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birgisdottir and Johansen, 2020</xref>). In mice, autophagic activity is relatively low in metaphase II (MII) oocytes, whereas it is rapidly upregulated approximately 4 hr after fertilization, and LC3 (MAP1LC3: microtubule-associated protein light chain 3)-positive structures appear throughout the cytoplasm. Autophagic activity decreases slightly before and after the 2-cell stage but remains high from the 4- to 8-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tsukamoto et al., 2008</xref>). Loss of Atg5 causes embryonic lethality at the 4- to 8-cell stages, suggesting that autophagy is essential for early mouse development. In contrast, some maternal plasma membrane (PM) proteins are internalized from the PM at the late 2-cell stage and are selectively degraded by lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morita et al., 2021</xref>). Endocytosis inhibitors prevent cell division in 2-cell embryos, suggesting that endocytosis plays a pivotal role in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Satouh and Sato, 2023</xref>). Although lysosomal degradation systems are drastically upregulated after fertilization, their regulation remains unknown.</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the lysosomal activity in oocytes is upregulated by major sperm proteins secreted from sperms as the oocytes grow and mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). In this process, translational arrest of mRNA coding the V1-subunits of vacuolar ATPase in oocytes is released by the stimulation of sperm-derived factors. Consequently, the V1-subunits are recruited to the Vo-subunits in the lysosomal membrane, enhancing lysosomal acidification. This process is known as lysosomal switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohnert and Kenyon, 2017</xref>). In mouse embryos, LysoTracker staining analysis suggests that lysosomal acidification is prominent at the 2-cell stage but not in MII oocytes and zygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsukamoto et al., 2013</xref>), raising the possibility that lysosomal switching takes place during mouse embryogenesis.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to investigate the dynamics of the endolysosomal system during mouse oocyte maturation and embryogenesis. We found that endosomes and lysosomes assembled to form spherical structures in germinal vesicle (GV)-stage oocytes, which became larger as they matured into MII oocytes. Ultrastructural analysis showed that these structures were large spherical membrane assemblies, including endosomes, lysosomes, and tubulo-vesicular structures located in the periphery of the PM. We refer to this structure as the endosomal-lysosomal organellar assembly (ELYSA). The ELYSA contains several cytosolic constituents. While ELYSAs are disassembled in late-stage zygotes, immature endosomes and lysosomes gradually appear in the cytoplasm of early 2-cell stage embryos. Live imaging analysis showed that the signal of V1-subunit of V-ATPase on the acidic compartment became stronger during embryogenesis, suggesting further acidification of lysosomes. These findings suggest that the ELYSA maintains low endosomal and lysosomal activities and acts as a waiting place for endolysosomal organelles to undergo fertilization-triggered activation toward embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endosomes and lysosomes coordinately form giant structures in MII oocytes</title><p>To examine the localization of endosomes and lysosomes in mouse MII oocytes, early or late endosomes were stained with anti-RAB5 or -RAB7 antibody, respectively, and their localization was compared with that of lysosomes stained with anti-LAMP1 antibody. Giant structures harboring lysosomes with early and late endosomes were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Although small punctate structures that are RAB5-positive but LAMP1-negative also spread over the cytosol, most giant structures were positive for RAB5 and LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Each giant structure in the MII oocytes was spherical, ellipsoidal, or concatenated with small spheres. These structures were located in the peripheral region just beneath the PM, excluding the metaphase plate region in proximity to the metaphase chromosomes. These structures were observed from the GV stage to the pronuclear-zygote (PN-zygote) stage but were mostly disassembled at the 2-cell stage. Dispersion and separation of RAB5 and LAMP1 signals after the first division indicated that these giant structures were transiently formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, RAB5-positive and LAMP1-negative punctate structures tend to accumulate along with LAMP1-positive punctate structures larger than 1 μm at the late 2-cell stage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endosomes and lysosomes form giant structures in the periphery of the oocyte plasma membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Metaphase II (MII) oocytes were fixed and co-stained with anti-RAB5 and anti-LAMP1 antibodies.

We first co-stained oocytes and embryos at various stages with LysoTracker Red and LysoSensor Green (in the same medium drop). LysoTracker showed a pronounced puncta-like signal after the 2-cell stage, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsukamoto et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the ELYSAs in GV and MII oocytes were clearly identified by LysoSensor, whereas LysoTracker only produced a very dim signal. Thus, the ratio of LysoTracker/LysoSensor fluorescent intensities in the cytoplasm of each stage embryo indicated that ELYSAs were present at a low ratio. In contrast, embryos at the 4-cell stage and beyond displayed small punctate signals with a higher ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A comparison between LysoTracker and V1A-mCherry signals showed that these fluorescent signals colocalized well on small bright vesicles but not on the ELYSA.

Small ELYSAs are present in GV oocytes and increase in size (3–7 μm in diameter) through assembly at the cell periphery in an actin-dependent manner during oocyte maturation and occupying more than half the volume of the LAMP1-positive fraction in MII oocytes. After fertilization, as ELYSAs gradually disassemble in zygotes, punctate structures positive for either RAB5 or LAMP1 signal alone appear in the cytoplasm of embryos at the early 2-cell stage. The number of membrane structures positive for V1A-mCherry increases upon ELYSA disassembly, indicating further acidification of the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. These results suggest that the ELYSA functions as a reservoir that accumulates endosomal and lysosomal compartments at the periphery of the cell cortex and maintains their activities in a static state until embryogenesis following fertilization.</p><p>We studied the dynamics and activity of endosomes and lysosomes in mouse oocytes and embryos and found that some oocyte PM proteins are internalized from the PM at the late 2-cell stage and are selectively degraded in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morita et al., 2021</xref>). In this process, we noted that lysosomes were not well stained by LysoTracker until the early 2-cell stage, but their signals became stronger from the late 2-cell stage, suggesting the existence of a mechanism underlying developmentally regulated endosomal/lysosomal activation during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsukamoto et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, ELYSAs were stained with toluidine blue and LysoSensor, suggesting that these structures were acidified to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). In addition, Magic Red, which reflects cathepsin B activity, weakly stained ELYSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These observations indicate that lysosomes in ELYSAs have some activity, albeit at low levels. Mouse oocytes accumulate several maternal constituents, including proteins, lipids, and mRNA, and grow to approximately 75 μm in diameter. In addition, oocytes must remain at the GV and MII stages for an extended period to maintain their quality until fertilization. In such situations, lysosomal degradation activity may be suppressed to a relatively low level by the ELYSA, while nutrient uptake, storage, and protein synthesis are predominantly upregulated in growing oocytes. Furthermore, we found that the V1-subunit signals were largely detected on the periphery of ELYSAs but not in their interior in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, it is possible that ELYSA formation prevents the localization of V1-subunits on the lysosomal membrane inside the ELYSA.</p><p>Ultrastructural analysis revealed that the ELYSA consists of outer and inner membrane assembly layers containing several endosomes and lysosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Considering the large number of RAB5-positive and LAMP1-negative punctate structures in MII oocytes, these layers may also reflect the assembly mechanism of the ELYSA. On the contrary, upon disassembly of the ELYSA, endosomes and lysosomes are expected to be released from the ELYSA earlier and later, respectively. This may explain the time lag between fertilization and lysosomal acidification beginning at the early 2-cell stage. Since the ELYSA appears to contain cytosolic constituents, it may accommodate some cytosolic constituents as a capsule to provide nutrition or signaling factors for development.</p><p>ELYSAs were distributed relatively widely in the GV oocyte, then specifically located at the periphery of the oocyte cell cortex, except in the MII cell plate in the MII stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This change in distribution is reminiscent of that of the ER and cortical ER clusters, whose distribution is regulated by the actomyosin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">FitzHarris et al., 2007</xref>). In fact, the treatment with actin cytoskeleton polymerization inhibitors, but not a tubulin polymerization inhibitor, prevented the redistribution of ELYSAs from the cellular medial region to the cell periphery in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The former treatment increased the number of small LAMP1-positive organelles but reduced the size of ELYSAs in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results suggest that actin cytoskeleton is involved in the assembly of smaller (&lt;2 μm in diameter) LAMP1-positive organelles for the enlargement of ELYSAs in the cell periphery.</p><p>Our detailed imaging analysis showed that lysosomal acidification is promoted simultaneously with the detection of the V1-subunits on lysosomes during ELYSA disassembly in late zygotes and is further facilitated from the 2- to 4-cell stage and is enhanced after the morula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These findings suggest that lysosomal acidification and maturation are linked to the ELYSA disassembly. Notably, minor and major zygotic gene activation in mouse embryos occur at the 1- and 2-cell stages, respectively, implying that lysosomal degradation of maternal components is coupled with zygotic gene expression to promote embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schulz and Harrison, 2019</xref>). Fertilization appears to trigger ELYSA disassembly, but the downstream signaling pathways remain to be identified and warrant further research.</p><p>Very recently, after sharing this ELYSA paper as a preprint in 2023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Satouh et al., 2023</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zaffagnini et al., 2024</xref> reported the endolysosomal vesicular assemblies (ELVAs), which resemble ELYSAs, in mouse oocytes. The ELVA is defined as super-organelles containing endosomes, lysosomes, autophagosomes, and proteasomes along with cytosolic proteins, which sequesters detrimental protein aggregates inside and degrade them upon oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zaffagnini et al., 2024</xref>). Consistencies between the ELYSA and the ELVA in their contents and actin-dependent dynamics during oocyte maturation/embryogenesis strongly suggest that ELYSAs and ELVAs are identical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zaffagnini et al., 2024</xref>), assuring the solidity of these findings in this paper. Zaffagnini et al. also observed the accumulation of proteasomes and ubiquitinated proteins in ELVAs and demonstrated that the depletion of a RUN and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (RUFY1) protein from oocytes by the Trim-Away method causes disappearance of ELVAs, suggesting that RUFY1 is involved in the ELVA assembly. Analysis of <italic>Rufy1</italic>-knockout ELVA/ELYSA-free oocytes is awaited to elucidate the physiological role of ELVAs or probably ELYSAs. They also suggested that ELVAs sequester and degrade specific proteins that are known to be aggregate and cause diseases, including proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase KIT, upon oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zaffagnini et al., 2024</xref>). Complementary to their findings, our study revealed that the recruitment of the V1-subunit is limited on ELYSAs in oocytes but enhanced on the isolated LAMP1-positive vesicles after late 2-cell stage. These findings support a hypothesis that ELYSA has a multimodal function, keeping endosomal and lysosomal compartments at a relatively static state and supplying these membrane compartments as a reservoir for embryogenesis.</p><p>Inhibition of lysosomal acidification by bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> treatment arrests embryogenesis at the 4- to 8-cell stage, while inhibition of cathepsin activity using a mixture of E64d and pepstatin A blocks embryogenesis at the 8-cell or morula stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tsukamoto et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the inhibition of endocytosis by Pitstop2 treatment causes arrest at the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morita et al., 2021</xref>). These differences may imply that at the 2-cell stage, the endocytic activity is more important than the lysosomal degradation activity, which is essential at later stages. However, insights from this study shed light on the correlation between increased endocytic/autophagic activity and lysosomal maturation through ELYSA disassembly and the potential significance of minor lysosomal maturation in the early phase of embryogenesis.</p><p>The relationship between such endocytic/autophagic activities in early-stage embryos and the embryonic developmental potential has been recently studied. Using GFP-LC3 as an indicator of autophagic activity, Tsukamoto et al. found that aged oocytes from 14- to 15-month-old mice had lower autophagic activity than those from younger mice, probably due to decreased lysosomal activity. Females transplanted with embryos with high autophagic activity at the 4-cell stage have a significantly higher litter size ratio than that of control females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsukamoto et al., 2014</xref>).

IVM assays using LatA and CCB were performed by transferring oocytes to medium drops containing each inhibitor or DMSO 4 hr after the start of IVM (waiting for the completion of GVBD), as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">FitzHarris et al., 2007</xref>). IVM media containing DMSO, LatA, or CCB was prepared by diluting the stock solution (1:400), and the final concentration of the inhibitors was 10 μM. The embryonic culture assay using bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> was conducted by transferring the PN-zygote into a 20 μL drop of KSOM containing 25 nM bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> covered with liquid paraffin at 6 hr post-fertilization (hpf). Embryos were transferred at 24, 48, and 72 hpf to freshly prepared KSOM containing bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>Immunostaining of oocytes or embryos was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morita et al., 2021</xref>). Oocytes or embryos were cultured to the indicated stages and fixed in 4% PFA (Nacalai Tesque) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mg/mL polyvinyl alcohol (PVA; Sigma-Aldrich; PVA/PBS) for 15 min at 25–27°C. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with PVA/PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 25–27°C and washed three times with PVA/PBS. After blocking with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 1 hr at room temperature, the cells were incubated with the aforementioned primary antibodies (1:100 for all) overnight at 4°C. Next, the cells were washed three times in PVA/PBS and incubated with anti-mouse, rat, or rabbit IgG secondary antibodies coupled with Alexa Fluor 488, 555, or 564 (1:200 for all; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 25–27°C for 2–4 hr. Thereafter, the cells were incubated with PVA/PBS containing 10 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Dojindo) for 10 min and washed with fresh PVA/PBS a few times. Subsequently, control and nonspecific staining were performed by processing oocytes and embryos in the absence of primary antibodies. The oocytes and embryos were imaged in PVA/PBS microdrops in 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA). For each position, confocal images at 81 <italic>z</italic>-axis planes with 1 μm increments were acquired on an IX-71 inverted microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a CSU W-1 confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa Electric Corporation) using a 60× silicone immersion lens UPLSAPO60XS (Olympus Corporation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>LysoTracker/LysoSensor staining of oocytes and generation of ratio images</title><p>Acidic organelles in the oocytes were visualized using LysoTracker Red DND-99 and LysoSensor Green DND-189 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the oocytes or embryos at target stages for one experimental round were obtained simultaneously and incubated in a large drop of reaction mixture (KSOM containing 1/10,000 Magic Red stock solution dissolved in DMSO and 1/1000 LysoSensor Green DND-189 stock solution dissolved in DMSO) for 30 min at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a humidified atmosphere in liquid paraffin in a 35 mm glass-bottomed dish (MatTek Corporation). Subsequently, confocal images at 41 z-axis planes with 2 μm increments were obtained using a CSU W-1 spinning disk confocal microscope with a 30× silicone immersion lens UPLSAPO30XS (Olympus Corporation). Acquisition conditions for fluorescence excited by 470 nm (LysoSensor) and 555 nm (LysoTracker) lasers were determined in preliminary experiments to be almost 1:1 intensities between the two wavelengths for cytosolic punctate structures in the 2-cell embryo. Further generation of ratio images for LysoTracker/LysoSensor fluorescence were carried out using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Averaged intensity projection was carried out, determining background intensity of each field by subtracting the averaged intensities of four cellular blank regions from the whole image. Then, 32-bit ratio images for LysoTracker/LysoSensor fluorescence of cytosolic regions were generated by processing images with ‘Math/Divide’ function in Fiji, and ‘fire’ lookup table images were converted to RGB images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Magic Red/LysoSensor staining</title><p>Intracellular cathepsin activity was assayed in oocytes or embryos using Magic Red Cathepsin B or Cathepsin L detection kits (ImmunoChemistry Technologies LLC, Davies, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Briefly, antral follicles were harvested in FHM medium containing 250 μM of dbcAMP using 26G needles (Terumo). After dissociating the cumulus cells by pipetting, the oocytes were transferred to medium supplemented with 250 μM of dbcAMP and 10 μM of CCB (Sigma-Aldrich). Thereafter, mRNA injection into the oocytes was performed using a piezo-micromanipulator (Primetech, Tokyo, Japan) with a glass capillary needle. The mRNA concentrations were 50 and 100 ng/μL for <italic>V1A-mCherry</italic> and <italic>Lamp1-EGFP</italic>, respectively. The oocytes were washed three times and used for IVM. Microinjection of mRNA into zygote stage embryo (at 3–4 hpf) was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Morita et al., 2021</xref>). The concentration of mRNA was the same as that in the GV oocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Time-lapse confocal imaging of oocytes/embryos</title><p>Low-invasive confocal fluorescence imaging of oocytes/embryos was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Nozawa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Satouh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Satouh et al., 2012</xref>) with slight modifications. Briefly, on an inverted microscope IX-71 (Olympus Corporation) equipped with a CSU W-1 confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa Electric Corporation), an incubation chamber (Tokai Hit, Fujinomiya, Japan) was set at 37°C on the microscope stage, with a gas mixture of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> introduced into the chamber at 150 mL/min. Oocytes/embryos were placed in 8 μL of IVM medium or KSOM drops covered with liquid paraffin (Nacalai Tesque) in 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation). Subsequently, confocal images at 41 z-axis planes with 2 μm increments for excitation lasers of 470 and 555 nm from an LDI-7 Laser Diode Illuminator (89 North, Williston, VT, USA) were obtained every 30 or 60 min during IVM or embryonic culture observation, respectively, through optimized band-pass filters using 30× silicone immersion lens UPLSAPO30XS (Olympus Corporation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>3D object analysis</title><p>Series of confocal images with 81 z-axis planes with 1 μm increments for LAMP1 immunostaining were used for 3D object analysis. Fields to analyze were cropped for each oocyte/embryo, and the upper and lower end of LAMP1 fluorescent signals in the cytosol were examined to determine the center plane (middle height) of the cell. The cellular region in the center plane was used for masking and determination of the geometric center (as a 3D center) of each oocyte. Deletion of the signals from the polar body or zona pellucida was carried out manually. Objects were profiled using the 3D object counter plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>) of Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), to measure the number, volume, geometric center of each object, and mean distance from the geometrical center of the object to its surface. Thresholding was carried out after background subtraction using the Fiji software, manually applying intensities of 600–1200 as threshold to recognize objects separately. Signals on PM were eliminated both via size filtering (0–5000 μm<sup>3</sup>) of the 3D object counter plugin and manual erasing. The distal distance of each object from the 3D center of the oocyte was used for distribution analysis to avoid underestimation of the distance of large ELYSA. This was calculated by adding the distance from the 3D center of the oocyte to the geometric center of each object and the mean distance from the geometrical center of the object to its surface. Distance calculation and generation of bar graphs were carried out using Excel 2016 software (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Object-based colocalization analysis for the punctate structures were performed using the JACoP plugin in the ImageJ Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). Confocal z-stack images of multiple wave length for LAMP1 and LC3 or RAB5 antibodies were acquired for each oocyte as above, and object-based colocalization was examined by identifying coincidence of geometric centers of LC3 or RAB5 objects overlapping on LAMP1 objects. All of the LAMP1-positive 3D objects were listed with the 3D object counter plugin applied with same threshold, and the colocalized LAMP1-positive objects were identified and analyzed using the Excel 2016 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Analysis of microscopic images and movies</title><p>Analysis of the acquired images, including the generation of a line plot of intensity, adjustment of intensity, and generation of montage images at a uniform intensity, was performed using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To enhance the images, a Gaussian Blur filter (at a sigma radius of 1) and auto-adjustment of the intensity were applied to the stack of images. To adjust the intensity, auto-adjustment of the intensity was applied to each image.

Although these structures have often been observed in oocytes and early embryos, their exact nature has not been characterized. The authors named these structures &quot;endosomal-lysosomal organelles form assembly structures (ELYSAs)&quot;. ELYSAs contain organelles such as endosomes, lysosomes, and probably autophagic structures. ELYSAs are initially formed in the perinuclear region and then seem to migrate to the periphery in an actin-dependent manner. When ELYSAs are disassembled after the 2-cell stage, the V-ATPase V1 subunit is recruited to make lysosomes more acidic and active. The ELYSAs are most likely the same as the &quot;endolysosomal vesicular assemblies (ELVAs)&quot;, reported by Elvan Böke's group earlier this year (Zaffagnini et al. doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.031). However, it is clear that Satouh et al. identified and characterized these structures independently. These two studies could be complementary. Although the nature of the present study is generally descriptive, this paper provides valuable information about these giant structures. Since the ELYSA described in this paper and ELVA proposed by Elvan Böke appear to be the same structure, it would be helpful to the field if the two groups discuss unifying the nomenclature in the future.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have provided additional data supporting their conclusions and also revised the text to more accurately reflect the experimental results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99358.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Satouh et al report the presence of spherical structures composed of endosomes, lysosomes and autophagosomes within immature mouse oocytes. These endolysosomal compartments have been named as Endosomal-LYSosomal organellar Assembly (ELYSA). ELYSAs increase in size as the oocytes undergo maturation. ELYSAs are distributed throughout the oocyte cytoplasm of GV stage immature oocytes but these structures become mostly cortical in the mature oocytes. Interestingly, they tend to avoid the region which contain metaphase II spindle and chromosomes. They show that the endolysosomal compartments in oocytes are less acidic and therefore non-degradative but their pH decreases and become degradative as the ELYSAs begin to disassemble in the embryos post fertilization. This manuscript shows that lysosomal switching does not happen during oocyte development, and the formation of ELYSAs prevent lysosomes from being activated.

Although these structures have often been observed in oocytes and early embryos, their exact nature has not been characterized. The authors named these structures &quot;endosomal-lysosomal organelles form assembly structures (ELYSAs)&quot;. ELYSAs contain organelles such as endosomes, lysosomes, and probably autophagic structures. ELYSAs are initially formed in the perinuclear region and then migrate to the periphery in an actin-dependent manner. When ELYSAs are disassembled after the 2-cell stage, the V-ATPase V1 subunit is recruited to make lysosomes more acidic and active. The ELYSAs are most likely the same as the &quot;endolysosomal vesicular assemblies (ELVAs)&quot;, reported by Elvan Böke's group earlier this year (Zaffagnini et al. doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2024.01.031). However, it is clear that Satouh et al. identified and characterized these structures independently. These two studies could be complementary. Although the nature of the present study is generally descriptive, this paper provides valuable information about these giant structures. The data are mostly convincing, and only some minor modifications are needed for clarification and further explanation to fully understand the results.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Satouh et al report the presence of spherical structures composed of endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes within immature mouse oocytes. These endolysosomal compartments have been named as Endosomal-LYSosomal organellar Assembly (ELYSA). ELYSAs increase in size as the oocytes undergo maturation. ELYSAs are distributed throughout the oocyte cytoplasm of GV stage immature oocytes but these structures become mostly cortical in the mature oocytes. Interestingly, they tend to avoid the region which contains metaphase II spindle and chromosomes. They show that the endolysosomal compartments in oocytes are less acidic and therefore non-degradative but their pH decreases and becomes degradative as the ELYSAs begin to disassemble in the embryos post-fertilization. This manuscript shows that lysosomal switching does not happen during oocyte development, and the formation of ELYSAs prevents lysosomes from being activated. Structures similar to these ELYSAs have been previously described in mouse oocytes (Zaffagnini et al, 2024) and these vesicular assemblies are important for sequestering protein aggregates in the oocytes but facilitate proteolysis after fertilization. The current manuscript, however, provides further details of endolysosomal disassembly post-fertilization. Specifically, the V1-subunit of V-ATPase targeting the ELYSAs increases the acidity of lysosomal compartments in the embryos. This is a well-conducted study and their model is supported by experimental evidence and data analyses.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Fertilization converts a cell defined as an egg to a cell defined as an embryo. An essential component of this switch in cell fate is the degradation (autophagy) of cellular elements that serve a function in the development of the egg but could impede the development of the embryo. Here, the authors have focused on the behavior during the egg-to-embryo transition of endosomes and lysosomes, which are cytoplasmic structures that mediate autophagy. By carefully mapping and tracking the intracellular location of well-established marker proteins, the authors show that in oocytes endosomes and lysosomes aggregate into giant structures that they term Endosomal LYSosomal organellar Assembl[ies] (ELYSA). Both the size distribution of the ELYSAs and their position within the cell change during oocyte meiotic maturation and after fertilization. Notably, during maturation, there is a net actin-dependent movement towards the periphery of the oocyte. By the late 2-cell stage, the ELYSAs are beginning to disintegrate. At this stage, the endo-lysosomes become acidified, likely reflecting the activation of their function to degrade cellular components.</p><p>This is a carefully performed and quantified study. The fluorescent images obtained using well-known markers, using both antibodies and tagged proteins, support the interpretations, and the quantification method is sophisticated and clearly explained. Notably, this type of quantification of confocal z-stack images is rarely performed and so represents a real strength of the study. It provides sound support for the conclusions regarding changes in the size and position of the ELYSAs. Another strength is the use of multiple markers, including those that indicate the activity state of the endo-lysosomes. Altogether, the manuscript provides convincing evidence for the existence of ELYSAs and also for regulated changes in their location and properties during oocyte maturation and the first few embryonic cell cycles following fertilization.</p><p>At present, precisely how the changes in the location and properties of the ELYSAs affect the function of the endo-lysosomal system is not known. While the authors' proposal that they are stored in an inactive state is plausible, it remains speculative. Nonetheless, this study lays the foundation for future work to address this question.</p><p>Minor point: l. 299. If I am not mistaken, there is a typo. It should read that the inhibitors of actin polymerization prevent redistribution from the cytoplasm to the cortex during maturation.</p><p>Minor point: A few statements in the Introduction would benefit from clarification. These are noted in the comments to the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the editorial board of <italic>eLife</italic> and the reviewers for their helpful and constructive comments on our manuscript. We are pleased that the reviewers acknowledged that we identified and characterized this assembly structure independently. In the revised manuscript, we have carefully considered the reviewers’ comments and conducted additional analysis to address each of them.</p><p>Regarding the typographical errors, we revised the description to fit with our findings and the reviewers’ comments.

(1) The authors state in the Abstract that ELYSAs contain autophagosome-like membranes in the outer layer. However, this seems to be just speculation based on the LC3 staining results and is not directly shown. Are there autophagosome-like double membrane structures in ELYSAs?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. We also agree with this concern; however, it was difficult to assert that they are autophagosomes based on the observation of the electron micrographs. For this reason, we rephrased it to be &quot;Most ELYSAs are also positive for an autophagy regulator, LC3.” (lines 33). In addition, we revised the notation to LC3-positive structures in the Result and Discussion section (line 165-169, 286).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (2) The data in Figure 2A, showing a decrease in the number of LAMP1 structures, seems to contradict the data in Figure 1B, showing an apparent increase in LAMP1 structures. Please explain this discrepancy. If the authors did not count structures just below the plasma membrane, please explain the rationale for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the valuable comment. Regarding the number of LAMP1-positive structures, it is not suitable for comparison with Figure 1B, etc., as pointed out by the reviewer, since the distribution of the LAMP1 signal differs from plane to plane. To avoid any potential confusion, we added new images of the Z-projection of the immunostained images that can better reflect the number of positive structures in the whole oocyte/embryo in Figure 2.</p><p>In addition, as the reviewer pointed out, there is a technical difficulty in measuring the LAMP1-positive signal on the plasma membrane or just below it. We explained how and why we had to delete plasma membrane signals in our response #21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (3) The actin dependence is not observed in Figure 5C. What is the difference between Figure 5C and 5E? Please explain further.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity; Figures 5C and 5E show the average number of LAMP1-positive structures (5C) and the percentage of the sum of granule volumes in LAMP1 positive structure (5E), respectively, after classifying the LAMP1 positive granules by their diameters.</p><p>We removed Figure 5E for the sake of conciseness since we already mentioned a similar fact in Figure 5C. To clarify the corresponding explanations, we moved figures that were not classified by diameter to Supplementary Figure 8 to improve readability. Moreover, we have rewritten the main text on lines 200–211.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (4) While the actin inhibitors reduce the number of peripheral LAMP1 structures (Figure 5F), they do not affect their number in the central region (Figure 5G). How can the authors conclude that actin inhibitors inhibit the migration of LAMP1 structures?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. As pointed out, the number of large LAMP1-positive structures in the medial region did not change. Therefore, we have avoided the description that ELYSAs migrate from the middle region to the cell periphery and have unified the description of whether large structures in the periphery occur. Please refer to the subsection title (line 188), the following descriptions (lines 189–199), the related description in the Results (lines 200–211), and the title and the legend of Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (5) The authors show that the V1A subunit associates with the surface of LAMP1 structures as punctate structures (Figure 6B). What are these V1A-positive structures? Is V1A recruited to some specific domains of ELYSAs, or are V1A-positive active lysosomes recruited to ELYSAs? Please provide an interpretation of these data. The phrase &quot;The V1-subunit of V-ATPase is targeted to these structures&quot; (line 262) is not appropriate because it is indistinguishable whether only the V1 subunits are recruited or active lysosomes containing the V1 subunit are recruited.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the valuable comment. Indeed, our analysis, including the analysis of Fig. 8 described on line 262, did not clarify whether free V1A-mCherry molecules accessed the ELYSA periphery or whether lysosomes with V1A-mCherry molecules newly merged into the ELYSA. Therefore, we added this interpretation to lines 232–234 of the Results and revised the Discussion as &quot;The number of membrane structures positive for V1A-mCherry increase upon ELYSA disassembly, indicating further acidification of the endosomal/lysosomal compartment&quot; (lines 292–294).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (6) Why did the authors use LysoSensor as a marker for ELYSA instead of LAMP1 in Figure 8 and 9? Some reasons should be given.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a clear technical reason for this: when LAMP1-EGFP was expressed in a zygote, it was largely migrated to the plasma membrane before and after the 2-cell stage, making it difficult to capture the change of ELYSAs. To circumvent this difficulty, we used Lysosensor to visualize ELYSAs instead of LAMP1-EGFP. This explanation was added to lines 258–260.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (7) In Figure 9A, it is not clear whether the activity of LysoSensor-positive structures is lower at this stage compared to other stages. It may be shown in Figure S7, but the data are not clearly visible. A direct comparison would be ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>A new analysis similar to that shown in Fig. 9 for early 2-cells and 4-cells was performed and added to Figure S7. To support direct comparison, the ranges of axes were set to be similar.</p><p>As a result, the quantified MagicRed signal on the isolated LysoSensor-positive punctate structure in MII oocyte was nearly the same as that in early 2-cells and 4-cells. In early 2-cells, LysoSensor gave a signal at the cellular boundary, where MagicRed staining was not observed, confirming that MagicRed activity is higher in the interior than in the cell periphery in post-fertilization embryos. We have included an additional description in the main text (lines 280–282).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (8) In the phrase &quot;pregnant mare serum gonadotropin or an anti-inhibin antibody&quot; (line 382), is &quot;or&quot; correct?</p></disp-quote><p>When inducing superovulatory stimulation, an anti-inhibin antibody (distributed as CARD HyperOva) can be used as a substitute for PMSG (after additional stimulation with hCG), which results in the production of eggs of similar quality to those of PMSG. This was used in most experiments. To amend the lack of clarity, a reference (Takeo and Nakagata Plos One, 2015) was added to the description of HyperOva (line 417).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (9) In almost all graphs, please indicate what the X-axis is indicating (not just &quot;number&quot;) so that readers can understand what number is being represented without reading the legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the axis titles in all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (10) Since grayscale images provide better contrast than color images, it is recommended that single-color images be shown in grayscale.</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced all single-color images with grayscale images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Q. (11) Figure 1 and S1- Both Rab5 and Rab7 co-localize with LAMP1. However, there seems to be a lot of LAMP1-free Rab5 dots as compared to the Lamp1-free Rab7. As a result, LAMP1 and Rab7 are co-localized more frequently than LAMP1 and Rab5 (video1). Could it be that early endosomes (Rab5+) are yet to be incorporated into ELYSAs? If so, a brief discussion of this phenomenon would be nice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for the comment. We agree with the reviewer’s interpretation. In accordance with this suggestion, we clearly stated in the main text: “Although small punctate structures that are RAB5-positive but LAMP1-negative also spread over the cytosol, most giant structures were positive for RAB5 and LAMP1 (Video 1)” (lines 91–93). In the Discussion section, a brief statement was included: “Considering the large number of RAB5-positive and LAMP1-negative punctate structures in MII oocytes, these layers may also reflect the assembly mechanism of the ELYSA” (lines 318–320).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (12) Video 3 (and Figure 6) clearly shows the dynamics of LAMP1-labelled vesicles during maturation, which is impressive. In contrast to the live cell imaging after LAMP1 mRNA injection, Figure 1 used anti-LAMP1 Ab to detect endogenous levels of LAMP1. It appears that mRNA microinjection causes LAMP1 overexpression causing more (but smaller) vesicles to form. It should be easy to quantify and compare the vesicles in Figure 1 and 6</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment. As mentioned, injections of EGFP-LAMP1 mRNA are useful for the visualization of LAMP1 dynamics during the maturation phase from GV to MII by live cell imaging, which is not feasible with immunostaining. However, the fluorescence emitted by EGFP-LAMP1 is only a few tenths of that of antibody staining, and because of the technical difficulty of microinjection into GV oocytes, the signal-to-noise ratio sufficient for imaging was merely one in ten oocytes. In addition, live cell imaging of oocytes in Figure 6 had to be carried out with very low excitation light exposure to reduce the toxicity. It was also performed with a low magnification lens and a longer step size in the z-axis. For these reasons, in examining the point raised, we performed an additional 3D object analysis, in the same way as in Figure 2, on the data of IVM oocytes injected with EGFP-LAMP1 mRNA using the same lens as in Figure 1 and with a longer exposure time than in live imaging. The results were compared with the MII data of Figures 1 and 2.</p><p>As a result, as shown in the new Figure S8, more objects with a diameter of 0.2–0.4 µm were found than in the immunostaining data, which fits the reviewer’s point. In addition, the counts were lower for the 0.6–1.0 µm diameter, but there was no significant difference in the number of larger LAMP1 positive structures corresponding to the ELYSA size. We consider that this was appropriate for the original purpose of characterizing the ELYSA formation process. A description of these points has been added to lines 221–225.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (13) In Figure 4A and B- Seems like not all LAMP1-positive structures were LC3-positive. Is there any size or location within the oocyte that determines LC3 positivity?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the valuable comment. To answer this comment, we proceeded with a new 3D object-based co-localization analysis on Lamp1 and LC3, determined the number, volume, and distribution within the oocyte, and incorporated the results as Supplementary Figure 6. To examine the positivity, we further analyzed the percentage of double-positive structures of all the LAMP1-positive structures. The results showed that their average diameter significantly shifted from 2.36 µm (GV) to 3.78 µm (MII). Moreover, it was clearly indicated that LAMP1-positive structures smaller than 2 µm in diameter are rarely positive for LC3. In terms of location, measuring the distance of the double positive structures from the oocyte center (the cellular geometric center) indicated that they tend to be observed at the periphery of both stages of oocytes (more than 80% in &gt; 30 µm in the MII oocyte). Of note, no clear tendency of double positivity was observed. A description of these points has been added to lines 174–186.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (14) In discussion, line 256- Small ELYSAs are formed in GV oocytes. Since you haven't checked the smaller-sized, growing oocytes, I suggest rephrasing this sentence as 'are present' rather than 'are formed'.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and changed it to &quot;present&quot; (line 287).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (15) Line 188- ELISA should instead be ELYSA</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have found a few more typographical errors, and all of them have been corrected (lines 213 and 321).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Q. (16) Line 42: What do you mean by 'zygotic gene expression following the degradation of the cellular components of each maternal and paternal gamete'? ZGA requires this degradation? Please provide supporting references from the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusing wording. We meant to say that both ZGA and degradation of parental components are required. To avoid misunderstanding, we have revised “zygotic gene expression as well as the degradation of the cellular components of each maternal and paternal gamete” and inserted a new reference (line 44).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (17) 50: MII means metaphase II, not meiosis II.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected the clerical mistake (line 50).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (18) 51: Define LC3.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the definition of LC3 (line 51-52).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (19) 60: 'lysosomal activity in oocytes is upregulated by sperm-derived factors as the oocytes grow and mature'. As written, the sentence implies that oocytes grow and mature after fertilization. This may be true for maturation, but I would be surprised to learn that there is growth of the oocyte after fertilization.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this valuable comment.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> lives mainly as a hermaphrodite, which contains a couple of U-shaped gonad arms including the ovary, spermatheca and uterus in the body. Oocytes grow in the ovary and maturate upon receiving major sperm proteins secreted from sperms and ovulated to the spermatheca for fertilization. In 2017, Kenyon’s group reported that major sperm proteins act as sperm-secreted hormones to upregulates the lysosomal activity in oocytes during oocyte growth and maturation. We have revised our manuscript to avoid misunderstanding, to ' lysosomal activity in oocytes is upregulated by major sperm proteins secreted from sperms as the oocytes grow and mature '. (L. 61-66).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (20) 94 and Figure 1B: While it is clear that many LAMP1 foci at the late 2-cell stage do not also contain RAB5, it seems that the majority of RAB5 loci also stain for LAMP1. This may be a minor point in the context of the paper but could be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We could not easily agree with the suggestion because of the possibility that the images might give different impressions on each plane. Therefore, as a way to verify this point, we attempted to quantify the co-localization by reconstructing the 3D puncta information based on the two types of antibody staining data. Unfortunately, as shown in Fig. 1AB, Rab5 had a high cytoplasmic background, and although we were able to extract peaks, we could not reliably recalibrate the three-dimensional punctate structure (please refer to the new Supplementary Fig. 6). Therefore, co-localization on each other's punctate structure (LAMP1/RAB5 vs. RAB5/LAMP1) could not be verified. The validation using specific planes also showed large differences between planes, with overlapping punctate structures counted separately in adjacent planes, making reliable quantification difficult. This is an issue that will be addressed in the future.</p><p>On the other hand, the newly added Z-projection figure (Fig. 1AB) shows that RAB5-positive and LAMP1-negative punctate structures tend to accumulate along the LAMP1-positive punctate structures larger than 1 µm at the late 2-cell stage in all observed embryos; we added this statement on lines 99–101.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (21) 100-102 and Figure 2A: Does the decrease in the total number of LAMP1 foci refer just to cytoplasmic or also to membrane foci? If the former, what was the reason for not including the membrane in the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the critical question. The LAMP1 signal on the plasma membrane interfered with the measurement of the signals just below the plasma membrane. The biological cause of this increased signal on the plasma membrane, as shown in Fig. 2E, seemed to be caused by the migration of the LAMP1 signals post-fertilization, which was also reported in a previous paper by Zaffagnini et al. (2024), published in <italic>Cell</italic>.</p><p>In our analysis, oocytes are giant cells, and confocal imaging has a technical limitation in obtaining the same fluorescent intensity along the z-axis. However, 3D-object analysis requires thresholding based on absolute values. As a result of this situation, the presence of the plasma membrane signal caused punctate structures located close to the membrane to be captured and recognized as a single, very large LAMP1-positive structure, resulting in the loss of the punctate structure that should be measured.</p><p>To avoid this issue, we have used several programs to correct the fluorescence difference along the z-axis; nonetheless, these attempts were unsuccessful. Therefore, as described in the Materials and Methods section, we applied only background subtraction at each z-position and then manually removed the plasma membrane signal (which was thin and continuous at the edges). Furthermore, when the plasma membrane and punctate structure signals overlapped, we paid attention not to remove the signals but to separate them. Thus, we believe that the decrease in the number and volume of LAMP1-positive structures after fertilization is still a phenomenon associated with the shift of LAMP1 to the plasma membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (22) Figure 2B, F, G: As the x-axis does not represent a continuous variable, adjacent data points should not be connected by a line. The histogram representations in A, C, and E are much easier to understand. I suggest presenting all data in this format.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the line graphs to bar graphs. Besides, to make the significance among populations clearer, the significances are now expressed using alphabetical indicators.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q. (23) Figure 2B, C: It seems that the values for the different stages are expressed relative to the value at MII. Why not use the GV value at the base-line? This would follow the developmental trajectory of the oocyte/embryo more directly and would not (I believe) change the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated the comment. We meant to express that ELYSA develops most in the MII phase and that it decreases after fertilization, so considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we expressed GV-MII changes based on GV and changes after fertilization based on the MII phase (Fig. 2C, D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
