The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is a key structure underlying auditory-cued fear conditioning. Here, we demonstrate that genetic disruption of GR in the LA (LAGRKO) resulted in an auditory-cued fear memory deficit for strengthened conditioning. Furthermore, the suppressive effect of a single restraint stress (RS) prior to conditioning on auditory-cued fear memory in floxed GR (control) mice was abolished in LAGRKO mice. Optogenetic induction of long-term depression (LTD) at auditory inputs to the LA reduced auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice, and in contrast, optogenetic induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) increased auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed floxed GR mice. These findings suggest that prior stress suppresses fear conditioning-induced LTP at auditory inputs to the LA in a GR-dependent manner, thereby protecting animals from encoding excessive cued fear memory under stress conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glucocorticoid receptor</kwd><kwd>metaplasticity</kwd><kwd>lateral amygdala</kwd><kwd>auditory fear conditioning</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26293213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Ran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15K06705</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inoue</surname><given-names>Ran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP25115002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inokuchi</surname><given-names>Kaoru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR13W1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Inokuchi</surname><given-names>Kaoru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>221S0003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H01279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25116508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Hisashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral analyses and an optogenetic approach reveal an existence of GR-mediated metaplasticity in the LA and its link with adaptive fear response to auditory cues in a stressful condition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stress activates the hypothalamusâpituitaryâadrenal (HPA) axis, which results in the release of glucocorticoid hormones (cortisol in humans and corticosterone in rodents) from the adrenal cortex. Glucocorticoid hormones can readily enter the brain and bind to specific receptors in regions crucial for memories of stressful experiences, such as the hippocampus and amygdala, thereby enhancing the consolidation of emotionally arousing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Quervain et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>). Two types of receptors mediate the effects of glucocorticoids: type I mineralocorticoid receptor (MR, <italic>Nr3c2</italic>) and type II glucocorticoid receptor (GR, <italic>Nr3c1</italic>). Compared with MR, GR has a lower binding affinity for glucocorticoids and is largely unoccupied at basal levels, and is thus considered to be particularly important in signaling mediated by stress-induced high levels of glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Kloet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reul and de Kloet, 1985</xref>).</p><p>The lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LA) is a key structure underlying auditory-cued fear conditioning (AFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">LeDoux, 2000</xref>). Auditory information, which is critical for AFC, reaches the LA either from the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) or from the auditory cortex (AC). Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the two auditory inputs to the LA is essential for the acquisition and expression of auditory-cued fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsvetkov et al., 2002</xref>). In response to stress, GR activation plays a central role in the formation of long-term memory, which is an essential mechanism for learning from stressful events and respond adaptively to similar demands in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Finsterwald and Alberini, 2014</xref>). In an electrophysiological study using brain slices, glucocorticoid prolonged excitatory synaptic responses in the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) by binding to GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karst et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, after an acute stress exposure, application of glucocorticoid suppressed excitatory synaptic responses in the BLA in a GR-dependent manner. This switch in synaptic response to glucocorticoid is referred to as metaplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham and Tate, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schmidt et al., 2013</xref>). Prior delivery of behavioral stress has also been shown to suppress subsequent induction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kavushansky and Richter-Levin, 2006</xref>). However, whether stress-induced amygdalar metaplasticity occurs in vivo in a way relevant to the strength of the auditory-cued fear memory, and what role LAGR plays in this neural process are unknown.</p><p>In this study, we generated LA-selective GR knockout (LAGRKO) mice to investigate the region-specific role of LAGR in mediating the modulatory effects of stress on fear memory. We first compared contextual and auditory-cued fear memory conditioned at different strengths between floxed GR (control) and LAGRKO mice at basal condition. We then investigated the effect of LAGR disruption on the adaptive modulation of fear memory after exposure to acute stress. Finally, using an optogenetic technique to induce LTP and long-term depression (LTD), we investigated how GR-dependent metaplasticity in the LA influenced auditory-cued fear memory in response to prior stress exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of LAGRKO mice</title><p>To selectively knockout the GR gene in the LA, we generated two mutant mouse lines.

Therefore, we hypothesized that prior RS exposure would suppress AFC-induced LTP in the LA, leading to the attenuation of auditory-cued fear memory in floxed GR mice, and that LAGR disruption might impair stress-induced metaplasticity in the LA. To test this, we used a recently established technique that allows engineering a memory using an optical LTP or LTD protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nabavi et al., 2014</xref>). We injected an AAV vector expressing a variant of light-activated channelrhodopsin 2, oChIEF, into bilateral MGN and AC.

Immediately after the first auditory-cued fear memory test (Test 1), which was conducted 24 hr after fear conditioning, mice received an optical LTP or LTD protocol and tested 24 hr later (Test 2).

We further demonstrate that LAGR is indispensable for the suppressive effect of prior RS exposure on AFC. The optogenetic potentiation of synaptic strength at auditory inputs to the LA by an LTP protocol significantly increased auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed floxed GR but not in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice. Accordingly, weakening the synaptic strength of auditory inputs to the LA by an LTD protocol significantly reduced auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice. These findings suggest that stress-induced metaplasticity occurs in the LA in a GR-dependent manner, and is responsible for the suppressive effect of prior RS on AFC.</p><p>The degree of stress induced by learning itself has been shown to be related to strength of the memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cordero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cordero and Sandi, 1998</xref>). In our study, there was no difference in freezing levels between floxed GR and LAGRKO mice conditioned with three CSÂ ÃÂ US pairings. When the number of CSÂ ÃÂ US pairings of the conditioning procedure was increased to six, LAGRKO exhibited an impaired auditory-cued fear memory. Concomitantly, in both genotypes, plasma corticosterone levels 90 min after fear conditioning were significantly higher in the group with six CSÂ ÃÂ US pairings than in the group with three CSÂ ÃÂ US pairings. It is likely that the increased number of CSÂ ÃÂ US pairings strengthened the connection between auditory CS and US in the LA, and LAGR, which is activated by high levels of circulating corticosterone, contributes exclusively to this neural process. These findings are in agreement with the lower binding affinity of GR for glucocorticoids, leading to the critical role of GR in signaling mediated by stress-induced high levels of glucocorticoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Reul and de Kloet, 1985</xref>).</p><p>Emerging evidence indicates that stress exposure modulates subsequent learning and memory bidirectionally, either through facilitation or impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Raio and Phelps, 2015</xref>). Glucocorticoid signaling has been thought as a common mechanism for mediating the effects of stress on fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cordero et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">RodrÃ­guez Manzanares et al., 2005</xref>). In our behavioral tests, a single RS exposure 1 hr before conditioning significantly reduced auditory-cued fear memory in floxed GR mice but not in LAGRKO mice, suggesting that the suppressive effect of prior RS is LAGR-dependent. To date, there are no reports demonstrating the effects of stress 1 hr before conditioning on fear memory. One previous report demonstrated that a single acute stress exposure 48 hr before fear conditioning had no effect on AFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cordero et al., 2003</xref>). GRs control the magnitude and duration of stress responses, and they are critical in the negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis in response to acute stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laryea et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, plasma corticosterone levels were significantly higher 1 hr after RS than 24 hr after RS (data not shown), and it is possible that the timing of previous stress exposure is a key determinant of the effects of stress on auditory-cued fear memory. Consistent with our in vivo evidence showing the LAGR-dependent suppressive effect of prior RS, Karst <italic>et al.</italic> demonstrated that a long-lasting glutamatergic transmission in BLA neurons triggered by the application of corticosterone was suppressed by RS 1 hr before slice preparation and the suppressive effect of RS was attenuated by treatment with a GR antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karst et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Synaptic changes at auditory inputs to the LA play an essential role in the acquisition and expression of auditory-cued fear memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blair et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tsvetkov et al., 2002</xref>). Exposure to a single stress induces LTP in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sarabdjitsingh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vouimba et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that prior RS exposure occludes or suppresses subsequent AFC-induced LTP in floxed GR mice, thereby preventing the formation of excessive cued fear memory. To test this hypothesis, we induced LTP at auditory inputs to the LA by optogenetic stimulation, and found a significant increase in auditory-cued fear responses in RS-exposed floxed GR mice. This is the first evidence supporting a causal link between stress-induced metaplasticity in the LA and adaptive fear response to a salient cue in a stressful condition. Several in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that the activation of GRs is involved in stress-induced amygdalar metaplasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kavushansky and Richter-Levin, 2006</xref>). In our study, optogenetic delivery of an LTP protocol failed to alter fear responses to auditory cues in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice, supporting that the activation of LAGR is essential for stress-induced suppression of synaptic plasticity in the LA. The link between synaptic strength and fear response was further verified by results demonstrating that the weakening of the synaptic strength by delivering an optical LTD protocol attenuated auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice. In agreement with this finding, a previous electrophysiological study using brain slices containing the BLA region demonstrated that the persistence of LTP induced in the presence of corticosterone is sensitive to previous RS exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sarabdjitsingh and JoÃ«ls, 2014</xref>). Herein, we did not directly examine the effects of a prior RS exposure on the subsequent induction or expression of LTP/LTD in fear-conditioned mice using an in vitro or in vivo electrophysiological method. However, the results of our optogenetic experiment, together with existing evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karst et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sarabdjitsingh and JoÃ«ls, 2014</xref>), led us to postulate that the persistence of AFC-induced LTP is suppressed by a previous RS exposure, thereby protecting animals from encoding excessive cued fear memory.</p><p>Two previous studies have contributed to our understanding the GR-dependent mechanisms involved in prior stress-modulated synaptic plasticity. Di et al. demonstrated that a short application of corticosterone activates G protein-coupled postsynaptic membrane glucocorticoid receptors (mGRs), leading to the synthesis and release of an endocannabinoid, which binds to the presynaptic CB1 endocannabinoid receptor to suppress glutamate release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, postsynaptic mGRs activation induced by a recent RS exposure may result in reduction of glutamate release during subsequent fear conditioning. In another study, Sato et al. demonstrated that membrane-impermeable corticosterone treatment decreases <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, suggesting that activation of mGRs may inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via the NMDA receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sato et al., 2004</xref>).

Mice were placed in the conditioning chamber for 60 s and then presented with a 30 s tone (65 dB, white noise) through a speaker on the ceiling of the sound-attenuating chamber. At the end of the tone presentation, mice were given a foot shock (0.5 mA, 2 s for three CSÂ ÃÂ US pairings at 1 min intervals and 0.5 mA, 1 s for six CSÂ ÃÂ US pairings at 30 s intervals). Mice were returned to their home cages 30 s after the last foot shock. The contextual and auditory-cued fear memory retention tests were conducted 24 and 48 hr after training, respectively. During the contextual memory test, mice were re-exposed to the conditioning chamber for 5 min without the tone and shock presentation. The conditioning chamber was cleaned with 70% ethanol before each trial. For the auditory-cued memory test, mice were placed in a novel chamber (10Â ÃÂ 10Â ÃÂ 10 cm, with white walls and a flat floor). Freezing was scored for 3 min before delivery of the tone and then scored for 3 min in the presence of the tone. Before each trial, the chamber was cleaned with 4% acetic acid.

Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we did not conduct in vivo electrophysiological analysis using stressed mice. However, in a previous electrophysiological study, brain slices containing the BLA region were analyzed to understand how restraint stress (RS) affects synaptic plasticity (Sarabdjitsinh and Joels, 2014). This report demonstrated that the persistence of LTP induced in the presence of corticosterone is sensitive to a previous RS exposure (Sarabdjitsinh and Joels, 2014). Therefore, in our study, we postulated that the persistence of LTP in fear-conditioned floxed GR mice is suppressed by a previous RS exposure, thereby leading to suppression of auditory-cued fear memory. This was indirectly verified by the fact that suppressed auditory-cued fear memory in RS-exposed floxed GR mice was rescued by optogenetic LTP induction in the LA. Accordingly, such suppression of auditory-cued fear memory was not observed in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice, suggesting that the persistence of LTP was not altered in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice. Thus, optogenetic delivery of LTP to the LA of RS-exposed LAGRKO mice exerted no influence on auditory-cued fear memory.</p><p>Two studies have contributed to our understanding of the GR-dependent mechanisms involved in stress-related modulation of synaptic plasticity in the LA. Di et al. demonstrated that a short application of corticosterone activates G protein-coupled postsynaptic membrane glucocorticoid receptors (mGRs), leading to synthesis and release of an endocannabinoid that binds to presynaptic CB1 endocannabinoid receptor to suppress glutamate release (Di et al., 2003). Thus, postsynaptic mGRs activation induced by a recent RS exposure may result in reduction of glutamate release during subsequent fear conditioning. In another study, Sato et al. demonstrated that membrane-impermeable corticosterone treatment decreases <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, suggesting that activation of mGRs may inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via the NMDA receptor (Sato et al., 2004). Therefore, the reduced presynaptic glutamate release and inhibition of postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx 1 h after RS exposure may influence the required level of depolarization for long-term maintenance of LTP. See Discussion, third paragraph. A diagram of a summary of these events was added in Figure 6âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Add discussion about what the model is; answer the following questions even if it's speculation:</p><p>- In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, the authors state that activation of LAGR by stress suppresses fear conditioning-induced LTP at auditory inputs to the LA and that this is indicated by the reduction of freezing in restraint stress exposed LAGRKO mice after delivery of an LTD protocol.

In contrast, optogenetic delivery of an LTP protocol did not alter the freezing level in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice, further suggesting that LAGR is required for the mechanisms responsible for stress-induced suppression of LTP. The purpose of using the LTD protocol is to verify whether the conditioned fear responses in RS-exposed LAGRKO mice is altered by reducing the synaptic strength. In the present study, we did not conclude that a synaptic mechanism similar to that elicited by an optical LTD is responsible for stress-induced suppression of fear-conditioned LTP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The absence of any data on corticosterone levels elicited by restraint stress is surprising in light of the central role this form of stress plays in the experimental findings reported in the manuscript.
