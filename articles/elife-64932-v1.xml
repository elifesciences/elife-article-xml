than males. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underpinning sex-dependent longevity are currently unclear. Epigenetic clocks are powerful biological biomarkers capable of precisely estimating chronological age and identifying novel factors influencing the aging rate using only DNA methylation data. In this study, we developed the first epigenetic clock for domesticated sheep (<italic>Ovis aries</italic>), which can predict chronological age with a median absolute error of 5.1 months. We have discovered that castrated male sheep have a decelerated aging rate compared to intact males, mediated at least in part by the removal of androgens. Furthermore, we identified several androgen-sensitive CpG dinucleotides that become progressively hypomethylated with age in intact males, but remain stable in castrated males and females. Comparable sex-specific methylation differences in <italic>MKLN1</italic> also exist in bat skin and a range of mouse tissues that have high androgen receptor expression, indicating that it may drive androgen-dependent hypomethylation in divergent mammalian species. In characterizing these sites, we identify biologically plausible mechanisms explaining how androgens drive male-accelerated aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>castration</kwd><kwd>epigenetic clock</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>sheep</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>androgens</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Paul G.

When highly correlated age-dependent sites are modeled through the use of a tool known as the epigenetic clock, exceptionally precise estimates of chronological age (termed ‘DNAm age’ or ‘epigenetic age’) can be achieved using only purified DNA as an input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hannum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Horvath and Raj, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levine et al., 2018</xref>). For example, despite being one of the earliest epigenetic clocks constructed, Horvath’s 353 CpG site clock is capable of estimating chronological age with a median absolute error (MAE) of 3.6 years and an age correlation of 0.96, irrespective of tissue or cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horvath, 2013</xref>). Estimates generated by this and related epigenetic clocks are not only predictive of chronological age but also biological age, allowing identification of pathologies as well as novel genetic and environmental factors that accelerate or slow biological aging. For example, irrespective of ethnic background, females and exceptionally long-lived individuals are found to have reduced epigenetic aging compared to males and other controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horvath et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Horvath et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Lifespan in mammals (including humans) is highly dependent upon an individual’s sex, whereby females generally possess a longevity advantage over males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemaître et al., 2020</xref>). Despite being a fundamental risk factor affecting age-related pathologies, the mechanistic basis of how sex influences aging is relatively unexplored. Perhaps not surprisingly, sex hormones are predicted to play a central role, with both androgens and estrogens thought to influence aspects of the aging process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horstman et al., 2012</xref>). Castration has been shown to extend the lifespan of laboratory rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asdell et al., 1967</xref>), as well as domesticated cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamilton, 1965</xref>) and dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoffman et al., 2013</xref>). Castration has also been associated with longer lifespans in historical survival reports of 14th- to 20th-century Korean eunuchs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Min et al., 2012</xref>) and men housed in US mental institutions in the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamilton and Mestler, 1969</xref>), although not in castrato opera singers, somewhat common in the 15th–19th centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nieschlag et al., 1993</xref>). Conversely, estrogen production appears to have some protective effect on aging in females, with ovariectomized mice having a shortened lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benedusi et al., 2015</xref>) and replacement of ovaries from young animals into old female mice extending lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cargill et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, ovariectomy has been shown to accelerate the epigenetic clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stubbs et al., 2017</xref>), supporting predictions that estrogen production slows the intrinsic rate of aging relative to males. In humans, natural and surgical induction of menopause also hastens the pace of the epigenetic clock, while menopausal hormone therapy decreases epigenetic aging as observed in buccal cell samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levine et al., 2016</xref>). Female breast tissue has substantially advanced epigenetic age compared to other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sehl et al., 2017</xref>), further implicating sex hormones. Nevertheless, the effects of castration and/or testosterone production on the epigenetic predictors of aging in males have remained unknown in either humans or animal models prior to the current study.</p><p>Domesticated sheep (<italic>Ovis aries</italic>) represent a valuable, albeit underappreciated, large animal model for human disease and share with humans more similar anatomy, physiology, body size, genetics, and reproductive lifestyle as compared with commonly studied rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pinnapureddy et al., 2015</xref>). With respect to aging, sheep exhibit a remarkable female-specific lifespan advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lemaître et al., 2020</xref>), and Soay sheep of the Outer Hebrides represent a cornerstone research paradigm for longevity in wild mammal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fairlie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jewell, 1997</xref>). Moreover, sheep are extensively farmed (and males castrated) in many countries, allowing incidental study of the effect of sex and sex hormones in aging to occur without increasing experimental animal use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Russell and Burch, 1959</xref>). Yet, exploration of the molecular aging process in sheep is relatively underdeveloped, particularly from the perspective of epigenetics and sex.</p><p>Here, we present the first sheep epigenetic clock and quantify its median error to 5.1 months, ~3.5–4.2% of their expected lifespan. Validating the biological relevance of our sheep model, we find age-associated methylation at genes well characterized for their role in development and aging in a wide range of animal systems. Significantly, we observed that not only castration affects the epigenome, but that the methylomes of castrated male sheep show reduced epigenetic aging compared to intact male and female counterparts, a result consistent with the increased longevity of castrated Soay sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jewell, 1997</xref>). Many genomic regions and genes with differential age association between castrated and intact males were identified, some of which are known to be regulated or bound by androgen receptor (AR) in humans and show sexually dimorphic methylation patterns in divergent mammalian species. Taken together, these findings provide a credible mechanistic link between levels of sex hormones and sex-dependent aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA methylation in blood and ear throughout sheep aging</title><p>To create an epigenetic clock for sheep, we purified DNA from a total of 432 sheep of the Merino breed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

There was some sub-clustering based on sex and age; however, there was no separation based on known underlying pedigree variation or processing batches. Global average CpG methylation levels in ear tissue exhibited a small progressive increase with age, though the same trend was not seen in blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Pearson correlation coefficients (r) describing the linear relationship between CpG methylation and chronological age ranged from −0.63 to 0.68 for all ear and blood samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). One of the most positively correlated mapped probes was located within the promoter of fibroblast growth factor 8 (<italic>FGF8</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), a well-described developmental growth factor (r = 0.64, p=1.38E<sup>−51</sup>). Probes located within several other well-known transcription factors (TFs) were also among those most highly correlated with age (<italic>PAX6</italic>, r = 0.62, p=2.71E<sup>−47</sup>; <italic>PAX5</italic>, r = 0.59, p=5.75E<sup>−43</sup>; <italic>HOXC4</italic>, r = 0.59, p=4.47E<sup>−43</sup>). Indeed, when we performed ontogeny analysis, we found that the top 500 CpGs positively correlated with age were enriched for transcription-related and DNA binding processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), consistent with widespread transcriptional shifts during different life stages. When we stratified our data, we found considerable differences in age association with regard to tissue of origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); however, this is consistent with other clock studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Issa, 2014</xref>). Sex and castration status also produced group-specific age association hits; however, this was comparatively less than that for tissue, with many significantly associated sites being shared between females and males (blood, 45 shared sites) and females, intact males, and castrated females (ear, 84 shared sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). Interestingly, we also found a CpG (cg18266944) in the second intron of insulin-like growth factor 1 (<italic>IGF1</italic>) that becomes rapidly hypomethylated in ear following birth before leveling off post-adolescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; r = −0.60, p=7.43E<sup>−15</sup>).

Both castrated males and intact aged-matched controls were sourced from genetically similar flocks kept under comparable environmental conditions.

Indeed, it appeared that significant male-specific hypomethylation was not present in sheep blood; and such compelling examples of this effect had not been reported previously in other species (most studies of which also involved blood). To explore this further, we assessed methylation changes in several mouse tissues using the pan-mammalian array. Again, cg21524116 in <italic>MKLN1</italic> stood out – muscle, tail, and kidney exhibited the same male-specific hypomethylation as seen in sheep, whereby females retain a constant level of high methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). Importantly, however, this same trend could not be seen in mouse blood, cerebellum, cortex, and liver. To explain this tissue specificity, we made use of microarray expression data from mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2002</xref>) and found that the AR is highly expressed in muscle, kidney, and (epidermis of) skin, tissues where androgen sensitivity at MKLN1 was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

Here, we developed the first epigenetic clock for sheep and show that it is capable of estimating chronological age with a MAE of 5.1 months – between 3.5% and 4.2% of the average sheep lifespan. Significantly, we also present the first evidence that castration feminizes parts of the epigenome and delays epigenetic aging.</p><p>Improved survival has previously been reported in castrated sheep compared to intact males and females, at least part of which has been attributed to behavioral changes such as reduced aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jewell, 1997</xref>). Our data shows that castration also causes a delay in intrinsic aging as assessed by the epigenetic clock, with an average reduction in epigenetic age of 3.1 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, delayed epigenetic aging in castrates is also seen relative to intact males and females, which is consistent with castrated males outliving intact animals of both sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jewell, 1997</xref>). We also find that the degree of age deceleration observed in castrated males is dependent on their chronological age. For instance, the average DNAm deceleration is increased by an additional 1.2 months when considering individuals aged beyond 2.9 years. In contrast, we saw no difference between castrated and intact males younger than 18 months. Together this implies that the effects of androgen exposure on the epigenome and aging are cumulative. Similar findings of greater age deceleration at later chronological ages have been observed in rodent models, with long-lived calorie-restricted mice showing a younger epigenetic age relatively late in life, but similar epigenetic aging rates at younger ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Petkovich et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>These results support the reproductive cell-cycle theory as an explanation for sex-dependent differences in longevity of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atwood and Bowen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bowen and Atwood, 2004</xref>). Androgens and other testicular factors may be working in an antagonistic pleiotropic manner whereby they push cells through the cell cycle and promote growth in early life to reach reproductive maturity, thus also influencing the epigenome in an age-related manner. This process, however, may become dysregulated and promote senescence at older ages, reflected in the hastening of the epigenetic clock observed in intact males compared to castrates. It is well known in farming practice that where it can be managed appropriately, leaving male sheep intact or partially intact (i.e., cryptorchid) increases body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seideman et al., 1982</xref>), something we also observed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This indicates greater rates of cell cycle progression, cellular division, and tissue hyperplasia. Under this hypothesis, the effects of castration should depend on whether animals are castrated before or after puberty. In rats, castration just after birth (i.e., prior to puberty) causes substantial lifespan extension while castration after puberty has smaller effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Talbert and Hamilton, 1965</xref>), supporting the idea that male gonadal hormones have effects at early-life stages that have deleterious consequences for survival.</p><p>Consequences of castration for increased survival and slowed epigenetic aging could also be linked to the effects of androgens on sexual dimorphism and adult reproductive investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks and Garratt, 2017</xref>). Life history theories predict that males in highly polygynous species, like sheep, should be selected to invest heavily in reproduction early in life, even at the expense of a shorter lifespan, because they have the potential to monopolize groups of females and quickly produce many offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clutton-Brock and Isvaran, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tidière et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, selection on females should promote a slower reproductive life strategy because female reproductive rate is limited by the number of offspring they can produce. While we show that castration slows epigenetic aging in sheep, loss of ovarian hormone production in mice and human (through ovariectomy or menopause) is associated with a hastening of the epigenetic clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stubbs et al., 2017</xref>), consistent with the beneficial effects of female ovarian hormones on survival. Thus, it appears that both male and female sex hormones differentially regulate the epigenetic aging process in directly opposing ways, in a manner that is consistent with the life history strategies classically thought to be optimal for each sex.</p><p>Comparison of intact and castrated males also allowed us to identify several age-related DMPs that display clear androgen-sensitivity (asDMPs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>), with castrated males exhibiting a feminized methylation profile compared to intact counterparts at these sites. In contrast to similar experiments performed in human blood, we found that these sex-specific CpG sites are not predominantly X-linked in sheep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCartney et al., 2019</xref>), but are instead distributed evenly throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As yet, we do not know if castration in later life would drive feminization of methylation patterns as we observed for early-life castration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is, however, an interesting consideration – it is possible that castration late in life would quickly recapitulate the methylation differences seen in those castrated early in life or it may be that methylation patterns established during early growth and development are difficult to change once set on a particular aging trajectory. This distinction may be important from a functional perspective because early- and later-life castration can have differing effects on survival in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Talbert and Hamilton, 1965</xref>). Moreover, while early-life castration has been shown to extend human lifespan, androgen depletion in elderly men can be associated with poor health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araujo et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Many of the highly significant asDMPs (i.e., 28/50, or 58%) are bound by AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When considering TF binding compared to background levels, our data shows that particularly AR, but also NR3C1, ESR1, FOXA1, and CEBP binding are enriched in the most significant asDMPs; all of which share biologically integrated functions. NR3C1, which encodes the GR and has been previously linked to longevity in certain populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olczak et al., 2019</xref>), is an anabolic steroid receptor; thus, it shares significant homology in its binding domain with AR and targets many DNA sequences also bound by AR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Claessens et al., 2017</xref>). CEBP is known to directly bind AR in prostate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agoulnik et al., 2003</xref>). FOXA1 has been found to regulate estrogen receptor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hurtado et al., 2011</xref>) as well as AR and GR binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sahu et al., 2013</xref>) in both normal and cancer cells. Furthermore, FOXA1 aids in ESR1-mediated recruitment of GRs to estrogen receptor binding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karmakar et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, AR agonist treatment in breast cancer models reprograms binding of both FOXA1 and ESR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ponnusamy et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting some degree of antagonistic function between the androgen and estrogen receptors. If this is true for asDMPs, these sites may well represent a conduit through which castrates and androgen-deprived males take on physiologically feminized traits, including delayed aging.</p><p>Having said this, it remains a possibility that methylation levels at androgen-sensitive sites have very little to do with biological aging and instead only diverge as time progresses due to the period of androgen exposure or deficiency. Specifically, the changes in methylation observed between intact and castrated males may not be adaptive at all, and rather, methylation is progressively ‘diluted’ by binding of AR to the DNA. Variable methylation at AR target genes has been reported in humans with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) when compared to normal controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ammerpohl et al., 2013</xref>), supporting the notion that AR binding could influence age-associated methylation profiles.</p><p>The most striking example of age-dependent androgen-sensitive DNA methylation loss we found was that detected by the probe cg21524116, mapping to <italic>MKLN1</italic> (Muskelin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Evidence for <italic>MKLN1</italic> androgen-dependence has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin et al., 2013</xref>), and MKLN1-containing complexes have been shown to regulate lifespan in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamilton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), although no links between this gene and mammalian longevity are yet known. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) data demonstrates enriched AR binding at the position of this asDMP in human, as well as exhibiting high-sequence conservation, DNase hypersensitivity and H3K27ac marks – the latter two of which are markers of open chromatin and indicate transcriptionally active areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Significantly, we found that <italic>MKLN1</italic> hypomethylation can be seen in skin from male bats, as well as tail, muscle, and kidney from mice – all tissues where there is high expression of AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>). In contrast, tissues showing no sex-dependent methylation changes in <italic>MKLN1</italic> during aging (i.e., cortex, cerebellum, and liver) show lower or silenced expression of AR. While this needs to be tested in more species and tissues, together this implies that <italic>MKLN1</italic> and other asDMPs represent potential biomarkers of androgen exposure over long time periods in a broad range of mammals.</p><p>In summary, this paper describes a robust epigenetic clock for sheep that is capable of estimating chronological age, detecting accelerated rates of aging, and contributes to a growing body of work on epigenetic aging. In addition to demonstrating the utility of sheep as an excellent model for aging studies, our data identify androgen-dependent age-associated methylation changes that affect known targets of sex hormone pathways and hormone binding TFs. While these changes may not promote aging per se, identification of loci with age-dependent androgen-sensitive methylation patterns uncovers novel mechanisms by which male-accelerated aging in mammals can be explained.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>DNA extraction and quantitation</title><p>Sheep DNA samples for this study were derived from two distinct tissues from two strains: ear tissue from New Zealand Merino and blood from South Australian Merino.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sheep ear DNA source</title><p>Ear tissue was obtained from females and both intact and castrated male Merino sheep during routine on-farm ear tagging procedures in Central Otago, New Zealand. As a small piece of tissue is removed during the ear tagging process that is usually discarded by the farmer, we were able to source tissue and record the year of birth without altering animal experience, in accordance with the New Zealand Animal Welfare Act (1999) and the National Animal Ethics Advisory Committee (NAEAC) Occasional Paper No 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carsons, 1998</xref>). The exact date of birth for each sheep is unknown; however, this was estimated to be the 18th of October each year, according to the date at which rams were put out with ewes (May 10th of each year), a predicted mean latency until mating of 12 days, and the mean gestation period from a range of sheep breeds (149 days) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fogarty et al., 2005</xref>). Castration was performed by the farmer using the rubber ring method within approximately 5–50 days from birth as per conventional farming practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">National Animal Welfare Advisory Comittee NZ, 2018</xref>). Mass of yearlings was recorded by the farmer for both castrated and intact male sheep at 6.5 months of age as a part of routine growth assessment. In total, ear tissue from 138 female sheep aged 1 month to 9.1 years and 126 male sheep (63 intact, 63 castrates) aged 6 months to 5.8 years was collected and subjected to DNA extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>DNA was extracted from ear punch tissue using a Bio-On-Magnetic-Beads (BOMB) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oberacker et al., 2019</xref>), which isolates DNA molecules using solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads. Approximately 3 mm punches of ear tissue were lysed in 200 μL TNES buffer (100 mM Tris, 25 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10% w/v SDS), supplemented with 5 μL 20 mg/mL Proteinase K and 2 μL RNAse A and incubated overnight at 55°C as per BOMB protocols. The remainder of the protocol was appropriately scaled to maximize DNA output while maintaining the necessary 2:3:4 ratio of beads:lysate:isopropanol. As such, 40 μL cell lysate, 80 μL 1.5X GITC (guanidinium thiocyanate), 40 μL TE-diluted Sera-Mag Magnetic SpeedBeads (GE Healthcare, GEHE45152105050250), and 80 μL isopropanol were combined. After allowing DNA to bind the SPRI beads, tubes were placed on a neodymium magnetic rack for ~5 min until the solution clarified and supernatant was removed. Beads were washed 1× with isopropanol and 2× with 70% ethanol, and then left to air dry on the magnetic rack. 25 μL of MilliQ H<sub>2</sub>O was added to resuspend beads, and tubes were removed from the rack to allow DNA elution. Tubes were once again set onto the magnets, and the clarified solution (containing DNA) was collected.</p><p>DNA was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# P11496). 1 μL DNA sample was added to 14 μL TE diluted PicoGreen in MicroAmp optical 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat# N8010560) as per the manufacturer's directions, sealed, and placed into a QuantStudio qPCR machine for analysis.

The resulting cell pellet was incubated in cell digestion buffer (2.4 mM EDTA, 75 mM NaCl, 0.5% SDS) and Proteinase K (500 μg/mL) at 50°C for 2 h. Phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (PCI, 25:24:1; pH 8) was added at equal volumes, mixed by inversion, and placed in the centrifuge for 5 min at 14,000 RPM at room temperature (repeated if necessary).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Sara Hägg as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Amr Sawalha (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162).

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper by Sugrue et al. describes an epigenetic clock in sheep and explores how castration affects epigenetic aging. The study demonstrates that androgen deficiency (induced by castration) in male sheep delays epigenetic aging. Androgen specificity of probes that show differences in age-dependent methylation changes between castrated and non-castrated males was inferred by enrichment in AR binding sites suggesting presumed regulation by androgens.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The aim of the study is not adequately described. There are incentives for the epigenetic clock creation, but the results also include age-related changes on the methylome?</p><p>2. Not the same order of presentation in methods and results. Age-associated changes in the methylome comes first in results but not in methods.</p><p>3. Any batch effects corrected for in the methylation data?</p><p>4. Pearson correlations assumes linearity, sensitivity analysis using Spearman correlation may be needed?</p><p>5. Figure 1:</p><p>a. In the analysis correlating epigenetic changes with age, presented in Figure 1B, please clarify how these data were corrected for multiple testing.</p><p>b. Is there a difference between females and intact males in the analysis correlating methylation levels with chronological age (Figure 1B)?</p><p>c. The figure legend in does not reflect the data presented in the figure.</p><p>6. The epigenetic clock:</p><p>a. Is the castrated samples included in the elastic net regression model in the clock creation? This is unclear, and I don´t think these samples should be included as they deviate from normal aging in sheep, at least in 18 months old sheep.</p><p>b. Figure 2A. The correlation in sheep blood is not as good as in other selections. Why is this? There seems to be an overrepresentation of young sheep in the data, can this be corrected for using weighted effects in the elastic net to get a better prediction? Or what happens if the Huntington samples are removed? Are they causing this pattern?</p><p>c. Figure 2E seems to be identical to 2C, what is the difference here? Not adequately described.</p><p>d. The rationale for creating a dual species clock is not clear. What does it add?</p><p>e. Figure 3A, I don´t understand how the ranking of the samples was done? If you have age-matched castrated and intact male sheep, why don´t you also use a matched control setting for the test statistic to calculate the DNAmAge difference? That would most likely account for other unmeasured confounders as well.</p><p>f. Figure 3B, P-value in text and figure legend does not match.</p><p>7. I do not agree on this statement: &quot;We found there was a sharp inflection in p value after approximately the 50 most significant probes (Figure S4A) and thus represented a natural cut-off for analysis.&quot; Looking into Table S3 and the p-values for the CpGs, this is not apparent. I suggest make a FDR-level cut-off and redo enrichment analyses as well.</p><p>8. The mouse methylation data are not described and the statistical test used in Figure 6 is not explained. Please put labels on top of Figure 6A and B.</p><p>9. It will be informative to examine DNA methylation differences between age-matched female and male sheep using a subset of the study samples. Also more specifically, is there a difference in methylation levels among the asDMPs identified?</p><p>10. To what extent does castration reverse methylation differences between males and females and/or methylation levels in asDMP compared to age-matched females? In other words do androgens completely or partly explain the difference between males and females?</p><p>11. It would have been nice if serum samples are available to explore the correlation between methylation levels in asDMP and androgen levels, but this might not be feasible.</p><p>12. The authors show significantly reduced mass of male lambs after castration. Within the castrated and intact groups separately, is there any correlation between mass and DNA methylation levels at any of the asDMP? This will help establish a &quot;phenotypic&quot; change associated with the DNA methylation changes induced by androgen deficiency.</p><p>13. Any specific positional annotation enrichment for age-correlated CpG sites and asDMP relative to CpG islands, shores, etc.</p><p>14. Can the authors further speculate about the reason behind tissue-specificity for asDMP (e.g. MKLN1), and how the presence or absence of androgens might be mechanistically linked to changes in DNA methylation? Why is there no difference seen in blood mammal tissues? The discussion around this needs to dig a little deeper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64932.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The aim of the study is not adequately described. There are incentives for the epigenetic clock creation, but the results also include age-related changes on the methylome?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers comments we have made more of an effort to introduce the need to explore the fundamentals of molecular aging through DNA methylation (and its association with age). Key passages edited include:</p><p>“Moreover, sheep are extensively farmed (and males castrated) in many countries, allowing incidental study of the effect of sex and sex hormones in aging to occur without increasing experimental animal use (Russell and Burch, 1959). Yet, exploration of the molecular aging process in sheep is relatively under developed, particularly from the perspective of epigenetics and sex.”</p><p>and</p><p>“Here we present the first sheep epigenetic clock and quantify its median error to 5.1 months, ~3.5-4.2 % of their expected lifespan. Validating the biological relevance of our sheep model, we find age associated methylation at genes well-characterised for their role in development and aging in a wide range of animal systems.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Not the same order of presentation in methods and results. Age-associated changes in the methylome comes first in results but not in methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now placed the &quot;Identification of age-associated and androgen-sensitive DMPs&quot; section earlier in the methods, before description of the clock.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Any batch effects corrected for in the methylation data?</p></disp-quote><p>In knowing the risk of batch effects potentially skewing our data, we sought to eliminate them from our main test comparison (i.e. castrates vs intacts) by arranging them on our array chips alternately (i.e. castrate_1, intact_1, castrate_2, intact_2….etc). Having put these protections in place, it appears they were not needed – hierarchical clustering revealed some clustering on the basis of sex and age as indicated in the manuscript, however, did not reveal any structuring on batch.</p><p>We have since clarified this point in the manuscript.</p><p>“There was some sub-clustering based on sex and age; however, there was no separation based on known underlying pedigree variation or processing batches”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Pearson correlations assumes linearity, sensitivity analysis using Spearman correlation may be needed?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewers’ comment, we compared correlation between chronological age and methylation levels at each CpG using Pearson and Spearman, and found good consistency between the methods for all samples and for Ewe ear punch only (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">2</xref>). Importantly, sites we picked out as being biologically interesting showed high correlation using either Pearson or Spearman (highlighted red).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64932-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64932-resp-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While we are pleased to have done this analysis, we are not convinced the results warrant inclusion in the manuscript. Nevertheless, details of what was done have now been included in the methods section.</p><p>“WGCNA outputs Pearson correlation as standard; however, we repeated the analysis using Spearman correlation and good consistency was seen generally, with regions of interest (e.g. PAX6, FGF8, PAX5, HOXC4 and IGF1) showing very similar results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 1:</p><p>a. In the analysis correlating epigenetic changes with age, presented in Figure 1B, please clarify how these data were corrected for multiple testing.</p></disp-quote><p>No correction for multiple testing was done for this figure (i.e. only uncorrected p-values are showing). Nevertheless, the findings are still significant even after Bonferroni correction. This has now been clarified in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Is there a difference between females and intact males in the analysis correlating methylation levels with chronological age (Figure 1B)?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment we are now showing stratified data for tissue and sex in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. We found that sex and castration status had much less effect on age associations compared when tissue was used to stratify the data. This has been updated in the text as follows:</p><p>“When we stratified our data, we found considerable differences in age association with regard to tissue of origin (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), however, this is consistent with other clock studies. Sex and castration status also produced group-specific age association hits, however, this was comparatively less than for tissue, with many of the most significantly associated sites being shared between females and males (blood, 45 shared sites) and females, intact males and castrated females (ear, 84 shared sites) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. The figure legend in does not reflect the data presented in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this was an oversight – &quot;Creation of the epigenetic clock in sheep.&quot; refers specifically to just one part of the Figure 1A, not the whole figure. As such, we have changed this figure title to &quot;Association between age and DNA methylation in sheep&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The epigenetic clock:</p><p>a. Is the castrated samples included in the elastic net regression model in the clock creation? This is unclear, and I don´t think these samples should be included as they deviate from normal aging in sheep, at least in 18 months old sheep.</p></disp-quote><p>Castrated sheep were included in the elastic net regression as indicated in Figure 1. We felt this was important to include them in the clock, as modelling epigenetic age in castrates forms a central part of our analysis (if the castrates were not included, we risk having a clock that held sites not suitable for their population).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Figure 2A. The correlation in sheep blood is not as good as in other selections. Why is this? There seems to be an overrepresentation of young sheep in the data, can this be corrected for using weighted effects in the elastic net to get a better prediction? Or what happens if the Huntington samples are removed? Are they causing this pattern?</p></disp-quote><p>We feel there are two potential factors driving the lower correlation in blood. Firstly, there was far fewer sheep included in the blood only set, and as pointed out by the reviewers, an overrepresentation of young sheep. This means the clock will be less predictive in general, particularly at advanced ages. Secondly, blood is likely more heterogeneous as a tissue compared to ear punches.</p><p>There was no significant difference in predicted epigenetic age for Huntington sheep compared to controls (p=0.3), therefore, we think this is an unlikely contributing factor.</p><p>To clarify this point in the manuscript, we have added the following passage to the Results section:</p><p>“When blood and ear clocks are constructed separately, the ear clock outperformed the blood clock in the LOOCV analysis (0.97 vs 0.75 correlation respectively, Figure 2B-C). While this may be related to blood being a more heterogeneous tissue than ear punch, less samples and an overrepresentation of young individuals is a likely driver of this effect.”</p><p>Further, to assist readability, we have changed the order of Figure 2A-C so that the multi-tissue clock (that was used for the majority of the analysis) is presented first (Figure2A), with the blood and skin clocks following (Figure 2B and 2C respectively)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Figure 2E seems to be identical to 2C, what is the difference here? Not adequately described.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2E represents a sheep and human multi-tissue clock that has been applied to only sheep, whereas Figure 2C (in the old manuscript) is a sheep-only multi-tissue clock applied to sheep only. We have clarified this in the Figure legend as follows.</p><p><bold>“</bold>Figure 2. Comparison of chronological age (x-axis) and epigenetic age (y-axis) for a variety of clock models trained on (A-C) sheep only, or (D-G) humans and sheep. […] Maximum lifespan values used were for human and sheep respectively were 122.5 years and 22.8 years. Each data point represents one sample, coloured based on origin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d. The rationale for creating a dual species clock is not clear. What does it add?</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to defining a single set of sites that act as a clock in both species, a dual-species clock provides an extra 'sanity-check' on our data because spurious age associations will be reduced by having an additional species and extra samples. Indeed, the demonstration that epigenetic age deceleration of castrates was found using the dual-species clock provides additional support for the original observation using the sheep clock alone.</p><p>This has now been made clearer in the Results section:</p><p>“In order to broaden applicability of the sheep clock, and also substantiate its general characteristics, two human and sheep dual-species clocks were also constructed.”</p><p>and</p><p>“Notably, the age deceleration observed in castrates was corroborated using the human and sheep dual-species clock (Figure 3—figure supplement 3, p=0.04), thus providing additional support for this finding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e. Figure 3A, I don´t understand how the ranking of the samples was done? If you have age-matched castrated and intact male sheep, why don´t you also use a matched control setting for the test statistic to calculate the DNAmAge difference? That would most likely account for other unmeasured confounders as well.</p></disp-quote><p>The 'ranking' of the samples is done by epigenetic age, and only relates to Figure 3A (note, statistics was not applied on this ranked data). The reason we presented Figure 3A in this manner was so that it was obvious to the reader that as the sheep aged (chronologically), divergence in epigenetic age between castrated and intact males became greater.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. Figure 3B, P-value in text and figure legend does not match.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a typographical error on our behalf – The &quot;0.01&quot; in the legend of Figure 3B was missing a digit (i.e. 0.018). This has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. I do not agree on this statement: &quot;We found there was a sharp inflection in p value after approximately the 50 most significant probes (Figure S4A) and thus represented a natural cut-off for analysis.&quot; Looking into Table S3 and the p-values for the CpGs, this is not apparent. I suggest make a FDR-level cut-off and redo enrichment analyses as well.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do believe there is an inflection point in p-value around this cut-off, we have nevertheless removed the top 50 as a cut-off for subsequent analysis; and have instead performed cistrome enrichments for all asDMPs identified. As this extended analysis required automation and updating of the cistrome database output, the numbers in Figure 5 have changed slightly, however, the interpretation remains the same.</p><p>Importantly, this extended analysis revealed that androgen receptor (AR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) have enriched binding in only the top ~200 most significant asDMPs, before returning to the expected background. This analysis is now included in Figure 4—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The mouse methylation data are not described and the statistical test used in Figure 6 is not explained. Please put labels on top of Figure 6A and B.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 6 has been completely reconstructed on account of exciting new data. Nevertheless, we have labelled tissue and species much more clearly and described the statistical test used in the same manner as Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. It will be informative to examine DNA methylation differences between age-matched female and male sheep using a subset of the study samples. Also more specifically, is there a difference in methylation levels among the asDMPs identified?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand what the reviewers are asking for in this question – age matched female and male sheep methylation for the asDMPs is shown in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. To what extent does castration reverse methylation differences between males and females and/or methylation levels in asDMP compared to age-matched females? In other words do androgens completely or partly explain the difference between males and females?</p></disp-quote><p>As in Figure 4, for the iconic asDMPs (MKLN1, ETAA1, <italic>LMO4</italic>, KIAA2026), androgens almost completely explain the differences between males and females. Despite being a strong effect at this site, there are some sexually dimorphic probes that are androgen-insensitive, so the effect is partial.</p><p>We have altered the discussion to clarify this point:</p><p>“Comparison of intact and castrated males also allowed us to identify several age-related DMPs that display clear androgen-sensitivity (asDMPs, Figure 4A-D), with castrated males exhibiting a feminised methylation profile compared to intact counterparts at these sites”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. It would have been nice if serum samples are available to explore the correlation between methylation levels in asDMP and androgen levels, but this might not be feasible.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately this is not feasible (blood/serum was not taken from the rams where ear punches were also taken). While beyond the scope of the current paper, we agree this will be an interesting experiment to perform in the future – there is reasonable variation in ram testosterone level (Clarke et al., 2012; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2011-1634">https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2011-1634</ext-link>), and this may be reflected in asDMP methylation. Nevertheless, we have performed live weight comparisons to methylation (as suggested by reviewers below) which somewhat acts as a proxy for testosterone level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors show significantly reduced mass of male lambs after castration. Within the castrated and intact groups separately, is there any correlation between mass and DNA methylation levels at any of the asDMP? This will help establish a &quot;phenotypic&quot; change associated with the DNA methylation changes induced by androgen deficiency.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a really helpful suggestion that has given us new insight into the paper.</p><p>We examined the relationship between mass in the young males (i.e. &lt;1 year old, the only sheep with mass recorded in this project) and DNA methylation and asDMPs. We found that, when individual sites were compared, the relationship to mass was on its own largely insignificant. For example, our 4 'iconic' asDMPs is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref> – of the 8 correlations shown here, only one was deemed significant (ram mass vs methylation at KIAA2026; p=0.0121). Nevertheless, it appeared that in general, there was a negative relationship between mass and methylation in intact males (green). For the castrates (blue), methylation at asDMPs and mass had a positive relationship.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64932-resp-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We then set out to explore how robust these associations were by comparing groups of 100 asDMPs at a time, and asking, (1) is there a difference in association of mass and asDMP methylation that changes for castrates and intact males, that is dependent upon asDMP prominence? and (2) does the mass vs methylation associations differ significantly between intact males and castrates? Indeed, starting with the 100 most prominent asDMPs identified, average association between mass and methylation was negative for intact rams and positive for castrates (p=1x10-9). To be sure these correlations were biologically meaningful, we sampled through less prominent asDMPs in a sliding window of 100, finding that significance merged with that of randomly chosen 100 CpG sites (10000 replicates) after the top ~1000 asDMPs.</p><p>What this analysis shows is that divergence of methylation at asDMP sites occurs early (i.e. as soon as physical traits like mass become dimorphic between intact and castrated males), and is detectable even before differences in epigenetic age are manifested. To illustrate this point, we have now included new panels in Figure 4—figure supplement 6, that show (B) the associations between mass and asDMP methylation in young sheep and (panel C) where significant differences are lost. The manuscript text has also been updated accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Any specific positional annotation enrichment for age-correlated CpG sites and asDMP relative to CpG islands, shores, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>The most striking positional enrichments found in this study was between asDMPs and the hormone related transcription factors (e.g. AR and NR3C1; as reported in Figure 5). We did perform CGI enrichment analysis – for the asDMPs, which predominantly demethylate with age in males, overlap with CGIs was observed at almost exactly the same rate as CpGs that are negatively correlated with age (i.e. 2.1% and 2.5% respectively). In contrast, sites where methylation is positively correlated with age (i.e. 'hypermethylated' over time) have lower rates of CGIs (0.32%). While it is useful to have verified that CGI enrichment is similar between asDMPs and similarly demethylating age-associated sites, we do not feel this warrants discussion in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Can the authors further speculate about the reason behind tissue-specificity for asDMP (e.g. MKLN1), and how the presence or absence of androgens might be mechanistically linked to changes in DNA methylation? Why is there no difference seen in blood mammal tissues? The discussion around this needs to dig a little deeper.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, this was a very helpful comment – we took advantage of new data from the pan-mammalian methylation array in mouse and classified them on the basis of whether there was any sex differences in methylation during aging. For MKLN1 we found mouse tail, kidney and muscle all showing asDMP behaviour, as in sheep ear punch. In contrast, mouse blood, cerebellum, cortex, heart, liver, spleen, striatum, and whole brain all lacked androgen sensitivity at this site (see more in revised Figure 6). Interestingly, those mouse tissues showing androgen sensitive methylation changes had significantly higher expression of the AR compared to tissue that do not. In addition to completely reformulating Figure 6, we have identified sex-dependent methylation changes in bats from published data of others (Figure 6—figure supplement 7). The results and discussion have been updated to reflect new data – we think together this represents an important new clues between TF binding and age-association, as well as uncovers some broader principles likely to be shared across divergent mammalian groups.</p></body></sub-article></article>
