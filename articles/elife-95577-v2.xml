protective or detrimental to normal brain functions. Currently, the mechanisms regulating neuroprotective astrocytes and the extent of neuroprotection are poorly understood. Here, we report that conditional deletion of serum response factor (SRF) in adult astrocytes causes reactive-like hypertrophic astrocytes throughout the mouse brain. These <italic>Srf</italic><sup>GFAP-ER</sup>CKO astrocytes do not affect neuron survival, synapse numbers, synaptic plasticity or learning and memory. However, the brains of <italic>Srf</italic> knockout mice exhibited neuroprotection against kainic-acid induced excitotoxic cell death. Relevant to human neurodegenerative diseases, <italic>Srf</italic><sup>GFAP-ER</sup>CKO astrocytes abrogate nigral dopaminergic neuron death and reduce β-amyloid plaques in mouse models of Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, respectively. Taken together, these findings establish SRF as a key molecular switch for the generation of reactive astrocytes with neuroprotective functions that attenuate neuronal injury in the setting of neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>reactive astrocytes</kwd><kwd>astrogliosis</kwd><kwd>SRF</kwd><kwd>serum response

in either acute tissue damage (ischemia, traumatic brain injury) or chronic morphological and functional changes in neural tissues, resulting in behavioral and cognitive deficits as seen in neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pekny and Pekna, 2014</xref>). Although much of the focus has centered on neuronal dysfunction, emerging studies have highlighted the critical roles played by non-neuronal cells, particularly astrocytes, in tissue repair, homeostasis, and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kimelberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Linnerbauer and Rothhammer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pekny and Pekna, 2014</xref>). In this regard, astrocytes respond to CNS pathology by undergoing a spectrum of transcriptomal, physiological and structural changes, termed ‘reactive astrogliosis or reactive astrocytosis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liddelow and Barres, 2017</xref>). Astrocyte reactivity is a diverse and complex cellular response that is context-dependent and reactive astrocytes perform several critical functions including aiding in repair and restoring normal homeostasis in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aswendt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Linnerbauer and Rothhammer, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pekny and Pekna, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Although reactive astrocytes could provide neuroprotection in the initial stages of disease, prolonged gliosis could hamper normal neuronal functions and contributes to the pathophysiology of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gleichman and Carmichael, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pekny and Pekna, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Phatnani and Maniatis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burda and Sofroniew, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Verkhratsky et al., 2016</xref>). For example, reactive astrocytes generated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation are dependent on microglia, deficient in several critical astrocyte functions and cause death of neurons and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guttenplan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, reactive astrocytes are also found in the aging brain and in the context of CNS neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boisvert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Clarke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liddelow et al., 2017</xref>), where inhibition of reactive astrocytes provides neuroprotection in mouse models of Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and ALS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ceyzériat et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guttenplan et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reichenbach et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yun et al., 2018</xref>). For these reasons, suppression of reactive astrogliosis is actively being pursued as an astrocyte-targeted therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have identified several genes including <italic>Stat3</italic>, <italic>Fgfr</italic>, <italic>Endothelin-1</italic>, <italic>β1-integrin</italic> and <italic>Bmal</italic> whose deletion results in hypertrophic reactive-like astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Correa-Cerro and Mandell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kang and Hébert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lananna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sofroniew, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, genetic manipulations of some of these genes have revealed their importance in regulating both the beneficial and negative effects of reactive astrocytes. For example, astrocyte-specific deletion of <italic>Stat3</italic> has revealed critical roles played by this pathway in the generation of scar-border forming astrocytes and tissue repair, and in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s and Huntington diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abjean et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben Haim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herrmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Okada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reichenbach et al., 2019</xref>). Deletion of β1-integrin resulted in progressive astrogliosis and spontaneous seizures in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Robel et al., 2009</xref>). These observations raise the intriguing possibility that reactive astrocytes can be reprogrammed to improve neuronal survival and promote CNS repair and recovery following injury and in the setting of neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To identify potential mechanisms for reactive astrocyte reprogramming, we focused on SRF, a stimulus-dependent transcription factor that plays several critical roles in nervous system development and glial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knöll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Knöll and Nordheim, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lu and Ramanan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu and Ramanan, 2012</xref>). We recently showed that astrocyte-specific deletion of SRF early during mouse development resulted in persistent reactive-like astrocytes throughout the postnatal mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain et al., 2021</xref>). Although these astrocytes did not cause any discernible abnormalities in the brain, the phenotypic changes exhibited by these <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient astrocytes could be due to developmental defects in astrocyte differentiation caused by SRF deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu and Ramanan, 2012</xref>). To address this, we now report that deletion of SRF in adult astrocytes also causes astrocyte reactivity-like phenotype that is persistent and widespread across the brain. We further show that <italic>Srf-</italic>deficient astrocytes did not affect neuronal survival, normal neuron functions, or learning and memory. Importantly, we demonstrate that astrocytic <italic>Srf</italic> deletion results in markedly attenuated neuronal death caused by excitotoxicity, and in a mouse model of Parkinson’s disease. Furthermore, astrocytic <italic>Srf</italic> deletion in the APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease causes a significant decrease in β-amyloid plaque burden. Taken together, our results reveal SRF as a critical regulator of neuroprotective reactive astrogliosis in the context of brain injury and neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SRF deletion in adult astrocytes results in GFAP+ hypertrophic astrocytes</title><p>We recently showed that astrocyte-specific SRF deletion during embryonic development using a GFAP-Cre transgenic mouse line (<italic>Srf</italic><sup>GFAP</sup>CKO) results in reactive-like astrocytes across the brain starting around 2 weeks of age and that these astrocytes persist throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jain et al., 2021</xref>). These changes in astrocytes could reflect a developmental effect or result from indirect effects via other cell types with Cre-mediated <italic>Srf</italic> loss (e.g. neurons). To determine whether SRF functions in a cell-autonomous fashion in adult astrocytes to establish a non-reactive state, we generated <italic>Srf</italic><sup>f/f; GFAP-ERT+/-</sup> (<italic>Srf</italic><sup>GFAP-ER</sup>CKO) mice in which the hGFAP promoter drives the expression of a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase in postnatal astrocytes, rather than in GFAP-positive neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chow et al., 2008</xref>). In this hGFAP-Cre<sup>ERT</sup> transgenic line, co-staining for β-gal from the Cre-IRES-β-gal transgene and cell-type specific marker genes revealed that ~85% of GFAP +and Sox9 +astrocytes were β-gal-positive in the neocortex, corpus callosum and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Death of CA3 neurons is due to excitotoxicity while that of CA1 neurons is thought to be due to anoxia/ischemia caused by status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sperk, 1994</xref>). The decreased cell death in these regions in the <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice suggests that <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient astrocytes likely protect neurons from both anoxic/ischemic and excitotoxic cell death. 6-OHDA is an oxidizable analog of dopamine that causes death of nigral dopaminergic (DA) neurons via oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hernandez-Baltazar et al., 2017</xref>). The lack of any discernible cell death of DA neurons following 6-OHDA administration in the <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice revealed robust neuroprotection from oxidative stress. In addition, <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient astrocytes in the APP/PS1 model of AD resulted in a greater reduction of amyloid plaque burden in the cortex and hippocampus. A recent study has shown that SRF may contribute to gene expression changes in reactive astrocytes in a broad cross-section of CNS disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Burda et al., 2022</xref>). These observations together suggest that SRF is a major mediator of reactive astrocytes that could provide neuroprotection in the brain following excitotoxity and in neurodegeneration.</p><p>There are some limitations to the current study. We have shown that the <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice do not exhibit any gross structural abnormalities or deficits in synaptic plasticity and behavior. However, it is possible that they may exhibit as yet uncharacterized structural or behavioral abnormalities. Astrocyte-restricted β1-integrin deletion results in widespread reactive astrocytes but these mutant mice showed spontaneous seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Robel et al., 2015</xref>). Although there was no obvious occurrence of seizures in the <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mice, electroencephalography recordings may provide information on any neuronal hyperexcitability in these mutant mice. Another limitation is that the molecular mechanisms by which <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient astrocytes provide neuroprotection is not known. The <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient astrocytes upregulate genes involved in regulating oxidative stress and these, including <italic>Cxcl16-Ccl2-Adora3</italic>, along with <italic>Gpx1, Hmox1</italic> could protect neurons from kainate-induced excitotoxicity and following 6-OHDA administration. We also observed a significant reduction in Aβ plaque burden, and this could be due to either deficits in Aβ production or efficient clearance by astrocytes. Several genes involved in Aβ clearance were upregulated in <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient astrocytes suggesting that astrocytes may promote clearance. We observed a greater accumulation of plaques near the cortical pial surface and in the hippocampal fissure region and these could be potential regions through which Aβ is cleared. Microglia can also become reactive in response to injury and neurodegeneration and reactive microglia can exert beneficial or detrimental effects on neuronal repair and recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Muzio et al., 2021</xref>). The molecular or functional nature of the reactive microglia observed in the <italic>Srf</italic> cKO mouse brains is not known. The absence of any structural and behavioral abnormalities in the <italic>Srf</italic><sup>GFAP-ER</sup>CKO mice strongly suggests that altered microglial morphology and increased numbers in these mice are unlikely to be detrimental and could potentially contribute to neuroprotection and Aβ clearance.</p><p>In summary, using the SRF transcription factor as a key regulator of reactive astrocytes, we demonstrate that the persistent presence of <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient astrocytes is not detrimental to brain cell survival, architecture, synaptic plasticity, learning or memory. Importantly, in the setting of both excitotoxicity and neurodegenerative disease these <italic>Srf</italic>-deficient reactive astrocytes provide significant neuroprotection and thus making astrocytic SRF a potential therapeutic target. In addition, the identification of SRF-dependent genes and pathways and the elucidation of neuroprotective mechanisms may open the door for novel pharmacologic therapies aimed at converting astrocytes to a neuroprotective state and allowing for optimized neuronal recovery following injury or in the setting of neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Srf</italic>-floxed mice were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ramanan et al., 2005</xref>).

The open field test was done under ambient lighting in a 45 (L) x 45 (W) x 35 (H) cm square acrylic box. Mice were gently introduced in the center of the arena and were allowed to explore freely for 10 min. The behavior was recorded using an overhead webcam (Logitech C270HD) at 720 p and 15 fps. Between each test, the arena was thoroughly cleaned with 70% ethanol to remove any odor cues. Movement of mice was tracked using custom MATLAB code developed in our lab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/swanandlab">https://github.com/swanandlab</ext-link>). Total distance traveled (cm) was automatically measured using the obtained coordinates. Only male mice (n=11, control; n=9, mutant) were used for all behaviour experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Fear conditioning</title><p>Declarative memory was tested using the contextual fear conditioning paradigm. The mice were handled for 4 days prior to training to reduce any anxiety-related effect on their memory performance. Two days prior to training, mice were habituated to transportation and room environments for 10 min. Configuration of sound attenuated contexts were as follows: context A – floor made up of steel grids, white light, 15% acetone; context B – triangle shed, laminated white sheet as floor to provide different tactile cues,75% ethanol.</p><sec id="s4-19-1"><title>Training</title><p>On training days, fear conditioning chambers were cleaned with 15% acetone. The tray below was cleaned and sprayed before placing any animal in the chamber. Animals were allowed to explore context A for 90 s and then a 2.8 kHz 75 db tone was played for 30 seconds. Animals received a 0.7mA mild foot-shock in the last 2 s of 30 s 2.8 kHz 75 dB tone in context A. This was repeated twice with a time interval of 15 s. After the last shock, animals were taken out of the chamber and brought back to their home cage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19-2"><title>Recent memory recall test in context A</title><p>24 hr post-training, animals were scored for their freezing response as a parameter of their memory. The first 90 s of freezing responses were scored manually with a custom scoring assistant plugin in ImageJ. A minimum of 1.2 s continuous freezing bouts were taken as a freezing response. Manually recorded data was analyzed using MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19-3"><title>Recent memory recall test in context B</title><p>48 hr post-training, animals were scored in context B for their freezing responses for the first 90 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19-4"><title>Remote memory recall</title><p>One month after the fear conditioning animals were tested again in context B, as explained above, and scored for their freezing response. Twenty-four hr later, the animals were tested in context A and freezing responses were recorded. In the remote recall, the order of contexts was inverted to avoid the CS-US dissociation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Barnes maze</title><p>Barnes maze test was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martyn et al., 2012</xref>). A white circular platform, 92 cm in diameter, with 20 equally spaced 5 cm-wide holes along the periphery was used. The platform was elevated 95 cm from the floor. The behavior was recorded using an overhead webcam (Logitech C270HD) at 720 p and 15 fps. A dark escape chamber was placed under one of the holes, called the target hole, which was indistinguishable from other holes. Three different visual cues, triangular, square, and circular in shape, were placed 10 cm from the edge of the platform, 120° apart from each other for mice to orient themselves in space. Cues remained constant throughout training and testing. Uniform illumination of the platform by bright LED light created an aversive stimulus to motivate the mice to seek the target hole. Before every trial, the arena was cleaned with 70% ethanol to eliminate olfactory cues. In case of unsuccessful trials, mice were gently guided to the target hole. One day before the training trial, the mice were habituated to the maze by placing them in a clear transparent plastic cylinder (15 cm in diameter) in the middle of the platform for 30 s, following which they were guided to the target hole. Mice were given 3 min to enter the escape chamber. The mice that did not enter the escape chamber were gently nudged with the cylinder to enter the chamber. Mice spent 1 min in the escape chamber before being returned to their home cage. Habituation consisted of two trials spaced 4 hr apart. On training day, mice were placed in an opaque plastic cylinder covered by an opaque lid (15 cm in diameter) for 15 s to randomize starting orientation. Each trial was initiated by lifting the cylinder and the trial lasted 2 min. The trial was stopped if the mouse entered the escape chamber. If the mouse did not get into the escape chamber within 2 min of trial, it was gently guided to the target hole with the clear plastic cylinder. Mice were returned to their home cage after 15 s of entering the escape chamber. Training trials were performed twice daily, with 1 hr interval between them with a pseudo-random starting location in the four quadrants. Trials were conducted for 4 consecutive days, until the learning curve leveled off. The test was conducted 2 hr after the last training trial. The escape chamber was removed for the probe test and the mice were allowed to explore the maze for 1 min. The videos were later analyzed for trajectories and other parameters using custom MATLAB scripts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/swanandlab">https://github.com/swanandlab</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nandi, 2023</xref>). Time to reach the correct location of the target hole was reported as latency to the target hole when the body centroid came within 10 cm of the target hole. Time spent in the target quadrant was also measured and reported.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Astrocyte isolation for transcriptome analysis</title><p>Astrocytes were isolated by magnetic assisted cell sorting (MACS) approach using the anti-ACSA2 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc, Germany). Briefly, the brains were isolated from 5 to 6-week-old <italic>Srf</italic><sup>GFAP</sup>CKO mice and meninges were removed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (For 10 ml: 1 ml 10 X HBSS w/o Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 1 µl of 1 mg/ml DNase I, 150 µl of 1 M HEPES, 120 µl of D-glucose, 9 ml milli-Q water). The neocortex and hippocampus were isolated and homogenized in a glass potter with pestle (7 ml volume) in 5 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer. The homogenate was strained through a 70 µm cell strainer and centrifuged at 300 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 37% Percoll in 15 ml centrifugation tube and centrifuged at 800 x <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4 °C. To make 37% Percoll, first a 100% Percoll solution was prepared by mixing 9 parts of Percoll with 1 part of 10 X DEPC-treated PBS (DPBS). This 100% Percoll was diluted to 37% using 1 X DPBS. The myelin in the top layer was carefully removed and discarded. The remaining supernatant was transferred to a fresh 50 ml centrifugation tube and 3 volumes ice-cold PB buffer (0.5% BSA in 1 X DPBS) to dilute the Percoll. The cell pellet was gently resuspended in 5 ml ice-cold PB buffer. Both these tubes were centrifuged at 700 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellets were pooled together in 80 µl PB buffer and 10 µl of FcR blocking reagent was added per 10<sup>7</sup> cells. After 10 min incubation at 4 °C, 10 µl of anti-ACSA2 microbeads were added per 10<sup>7</sup> cells and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The ACSA2 +astrocytes were isolated using the midi-MACS separator and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The ACSA2+ astrocytes were eluted from the magnetic columns and pelleted by centrifugation at 300 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in RNA Later (Invitrogen). To measure the purity of isolated astrocytes, the eluted ACSA2+ cell fraction was plated on poly-D-lysine coated cover glass in 24-well dishes and grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed at 7 days in vitro and immunostained for GFAP. The purity of the culture was around 95% (based on GFAP+/total DAPI+ cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>RNA sequencing and analysis</title><p>The sequence data was generated using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Data quality was checked using FastQC and MultiQC software. The data was checked for base call quality distribution, % bases above Q20, Q30, %GC, and sequencing adapter contamination. All the samples passed QC threshold of Q<sub>20</sub> &gt; 95%. Raw sequence reads were processed to remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases using fastp. The QC passed reads were mapped onto indexed Mouse reference genome (GRCm 38.90) using STAR v2 aligner. On average 99.03% of the reads aligned onto the reference genome. Gene level expression values were obtained as read counts using featureCounts software. Expression similarity between biological replicates was checked by spearman correlation and Principal Components Analysis. For differential expression analysis the biological replicates were grouped as Control and Test. Differential expression analysis was carried out using the edgeR package after normalizing the data based on trimmed mean of M (TMM) values. After normalization 27540 features (52.32%) have been removed from the analysis because they did not have at least 1 counts-per-million in at least four samples. Genes with absolute log<sub>2</sub> fold change ≥ 1.5 and adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. The expression profile of differentially expressed genes across the samples is presented in volcano plots and heatmaps. The genes that showed significant differential expression were used for Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://david.ncifcrf.gov/">https://david.ncifcrf.gov/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Experimental design and statistical analysis</title><p>Prior to starting each experiment, animals were randomly assigned to experimental groups. For phenotypic studies, experiments were repeated in separate cohorts. The experimenter was blinded to the genotype of the mice in all surgical, histological, electrophysiological, and behavioral analyses. The comparisons between two groups were done using unpaired two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. For our group comparisons with two variables (context and genotype) in the fear conditioning test, two-way ANOVA was used followed by Sidak’s post hoc test to analyze the interactions between the wo variables. The standard error mean (SEM) was calculated and depicted as error bars in the graphs. All the statistical details for each experiment, including the <italic>n</italic> value, the statistical test used, p value, significance of comparisons are mentioned in the figure legends. Analyses were done using GraphPad Prism 6 (Graphpad Software Inc; LaJolla, CA; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>). A p&lt;0.05 was considered significant in all statistical analyses. No samples were omitted from the analysis. Data presented in the study represent biological (and not technical) replicates. Both male and female mice are included in all experiments except the behavioral experiments, in which only male mice were used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All the procedures in this study were performed according to the rules and guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experimental Animals (CPCSEA), India.

Below, we describe the experiments that have been carried out in response to the reviewers and incorporated in the preliminary revision. We have addressed all concerns of the reviewers, and the experiments suggested have helped to strengthen the study reported in this manuscript without affecting the fundamental findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>­</p><p>Summary: The authors used a conditional transgenic mouse model to demonstrate that deletion of serum response factor (SRF) from adult astrocytes provides neuroprotection in various insult/ diseases contexts without promoting any obvious phenotypic deficiencies. The work builds on the group’s previous study where SRF was embryonically deleted from astrocytes and their precursor cells. Given the role of SRF in promoting glial cell differentiation, the adult conditional KO used in the current study was designed to circumvent the limitations of the previous approach. The authors used a variety of complementary approaches (including immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, transcriptomics, and behavior) to demonstrate the therapeutic potential of their approach. However, I have questions regarding the validity of the behavioral analyses as well as some of the imaging results that dampen my overall enthusiasm.</p><p>Major Comment #1</p><p>The synaptogenic factors probed in Figure 3C (e.g. glypicans, thrombospondins, etc.) are not likely to play major roles in the adult brain in a non-injury context, so I do not know that these analyses provide any significant insight into potential functional changes in the mutant mice. Along the same lines, the analysis of synapse count (Figure 3D-E) seems inconsequential given that SRF was knocked out well after the period of developmental synaptogenesis. It would have been much more interesting to have performed these analyses following insult (such as the kainate injury model used by the authors) or in one of the disease models presented later in the manuscript. As it stands, I don't think they add very much to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for the careful reading of the manuscript. Astrocytes are known to regulate the formation, maintenance, and elimination of synapses. It has been previously shown that LPS-induced reactive astrocytes exhibit reduced expression of several synaptogenic factors, were unable to promote synapse formation and showed reduced phagocytic activity (PMID: 28099414). We wanted to determine whether the SRF-deficient reactive-like astrocytes were likely compromised in their ability to produce pro-synaptogenic factors and/or adversely affect synapse maintenance. We agree with the reviewer that analysis of synapses in the adult brain may not address the role of these mutant astrocytes in synaptogenesis. But our results indicate that the mutant astrocytes are likely not affecting synapse maintenance or exhibit altered phagocytotic activity that would result in increased or decreased synapse numbers. We have made this clear in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comment #2</p><p>There is considerable variability in the behavioral results, particularly the fear conditioning and Barnes maze tasks (Figures 4F-G). Given the extremely low sample size for mouse behavior (n=5 in on group, n=7 in the other), it is highly likely that the behavioral tests were done with a single cohort of animals (which would be far from ideal) and that these experiments are significantly underpowered. Furthermore, it does not appear that the fear conditioning task was properly optimized. For example, in the control mice in context A, there were two animals that were at or very close to 0 percent freezing; these were likely outliers, or even an indication that the foot shock conditioning protocol was not working as it should. The highest percent freezing of either group was ~70%, which would have been an ideal starting place as an average for the control group. In addition, sex of the animals was not reported for these experiments. If the authors combined sexes as they did in other analyses in this paper, it is possible that they missed reaching the appropriate reaction threshold for the foot shock for some of the animals, as sex differences have previously been demonstrated in mice (DOI: 10.1037/bne0000248). Given the age at which the animals are assessed with these tasks, these specific revisions would require greater than 6 months to complete. However, as currently presented, there simply are not enough data points to make any conclusions regarding behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the behavioural experiments with an additional cohort of animals for both control and mutant groups and reanalysed the data. We now have n=11 for control and n=9 for mutant group. Only males were used for the behaviour experiments, and we have indicated this in the revised Methods section (page 31). We do not see any significant difference in behaviour between the two groups. These results are included in revised Figure 4E-G in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comment #1:</p><p>The representative GFAP images (Figure 1 E/G) do not appear to have been taken at the same magnification. This was particularly apparent in the comparison between the control and CKO hippocampus at 12mpi. It is difficult to say with certainty, due to the lack of fiducial markers in many of the images. Inclusion of a nuclear stain (DAPI) would be highly beneficial to allow the reader to make a more informed comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>These images were taken at the same magnification. We observed that the mutant astrocytes are much larger in older mice (12 months post-Tam injection) compared to younger mice (2 months post-Tam injection). This is one of the possilbe reasons that the magnification may appear different. We have included the DAPI staining for these images in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comment #2:</p><p>The authors should note that the use of GluA1 as a postsynaptic marker will not identify silent synapses (i.e. structurally &quot;normal&quot; but functionally inert).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that GluA1 will not identify functionally silent synapses. We have indicated that we are only looking at structural synapses in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>After reading the comments of the other reviewer, I think we're in agreement that the cellular and molecular data, while descriptive, is of mostly excellent quality. Moreover, the significance of the study is high, and the potential readership broad. However, I stand by my initial assessment of the behavioral data and find the manuscript quite lacking in this regard. Proper revisions would take at least half a year or more, so the authors may be disinclined to go this route. That being said, if the behavioral data were to be excised, I would be happy to sign off on the rest of the manuscript provided that the other major criticisms are addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the appreciation of our work. We have increased the number of animals in the behavioural experiments and do not see any significant difference between the two groups. These results are included in revised Figure 4E-G in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In response cross-comment of Rev 2:</p><p>Agreed that if properly conducted and presented, the behavioral data would indeed provide a nice functional correlate to the cellular work. In its current state, I'm afraid that it is instead a hindrance to the study and I would recommend that they just remove it if they choose not to address my concerns with the quality (particularly the extreme variability and the complete lack of freezing by several of the animals, especially in the controls).</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the revised behaviour data would provide a strong functional correlate to the other findings in the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional cross-comments:</p><p>I agree with the added criticisms raised by Reviewer #3, and I think that the manuscript would be greatly improved by revisions that address those and the original criticisms from myself and Reviewer #2. I still think that the behavioral data should be omitted, provided that the authors are not capable or willing to appropriately address those concerns within a reasonable time frame.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all the concerns raised by Reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript addresses the important area of the cellular mechanisms that underlie neuroprotection. The ms adds to our understanding of genetic control of neuroprotection and should be of significant interest to others in the field. The experimental approach systematic and the data presented are generally of high quality and believable. While the ms presents quite a bit of overall cellular data that underlies various areas of neuronal and brain function that may be affected by loss of SRF, it is still somewhat descriptive. It is unclear what aspect of astrocyte reactivity is determinative, how mechanistically in normal cells SRF suppresses reactivity, and how SRF -negative reactive astrocytes confer such broad neuroprotection. While the latter is well beyond the scope of this study, the authors do propose SRF may be involved in regulating oxidative stress and amyloid plaque clearance as a potential pathway to account for SRF's role, however a more systematic discussion based on the gene expression data and known pathways would be welcome. Overall, this is a high quality ms that should be of interest to the field that identifies a SRF as a novel player in neuroprotection.</p><p>1. Quantification of the extent of SRF loss in astrocytes in conditional tamoxifen knockout would strengthen the quality of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided this data in revised Figure 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. While the authos did use a Sholl analysis to show hypertophic changes in SRF negative astrocytes, given that SRF is an important regulator of actin and other cytoskeletal related proteins in other cell types, and that cytoskeletal components can play an important role in cell signaling, it is somewhat surprising that the gene array analysis did not include actin and other cytoskeletal proteins, nor did the authors consider a more careful analysis of intracellular cytoskeletal changes and the potential mechanistic implications of this for observed reactivity and neuroprotection.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that SRF is a well-established regulator of actin cytoskeleton. However, we did not check for any significant changes in gene expression for actin or actin-regulatory proteins. We would have expected a decrease in astrocyte morphology similar to the neurite/axon defects exhibited by SRF-deficient neurons. It is unclear whether the hypertrophic morphology is due to transcriptional regulation of actin/actin-binding proteins or due to astrocyte reactivity. This would be a very interesting question and we will investigate these aspects in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</p><p>Summary: The study by Thumu et al., suggests that astrocytic specific deletion of SRF in mice results in morphological changes in these cells that does not affect neuronal survival, synapse number, plasticity or cognition. However, in in vivo mouse models of excitotoxic damage and neurodegenerative disease, deletion of SRF reduced neurotoxicity. The authors provide sufficient evidence to suggest that astrocytic SRF contributes to neurotoxicity in various models however some claims are made that are currently not supported by evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for critical reading of our manuscript and for suggesting ways to strengthen our findings. We have addressed all the concerns raised by the reviewer and with additional experiments where required. We hope that these changes would have improved our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The title of the manuscript is &quot;SRF-deficient astrocytes provide neuroprotection in mouse models of excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration&quot;. It would be more accurate to say that SRF is involved in neurotoxicity in these models. To make a comment on the role of SRF in neuroprotection, experiments should be performed in spinal cord injury or ischaemia, where deficiency of SRF would be hypothesised to worsen recovery.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the reviewer with this assessment. There is no evidence to suggest that SRF is involved in neurotoxicity. What our data suggests is that SRF deficiency results in a reactive astrocyte state that is neuroprotective in these models. We hypothesize that in injury/infection/disease conditions that would result in generation of neuroprotective astrocytes, SRF expression or function may be negatively regulated. It would be interesting to see whether the SRF-deficient astrocytes alleviate or exacerbate pathology and recovery following spinal cord injury and ischaemia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that SRF KO astrocytes undergo hypertrophy. However, the quantification of the number of intersections gives information about morphology rather than hypertrophy. Quantification of cell size (area of S100B staining) should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the cell area based on S100B staining and have included this data in revised Figure 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure S1 the authors provide evidence showing lack of B-gal in cell types other than astrocytes (neurons/OPCs). However, microglia are missing, which could be important as later they show that microglia undergo changes in the SRF knockout model. This staining should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed double immunostaining for B-gal and IbaI and do not see any overlap between these two, suggesting that there is no Cre expression in microglia. We have included this data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 in revised manuscript and mentioned this in the revised text (page 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Can the authors explain the large amount of variability in number of synapses in 15 mpi in Figure 3E?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified synapses from two more mice and added that data, and the variability is less. The revised data is included in revised Figure 3E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors claim in the text that microglia have thicker processes and an amoeboid shape however no evidence of this is provided in Figure S5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided higher magnification images to show amoeboid microglial morphology in revised Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) For the RNAseq of isolated astrocytes did the authors confirm that other cell types (e.g microglia) did not contaminate their samples?</p></disp-quote><p>To test purity, the ACSA2+ fraction was plated on poly-D-lysine coated coverglass and grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Cells were fixed at 7 days later and immunostained for GFAP. We found the purity to be around 95% based on GFAP+/DAPI+ cells. We have provided this information in the revised methods section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the text &quot;Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology terms for Biological Process (GO BP) revealed that Srf deficient astrocytes showed enrichment of pathways related to cellular response to β amyloid and β-amyloid clearance.&quot; This is not shown in Figure 5. It would be more accurate to say that there is a downregulation of genes involved in B amyloid metabolic process.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the omission in showing that this data was presented in the revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We now state that, “there is downregulation of genes involved in b-amyloid metabolic process”, as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The authors say that in Figure 1B many astrocytes did not show any SRF expression. However, overall averages of SRF intensity are plotted in Figure 1C. It would support their claim to instead to calculate the percentage of SRF expressing cells above a certain threshold in each condition, rather than plotting the mean intensity. As a control for their method of quantifying SRF intensity in Figure 1B, demonstrating no change in SRF in neurons would provide confidence for the specificity of the knockout.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the quantification of the extent of SRF loss in astrocytes (percent astrocytes that are deleted for SRF) as suggested by Reviewer 2 in Revised Figure 1C and in page 5 in the main text, as this would provide a more meaningful information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use the term &quot;reactivation&quot; throughout the manuscript. This could be misconstrued as re-activation and so I would suggest using the terms &quot;reactivity&quot; or &quot;reactive transformation&quot;. Furthermore, only one region is quantified in Figure 1C while in later figures multiple regions are quantified. The authors should justify this decision or update the figures with data from missing regions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed “reactivation” to “reactivity” in all places as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure S2 the authors should provide a positive control for their staining.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided positive control for these staining experiments in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 1E is missing body weight data noted in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this oversight. This data was previously included in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and not in Figure 1. We have made this correction to Figure 1 legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Images in Figure 2C are poorly visible and should be improved in terms of either quality or magnification.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor quality of the images in Figure 2A. We have now provided higher magnification of the images in revised Figure 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 2B figure labels are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this omission. We have added the missing labels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Details of houskeeping gene normalisation are missing from qPCR data.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing this information. We have included this in the revised Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should provide a list of differentially expressed genes from RNAseq of SRF KO mice. No information is currently given in the text about the number of differentially expressed genes in the conditional knockout.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a list of differentially expressed genes from RNAseq of SRF KO mice as Figure 5-source data1 and 2. We have also provided information on the number of differentially expressed genes in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In figure 5A data would be better illustrated as a volcano plot (similar to Figure S7C).</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the heatmaps with volcano plaots in figure 5A as suggested by the reviewer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
