Recent works have highlighted flaws in citation practices in the Neurosciences, such as the under-citation of women. However, self-citation rates—or how much authors cite themselves—have not yet been comprehensively investigated in the Neurosciences. This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical Neuroscience literature by collating 100,347 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000–2020. In analyzing over five million citations, we demonstrate four key findings: (1) increasing self-citation rates of Last Authors relative to First Authors, (2) lower self-citation rates in low- and middle-income countries, (3) gender differences in self-citation stemming from differences in the number of previously published papers, and (4) variations in self-citation rates by field. Our characterization of self-citation provides insight into citation practices that shape the perceived influence of authors in the Neurosciences, which in turn may impact what type of scientific research is done and who gets the opportunity to do it.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bibliometrics</kwd><kwd>self-citation</kwd><kwd>neuroscience</kwd><kwd>neurology</kwd><kwd>psychiatry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Self-citation rates differed by geographic region, seniority, gender, and field, which may ultimately affect the perceived influence of authors in these subgroups in neuroscience literature.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Citations are often used as a proxy for how well a researcher disseminates their work, which is important both for spreading knowledge and establishing a scientific reputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, citation counts and other metrics like the h-index are critical for hiring and promotion in an increasingly tenuous academic job market (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Else, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holden et al., 2005</xref>), necessitating a thorough examination of citation practices across research fields. Existing investigations of citation practices have found, for instance, false inflation of impact factors by specific journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Van Noorden, 2013</xref>). Others have demonstrated under-citation of racial and ethnic minority groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertolero et al., 2020</xref> and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chatterjee and Werner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fulvio et al., 2021</xref>), including three studies specific to the Neuroscience literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertolero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fulvio et al., 2021</xref>). These examples of citation manipulations and biases underscore the importance of comprehensively investigating citation practices in the broader Neuroscience literature.</p><p>Self-citation, or how frequently authors cite themselves, remains an understudied citation practice in the Neuroscience literature. Self-citation can be calculated from two different perspectives: (1) as the proportion of an author’s total citations that come from their own works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ioannidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksnes, 2003</xref>) or (2) as the proportion of an author’s references on which they are also an author (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Snyder and Bonzi, 1998</xref>). Since the former accounts for the total number of times an author cites themselves (across all papers) divided by the total number of citations the author has received, it helps identify when a particular author only accumulates citations from themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ioannidis et al., 2019</xref>). However, in this manuscript, we defined self-citation as the latter because one cannot control how much others cite their works. As such, the second definition of self-citation rate may more closely reflect intention in self-citing and will allow for more self-reflection about self-citation practices.</p><p>Self-citations may often be appropriate. For example, in a direct follow-up publication, a researcher will need to cite their previous work. Yet, h-indices can be strategically manipulated via self-citation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartneck and Kokkelmans, 2011</xref>), and some scientists may engage in extreme or unnecessary self-citation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ioannidis et al., 2019</xref>). While certain citation metrics can be adjusted to remove self-citations, the effect of a single self-citation extends beyond adding one additional citation to an author’s citation count. In a longitudinal study of self-citation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fowler and Aksnes, 2007</xref> found that each self-citation leads to approximately three additional citations after five years. Given the potential effects of self-citations on various citation metrics that influence career trajectories, a detailed analysis of self-citation rates and trends in the Neuroscience literature could benefit the field.</p><p>This work summarizes self-citation rates in Neurology, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry literature across the last 21 years, 63 journals, 100,347 articles, and 5,061,417 citations. We then build upon these calculations by exploring trends in self-citation over time, by seniority, by country, by gender, and by different subfields of research. We further develop models of the number of self-citations and self-citation rate. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings in the Neuroscience publishing landscape and share a tool for authors to calculate their self-citation rates: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mattrosenblatt7/self_citation">https://github.com/mattrosenblatt7/self_citation</ext-link>.

As an example, consider a hypothetical paper by Author A, Author B, and Author C that cites 100 references.</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list1"><list-item><p>If Author A is an author on 5 of those references, then the First Author self-citation rate is 5/100=5%.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If Author C is an author on 10 of those references, then the Last Author self-citation rate is 10/100=10%.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If at least one of Author A, Author B, OR Author C is an author on 18 of the references, then the Any Author self-citation rate is 18/100=18%.</p></list-item></list><p>We will use the above definitions of self-citation throughout the remainder of the paper. Furthermore, our estimations via Python code of the above three metrics showed strong agreement with 906 manually scored articles from a subset of Psychiatry journals (<italic>r</italic>=0.98 for First Authors, 0.95 for Last Authors, 0.96 for Any Authors).</p><p>We performed 1000 iterations of bootstrap resampling to obtain confidence intervals for all analyses. We additionally performed 10,000 iterations of permutation testing to obtain two-sided p values for all significance tests. All P values are reported after applying the Benjamini/Hochberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) false discovery rate (FDR) correction, unless otherwise specified. Importantly, we accounted for the nested structure of the data in bootstrapping and permutation tests by forming co-authorship exchangeability blocks.</p><p>Throughout this work, we characterized self-citation rates with descriptive, not causal, analyses. Our analyses included several theoretical estimands that are descriptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundberg et al., 2021</xref>), such as the mean self-citation rates among published articles as a function of field, year, seniority, country, and gender. We adopted two forms of empirical estimands. First, we showed subgroup means in self-citation rates. We then developed smooth curves with generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe trends in self-citation rates across several variables.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Self-citation rates in 2016-2020</title><p>In the last 5 years of our dataset (2016–2020), the overall self-citation rates were 3.98% (95% CI: 3.87%, 4.07%) for First Authors, 8.15% (95% CI: 7.98%, 8.30%) for Last Authors, and 14.41% (95% CI: 13.99%, 14.74%) for Any Authors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

We found no significant difference between Neurology and Psychiatry for First Author (p=0.144) and Last Author (p=0.123) self-citation rates. Any Author self-citation rates were significantly higher in Neurology than Psychiatry before correction but nonsignificant after correction (p=0.010). When determining fields by each author’s publication history instead of the journal of each article, we observed similar rates of self-citation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table1">Appendix 2—table 1</xref>).

This equated to a 33.13% higher self-citation rate for men than women during the first ten years of their careers (p=2.9e-4).</p><p>We considered two factors that might contribute to the gender discrepancy in self-citation rate by academic age: the number of papers published for authors of a given academic age, which is greater for men at all career stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azoulay and Lynn, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larivière et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">West et al., 2013</xref>), and the self-citation rate for a given number of papers. We compared the number of papers for men and women at a given academic age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f–g</xref>) and found that men had a higher number of papers. This trend started early in the career (academic age ≤ 10 years), where men had significantly more papers than women (p=2.9e-4). For example, at an academic age of 10 years, men were authors on an average of 42.32 (s.d.: 1.76) papers, and women authored 30.09 (s.d.: 0.96) papers on average. In addition, we divided the number of papers into groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and computed self-citation rate by gender for each group. Although the effect was small, men had significantly higher self-citation rates for 0–9 papers (p=7.8e-4) and 10–19 papers (p=0.034). All other differences were not statistically significant.

Consistent with prior works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azoulay and Lynn, 2020</xref>), self-citation rates and counts were higher for authors with a greater number of previous papers. Self-citation counts and rates increased rapidly among the first 25 published papers but then more gradually increased. Early in the career, increasing academic age was related to greater self-citation. There was a small peak at about five years, followed by a small decrease and a plateau. We found an inverted U-shaped trend for average time lag and self-citations, with self-citations peaking approximately 3 years after initial publication. In addition, self-citations have generally been decreasing since 2000. The smooth predictors showed larger decreases in the First Author model relative to the Last Author model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Then, we considered whether authors were affiliated with an institution in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC). LMIC status was determined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. We opted to use LMIC instead of affiliation country or continent to reduce the number of model terms. We found that papers from LMIC institutions had significantly lower self-citation counts (–0.138 for First Authors, –0.184 for Last Authors) and rates (–12.7% for First Authors, –23.7% for Last Authors) compared to non-LMIC institutions. Additional results with affiliation continent are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table1">Appendix 3—table 1</xref>. Relative to the reference level of Asia, higher self-citations were associated with Africa (only three of four models), the Americas, Europe, and Oceania.</p><p>Among paper characteristics, a greater number of references was associated with higher self-citation counts and lower self-citation rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, self-citations were greater for a small number of authors, although the effect diminished after about five authors. Review articles were associated with lower self-citation counts and rates. No clear trend emerged between self-citations and journal impact factor. In an analysis by field, despite the raw results suggesting that self-citation rates were lower in Neuroscience, GAM-derived self-citations were greater in Neuroscience than in Psychiatry or Neurology. Field-based results were comparable when defining fields by each author’s publication history instead of the journal of each article. The most notable difference was in Neuroscience, where authors had relatively higher self-citation rates using author-based rather than journal-based definitions of field (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table2">Appendix 3—table 2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, our results aligned with previous findings of nearly equivalent self-citation rates for men and women after including covariates, even showing slightly higher self-citation rates in women. Since raw data showed evidence of a gender difference in self-citation that emerges early in the career but dissipates with seniority, we incorporated two interaction terms: one between gender and academic age and a second between gender and the number of previous papers. Results remained largely unchanged with the interaction terms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table3">Appendix 3—table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Reconciling differences between raw data and models</title><p>The raw and GAM-derived data exhibited some conflicting results, such as for gender and field of research. To further study covariates associated with this discrepancy, we modeled the publication history for each author (at the time of publication) in our dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The model terms included academic age, article year, journal impact factor, field, LMIC status, gender, and document type. Notably, Neuroscience was associated with the fewest number of papers per author. This explains how authors in Neuroscience could have the lowest raw self-citation rates by highest self-citation rates after including covariates in a model. In addition, being a man was associated with about 0.25 more papers. Thus, gender differences in self-citation likely emerged from differences in the number of papers, not in any self-citation practices.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Self-citation code</title><p>We provide code for authors to evaluate their own self-citation rates at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mattrosenblatt7/self_citation">https://github.com/mattrosenblatt7/self_citation</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenblatt, 2025</xref>). Please note that this code requires access to Scopus, which may be available through your institution. The code may also be adapted for journal editors to evaluate the author self-citation rates of published articles in their journal.</p><p>As an example, we also investigated self-citation rates for a particular author, in this case Dustin Scheinost. Dr. Scheinost permitted us to use his name and self-citation data in this work. We show a histogram of self-citations by paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>), the self-citation rates over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>), and the histogram of Any Author self-citation rates for all of Dr. Scheinost’s papers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). Furthermore, these methods can be extended to evaluate self-citation rates at the level of a country, institute, or journal. For instance, we compared self-citation rates in <italic>Nature Neuroscience</italic> to the overall field of Neuroscience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref>). In general, Last Author and Any Author self-citation rates were higher in <italic>Nature Neuroscience</italic> compared to the field. First Author self-citation rates used to be lower in <italic>Nature Neuroscience</italic> (e.g. Year 2000) but are now approximately equal to that of the field.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Self-citation tool outputs.</title><p>Self-citation rates for a single author (<bold>a</bold>) across all papers, (<bold>b</bold>) by year, and (<bold>c</bold>) for all authors of their papers.

A more concerning trend is the decrease in First Author relative to Last Author self-citations since 2000. In the Neurosciences, First Authors are typically early-career researchers (e.g. graduate students, postdoctoral fellows) who perform the majority of the experiments and analysis, whereas Last Authors are typically professors who oversee the project and secure funding. As a result, these changes in citation practices could make it harder for early-career scientists to advance in their academic careers, warranting further investigation and monitoring. Another possible explanation is that an increasing number of early career researchers are leaving academia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langin, 2022</xref>). Thus, early-career researchers may be less incentivized to self-promote (e.g. self-cite) for academic gains compared to 20 years ago. A third, more optimistic explanation is that principal investigators (typically Last Authors) are increasingly self-citing their lab’s papers to build up their trainee’s citation records for an increasingly competitive job market.</p><p>Differences between early- and late-career researchers’ self-citation practices is not surprising because, as one continues in their career, they contribute to more papers and are more likely to cite themselves. In addition, researchers may often become more specialized throughout their career, which may necessitate higher self-citation rates later in the career. However, these results demonstrate a ‘snowball effect’, whereby senior authors continually accumulate a disproportionate number of self-citations. For example, an author with 30 years of experience cites themselves approximately twice as much as one with 10 years of experience on average. Both authors have plenty of works that they can cite, and likely only a few are necessary. As such, we encourage authors to be cognizant of their citations and to avoid unnecessary self-citations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Geographic differences in self-citation rates</title><p>There are several possible explanations for differences in self-citation by geographic region, including broader cultural differences or academic culture differences. For instance, an analysis of management journals previously found that self-citation rates of authors from individualist cultures were higher than that of authors from collectivist cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deschacht and Maes, 2017</xref>). In addition to broader cultural norms affecting the tendency to self-cite, differences in academic norms likely play a major role as well. Researchers in the United States, for example, reported feeling more pressure to publish papers within their organizations compared to researchers from other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Dalen and Henkens, 2012</xref>). The pressure to publish stems from pressure to advance one’s career. Similar pressures that vary by geographic region may drive researchers to unnecessarily self-cite to improve their citation metrics and make them more competitive candidates for hiring, promotion, and funding.</p><p>In addition, low- and middle-income countries were associated with fewer self-citations, even after considering numerous covariates. Decreased self-citations may diminish the visibility of researchers from LMIC relative to their peers from non-LMIC. Thus, future research should explore the mechanism behind the decreased self-citations.</p><p>While hiring and promotion almost universally depend on citation metrics to some extent, an example of a recent policy in Italy demonstrates how rules regarding hiring and promotion can influence self-citation behavior. This policy was introduced in 2010 and required researchers to achieve certain citation metrics for the possibility of promotion, which was followed by increases of self-citation rates throughout Italy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seeber et al., 2019</xref>). Ideally, authors, institutions, journals, and policymakers would work together to establish self-citation guidelines and discourage a ‘game the system’ mindset. However, requiring all institutions and countries to follow similar values regarding citation metrics is not practical, so awareness of possible differences in metrics by geographic region due to self-citation differences is the next best alternative.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Field differences in self-citation rates</title><p>Initially, it appeared that self-citation rates in Neuroscience are lower than Neurology and Psychiatry, but after considering several covariates, the self-citation rates are higher in Neuroscience. This discrepancy likely emerges because authors in Neuroscience journals in our dataset tended to be more junior (fewer number of previous papers, slightly lower academic age) compared to Neurology and Psychiatry, giving the illusion of lower field-wide self-citation rates. The field-wide differences in self-citation rate likely depend on both necessity and opportunity. In some research fields, a researcher may need to reference several of their previous works to properly explain the methodology used in the present study, thus having a high necessity of self-citation. Depending on the nature of the work across various fields, researchers may publish more or less frequently, which will affect their number of previous works and thus their opportunity to self-cite.</p><p>In addition, while not included in the model to limit the number of terms, the 13 subtopics under examination had different raw self-citation rates, and ‘acceptable levels’' of self-citation may vary depending on the subfield. For example, clinical trials had the highest self-citation rate, which may relate to the relatively high number of authors per paper in clinical trial research or the fact that clinical trial research often builds upon previous interventions (e.g. Phase 1 or 2 trials). Overall, these field and subfield differences highlight the importance of editors and researchers understanding common self-citation rates in their specific fields to ensure that they are not unnecessarily self-citing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Self-citation rates by gender</title><p>The higher self-citation rate of men compared to women, without considering other covariates, aligns with the previous self-citation literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">King et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azoulay and Lynn, 2020</xref>). Similar to prior works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mishra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azoulay and Lynn, 2020</xref>), we found that the largest difference in self-citing is explained by the number of previous papers (i.e. number of citable items) as opposed to differences in self-citation behavior itself. This result overall points toward a more general underrepresentation of women in science, such as in publication counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Larivière et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">West et al., 2013</xref>), collaboration networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2022</xref>), awards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Melnikoff and Valian, 2019</xref>), editorial boards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palser et al., 2022</xref>), and faculty positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wapman et al., 2022</xref>). We confirmed this idea by modeling the number of previous papers for each author. Women had significantly fewer papers than men after considering multiple covariates, such as academic age. In other words, women have a lower self-citation rate than men in the Neuroscience literature because they are not given the same opportunity, such as through prior publications, to self-cite. Establishing field-wide influence and scientific prominence may be most crucial in early career stages, since soon thereafter decisions will be made about hiring, early-career grants, and promotion. Thus, future work should further consider the downstream effects of differences in the number of publications by gender.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were several notable limitations of this study. First, our analyses were restricted to the top-ranked Neurology, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry journals, and the generalizability of these findings to a wider variety of journals has yet to be determined. Citations of a journal’s articles directly affect the journal’s impact factor. As such, it is possible that the selection of journals based on high impact factor skews the results toward higher self-citation rates compared to the entire field of Neuroscience. Yet, we found minimal effect of impact factor in our models. Second, we calculated differences between Neurology, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry journals by assigning each journal to only one field (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). As some journals publish across multiple fields (e.g. both Neuroscience and Psychiatry research), this categorization provides a gross estimate of differences between fields. Third, we reported averages of self-citation rates across various groups (e.g. academic ages), but there is a wide inter-author and inter-paper variability in self-citation rate. Fourth, as described above, we evaluated gender differences with gender assignment based on name, and this does not account for nonbinary, transgender, or intersex authors. Fifth, selecting subtopics using LDA was subjective because we assigned each subtopic name based on the most common words. Sixth, our modeling techniques are not useful for prediction due to the inherently large variability in self-citation rates across authors and papers, but they instead provide insight into broader trends. In addition, these models do not account for whether a specific citation is appropriate, as some situations may necessitate higher self-citation rates. Seventh, the analysis presented in this work is not causal. Association studies are advantageous for increasing sample size, but future work could investigate causality in curated datasets. Similarly, this study falls short in several potential mechanistic insights, such as by investigating citation appropriateness via text similarity or international dynamics in authors who move between countries. Yet, this study may lay the groundwork for future works to explore causal estimands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lundberg et al., 2021</xref>). Eighth, authors included in this work may not be neurologists, neuroscientists, or psychiatrists. However, they still publish in journals from these fields. Ninth, data were differentially missing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>) due to Scopus coverage and gender estimation. Differential missingness could bias certain results in the paper, but we hope that the dataset is large enough to reduce any potential biases. Tenth, while we considered academic age, we did not consider cohort effects. Cohort effects would depend on the year in which the individual started their career. Finally, our analysis does not account for other possible forms of excessive self-citation practices, such as coercive induced self-citation from reviewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ioannidis, 2015</xref>). Despite these limitations, we found significant differences in self-citation rates for various groups, and thus we encourage authors to explore their trends in self-citation rates. Self-citation rates that are higher than average are not necessarily wrong, but suggest that authors should further reflect on their current self-citation practices.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Self-citation policies</title><p>According to The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), ‘citations where the motivations are merely self promotional…violates publication ethics and is unethical’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">COPE Council, 2019</xref>). Excessive and unnecessary self-citations can possibly be limited by using appropriate citation metrics that cannot be easily ‘gamed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seeber et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ioannidis, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, while COPE suggests that journals and editors should make policies about acceptable levels of self-citation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">COPE Council, 2019</xref>), many journals have no such policy. For example, only 24.71% of General Surgery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanfilippo et al., 2021a</xref> and 14.29% of Critical Care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanfilippo et al., 2021b</xref>) journals had policies regarding self-citation, most of which were policies discouraging ‘excessive’ or ‘inappropriate’ self-citations. Although the self-citation policies in the investigated journals had no significant effect on self-citation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanfilippo et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanfilippo et al., 2021b</xref>), a more appropriate consideration might be whether these policies significantly reduce excessive self-citations. Self-citation practices are not typically problematic, but excessive self-citations may falsely establish community-wide influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szomszor et al., 2020</xref>). As such, we believe that the self-citation summary statistics presented in this work could serve as a useful guide in identifying potential cases of excessive self-citation. In practice, there should be more nuance than a binary threshold of acceptable/unacceptable levels of self-citation, as some fields may have atypical self-citation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szomszor et al., 2020</xref>) or specific articles may require high levels of self-citation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, we identified trends in self-citation rates by time, geographic region, gender, and field, though the extent to which this reflects an underlying problem that needs to be addressed remains an open question. We do not intend to argue against the practice of self-citation, which is not inherently bad and in fact can be beneficial to authors and useful scientifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fowler and Aksnes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ioannidis, 2015</xref>). Yet, self-citation practices become problematic when they are different across groups or are used to ‘game the system’. Future work should investigate the downstream effects of self-citation differences to see whether they impact the career trajectories of certain groups. We hope that this work will help to raise awareness about factors influencing self-citation practices to better inform authors, editors, funding agencies, and institutions in Neurology, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We collected data from the 25 journals with the highest impact factors, based on Web of Science impact factors, in each of Neurology, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry. Some journals appeared in the top 25 list of multiple fields (e.g. both Neurology and Neuroscience), so 63 journals were ultimately included in our analysis. We recognize that limiting the journals to the top 25 in each field also limits the generalizability of the results. However, there are tradeoffs between breadth of journals and depth of information. For example, by limiting the journals to these 63, we were able to look at 21 years of data (2000–2020). In addition, the definition of fields are somewhat arbitrary. By restricting the journals to a set of 63 well-known journals, we ensured that the journals belonged to Neurology, Neuroscience, or Psychiatry research. It is also important to note that the impact factor of these journals has not necessarily always been high. For example, <italic>Acta Neuropathologica</italic> had an impact factor of 17.09 in 2020 but 2.45 in 2000.

To count as a self-citation, we required that the Scopus Author IDs matched exactly.</p><p>Our self-citation metrics included First Author, Last Author, and Any Author self-citation rates. For First (Last) Author self-citation rates, we computed the proportion of reference papers on which the citing First (Last) author is also an author. We considered papers with only a single author as both First Author and Last Author self-citations. For Any Author self-citation rates, we found the proportion of papers for which at least one of the citing authors (any authorship position) was also an author. For the analyses in this paper, we reported total (or weighted average) self-citation rates for different groups. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the reported self-citation rate for the year 2000 is the total number of self-citations in 2000 across all papers divided by the total number of references in 2000 across all papers.</p><p>Other data we collected from Scopus and Pybliometrics included the affiliation of the authors, the number of papers published by the First and Last Authors before the current paper, and academic age of the First and Last Authors, which we defined as the time between the author’s first publication and their current publication.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data exclusions and missingness</title><p>Data were excluded across several criteria: missing covariates, missing citation data, out-of-range values at the citation pair level, and out-of-range values at the article level (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). After downloading the data, our dataset included 157,287 articles and 8,438,733 citations. We excluded any articles with missing covariates (document type, field, year, number of authors, number of references, academic age, number of previous papers, affiliation country, gender, and journal). Of the remaining articles, we dropped any for missing citation data (e.g. cannot identify whether a self-citation is present due to lack of data). Then, we removed citations with unrealistic or extreme values. These included an academic age of less than zero or above 38/44 for First/Last Authors (99th percentile); greater than 266/522 papers for First/Last Authors (99th percentile); and a cited year before 1500 or after 2023. Subsequently, we dropped articles with extreme values that could contribute to poor model stability. These included greater than 30 authors; fewer than 10 references or greater than 250 references; and a time lag of greater than 17 years. These values were selected to ensure that GAMs were stable and not influenced by a small number of extreme values.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Data exclusions.</title><p>Each cell shows the number of articles or citations remaining after exclusion, as well as the percentage that were dropped by the exclusion criteria.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2">First Author</th><th align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="2">Last Author</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"># Articles</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"># Citations</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"># Articles</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"># Citations</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Prior to exclusions</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">157,287</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8,438,733</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">157,287</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8,438,733</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Missing covariates: remaining (% dropped)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">133,403 (15.18%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7,392,638 (12.40%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">132,806 (15.56%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7,379,581 (12.55%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Missing citation data: remaining (% dropped)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">133,256 (0.11%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6,773,293 (8.38%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">132,667 (0.10%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6,769,081 (8.27%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Extreme values (citation level): remaining (% dropped)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">126,938 (4.74%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6,390,129 (5.66%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">126,168 (4.90%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">6,396,015 (5.51%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Extreme values (article level): remaining (% dropped)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">115,205 (9.24%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5,794,926 (9.31%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">114,622 (9.15%)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5,801,367 (9.30%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Data available for First and Last Authors</td><td align="left" valign="bottom" colspan="4">100,347 Articles; 5,061,417 citations</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In addition, we evaluated whether the data were not missing at random (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>).

In the case of multiple affiliations, the first one listed in Scopus was used. We then calculated the total First Author and Last Author self-citation rate by country, only including countries that had at least 50 First Author or Last Author papers in these select journals from 2016 to 2020. We then projected the self-citation rates onto a map using Geopandas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jordahl, 2020</xref>), specifically using the map with coordinate systems EPSG:6933 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://epsg.io/6933">https://epsg.io/6933</ext-link>). We determined whether a country was considered a low- and middle-income country based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s list (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries">https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/guidance/low-and-middle-income-countries</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Topic modeling</title><p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffman et al., 2010</xref>) was implemented with the Gensim package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rehurek and Sojka, 2010</xref> in Python. LDA is a generative probabilistic model that is commonly used in natural language processing to discover topics in a large set of documents. In LDA, each document is modeled as a distribution of latent topics, and each topic is represented as a distribution of words. Based on the data provided, in this case abstracts from all articles in our dataset from 2016 to 2020, the model finds distributions of topics and words to maximize the log likelihood of the documents. Further details about LDA are available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rehurek and Sojka, 2010</xref>.</p><p>For our implementation, we first removed all special characters and numbers from the abstract data. Then, we lemmatized the words using the Natural Language Toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bird et al., 2009</xref>). We excluded words that appeared in less than 20 documents, words that appeared in over 50% of the documents, common stop words (e.g. ‘the’, ‘you’, etc.), and some additional words that we felt would not meaningfully contribute to the topic model (e.g. ‘associated’, ‘analysis’, ‘effect’, etc.). In addition, we allowed for bigrams (two consecutive words) and trigrams (three consecutive words) in the model, as long as they appeared at least 20 times in the dataset.</p><p>Our total corpus included 41,434 documents with 16,895 unique tokens (words + bigrams + trigrams). We used 90% of the corpus to train our LDA model, and left out 10% to evaluate the perplexity, where a lower perplexity demonstrates better performance, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blei et al., 2003</xref>. For the a-priori belief on document-topic distribution, we used Gensim’s ‘auto’ option. We trained models with a number of topics ranging from 2 to 20, passing through the entire train corpus 30 times for each number of topics we evaluated. The number of topics was picked based on two evaluation metrics. First, we selected 13 topics as the topics that seemed most meaningful, as assessed qualitatively by word clouds for each topic. Second, we selected seven topics as the number of topics with the lowest validation perplexity.</p><p>Finally, we assigned each paper a discrete topic by choosing the topic with highest probability. Since we do not necessarily care about the generalization of this model and are instead using it to determine topics of a specific set of papers, we determined topics on the same data on which the model was trained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Name gender probability estimation</title><p>To compute gender probabilities, we submitted given names of all First and Last Authors to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">Genderize.io</ext-link> API. Each name was assigned a probability of a name belonging to a woman or man, and we only used names for which <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">Genderize.io</ext-link> assigned at least an 80% probability. Details about the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">Genderize.io</ext-link> database used to calculate probabilities is available at this link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/our-data">https://genderize.io/our-data</ext-link>.</p><p>There are clear limitations to probabilistically assigning genders to names with packages such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genderize.io/">Genderize.io</ext-link>, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>, because they assume genders are binary and do not account for authors who identify as nonbinary, transgender, or intersex. As such, the terms ‘women’ and ‘men’ indicate the probability of a name being that gender and not that a specific author identifies as a man or woman. However, these tools are still useful to explore broad trends in self-citation rates for women and men.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Self-citation rate for a particular author</title><p>We also calculated the self-citation rate for a particular author, in this case Dr. Dustin Scheinost, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. Here, we defined Scheinost-Scheinost self-citation rates as the proportion of references with Dr. Scheinost as one of the authors. Notably, Dr. Scheinost can be in any author position on the citing or cited article. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>, we calculated the Any Author self-citation rate for all of Dr. Scheinost’s papers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Confidence intervals</title><p>Confidence intervals were computed with 1000 iterations of bootstrap resampling at the article level. For example, of the 100,347 articles in the dataset, we resampled articles with replacement and recomputed all results. The 95% confidence interval was reported as the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the bootstrapped values.</p><p>We grouped data into exchangeability blocks to avoid overly narrow confidence intervals or overly optimistic statistical inference. Each exchangeability block comprised any authors who published together as a First Author / Last Author pairing in our dataset. We only considered shared First/Last Author publications because we believe that these authors primarily control self-citations, and otherwise exchangeability blocks would grow too large due to the highly collaborative nature of the field. Furthermore, the exchangeability blocks do not account for co-authorship in other journals or prior to 2000.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>P values</title><p>P values were computed with permutation testing using 10,000 permutations, with the exception of regression p values and p values from model coefficients. For comparing different fields (e.g. Neuroscience and Psychiatry) and comparing self-citation rates of men and women, the labels were randomly permuted by exchangeability block to obtain null distributions. For comparing self-citation rates between First and Last Authors, the first and last authorship was swapped in 50% of exchangeability blocks.</p><p>In total, we made 40 comparisons (not including the models of self-citation). All p values described in the main text were corrected with the Benjamini/Hochberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) false discovery rate (FDR) correction. With 10,000 permutations, the lowest p value after applying FDR correction is p<italic>=</italic>2.9e-4, which indicates that the true point would be the most extreme in the simulated null distribution. Further details about each comparison and p values can be found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table4">Appendix 3—table 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Exploring effects of covariates with generalized additive models</title><p>For these analyses, we used the full dataset size separately for First and Last Authors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table2">Appendix 2—table 2</xref>). This included 115,205 articles and 5,794,926 citations for First Authors, and 114,622 articles and 5,801,367 citations for Last Authors. We modeled self-citation counts, self-citation rates, and number of previous papers for First Authors and Last Authors separately, resulting in six total models.</p><p>We found that models could be computationally intensive and unstable when including author-level random effects because in many cases there was only one author per group. Instead, to avoid inappropriately narrow confidence bands, we resampled the dataset such that each author was only represented once. For example, if Author A had five papers in this dataset, then one of their five papers was randomly selected. The random resampling was repeated 100 times as a sensitivity analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>For our models, we used generalized additive models from mgcv’s ‘<monospace>gam</monospace>’ function in R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wood, 2017</xref>. The smooth terms included all the continuous variables: number of previous papers, academic age, year, time lag, number of authors, number of references, and journal impact factor. The linear terms included all the categorical variables: field, gender affiliation country LMIC status, and document type. We empirically selected a Tweedie distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dunn and Smyth, 2005</xref>) with a log link function and <italic>P</italic>=1.2. The p parameter indicates that the variance is proportional to the mean to the p power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wood, 2017</xref>). The p parameter ranges from 1 to 2, with <italic>P</italic>=1 equivalent to the Poisson distribution and <italic>P</italic>=2 equivalent to the gamma distribution. For all fitted models, we simulated the residuals with the DHARMa package, as standard residual plots may not be appropriate for GAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartig, 2022</xref>). DHARMa scales the residuals between 0 and 1 with a simulation-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartig, 2022</xref>). We also tested for deviation from uniformity, dispersion, outliers, and zero inflation with DHARMa. Non-uniformity, dispersion, outliers, and zero inflation were significant due to the large sample size, but small in effect size in most cases. The simulated quantile-quantile plots from DHARMa suggested that the observed and simulated distributions were generally aligned, with the exception of slight misalignment in the models for the number of previous papers. These analyses are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app3table4">Appendix 3—table 4</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we tested for inadequate basis functions using mgcv’s ‘<monospace>gam.check()</monospace>’ function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wood, 2017</xref>). Across all smooth predictors and models, we ultimately selected between 10 and 20 basis functions depending on the variable and outcome measure (counts, rates, papers). We further checked the concurvity of the models and ensured that the worst-case concurvity for all smooth predictors was less than 0.8.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Journal-based vs. author-based field sensitivity analyses</title><p>We refined our field-based analysis to focus only on authors who could be considered neuroscientists, neurologists, and psychiatrists. For each author, we examined the number of articles they had in each subfield, as defined by Scopus. We considered 12 subfields that fell within Neurology, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry, which are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>. For both First Authors and Last Authors, we excluded them if any of their three most frequently published subfields did not include one of the 12 subfields of interest. If an author’s top three subfields included multiple broader fields (e.g., both Neuroscience and Psychiatry), then that author was categorized according to the field in which they published the most articles. Among First Authors, there were 86,220 remaining papers, split between 33,054 (38.33%) in Neurology, 23,216 (26.93%) in Neuroscience, and 29,950 (34.73%) in Psychiatry. Among Last Authors, there were 85,954 remaining papers, split between 31,793 (36.98%) in Neurology, 25,438 (29.59%) in Neuroscience, and 28,723 (33.42%) in Psychiatry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Citation diversity statement</title><p>Recent work in several fields of science has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minority scholars are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bertolero et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chatterjee and Werner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fulvio et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maliniak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caplar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dion et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, race, ethnicity, and other factors. First, we obtained the predicted gender of the First and Last Author of each reference by using databases that store the probability of a first name being carried by a woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dworkin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). By this measure (and excluding self-citations to the First and Last Authors of our current paper), our references contain 12.53% woman(first)/woman(last), 19.27% man/woman, 13.17% woman/man, and 55.03% man/man. This method is limited in that (a) names, pronouns, and social media profiles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity and (b) it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people. Second, we obtained predicted racial/ethnic category of the First and Last Author of each reference by databases that store the probability of a first and last name being carried by an author of color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambekar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sood and Laohaprapanon, 2018</xref>). By this measure (and excluding self-citations), our references contain 7.46% author of color (first)/author of color(last), 17.45% white author/author of color, 14.81% author of color/white author, and 60.29% white author/white author. This method is limited in that (a) names, Census entries, and Wikipedia profiles used to make the predictions may not be indicative of racial/ethnic identity, and (b) it cannot account for Indigenous and mixed-race authors, or those who may face differential biases due to the ambiguous racialization or ethnicization of their names. We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand how to support equitable practices in science.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88540-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data and code are available via GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/mattrosenblatt7/self_citation">https://github.com/mattrosenblatt7/self_citation</ext-link> (copy archhived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosenblatt, 2025</xref>).

We have addressed your suggestions presented in the “Recommendations for the authors” section by performing your recommended sensitivity analysis that specifically identifies authors who could be considered neurologists, neuroscientists, and psychiatrists (as opposed to just papers that are published in these fields). Please see the “Recommendations for the authors” section for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer#3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This paper analyses self-citation rates in the field of Neuroscience, comprising in this case, Neurology, Neuroscience and Psychiatry. Based on data from Scopus, the authors identify self-citations, that is, whether references from a paper by some authors cite work that is written by one of the same authors. They separately analyse this in terms of first-author self-citations and last-author self-citations. The analysis is well-executed and the analysis and results are written down clearly. The interpretation of some of the results might prove more challenging. That is, it is not always clear what is being estimated.</p><p>This issue of interpretability was already raised in my review of the previous revision, where I argued that the authors should take a more explicit causal framework. The authors have now revised some of the language in this revision, in order to downplay causal language. Although this is perfectly fine, this misses the broader point, namely that it is not clear what is being estimated. Perhaps it is best to refer to Lundberg et al. (2021) and ask the authors to clarify &quot;What is your Estimand?&quot; In my view, the theoretical estimands the authors are interested in are causal in nature. Perhaps the authors would argue that their estimands are descriptive. In either case, it would be good if the authors could clarify that theoretical estimand.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment and for highlighting this insightful paper. After reading this paper, we believe that our theoretical estimand is descriptive in nature. For example, in the abstract of our paper, we state: “This work characterizes self-citation rates in basic, translational, and clinical Neuroscience literature by collating 100,347 articles from 63 journals between the years 2000-2020.” This goal seems consistent with the idea of a descriptive estimand, as we are not interested in any particular intervention or counterfactual at this stage. Instead, we seek to provide a broad characterization of subgroup differences in self-citations such that future work can ask more focused questions with causal estimands.</p><p>Our analysis included subgroup means and generalized additive models, both of which were described as empirical estimands for a theoretical descriptive estimand in Lundberg et al. We added the following text to the paper (page 3, line 112):</p><p>“Throughout this work, we characterized self-citation rates with descriptive, not causal, analyses. Our analyses included several theoretical estimands that are descriptive 17, such as the mean self-citation rates among published articles as a function of field, year, seniority, country, and gender. We adopted two forms of empirical estimands. First, we showed subgroup means in self-citation rates. We then developed smooth curves with generalized additive models (GAMs) to describe trends in self-citation rates across several variables.”</p><p>In addition, we added to the limitations section as follows (page 15, line 539):</p><p>“Yet, this study may lay the groundwork for future works to explore causal estimands.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in my previous review, I raised the issue of when self-citations become &quot;problematic&quot;. The authors have addressed this issue satisfactorily, I believe, and now formulate their conclusions more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your previous comments.

I still find the message conveyed slightly misleading, as the results seem to be generalized to neurologists, neuroscientists, and psychiatrists. It is important to refine the analysis to focus specifically on neuroscientists, identified as first or last authors based on their publication history. This approach is common in the science of science literature and would provide a more accurate representation of the findings specific to neuroscientists, avoiding the conflation with other related fields. This refinement could serve as a robustness check in the supplementary. I think adding this sub-analysis is essential to the validity of the results claimed in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We added a sensitivity analysis where fields are defined by an author’s publication history, not by the journal of each article.</p><p>In the main text, we added the following:</p><p>(Page 3, line 129) “When determining fields by each author’s publication history instead of the journal of each article, we observed similar rates of self-citation (Table S7). The 95% confidence intervals for each field definition overlapped in most cases, except for Last Author self-citation rates in Neuroscience (7.54% defined by journal vs. 8.32% defined by author) and Psychiatry (8.41% defined by journal vs. 7.92% defined by author).”</p><p>Further details are provided in the methods section (page 21, line 801):</p><p>“4.11 Journal-based vs. author-based field sensitivity analyses</p><p>We refined our field-based analysis to focus only on authors who could be considered neuroscientists, neurologists, and psychiatrists. For each author, we looked at the number of articles they had in each subfield, as defined by Scopus. We considered 12 subfields that fell within Neurology, Neuroscience, and Psychiatry. These subfields are presented in Table S12. For each First Author and Last Author, we excluded them if any of their three most frequently published subfields did not include one of the 12 subfields of interest. If an author’s top three subfields included multiple broader fields (e.g., both Neuroscience and Psychiatry), then that author was categorized according to the field in which they published the most articles. Among First Authors, there were 86,220 remaining papers, split between 33,054 (38.33%) in Neurology, 23,216 (26.93%) in Neuroscience, and 29,950 (34.73%) in Psychiatry. Among Last Authors, there were 85,954 remaining papers, split between 31,793 (36.98%) in Neurology, 25,438 (29.59%) in Neuroscience, and 28,723 (33.42%) in Psychiatry.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer#3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I would like to thank the authors for their responses the points that I raised, I do not have any new comments or further responses.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
