understood. Here, we found that non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells adjacent to bone tissue had a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells in patients and mice. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that osteocytes, sensing mechanical stimulation generated by exercise, inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation and sustain the dormancy thereof by releasing small extracellular vesicles with tumor suppressor micro-RNAs, such as miR-99b-3p. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of mechanical loading and treadmill exercise on the bone metastasis progression of NSCLC in mice. As expected, mechanical loading of the tibia inhibited the bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Notably, bone metastasis progression of NSCLC was inhibited by moderate exercise, and combinations with zoledronic acid had additive effects. Moreover, exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression. This study significantly advances the understanding of the mechanism underlying exercise-afforded protection against bone metastasis progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>osteocyte</kwd><kwd>bone metastasis</kwd><kwd>mechanical loading</kwd><kwd>tumor dormancy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81991511</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Xiaochun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81402373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Qiancheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021171</institution-id><institution>Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023A1515110054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Osteocytes, sensing mechanical stimulation generated by exercise, inhibit the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells and sustain their dormancy by releasing small extracellular vesicles containing tumor-suppressive micro-RNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the second most common cancer type and the leading global cause of cancer mortality (18.0% of the total cancer deaths) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sung et al., 2021</xref>). Approximately 85% of lung cancer patients have a group of histological subtypes collectively termed non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>). Despite important advancements in NSCLC treatment that have been achieved over the past two decades, prognosis remains poor owing to the presence of locally advanced or widely metastatic tumors in most patients at the time of diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>). Approximately 20–30% of patients with NSCLC present with bone metastases at diagnosis, and 35–60% will develop them during their disease course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Riihimäki et al., 2014</xref>). Bone metastases are frequent events associated with advanced-stage malignancies and often cause skeletal-related events (SREs) such as severe bone pain, pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia, which reduce the quality of life and predict a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sowder and Johnson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In general, bone metastases are incurable; goals of management include maximizing symptom control, preserving function, minimizing SREs, and enhancing local tumor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knapp et al., 2022</xref>). A multidisciplinary treatment approach is required, including pain management, osteoclast inhibitors and other bone-specific therapy, systemic anti-cancer therapy, surgery, radiation, and interventional techniques. Although there have been many advances in treatment, the median survival from diagnosis of bone metastases has been reported to be very short in patients with lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herbst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knapp et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it is of considerable clinical significance to elucidate the mechanism of bone metastasis and to find new drugs and combination therapies for bone metastasis prevention and treatment in NSCLC.</p><p>Many preclinical and clinical studies have shown that exercise can reduce the incidence of various cancers, inhibit cancer progression, reduce symptom burden, mitigate side effects of cancer treatment, and improve survival and the quality of life in patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bade et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ligibel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schmitz et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, sedentary behavior and lack of physical activity is positively associated with an increased risk for cancer and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerr et al., 2017</xref>). Exercise is safe perioperatively, and multiple international organizations have published exercise recommendations for patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bade et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ligibel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stout et al., 2021</xref>). The evidence to-date suggests a benefit of exercise in all stages of lung cancer and lung cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bade et al., 2015</xref>). Exercise has the potential to improve physical function and the quality of life in individuals with bone metastases and appears safe and feasible when it includes an element of supervised exercise instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ligibel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weller et al., 2021</xref>). The optimal exercise prescription for patients with bone metastases is currently undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavalheri and Granger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stout et al., 2021</xref>). Each patient with cancer may require a more personalized exercise prescription. Therefore, a clearer understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise modulates tumors is required.</p><p>Exercise induces systemic changes involving every system over the entire body, including circulating substances, the immune system, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ruiz-Casado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang and Zhou, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2022</xref>). Throughout life, the skeleton undergoes continuous remodeling, which is a balance between the resorption of mineralized bone by bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts) and new bone formation by bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Osteocytes, the most abundant cell type in bone, are terminally differentiated osteoblasts that have become buried in their own matrix. During this process, their morphology changes to stellate, facilitating the formation of an extensive interconnected network throughout the bone matrix termed the lacunar-canalicular network (LCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Prideaux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Robling and Bonewald, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schaffler et al., 2014</xref>). Through the LCN, osteocytes sense mechanical stimulus and translate them into biochemical signals, and appropriately control bone homeostasis by regulating the function of both osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Therefore, the osteocyte is now recognized as a major orchestrator of the bone remodeling process. However, the understanding of the relationship between osteocytes and bone metastasis remains limited.</p><p>Bone metastasis is a multistage process. Long before the development of clinically detectable metastases, circulating tumor cells settle and enter a dormant state in normal vascular and endosteal niches present in the bone marrow, which provide immediate attachment and shelter, and the cells only become active years later as they proliferate and alter the functions of osteoclasts and osteoblasts, promoting skeletal destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clézardin et al., 2021</xref>). The endosteal niche, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts, has been reported to provide tumor cells with an environment supporting their survival and outgrowth, however, the role of osteocytes has been rarely addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Tumor cell dormancy is defined as an arrest in the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blasco et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Phan and Croucher, 2020</xref>). The details of niches and signals that support tumor cell dormancy in bone metastasis are largely unknown. In the current study, we discuss the effect of exercise on bone metastasis of NSCLC, and investigated the potential effects and mechanisms of the osteocyte on the dormancy of bone metastasis NSCLC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Osteocytes inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation</title><p>To study the spatial distribution of NSCLC cell proliferation in bone metastasis, bone metastasis tissues of six NSCLC patients were obtained. Bone destruction was found in the presence of bone metastasis in NSCLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Surprisingly, immunohistochemical staining showed that Ki-67 was much lower in tumor cells adjacent to bone tissue than in the surrounding tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). An intraosseous model was used to investigate the biological progression of NSCLC cells in a bone microenvironment via direct tibial implantation of A549 in nude mice. The results of biophotonic imaging, micro-computed tomography (micro-CT), and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining indicated that the model was successfully established 21 days after modeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). Consistent with the result in the clinical samples, Ki-67 expression was much lower in tumor cells adjacent to bone tissue than in the surrounding tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The above results indicated that NSCLC cells adjacent to bone tissue have a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that bone tissues release some substance that inhibits tumor growth.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Osteocytes inhibited the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representative immunohistochemical staining and quantification of Ki-67 in bone metastasis site of patients with NSCLC.

Moderate exercise was provided by treadmill running for mice, which were involuntarily placed on a 12-lane rodent treadmill for 30 min per day at a speed of 15 cm/s for at least 5 days per week, and were euthanized after 4 weeks. Biophotonic imaging showed that tumor progression in the three treated groups was significantly slower than that in the control group, among which, the treadmill running+ZA group suppressed the growth of tumors in the tibia most effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Tumor growth inhibition by the ZA and treadmill running groups was similar, with no statistical difference. Ki-67 protein has been widely used as a proliferation marker for tumor cells. In this study, immunofluorescence assessment results of Ki-67 and CCND3 were largely consistent with those of biophotonic imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Ki-67 and CCND3 expression level was lowest in the treadmill running+ZA group lung cancer cells in the tibia, which confirmed that in the treadmill running+ZA group, tumor growth in the tibia was suppressed most effectively. The micro-CT analysis showed that treadmill running and/or ZA protected bone integrity and delayed bone destruction in the presence of bone metastasis in NSCLC, among which, the treadmill running+ZA group displayed the strongest effect, specifically reflected in the BV/TV, Tb.Th, and Ct.Th (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c–e</xref>). The protective effect of bone integrity in the ZA and treadmill running groups was similar, with no statistical difference. Taken together, these results demonstrated that moderate exercise significantly suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Furthermore, moderate exercise combined with ZA displayed additive effects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Moderate exercise combined with zoledronic acid (ZA) effectively suppressed the progression of bone metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</title><p>An intraosseous model of bone metastasis was used via direct implantation of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) into tibia of mouse.

However, it remains mostly unknown whether and how exercise preconditioning affects bone metastasis progression. In this study, we examined the effects of preconditioning on bone metastasis progression in mature adult mice using treadmill running. Male, 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 4 weeks of treadmill exercise followed by tibial implantation of NSCLC cells. Mice were randomized into tumor-bearing only (control), treadmill running before and after tibial implantation of NSCLC cells (exercise preconditioning), and treadmill running after tibial implantation of NSCLC cells (treadmill running) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The biophotonic imaging showed that tumor growth in the two exercise groups was significantly slower than that in the control group, with the exercise preconditioning group suppressing the tumor growth more significantly effectively than treadmill running only after tibial implantation of NSCLC cells, which were consistent in C57BL/6J and nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Regarding the proliferation marker, the Ki-67 and CCND3 immunofluorescence assessment results were largely consistent with those of the biophotonic imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The Ki-67 and CCND3 expression level in NSCLC cells in the exercise preconditioning group was much significantly lower than that in the other groups, which indicated that exercise preconditioning could effectively inhibit tumor growth. The micro-CT analysis showed that the exercise protected bone integrity and delayed bone destruction in the presence of bone metastasis in NSCLC, with the exercise preconditioning group having a stronger effect than the other group, specifically reflected in the BV/TV, Tb.Th, and Ct.Th (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c–e</xref>). The micro-CT analyses of C57BL/6 mice and nude mice were consistent.

Clarifying the mechanism of action is essential to determine optimal exercise programs, design appropriate combination therapy with standard therapy regimens, or identify specific targets for new treatment. In this study, we found that NSCLC cells adjacent to bone tissue had a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells, thus we hypothesized that bone tissues release some substance that inhibits tumor growth and sustains tumor dormancy in bone metastasis. Next, we demonstrated that osteocytes inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation by releasing sEVs containing tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as miR-99b-3p. Meanwhile, both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that mechanical loading stimulated osteocytes to release more sEVs and miR-99b-3p to delay the progression of bone metastasis of NSCLC. In addition, we showed that bone metastasis progression of NSCLC was inhibited by moderate exercise, and combinations with ZA had additive effects. Furthermore, exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Taken together, our work elucidated a mechanism for the clinical observation that bone metastasis was inhibited by moderate exercise.</p><p>In bone metastasis, only a limited number of disseminated tumor cells survive following bone colonization, and these are retained in a dormant state for prolonged periods through engagement in specialized endosteal niches before becoming reactivated to form overt metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, molecular mechanisms for tumor cell dormancy in the endosteal niche remain poorly understood, representing both a challenge and an opportunity for therapeutic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clézardin et al., 2021</xref>). Bone metastases occur from a complex interplay between cancer cells and bone cells. Interestingly, here we found that NSCLC cells adjacent to bone tissue have a much lower proliferative capacity than the surrounding tumor cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that bone tissues release some substance that inhibits tumor growth and sustains NSCLC cell dormancy in bone metastasis.</p><p>Osteoclast and osteoblast functions in bone metastases have been well characterized; however, the role of osteocytes needs to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atkinson and Delgado-Calle, 2019</xref>). Osteocytes act as mechanosensors to control responses to mechanical loading of the skeleton. For bone metastases, osteocytes may play a pivotal role in the interaction between mechanical loading and SREs. Here, we demonstrated that it is osteocytes that inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation in the endosteal niche, but not osteoblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that osteocytes inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation by releasing sEVs containing tumor suppressor miRNAs, such as miR-99b-3p. Recent studies showed that miR-99b-3p functions as a potential tumor suppressor in oral squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2015</xref>). We found that osteocyte sEVs miR-99b-3p inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation by directly targeting MDM2. As a negative regulator of the p53, the most extensively studied human tumor suppressor, MDM2 has been shown to exert oncogenic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Karni-Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>). To date, three regions of interaction between MDM2 and p53 have been identified, by which MDM2 inhibits the binding of p53 to the transcriptional machinery. MDM2 is significantly highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent tissues, and is regarded as a proto-oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ni et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings identified MDM2 as a direct target of miR-99b-3p, emphasizing the crucial role of miRNA in bone metastases. Interestingly, the miR-99b-3p content in osteocyte sEVs increased dramatically after mechanical loading, suggesting that miR-99b-3p may play a role in the inhibition of bone metastases by exercise.</p><p>SREs resulting from bone metastasis are a major clinical problem that significantly harm patient outcomes, and are commonly considered an incurable consequence of terminal malignancies. Bone metastases from lung cancer represent the majority of cases, followed by prostate cancer and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ryan et al., 2022</xref>). A recent animal study showed that in vivo exercise was protective against metastatic bone loss and inhibited breast cancer progression in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, there was no report about the effect of exercise on bone metastasis of lung cancer until recently. In the present study, we showed that bone metastasis progression in lung cancer was inhibited by exercise. More interestingly, exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC, suggesting that maintaining exercise habits affords protection against bone metastasis. Bisphosphonates are the standard of care in patients with bone metastases. Our study demonstrated that moderate exercise and ZA have additive effects.</p><p>Exercise is quite complex because it involves multiple organs of the body. The bone can sense the mechanical stress stimulus in the process of exercise. Using in vivo models, mostly breast cancer bone metastasis models, several studies suggested that mechanical stimulation of the tibia can contribute to inhibiting bone metastatic colonization and cancer progression in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Tibial compression has been used to stimulate bone formation and study the interplay between mechanical stimuli and SREs. One study showed that moderate tibial loading, but not overloading, protected adult murine bone from destruction by metastasized breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this, our work showed that mechanical loading of the tibia inhibited bone metastasis progression of NSCLC. Although many preclinical and clinical studies have shown that exercise can inhibit cancer progression, the ideal mechanism of implementation remains to be determined. The prescription of exercise for patients with cancer requires further research, including exercise type, frequency, duration, intensity, and whether it is supervised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavalheri and Granger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stout et al., 2021</xref>). Exercise has been underutilized in patients with advanced cancer despite the benefits, particularly for those with bone metastases because of concerns over skeletal complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheville et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ten Tusscher et al., 2020</xref>). Multiple studies showed that individuals with NSCLC were engaged in significantly less physical activity than similar-aged healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Granger et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Granger et al., 2014b</xref>). Exercise models such as running are more realistic for healthy people, but mechanical loading such as tibial compression provides for isolating the impacts of mechanical stimuli on bone tissue in the context of SREs, which are more effective and safer for patients with advanced cancer. Previous studies have shown that either exercise or mechanical loading can lead to increased bone mass, which may be another reason for the attenuated erosion of NSCLC cells and deserves our further exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Robling et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study provides new insights into understanding the mechanism underlying exercise-afforded protection against bone metastasis progression. Bone metastasis progression of NSCLC was inhibited by moderate exercise. Osteocytes, sensing mechanical stimulation generated by exercise, inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells and sustain their dormancy by releasing sEVs containing tumor-suppressive miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Understanding the mechanism underlying tumor dormancy may provide the foundation for the development of strategies to prevent dormant bone metastasis from emerging as overt bone metastasis.</p><fig

recruited by the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China) from January 2020 to January 2021. All patients were fully informed of the study, and they provided written consent prior to participation. Surgically resected bone metastatic tumor tissue was collected from all patients. The obtained bone metastatic tumor tissue was trimmed to an appropriate size and rapidly transferred to formalin solution for storage until processing. We confirm that our study was compliant with the ‘Guidance of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) for the Review and Approval of Human Genetic Resources’. Ethics approval was granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University (2019-LS-16). The study was conducted in accordance with the principles and guidelines of The Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>A549, LLC, NCM460, MLO-A5, and MLO-Y4 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA) and grown in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. MC3T3-E1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in α Minimum Essential Medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. All cell lines were mycoplasma negative and authenticated by ATCC STR profiling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Animal models</title><p>All animal experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China (SMUL2020141). C57BL/6 and nude athymic mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of the Southern Medical University in Guangzhou, China. Animal care was in accordance with the guidelines of the US National Institutes of Health and the Chinese National Institute of Health. All surgical interventions were performed under anesthesia with a mixture of 13.3% urethane and 0.5% chloralose (0.65 ml/100 g body weight). All efforts were made to reduce the number of animals used and to minimize animal discomfort. Animals were randomly grouped in all experiments, and the names of the groups were concealed until statistical analysis was completed.</p><p>For in situ studies, 25×10<sup>4</sup> LLC cells or A549 cells were injected into the tibiae of 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice or nude mice. In brief, 25×10<sup>4</sup> LLC cells and A549 cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were injected into the tibia of C57BL/6 mice and nude mice, respectively. Mice were euthanized on day 21 for analyses, unless otherwise indicated. For stress-induced experiments, after 2 days of recovery, tibiae loading was performed daily on the tumor-inoculated tibiae. Using an ElectroForce device (Bose, Framingham, MA, USA), the tibiae of the mask-anesthetized mice were given daily loads of 1 N (peak-to-peak) at 2 Hz for 10 min, 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The tibias of a subset of mice were injected with AntagomiR-NC or AntagomiR-99b-3p (GenePharma, Shanghai, China, 3 nmol per tibia, once a week for 3 weeks) after 2 days of recovery.</p><p>For ZA experiments, starting on day 3 after lung cancer cell transplantation, mice were treated with subcutaneous injection of 100 µg/kg ZA (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) or saline (other groups) every 3 days for 3 weeks, after which they were euthanized. For exercise experiments, exercised mice were involuntarily placed on a 12-lane rodent treadmill for 30 min per day at a speed of 15 cm/s for at least 5 days per week unless otherwise stated. During the 3 days prior to euthanasia, the exercising mice underwent obligatory exercise, regardless of how many consecutive days they had previously exercised. Two days after surgery, all mice except the control group began moderate exercise by treadmill running, whereby they were involuntarily placed on a 12-lane rodent treadmill for 30 min per day at a speed of 15 cm/s for at least 5 days per week, and were euthanized after 4 weeks. For exercise preconditioning, mice were additionally subjected to 4 weeks of treadmill exercise prior to tibial implantation of NSCLC cells. In the matched experiment, the control mice were placed on a stationary (0 cm/s) treadmill for the same time duration as the experimental mice.</p><p>We examined the effects of preconditioning on bone metastasis progression in mature adult mice using treadmill running. Male 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were subjected to 4 weeks of treadmill exercise followed by tibial implantation of NSCLC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lung cancer cell preparation and in situ injection</title><p>We used clones derived from the GFP-tagged LLC cells and A549 cells. The cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 0.1 mg/ml penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C under 5–8% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were passaged at 80–90% confluence and re-plated at a 1:10 dilution, which was approximately every 72 hr. Before in situ injection, cells were trypsinized at 80–90% confluence with 0.15% trypsin/ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.5% Gibco trypsin EDTA diluted 1:2 in PBS). Cells were immediately removed from the plate with 10 ml ice-cold DMEM containing 10% FBS, pipetted into a 15 ml conical tube, and centrifuged at 200×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in a 50 ml conical tube in 25 ml ice-cold PBS (without Ca or Mg) and counted. This was centrifuged to re-pellet, and finally resuspended at 25×10<sup>4</sup> cells/10 μl in ice-cold PBS.</p><p>The mice were anesthetized using a mixture of 13.3% urethane and 0.5% chloralose (0.65 ml/100 g body weight). Both legs were cleaned with 10% povidone/iodine swab/solution, followed by ethanol, repeated twice. The skin was wetted with 70% ethanol to increase visibility of the underlying patellar ligament, which should be visible as a distinct, thick, white line. While firmly grasping the ankle/leg of the mouse, a 28 g ½ needle was inserted under the patella, through the middle of patellar ligament, and into the anterior intercondylar area in the top of the tibia. A gentle, lateral movement of the needle was applied to ensure it was in tibia and passed through the growth plate. The plunger was slowly depressed to inject 10 μl of cell solution. After 3 min, the needle was slowly extracted. The treated mice were kept on a heating pad until revived.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mechanical stress stimulation of MLO-Y4 cells</title><p>MLO-Y4 cells were transferred to a Biofex six-well plate (Flexcell, Burlington, NC, USA) and allowed to adhere to the membrane until they attained 90% confluence. The cells were subjected to sinusoidal stretching (Flexcell) at 12% strain and 1.25 Hz frequency for 12 hr. Experiments were performed at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following 48 hr of stretching, the CM (or control medium) was collected for sEVs extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Biophoton imaging and micro-CT imaging</title><p>Tumor-bearing mice were euthanized 30 days after tumor cell injection, and their hindlimb bones were imaged by biophotonics. Fluorescence imaging for GFP-labeled tumor cells in these bones was performed using the optical imaging system, Fx Pro (Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). For anatomical orientation, a white light/grayscale picture was performed and used with the fluorescent signal (Cy3.5: excitation = 570 nm; emission = 620 nm). For data analysis, molecular imaging software 7.1.3 (Bruker BioSpin MRI GmbH) was used. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined around the bone and analyzed compared to the background of PBS injection to calculate the signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Micro-CT was performed using the Skyscan 1172 (Bruker-MicroCT, Kontich, Belgium). The X-ray tube settings were 80 kV and 500 µA and images were acquired at the highest resolution without charge-coupled device binning, resulting in a voxel size of 9.44 µm. A 0.66° rotation step through a 195° angular range with 6500 ms exposure was used. After processing with a three-dimensional Gaussian filter to reduce noise, the ROIs were manually segmented such that they corresponded to the cortical and trabecular bone regions. Cortical ROIs comprised 470 µm thick regions (50 slices, 9.4 µm thickness per slice) located 3 mm distal to the growth plate, while 300 µm thick trabecular sections began 0.27 mm distal to the growth plate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Bone samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and decalcified in a 10% EDTA solution. They were subsequently dehydrated through a series of graded alcohols, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Sagittal sections of 2–5 µm were prepared for histological analyses. Following deparaffinization and rehydration, H&amp;E staining were performed on the tissue sections. The tissue sections were imaged using an FSX100 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>For immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 30 min at 90°C or treated with 200 mg/ml proteinase K (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 10 min at 37°C to unmask antigen.

Thereafter, the sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and blocked with 1% sheep serum at room temperature for 1 hr. We incubated the sections with a primary antibody that recognized Ki-67 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, cat. #: 9129, 1:200) overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, we used a horse radish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (1:200 in 1% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 1 hr) at 37°C. Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen and hematoxylin as the counterstain.</p><p>For immunofluorescence, we incubated primary antibodies that recognized Ki-67 (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. #: 9129, 1:200), DMP1 (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA, cat. #: AF4386, 1:100), GFP (ABclonal, Wuhan, China, cat. #: AE012, 1:100), and CCND3 (Bioss, Woburn, MA, USA, cat. #: bs-0660R, 1:100) overnight at 4°C. For secondary reactions, species-matched Alexa Fluor 488- and Alexa Fluor 594-secondary antibodies were used (1:500 in 1% BSA, 1 hr) at 37°C in the dark. The secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence staining were goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen, cat, #: A-11008) and donkey anti-Sheep Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, cat. #: A-11016). The sections were mounted with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) before imaging and we examined more than five different microscopic images (per section) under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In situ hybridization</title><p>In situ hybridization was performed to determine the expression of miR-99b-3p using miRCURY LNA miRNA Detection, Optimization Kit 2 (miR-99b-3p) (Exiqon, Vedbæk, Denmark), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

After washing in PBS, the slides were submerged in 99.7% ethanol and air-dried. Slides were hybridized with 40 nM miR-99b-3p in an incubation chamber at 37°C for 16–18 hr, followed by stringent washes with saline-sodium citrate buffer at 37°C. For immunodetection, slides were blocked with digoxigenin blocking reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in maleic acid buffer containing 2% sheep serum at ambient temperature for 60 min and then incubated with sheep anti-digoxigenin conjugated to ALP (diluted 1:800 in blocking reagent) at ambient temperature for 60 min, resulting in dark-blue staining. The NBT/BCIP reaction mixture was incubated within a humidified chamber at 37°C for 2 hr and the reaction was stopped with KTBT buffer, and then washed in PBS three times, dehydrated, and mounted for microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Cells and sEVs were lysed with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS), 2 M urea, 10% glycerol, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mM dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blocked with BSA.

They find that metastatic NSCLC cells exhibit lower levels of the proliferation markers Ki-67 and CCND3 when located in areas adjacent to the bone surface in both NSCLC patients and an intraosseous animal model of NSCLC. Using in vitro approaches, they show that osteocyte-like cells inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells through the secretion of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). They identify miR-99b-3p as a component of sEVs and demonstrate that miR-99b3p inhibits the proliferation of NSCLC cells by targeting the transcription factor MDM2. Interestingly, the data also shows that mechanical stimulation of osteocytes enhances the inhibitory effect of osteocytes on NSCLC cell proliferation via increasing sEVs release. By performing different in vivo studies, the authors show that tibial loading and moderate exercise (treadmill running), before and after tumor cell inoculation, suppress tumor progression in bone and protect bone mass. Intriguingly, the moderate exercise regime shows additive/synergistic effects with the co-administration of anti-resorptive therapy. These data add to the growing evidence pointing towards osteocytes as important cells of the tumor microenvironment capable of influencing the progression of tumors in bone.</p><p>The conclusions of the paper, however, are not well supported by the data, and some critical aspects of image analysis and data analysis need to be clarified and extended.</p><p>(1) In Figure 1, the authors rely on KI-67 as a marker of proliferation. Yet, it is intriguing that some osteocytes, non-proliferating cells by definition, are often positive for this marker, which questions the specificity of the staining. The data displayed in supplementary figures showing CCND3 as a marker of proliferation ,and GFP as a marker of cancer cells, is much more robust and should be moved to the main figures.</p><p>(2) Adding control groups to fully assess the impact of the in vivo interventions (tibial loading, moderate exercise, anti-resorptive therapy) on bone mass would be needed. The authors should have used naive mice or analyzed the bones from the non-injected contralateral legs.</p><p>(3) The data on miRNA99b-3p on NSCLC in Supplementary figure 3 is not convincing. The positive cells are difficult to see and most of the osteocyte lack nuclei. Better data, in humans and the mouse model, would have helped to confirm that osteocytes produce miRNA99b-3p.</p><p>(4) Some conclusions of the paper are not entirely supported by the data provided. Osteocytes, as well as other bone cells, can respond to mechanical stimulation and thus could virtually be responsible for the protective effects of mechanical loading or moderate exercise. While blocking miR-99b3p with antagomiRs rescued the decreases in proliferation, it is unclear whether this effect is mediated by osteocytes or other cells that express this miRNA. In vivo experiments demonstrating a direct role of osteocytes are needed to support the notion that osteocytes maintain tumor dormancy in NSCLC bone metastasis. In vivo, studies assessing tumor dormancy directly would be needed to confirm osteocytes promote cancer cell dormancy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

These experiments were conducted before our lastsubmission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The bone microenvironment is complex. It is recommended to evaluate the effect of bone marrow-derived sEVs on NSCLC to validate whether the tumor suppressive effect of osteocyte sEVs is unique.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We agree with the reviewer’s comments that the bone microenvironment is complex. We explored the effect of bone marrow-derived sEVs on NSCLC cell proliferation and found that bone marrow-derived sEVs promoted NSCLC cell proliferation, as shown in Supplemental Figure 2g, h in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The description of exercise preconditioning is not clear enough. It is recommended to supplement the pattern diagram to improve readability. Exercise preconditioning should be further discussed by the Authors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments and we are sorry to make you confused. We have added the pattern diagram of the exercise preconditioning in Supplemental Figure 6a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The histological images are analyzed in a qualitative manner, with no description of the methodology used. A quantitative assessment of the distance and level of Ki-67+ NSCLC cells needs to be performed in human and murine tissues. Because in bone metastases cancer cells are frequently mixed with bone marrow cells, the inclusion of a cell marker to identify NSCLC cells is needed for proper interpretation of the imaging data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful reading and constructive suggestions. We conducted the suggested quantitative assessment and descripted the methodology in the revised manuscript. The results showed that Ki-67 was lower in tumor cells adjacent to bone tissue than in the surrounding tumor cells (Figure 1a, b).</p><p>In order to effectively identify NSCLC cells in bone metastases, GFP-expressing NSCLC cells were used in the animal model. We have added the immunofluorescence analysis of GFP and CCND3 in Supplemental Figure 4e, 4g, 5 and 6b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors rely on KI-67 as a marker of proliferation. Yet, it is intriguing that some osteocytes, non-proliferating cells by definition, are often positive for this marker, which questions the specificity of the staining. The authors should provide the proper immunostaining controls to check for specificity and use additional markers of proliferation to confirm these results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. Ki-67 staining was wildly used to determine the dormancy of tumor cells in previous studies [1-4]. To confirm the results of Ki-67 staining, we used cyclin D3 (CCND3) as an additional marker of proliferation as suggested by the reviewer. We added the immunofluorescence analysis of CCND3 in Supplemental Figure 4e, 4g, 5 and 6b, which is consistent with the result of the quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of KI-67.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The lack of proper controls in the in vivo experiments makes the interpretation of the data difficult. For instance, in the preconditioning experiment, it is likely that the bone mass increases. thus, these mice start with high bone mass than the control mice. The lack of a proper control (naive mice exposed to moderate exercise) does not allow testing if the presence of cancer cells still promotes bone loss in this group. The authors need to include naive mice or analyze the bones from the non-injected contralateral legs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments and we are sorry to make you confused. We absolutely agree with the reviewer that the bone mass increases after exercise preconditioning.Multiple tissues and organ systems are affected by exercise, initiating diverse homeostatic responses. Although exercise preconditioning effectively suppressed bone metastasis progression of NSCLC as mentioned in the previous manuscript, we cannot immediately conclude that it is completely dependent on osteocytes to function. The mechanism of exercise preconditioning in suppressing bone metastasis progression is complex which still need further exploration. The revised manuscript has expanded the discussion on this area (manuscript line 326-328).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4)Further, validating the in vivo work with other osteocyte-like cells or primary osteocytes would have strengthened the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have conducted the experiments of co-culture ofMLO-A5 (another type of osteogenic cell line) and NSCLC cells as shown in SupplementalFigure 1g. Not surprisingly, MLO-A5 cells also had an inhibitory effect on proliferation of NSCLC cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The data on miRNA99b-3p on NSCLC in Supplementary Figure 3 is not convincing. The positive cells are difficult to see and most of the osteocyte lack nuclei. Better data, in humans and the mouse model, is needed to confirm that osteocytes produce miRNA99b-3p.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and we are sorry to make you confused. In this study, we used miRCURY LNA miRNA detection probes in ISH without staining the nuclei in the tissues, which method have been used in our previous studies with others [5-7]. Detailed experimental procedures for ISH of miRNA have been added in the revised manuscript (manuscript line461-474).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors do not provide a piece of data supporting that osteocytes are responsible for any of the effects seen by the interventions done in the in vivo models. Osteocytes, as well as other bone cells, can respond to mechanical stimulation and thus could virtually be responsible for the protective effects of mechanical loading or moderate exercise. In vivo experiments demonstrating a direct role of osteocytes-produced miRNA99b-3p are needed to support the notion that osteocytes maintain tumor dormancy in NSCLC bone metastasis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful comments and suggestion. We constructed in vivo model by injecting with antagomir-NC and antagomir-99b-3p with mechanical loading [8]. The results showed that the injection of antagomiR-99b-3p could partially and effectively rescue the inhibitory effect on NSCLC cell proliferation (Figure 4i-k).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Further, the authors solely rely on Ki-67 as a marker of dormancy. Completing this analysis with an assessment of a dormant gene expression signature or in vivo studies assessing tumor dormancy directly would be needed to confirm this notion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We conducted the suggested experiment by using CCND3 as an additional dormancy marker. We added the immunofluorescence analysis of CCND3 in Supplemental Figure 4e, 4g, 5 and 6b, which is consistent with the result of the quantitative immunofluorescence analysis of Ki-67.</p><p>References</p><p>[1] Guba M, Cernaianu G, Koehl G et al.
