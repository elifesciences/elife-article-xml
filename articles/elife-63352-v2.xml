formation. The hypothalamic supramammillary nucleus (SuM) sends long-range projections to hippocampal area CA2. While the SuM-CA2 connection is critical for social memory, how this input acts on the local circuit is unknown. Using transgenic mice, we found that SuM axon stimulation elicited mixed excitatory and inhibitory responses in area CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs). Parvalbumin-expressing basket cells were largely responsible for the feedforward inhibitory drive of SuM over area CA2. Inhibition recruited by the SuM input onto CA2 PNs increased the precision of action potential firing both in conditions of low and high cholinergic tone. Furthermore, SuM stimulation in area CA2 modulated CA1 activity, indicating that synchronized CA2 output drives a pulsed inhibition in area CA1. Hence, the network revealed here lays basis for understanding how SuM activity directly acts on the local hippocampal circuit to allow social memory encoding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>supramammillary nucleus</kwd><kwd>area CA2</kwd><kwd>hippocampal circuitry</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>social memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013107</institution-id><institution>RIKEN Brain Science Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Thomas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H05646</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Thomas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H05233</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McHugh</surname><given-names>Thomas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-13-JSV4-0002-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piskorowski</surname><given-names>Rebecca Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE37-0020-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piskorowski</surname><given-names>Rebecca Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ville de Paris</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Programme Emergences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piskorowski</surname><given-names>Rebecca Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NARSAD Young INvestigator Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Piskorowski</surname><given-names>Rebecca Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FTD20170437387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schizo-Oui</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Input conveying social novelty information from the hypothalamus controls hippocampal activity by recruiting a novel inhibitory circuit in hippocampal area CA2.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hippocampus is critical for memory formation and spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2014</xref>), yet basic questions persist regarding the underlying circuitry and cellular components. While area CA2 has been shown to play a significant role in several hippocampal processes including social memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hitti and Siegelbaum, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stevenson and Caldwell, 2014</xref>) sharp-wave ripple generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliva et al., 2016a</xref>) and spatial encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kay et al., 2016</xref>), information about the local circuitry and cellular mechanisms allowing these functions is lacking. There is mounting evidence that generalizations cannot be made from the rich understanding of areas CA1 and CA3, as neurons in area CA2 have been shown to have unique molecular expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lein et al., 2004</xref>), morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartesaghi and Ravasi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nò, 1934</xref>) and cellular properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Srinivas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, and in contrast to area CA1, CA2 pyramidal neurons do not undergo high-frequency stimulation-induced synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dasgupta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>). Rather, the excitability of this region is tightly controlled by a highly plastic network of inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leroy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasrallah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013</xref>). When active, CA2 pyramidal neurons (PNs) can strongly drive area CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasrallah et al., 2019</xref>), thereby influencing hippocampal output. Furthermore, CA2 neurons also project to area CA3, where they recruit inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>) and act to control hippocampal excitability. Thus, CA2 neurons are poised to have long-reaching effects in the hippocampus, and a better understanding of the regulation of neuronal activity in this region is needed.</p><p>The hypothalamic supramammillary (SuM) nucleus sends projections to both area CA2 and the dentate gyrus (DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haglund et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vertes, 1992</xref>). These long-range connections have been shown in several species including rodents, primates, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haglund et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wyss et al., 1979</xref>) where they are present in early hippocampal development. The SuM has been found to be active during a wide variety of conditions including novel environment exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ito et al., 2009</xref>), reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ikemoto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ikemoto et al., 2004</xref>), food anticipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Le May et al., 2019</xref>), and during REM sleep and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Renouard et al., 2015</xref>). This nucleus is also known for participating in hippocampal theta rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pan and McNaughton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pan and McNaughton, 1997</xref>), possibly by its direct projection to the hippocampus or by modulation of the medial septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borhegyi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vertes and Kocsis, 1997</xref>), and regulating spike-timing between hippocampus and the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Disruption of SuM neuron activity with pharmacological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aranda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shahidi et al., 2004</xref>) or lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranda et al., 2006</xref>) has been reported to disrupt hippocampal memory. Serotonin depletion of the SuM leads to deficiencies in spatial learning in the Morris water maze, and results in altered hippocampal theta activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gutiérrez-Guzmán et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hernández-Pérez et al., 2015</xref>). Salient rewarding experiences also activate the SuM, as evidenced by cFos expression in monoaminergic SuM neurons by consumption of rewarding food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Plaisier et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, the rewarding aspects of social aggression have been shown to involve an excitatory circuit between the hypothalamic ventral premammillary nucleus and the SuM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stagkourakis et al., 2018</xref>). It has recently been shown that there are two separate populations of cells in the SuM that target either CA2 or the DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). In the DG, the SuM terminals release both glutamate and GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>). The SuM-DG projection has been recently shown to play a role in modulating DG activity in response to contextual novelty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) and spatial memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, functional studies of the SuM-CA2 projection have found that this connection is entirely glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). It was recently discovered that the CA2-projecting SuM neurons are active during social novelty exposure, and their selective stimulation prevents expression of a memory of a familiar conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). These findings strongly suggest that the SuM-CA2 connection conveys a social novelty signal to the hippocampus. Furthermore, recent in vivo recordings from the SuM in anesthetized rats reported that a subset of SuM neurons were active earlier than CA2 and other hippocampal cells during SWR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vicente et al., 2020</xref>), indicating a possible role for the SuM-CA2 projection in shaping area CA2 activity prior to SWR onset.</p><p>Even with the anatomical and in vivo data, the properties and consequences of SuM activation on area CA2 activity remain unexplored. In this study, we use a combination of approaches to specifically examine the effects of SuM input stimulation on neuronal activity in hippocampal area CA2. Here, we show that the SuM-evoked post-synaptic excitation of CA2 PN is controlled by SuM-driven inhibition. We identified PV-expressing basket cells as the neuronal population most strongly excited by SuM input in area CA2, and thus likely responsible for the feedforward inhibition evoked by SuM in CA2 PNs. We found that recruitment of this inhibition enhances the precision of AP firing by area CA2 PNs in conditions of low and high cholinergic tone. Finally, we observed that the resulting synchronized CA2 PN activity drives inhibition in area CA1, thereby providing a circuit mechanism through which SuM can modulate hippocampal excitability by controlling area CA2 output.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SuM axons provide excitatory glutamatergic input to pyramidal neurons in area CA2 and CA3a</title><p>Its small size and cellular heterogeneity have made the SuM a difficult region to study. It has been shown that the source of vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2)-immunopositive boutons in area CA2 originate from the SuM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Halasy et al., 2004</xref>). In order to more closely examine the SuM-CA2 long-range connection, we injected a retrograde canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) into area CA2 of the hippocampus to permit the expression of Cre-recombinase (Cre) in hippocampal-projecting SuM neurons, and an adeno-associated virus (AAV) was injected into the SuM to allow the expression of EGFP under the control of Cre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In five animals the injection of retrograde CAV-2 was sufficiently targeted to area CA2, as indicated by the presence of EGFP-expressing SuM axonal fibers primarily in this hippocampal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We stained for calretinin to define the boundaries of the SuM nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pan and McNaughton, 2004</xref>). Consistent with recent findings using retrograde AAV vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), we observed that CA2-projecting cells express calretinin and are located in the medial SuM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). These cells were located bilaterally, ventral to the fiber bundles that traverse the SuM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, we confirmed that these cells also stain for VGluT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>In order to better understand the cellular targets and consequences of SuM input activity in area CA2, we injected an AAV to express channelrhodopsin(H143R)-YFP (ChR2-EYFP) under the control of Cre into the SuM of a transgenic mouse line with Cre expression controlled by the VGluT2 promoter, the <italic>Tg(Slc17a-icre)10Ki</italic> line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borgius et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

We found that with both transgenic mouse lines we could reproducibly restrict expression of ChR2-EYFP in the SuM and avoid infecting nearby hypothalamic regions that also project to the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, with both lines of transgenic mice, we observed identical patterns of SuM fiber localization in the hippocampus. EYFP-containing SuM axons were found throughout the granule cell layer of the DG and in area CA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) where they clustered around the pyramidal layer (<italic>stratum pyramidale</italic>, SP). The SuM fiber projection area was clearly restricted to area CA2, as defined by expression of the CA2-specific markers PCP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and RGS14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and did not spread to neighboring areas CA3 and CA1. In order to maximize the precision of our experiments, we frequently only achieved partial infection of the SuM, as indicated by the sparseness of ChR2-EYFP-containing fibers in comparison to the number of VGluT2-stained boutons in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Selective functional mapping of SuM neurons that project to hippocampal area CA2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left, diagram illustrating the injection of AAVs into the SuM.

Additionally, injection sites were examined post hoc to ensure correct targeting of the SuM.</p><p>We observed that photostimulation of SuM axons elicited excitatory post-synaptic responses in 63% of PNs (n = 166 of 263 cells) located in area CA2. PNs in this region shared similar overall dendritic morphologies and electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) but differed along two criteria. First, in <italic>stratum lucidum</italic> where the DG mossy fibers (MF) project, some PNs clearly had thorny excrescences (TE) while others had very smooth apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Based on the presence of TEs, we classified cells as CA2 or CA3a PNs (unequivocal distinction was possible for 148 neurons). Second, the distribution of the locations of PN soma along the radial axis of the hippocampus allowed us to cluster them as deep (closer to <italic>stratum oriens</italic>, SO) or superficial (closer to <italic>stratum radiatum</italic>, SR) subpopulations (unequivocal distinction was possible for 157 neurons). We found that the SuM-PN connectivity was not different between CA2 and CA3 PNs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, χ² test for CA2 and CA3 PNs, p=0.572) or between deep and superficial PNs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, χ² test for deep and superficial PNs, p=0.946). Light-evoked excitatory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs) and excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) recorded at −70 mV were of fairly small amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) that were similar regardless of the PN type or somatic location (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, Mann-Whitney U test for CA2 and CA3 PNs, p=0.409; Mann-Whitney U test for deep and superficial PNs, p=0.306). Because no significant differences in post-synaptic responses to SuM input stimulation were observed between CA2 and CA3 PNs as well as between deep and superficial PNs, data from all PNs was pooled for the rest of the study. The small amplitude of SuM input-evoked post-synaptic responses in PNs was not due to suboptimal stimulation of SuM axons as EPSC amplitudes rapidly reached a plateau when increasing light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). We are confident that this transmission is due to action potential-generated vesicle release because all transmission was blocked following application of the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The pure glutamatergic nature of the SuM input was confirmed by the complete block of light-evoked synaptic transmission following the application of the AMPA and NMDA receptors antagonists NBQX and D-APV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>; amplitudes were −16 ± 4.8 pA in control and −1.8 ± 0.3 pA in NBQX and D-APV, n = 6; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.03).

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Our results and other have demonstrated that glutamate and GABA are co-released at SuM-DG synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boulland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>), but that the SuM-CA2 synapses are exclusively glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). We have previously shown that SuM input stimulation in area CA2 evokes a very large inhibitory post-synaptic current (IPSC) that is entirely due to feedforward inhibition based on the delayed response latencies of IPSCs as compared to EPSCs, the complete block of IPSCs by NBQX and APV, and the complete abolition of IPSCs but sparing of EPSCs in the presence of TTX and 4-amino pyridine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Because photostimulation of SuM input elicited excitatory post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) of fairly small amplitude in area CA2 PNs held at −70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> 4 and D4), we asked if the amplitude of SuM input stimulation-evoked PSPs in PNs could be controlled by feedforward inhibition. Interestingly, blocking inhibitory transmission with the GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonists SR95531 and CGP55845A led to a significant increase of light-evoked PSP amplitude recorded in area CA2 PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>; amplitudes of the first response were 0.18 ± 0.05 mV in control and 0.24 ± 0.05 mV in SR95531 and CGP55845A, n = 14; Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, p=0.004 for the first PSP, p=0.013 for the second PSP, p&lt;0.001 for the third PSP).

Hippocampal area CA2 receives synaptic input from CA3 in <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> (SR). Stimulation of CA3 inputs evokes a very strong feedforward inhibition, such that it is exceptionally difficult to evoke action potential firing in CA2 pyramidal neurons when inhibitory transmission is intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasrallah et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013</xref>). Additionally, CA2 PNs receive synaptic input from the entorhinal cortex in <italic>stratum lacunosum molecular</italic> (SLM). These inputs are very distal but relatively less attenuated in CA2 PNs in comparison to distal inputs in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Srinivas et al., 2017</xref>). In order to answer how the SuM input interacts with the CA3 and entorhinal inputs in area CA2, we electrically stimulated synaptic inputs in SR and SLM in the presence and absence of simultaneous SuM fiber stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In summary, we found that when the CA2 PNs were kept at −70 mV, SuM input stimulation paired with SR or SLM input had a net depolarizing effect. We measured the amplitudes of the light-evoked SuM PSP, the electrically evoked PSP of either SR or SLM stimulation and the paired SuM and electrical PSP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). For SR input stimulation, we found no significant difference between the observed paired SR+SuM amplitude and the calculated linear summated amplitude (SR alone + SuM alone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This was observed for all four pulses of input summations delivered at 10 Hz. However, for the SLM input stimulation, the observed paired amplitude was significantly smaller than the linear summation of the two inputs (SLM alone + SuM alone) for the first stimulus (n = 10; T test, p=0.014) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This observation is expected, as the attenuation of distal dendritic SLM inputs causes the peak of the PSP to be delayed relative to the more somatic SuM input. Thus, the SuM input paired with either SR or SLM input stimulation has minor depolarizing effect on the PSP in CA2 PNs. However, the SuM input might have different effect on the SR and SLM inputs depending on the precise timing of their activation.</p><p>We also examine the summation ratio for a train of 4 PSPs at 10 Hz from SR and SLM synaptic inputs stimulation with and without simultaneous SuM input stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). We observed a significant reduction of the summation ratio as measured by the ratio of the n-th pulse to the first (Pn/P1) for both SR (n = 10; repeated-measures ANOVA, p=2.3×10<sup>−4</sup>) and SLM (n = 10; repeated-measures ANOVA, p=8.5×10<sup>−4</sup>). This observation that concomitant SuM activity is reducing the level of facilitation of several pulses in a train indicates that the short-term dynamics of the SuM-driven excitation and feedforward inhibition are playing a role to prevent cellular excitation from other inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Basket cells are strongly recruited by the SuM input</title><p>Because the hippocampus hosts a variety of interneurons (INs) that are involved in controlling specific aspects of PN excitability, we wished to establish which kind of IN was targeted by the SuM input to area CA2. We performed whole-cell recordings from INs in this area and assessed post-synaptic excitatory responses to SuM axons stimulation in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In contrast with previous reports of an exclusive innervation of PNs by SuM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maglóczky et al., 1994</xref>), we observed robust light-evoked excitatory transmission from SuM axons in 35 out of 62 interneurons (INs) with soma located in SP. Following biocytin-streptavidin staining and anatomical reconstructions of recorded INs (allowing unequivocal identification in 48 neurons), we were able to classify INs based on their physiological properties, somatic location and axonal arborization location. We classified 22 cells as basket cells (BCs) because their axonal arborizations were restricted to SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). BCs fired APs at high frequency either in bursts or continuously upon depolarizing current injection and showed substantial repolarizing sag current when hyperpolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Light-evoked EPSCs and PSPs were readily observed in the vast majority of BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>) and reached large amplitudes in some instances. An additional 26 INs with soma in SP were classified as non-BCs because their axon did not target SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In our recordings, these cells fired in bursts and showed little sag during hyperpolarizing current injection steps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). We consistently observed no or very minor light-evoked excitatory transmission onto non-BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, we recorded from 17 INs that had soma in <italic>stratum oriens</italic> (SO) and nine in <italic>stratum radiatum</italic> (SR). Like non-BCs, these INs did not receive strong excitation from SuM fibers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).

First, SuM inputs preferentially innervated BCs as evidenced by a higher connectivity of EPSCs in BCs than in PNs or other INs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Importantly, excitatory responses had short latencies with limited jitter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>) indicating that the connection was monosynaptic in all cell types. When voltage-clamping cells at −70 mV, light-evoked EPSCs could be compared between different cell populations. However, not every photostimulation gave rise to an EPSC leading to an average success rate that tended to be highest in BCs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). In addition, BCs appeared to receive more excitation from the SuM input than other cells types, as the amplitude of EPSCs was larger in BCs than in PNs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). EPSCs recorded in BCs also had faster kinetics than in PNs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Interestingly, combining the success rate of EPSCs with their respective amplitudes to compute the potency of the SuM synapses revealed that it was significantly larger in BCs than in PNs and non-BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; potencies were −12 ± 1.6 pA for PNs, n = 166; −29 ± 7.8 pA for BCs, n = 18; −5.9 ± 1.5 pA for non-BCs, n = 13; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn-Holland-Wolfe <italic>post hoc</italic> test, p=0.022). Consequently, EPSPs recorded at −70 mV were of larger amplitude in BCs than in PNs and non-BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; amplitudes were 0.44 ± 0.06 mV for PNs, n = 20; 1.71 ± 0.57 mV for BCs, n = 10; 0.53 ± 0.07 mV for non-BCs, n = 4; Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn-Holland-Wolfe post hoc test, p&lt;0.001). When recording cell-attached or current-clamping BCs at their resting membrane potential (V<sub>M</sub>), photostimulation of SuM axons was able to evoke AP firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) in multiple instances (n = 7 of 13). However, this was never observed in PNs (n = 0 of 78), non-BCs (n = 0 of 16), SR INs (n = 0 of 9) or SO INs (n = 0 of 8). These results show that SuM projections to area CA2 preferentially provide excitation to BCs that are likely responsible of the feedforward inhibition observed in PNs. This is in accordance with an efficient control of area CA2 PNs excitation by the SuM inhibitory drive as axons from BCs deliver the feedforward inhibition to the peri-somatic region of PNs, effectively shunting incoming PSPs from both the SuM and from dendritic-targeted inputs in SR and SLM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Parvalbumin-expressing basket cells mediate the feedforward inhibition driven by SuM</title><p>In the hippocampus, BCs express either cholecystokinin (CCK) or parvalbumin (PV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>). We found that in response to a 1 s depolarizing pulse, most BCs that received strong SuM excitatory input displayed very fast AP firing with little accommodation in the AP firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This firing behavior is similar to what has been reported for fast spiking PV-expressing BCs in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pawelzik et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, CCK-expressing BCs show a lower firing frequency and more accommodation during the train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pawelzik et al., 2002</xref>). This result suggests that BCs connected by the SuM may be expressing PV. To directly confirm this hypothesis, we performed post hoc immunostaining of recorded interneurons that received strong excitation from SuM input. Because of the dialysis inherent to the whole-cell recording conditions, we encountered difficulty staining for multiple cells. However, PV-immunoreactivity could unequivocally be detected in either the soma or dendrites of seven connected BCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, this data demonstrates that at least a fraction of the recorded BCs connected by the SuM is expressing PV.</p><p>Hence, to address whether the lack of PV staining in some cells was a consequence of dialysis or resulted from the fact that non-PV +BCs are also connected, we made use of different strategies to differentiate PV+ and CCK+ INs. First, we wished to genetically confirm that PV+ INs are involved in the SuM-driven feedforward inhibition of area CA2 PNs. We used inhibitory Gi-DREADD to selectively inhibit PV+ INs in area CA2 while monitoring feedforward IPSCs from area CA2 PNs in response to SuM stimulation. To achieve that, we injected AAVs expressing a Cre-dependent hM4D(Gi) inhibitory Gi-DREADD in area CA2 of PV-Cre mice together with AAVs expressing ChR2 with a pan-neuronal promoter in the SuM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). While we were able to obtain very specific expression of DREADD in PV+ INs, only a fraction of PV+ INs had detectable DREADD expression as quantified by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; fraction of PV+ INs expressing DREADDs in CA2 = 75 ± 3.5%, n = 13). We observed a substantial reduction of SuM-evoked IPSC amplitude recorded in area CA2 PNs upon application of 10 µM of the Gi-DREADD ligand CNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; amplitudes were 847 ± 122 pA in control and 498 ± 87 pA in CNO hence a 42 ± 6.0% block, n = 13; paired-T test, p&lt;0.001). Although we never measured a complete block of inhibitory responses, this result unequivocally places PV+ INs as mediators of the SuM feedforward inhibition of area CA2 PNs. The incomplete block of IPSCs observed in these experiments indicates that either additional non-PV+ INs are recruited by SuM input or that our silencing of PV-mediated feedforward inhibition is incomplete. This could be a consequence of partial infection of PV +INs in area CA2 by AAVs carrying DREADDs and partial silencing of DREADD-expressing PV+ INs by CNO. To address the latter, we performed whole-cell recordings from Gi-DREADD-expressing CA2 PV+ INs labeled with mCherry and monitored the variations in V<sub>M</sub> level and action potential firing to SuM input stimulation before and after CNO application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We found that CNO application caused a significant hyperpolarization of Gi-DREADD-expressing CA2 PV+ INs, albeit modest in magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>; V<sub>M</sub> were −55.3 ± 2.3 mV in ACSF and −61.8 ± 2.7 mV in CNO hence a −6.5 ± 2.4 mV hyperpolarization, n = 6; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.031). While this confirmed the relevance of our silencing strategy, it highlighted the possibility that Gi-DREADD-expressing CA2 PV+ INs may not be fully silenced by CNO. Indeed, we observed residual SuM-evoked AP firing in these cells after CNO application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). These data indicate that synaptically evoked somatic AP firing is not fully blocked by CNO in Gi-DREADD-expressing CA2 PV+ INs. Because it is difficult to distinguish between partial silencing of PV INs by Gi-DREADDs or recruitment of other types of INs in the SuM-driven feedforwards inhibition, we adopted other complementary strategies to answer this question.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Parvalbumin-expressing BCs mediate the feedforward inhibition recruited by photostimulation of SuM fibers.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Silencing of PV+ INs by inhibitory DREADDs reduces SuM feedforward inhibition onto area CA2 PNs.

In the neocortex, P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels are necessary for GABA release from PV+ fast spiking INs onto PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zaitsev et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, N-type calcium channels are primarily involved in GABA release from CCK+ INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hefft and Jonas, 2005</xref>). Thus, we recorded SuM input-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs in CA2 PNs before and after application of the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels specific blocker ω-agatoxin TK (200 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We observed a near-complete block of IPSCs upon ω-agatoxin TK application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> <bold>1</bold>, IPSC amplitudes were 245.5 ± 92.6 pA in control and 35.0 ± 15.4 pA in ω-agatoxin TK hence a 81.8 ± 3.9% block, n = 5; paired-T test, p&lt;0.001), suggesting a major contribution from PV+ INs to SuM-driven feedforward inhibition consistent with our previous results. However, we observed that excitatory transmission from SuM axons was also partially blocked by ω-agatoxin TK application, as SuM input-evoked EPSCs were significantly reduced although not abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> <bold>2</bold>, EPSC amplitudes were −51.8 ± 5.9 pA in SR95531 and CGP55845A and −26.5 ± 5.4 pA after ω-agatoxin TK hence a 49.6 ± 5.6% block, n = 6; paired-T test, p&lt;0.001). This observation indicates that glutamate release from SuM axons relies on P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels to some degree, thereby complicating the interpretation of the reduction of IPSC amplitude in CA2 PNs.</p><p>It has previously been demonstrated that PV+ BC transmission can be strongly attenuated by mu opioid receptor activation (MOR) while CCK+ BC transmission is insensitive to MOR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glickfeld et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we recorded from PNs in area CA2 and examined the sensitivity of light-evoked IPSCs to the application of the MOR agonist DAMGO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We found that there was a near complete block of the light-evoked IPSC amplitude following 1 μM DAMGO application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> <bold>1</bold>; IPSC amplitudes were 343 ± 123 pA in control and 31 ± 12.4 pA in DAMGO hence a 88 ± 5.0% block, n = 6 PNs; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.031), while direct excitatory transmission remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> <bold>2</bold>; EPSC amplitudes were −6.7 ± 1.1 pA in SR95531 and CGP55845A and −5.6 ± 0.9 pA after DAMGO, n = 17 PNs; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.19). While this result is in agreement with our DREADD and ω-agatoxin TK results showing a major contribution of PV +INs to the SuM-driven feedforward inhibition, it should be noted that the dichotomy between PV+ versus CCK+ INs sensitivity to DAMGO has not been directly verified in area CA2.</p><p>It has recently been shown that delta opioid receptors (DORs) are specifically expressed in a fraction of PV+ cells in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Erbs et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, PV+ INs in area CA2 are the substrate of an iLTD of feedforward inhibition from CA3 mediated by delta opioid receptor (DOR) activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasrallah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013</xref>). Therefore, we sought to further refine our characterization of the SuM feedforward inhibition by assessing its sensitivity to DOR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Application of 0.5 µM of the DOR agonist DPDPE led to a long-term reduction of light-evoked IPSCs recorded in area CA2 PNs, similar to the iLTD seen by CA3 input stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> <bold>1</bold>; IPSC amplitudes were 168 ± 28 pA in control and 64 ± 22 pA in DPDPE hence a 61 ± 14% block by DPDPE, n = 7; paired-T test, p=0.015), while leaving direct EPSCs unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> <bold>2</bold>; EPSC amplitudes were −4.0 ± 1.6 pA in SR95531 and CGP55845A and −3.1 ± 1.1 pA after DPDPE, n = 7; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.22). Further confirming the PV+ nature of INs responsible for the SuM feedforward inhibition, this result reveals that both the local CA3 and long-range SuM inputs converge onto an overlapping population of INs to inhibit area CA2 PNs, thus enabling cross-talk between these routes through synaptic plasticity of PV+ INs. However, since DORs are only expressed in a fraction of PV+ INs and therefore only reduces but does not fully block PV+ IN-mediated GABA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasrallah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013</xref>), it is difficult to know if the remaining SuM-evoked IPSCs are from PV+ INs not expressing DOR or from other INs recruited by the SuM input.</p><p>Altogether, these four methods strongly suggest that SuM inputs selectively recruit PV +interneurons to inhibit CA2 PNs. Although individually each method does not conclusively demonstrate that SuM input exclusively targets PV+ INs, the consistent reduction of SuM-driven feedforward inhibition of CA2 PNs observed with every approach allows us to conclude that PV + cells are predominantly targeted by SuM inputs in area CA2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The feedforward inhibitory drive from SuM controls pyramidal neuron excitability</title><p>Given SuM axonal stimulation triggers an excitatory-inhibitory sequence in post-synaptic PNs, we asked which effect would prevail on PN excitability. In order to assess this, we mimicked an active state in PNs by injecting constant depolarizing current steps sufficient to sustain AP firing during 1 s while photostimulating SuM axons at 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). We observed that recruitment of SuM inputs significantly delayed the onset of the first AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; latency to the first AP were 221 ± 19.9 ms in control and 233 ± 19.1 ms with photostimulation, hence a 12.1 ± 4.3 ms increase upon photostimulation, n = 12; paired-T test, p=0.016). In addition, given SuM neurons display theta-locked firing in vivo, we asked if rhythmic inhibition driven by SuM inputs in area CA2 could pace AP firing in PNs by defining windows of excitability. Indeed, photostimulation of SuM axons at 10 Hz led to a significant decrease of variability in the timing of AP firing by PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>; standard deviations of the first AP timing were 36.9 ± 11 ms in control and 24.7 ± 7.4 ms with photostimulation, hence a 12.3 ± 5.3 ms decrease upon photostimulation, n = 12; Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, p&lt;0.001 for the first AP, p=0.008 for the second AP, p=0.004 for the third AP). Both the delay of AP onset and the reduction of AP jitter stemmed from the feedforward inhibition recruited by SuM inputs as application of GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor antagonists abolished these effects of SuM stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>; latency to the first AP were 232 ± 19.8 ms in SR95531 and CGP55845A and 235 ± 18.0 ms with photostimulation, n = 6; Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p=0.44; standard deviations of the first AP timing were 11.9 ± 2.0 ms in SR95531 and CGP55845A and 7.1 ± 1.5 ms with photostimulation, n = 6; Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, p=0.22 for the first AP, p=0.16 for the second AP, p=0.09 for the third AP).

It has been reported that the AP discharge of SuM neurons in vivo is phase-locked to the hippocampal theta rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>). Because theta rhythm is a brain state characterized by elevated levels of acetylcholine, we approximately mimicked these conditions in the hippocampal slice preparation by bath application of 10 µM of the cholinergic agonist carbachol (CCh). Under these conditions, CA2 PNs depolarize and spontaneously fire rhythmic bursts of APs, and the properties of these AP bursts are tightly controlled by excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robert et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we decided to examine how SuM input stimulation influenced CA2 PN firing under these conditions.</p><p>Because SuM neurons fire in bursts at theta frequency in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirk et al., 1996</xref>), and because the elevated cholinergic tone accompanying theta can activate muscarinic receptors that alter the synaptic release properties of many synapses in the brain, we examined how synaptic transmission from the SuM input to area CA2 was affected by the application of 10 µM carbachol (CCh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>). With GABA receptors blocked to first assess the SuM excitatory transmission only, we observed that CCh decreased the amplitude and increased the PPR of SuM-evoked EPSCs in CA2 PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests a decrease of glutamate release by SuM axons induced by CCh. We found similar results for SuM-evoked feedforward inhibitory transmission to CA2 PNs as IPSC amplitude was decreased and PPR increased with CCh application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we examined the relative short-term dynamics of SuM-evoked excitatory and inhibitory transmission to CA2 PNs. For this, both EPSCs and IPSCs were recorded from the same individual CA2 PNs upon repeated SuM input stimulation with five pulses delivered at 10 Hz before and after CCh application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). We observed that both SuM-evoked EPSCs and IPSCs underwent short-term depression, as evidenced by a decrease in amplitude along the pulse train as well as amplitude ratios between subsequent pulses over the first pulse (Pn/P1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). It is worth noting that the Pn/P1 ratio was similar for EPSCs and IPSCs and that the E/I ratio did not significantly change with repeated SuM input stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). This indicates that the SuM influence over CA2 PN may remain overall inhibitory during prolonged SuM input activation. Similarly influencing both EPSCs and IPSCs, application of 10 µM CCh affected these short-term dynamics of the SuM-CA2 PN transmission by decreasing the amplitude of the initial response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>) but limiting the subsequent short-term depression of SuM-evoked PSCs amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Interestingly, the overall effect of repeated SuM input stimulation on post-synaptic responses in area CA2 PNs was even more biased toward inhibition after CCh application as the E/I ratio of PSCs during the pulse train was lower in CCh as compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>), possibly because of a lesser depression of IPSCs as compared to EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>) which could be due to a CCh-induced depolarization of INs mediating SuM-evoked feedforward inhibition. Altogether, these observations match with our findings of the SuM input having an overall inhibitory influence over area CA2, and suggest that this effect might be more gradual over time but even stronger in conditions of elevated cholinergic tone.</p><p>Under these conditions of elevated cholinergic tone, we asked how the spontaneous AP bursting activity of CA2 PNs would be affected by activation of the SuM input by triggering 10 s-long trains of 0.5 ms light pulses delivered at 10 Hz to stimulate SuM axons at the onset of bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Because of the intrinsic cell-to-cell variability of bursting kinetics, we photostimulated SuM inputs only during interleaved bursts in the same cells. To do this, bursts were detected automatically with an online threshold detection system that started the photostimulation pulse train after the first AP of every alternating burst, starting with the second burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). For analysis, the number of APs and bursting kinetics could be compared within the same cell.

We observed that photostimulation of SuM inputs resulted in a striking reduction in the amount of time the membrane potential remained depolarized, and this is likely why the burst duration was significantly shorter in bursts with SuM photo-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>; burst duration was 4.0 ± 1.1 s in control and 1.6 ± 0.5 s with photostimulation, n = 7; paired-T test, p=0.037).

Indeed, AP bursts with SuM input activation were followed more rapidly by another burst of APs than the ones without SuM input activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and H</xref>; time until next burst was 93 ± 14 s in control and 59 ± 17 s with photostimulation, n = 7; paired-T test, p=0.001), which could be due to both short-term depression of inhibitory transmission after repeated activation during the SuM input photostimulation train and reduced activation of hyperpolarizing and shunting conductances during bursts shortened by SuM input photostimulation. Thus, in our preparation, SuM input activation is able to modify the spontaneous bursting activity of CA2 PNs under conditions of high cholinergic tone.</p><p>As SuM input controls burst firing of action potentials and likely paces activity in area CA2, we wondered how the subsequent output of CA2 PNs would affect their post-synaptic targets.

Mice were placed in a small box (familiar context) and left free to explore as blue (473 nm) laser light pulses (50 ms pulse width) were applied to the SuM terminals at 10 Hz. Across 23 recording sessions in five mice, we found that the activation of SuM terminals in CA2 resulted in a significant and reproducible change in the multiunit spiking activity recorded in the pyramidal cell layer of CA1 on 34 of 55 tetrodes. The firing rate change was similar across individual tetrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>), with a decrease in the normalized firing rate starting shortly after laser onset and continuing for about 10 ms, followed immediately by a rebound-like increase to about 20% greater than baseline firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>).</p><p>In order to get a better mechanistic understanding of this observation, we set out to decipher how SuM activity in area CA2 influences CA1 in the hippocampal slice preparation. To this end, we used the same photostimulation protocol used in vivo that consisted of light stimulation trains of 50 ms-long pulses delivered at 10 Hz for 1 s, repeated every 10 s for 2 min and interleaved with light-off sweeps of the same duration, with the microscope objective centered on area CA2. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of CA1 PNs were obtained in acute hippocampal slices superfused with CCh and subjected to this light stimulation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We asked what synaptic events may be responsible for the decreased firing of CA1 units observed 10–20 ms after light onset in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Whole-cell recordings of CA1 PNs showed an absence of EPSCs time-locked to the photostimulation in all but one case (n = 11/12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). In contrast, we often (n = 7/12) observed light-evoked IPSCs in CA1 PNs occurring 10–20 ms after light onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>). Therefore, the reduction in firing of CA1 units in vivo is likely caused by increased inhibitory inputs onto CA1 PNs within 10–20 ms of SuM fiber stimulation over area CA2. This result highlights a contribution of SuM input to controlling CA2 output that regulate CA1 activity in vivo and provides a mechanistic interpretation of this observation at the circuit level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we provide direct evidence for a functional connection between the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. Using stereotaxic injection of viral vectors in combination with transgenic mouse lines to express channelrhodopsin in a projection-specific manner, we have been able to selectively stimulate SuM axons in area CA2 of the hippocampus, allowing for the direct examination of synaptic transmission. This approach yielded novel functional information about the SuM input post-synaptic targets and the overall physiological consequences of its activation. We found that, in contrast to previous anatomical reports, SuM input forms synapses onto both PNs and INs in area CA2. The excitatory drive evoked by light-stimulation of SuM input was significantly larger for BC INs, which we demonstrate are likely PV+. The resulting feedforward inhibition recruited by SuM input stimulation enhanced the precision of AP timing of CA2 PNs in conditions of low and high cholinergic tone relevant to different brain states. The modified CA2 output evoked poly-synaptic inhibition in area CA1, likely responsible for a decrease in firing rate of CA1 units in vivo. Overall, we demonstrate that SuM input controls CA2 output to area CA1 by recruiting feedforward inhibition.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SuM input to area CA2 forms a microcircuit where PV+ basket cells strongly inhibit pyramidal neurons</title><p>Glutamatergic innervation of area CA2 by the SuM has been previously described by tracing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kiss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Soussi et al., 2010</xref>) and presumed to form synapses exclusively onto PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maglóczky et al., 1994</xref>). Our experimental strategy allowed for the direct examination of the post-synaptic targets of SuM glutamatergic axons. Our results confirm that PNs in area CA2 indeed receive excitatory synapses from SuM axons. However, in contrast to what had been proposed in previous studies, we observed that SuM inputs target not only PNs but also INs in area CA2. Importantly, we identified a specific subpopulation of INs as BCs which were the cell type most potently excited by SuM. These BCs could fire action potentials upon SuM input photostimulation leading to a substantial feedforward inhibition of neighboring PNs. We found that at resting membrane potentials, the mixed excitatory/inhibitory SuM input resulted in a net depolarization of the membrane potential in CA2 PNs. However, when the SuM input was paired with either inputs in SR or SLM, we observed a decrease in the summation ratios of trains of synaptic inputs consistent with a perisomatic shunting inhibition driven by SuM in area CA2. Furthermore, we found that with elevated cholinergic tone, recruitment of BCs by SuM controlled PNs excitability and shaped spontaneous burst firing. This finding demonstrates that SuM activity can pace action potential firing in PNs through recruitment of feedforward inhibition.</p><p>The population of INs potently excited by SuM transmission display many features that motivate us to classify them as PV+ BCs. They have somas located in the somatic layer, have densely packed perisomatic-targeted axons, are fast spiking and show PV immuno-reactivity. The selective expression of GiDREADD in PV+ cells allows for selective silencing that reduces SuM-driven feedforward inhibition of area CA2 PNs. With these techniques, however, we were unable to sufficiently silent PV+ cells in area CA2, leaving open the possibility that another population of basket cell is targeted by SuM input. The feedforward inhibitory transmission recruited by SuM stimulation is highly sensitive to MOR activation. While this supports our hypothesis that PV+ cells are targeted by SuM input, MORs are not entirely exclusive to PV+ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stumm et al., 2004</xref>). We also show that the SuM-recruited feedforward inhibition is sensitive to DOR activation. Unlike MORs, DORs have been shown to be specific to PV+ cells in area CA2, however, only a sub-population of PV +INs express this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasrallah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013</xref>) leaving open the possibility that the remaining IPSCs evoked by SuM stimulation are not from PV+ cells. We also show in this work that SuM-evoked inhibitory currents are blocked by the application of ω-agatoxin TK, indicating that these recruited INs express P/Q-type CaV channels, consistent with PV+ BCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zaitsev et al., 2007</xref>). However, we also saw that ω-agatoxin TK also blocked gluatamatergic transmission from SuM inputs, preventing a simple interpretation of these results. Thus, while there is ample evidence that SuM inputs target PV+ BCs in area CA2, we cannot exclude the possibility that other populations of BCs, such as CCK+ INs are also targeted by these inputs. PV+ BCs in the hippocampus have been shown to be modulated by CCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) which would have very interesting implications for the effect of SuM activity in area CA2. Furthermore, it was recently shown that PV+ BCs actively inhibit CCK+ BCs, enabling a complementary perisomatic inhibitory system that allows for brain-state-dependent activity during behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dudok et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that the SuM input to CA2 plays a key role in social novelty discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings are very consistent with the finding that DOR-mediated inhibitory synaptic plasticity of PV+ INs in area CA2 is required for social recognition memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Domínguez et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, exposure to a novel conspecific induces a DOR-mediated plasticity in this same inhibitory network in area CA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leroy et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our finding that SuM input acts via PV+ interneurons fits with previous studies and provides a link between social novelty detection and local CA2 hippocampal inhibitory plasticity.</p><p>Overall, the local circuitry and consequences of SuM input to area CA2 contrasts with the SuM-DG path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hashimotodani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mizumori et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nakanishi et al., 2001</xref>). Previously, we have shown that unlike the SuM-DG synapse, the SuM-CA2 synapse is entirely glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we use both a VGluT2-Cre and SuM-Cre mouse lines to demonstrate how the combination of direct excitation and feedforward inhibition regulates CA2 PN AP firing. Our data shows that SuM activity results in synchronized feedforward inhibition from CA2 to CA1 which decreases CA1 PN firing. While our results are very intriguing given the importance of area CA2 in propagation of hippocampal network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oliva et al., 2016a</xref>), further questions remain. CA2 PNs also receive excitatory input from DG cells via the mossy fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Llorens-Martín et al., 2015</xref>).

More critically, in conditions of elevated cholinergic tone relevant to SuM activity in vivo, CA2 PNs depolarize and fire bursts of APs that can be shaped by SuM input both by controlling AP firing as well as membrane depolarization. While this result was obtained by triggering SuM input stimulation to the onset of burst firing by CA2 PNs, in vivo and acute slice experiments revealed a consistent influence of CA1 PN AP firing by SuM input to area CA2 regardless of the timing of SuM input stimulation relative to CA2 PN AP burst firing. These results demonstrate a powerful control of SuM input over CA2 output when PNs are spontaneously firing bursts of APs, a firing mode that is most efficient at influencing CA1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tirko et al., 2018</xref>). Optogenetic experiments have recently shown that CA2 PNs can drive a strong feedforward inhibition in area CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kohara et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasrallah et al., 2019</xref>). Although SuM input likely does not directly drive feedforward inhibition in area CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), the recruitment of feedforward inhibition in area CA2 by SuM input activation could curtail the time window of spontaneous firing in CA2 PNs and effectively lead to a synchronized drive of feedforward inhibition by area CA2 over area CA1. We postulate that the concerted IPSC that we detect in area CA1 with SuM fiber photostimulation in area CA2 corresponds to the large decrease in firing that is observed in CA1 multi-unit recordings in vivo. Thus, these data provide evidence for a long-range control of CA2 bursting activity and the consequences in downstream area CA1 in conditions of high cholinergic tone that accompanies theta oscillations in vivo during which SuM is active.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relevance of the SuM input to area CA2 for hippocampal oscillations</title><p>The activity of hippocampal neurons is orchestrated by brain rhythms, notably theta and gamma oscillations that are prominent during exploration and linked to the learning and memory functions of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buzsáki and Wang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colgin, 2016</xref>). The SuM is active during these brain states and contributes to theta oscillations in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kirk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirk and McNaughton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kocsis and Vertes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McNaughton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pan and McNaughton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pan and McNaughton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thinschmidt et al., 1995</xref>). Here, we show that the SuM controls area CA2 output to CA1 by recruiting PV +BCs, which are important for both theta and gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuchs et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gulyás et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Korotkova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mann and Mody, 2010</xref>). Through its perisomatic mono-synaptic excitation and PV +BC-mediated di-synaptic inhibition of CA2 PNs, the SuM likely contributes to enforcing theta-locked windows of excitability shaping CA2 PNs output. Area CA2 can influence CA1 activity not only by direct projections but also through its interactions with both CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>) and EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rowland et al., 2013</xref>) which are major contributors to CA1 theta and gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buzsáki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Colgin, 2016</xref>). CA2 axons target both CA1 <italic>stratum oriens</italic> and <italic>radiatum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nasrallah et al., 2019</xref>), thus the CA2 projections to CA1 likely contributes to the theta and slow gamma oscillations observed in these strata in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belluscio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colgin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schomburg et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, CA2 PNs show theta- and gamma-modulation of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernandez-Lamo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oliva et al., 2016b</xref>), and chemogenetic manipulations of their excitability bidirectionally influences hippocampal low gamma power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2018</xref>). Further, chronic block of CA2 output transmission leads to hippocampal hyperexcitability and disrupts CA1 theta phase preference and spatial coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boehringer et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, by providing a theta-locked input shaping CA2 PN activity, the SuM is poised to contribute to oscillatory activity in downstream brain regions receiving CA2 input. Indeed, chemogenetic activation or silencing of SuM glutamatergic neurons respectively increases or decreases theta and gamma power in the EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pedersen et al., 2017</xref>). Further, the SuM is involved in coordinating activity between the prefrontal cortex, the thalamus and area CA1 as evidenced by a loss of theta coherence amongst these regions upon SuM optogenetic silencing during a spatial task requiring action planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Altogether, these studies point to the SuM as a crucial component in the regulation of hippocampal oscillations and our findings shed light on an aspect of this circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Gating of area CA2 activity by PV +INs and significance for pathologies</title><p>The density of PV +INs in area CA2 is strikingly higher than in neighboring areas CA3 and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Botcher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013</xref>). This population of INs has been shown to play a powerful role in controlling the activation of CA2 PNs by CA3 inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nasrallah et al., 2015</xref>). We show in this study that long-range inputs from the SuM can strongly recruit PV +BCs, which in turn inhibit PNs in this area. Hence, both intra-hippocampal inputs from CA3 and long-range inputs from the SuM converge onto PV +INs to control CA2 PN excitability and output.</p><p>Postmortem studies have reported losses of PV +INs in area CA2 in pathological contexts including bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benes et al., 1998</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brady and Mufson, 1997</xref>), and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benes et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knable et al., 2004</xref>). Consistent with these reports, in a mouse model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, a major risk factor for schizophrenia in humans, we found a loss of PV staining and deficit of inhibitory transmission in area CA2 that were accompanied by impairments in social memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Piskorowski et al., 2016</xref>). We postulate that the PV +INs altered during pathological conditions may be the same population of PV +BCs recruited by long-range SuM inputs. Indeed, the DOR-mediated plasticity onto PV +INs is altered in the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome mouse model, and we show here that a fraction of the PV +INs targeted by the SuM also express DOR. Thus, the loss of function of PV +INs in area CA2 could disrupt proper long-range connection between the hippocampus and the hypothalamus and possibly contribute to some of the cognitive impairments observed in schizophrenic patients and animal models. Further, pharmacological mouse models of schizophrenia have reported increased c-fos immunoreactivity in the SuM as well as memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Castañé et al., 2015</xref>). Although several alterations in these models of schizophrenia could lead to deficits of hippocampal-dependent behavior, abnormalities of the SuM projection onto area CA2 appear as a potential mechanism that warrants further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

Csf2rb2-cre male mice from 3 to 6 months of age were anaesthetized using 500 mg/kg Avertin. pAAV.DIO.hChR2(H134R).EYFP was injected into the SuM (−2.7 mm AP, +0.4 mm ML, −5.0 mm DV) using a 10 μL Hamilton microsyringe (701LT, Hamilton) with a beveled 33 gauge needle (NF33BL, World Precision Instruments (WPI)). A microsyringe pump (UMP3, WPI) with controller (Micro4, WPI) were used to set the speed of the injection (100 nl/min). The needle was slowly lowered to the target site and remained in place for 5 min prior to start of the injection and the needle was removed 10 min after infusion was complete. Following virus injection, a custom-built screw-driven microdrive containing six independently adjustable nichrome tetrodes (14 μm diameter), gold-plated to an impedance of 200–250 kΩ was implanted, with a subset of tetrodes targeting CA1, and an optic fiber (200 μm core diameter, NA = 0.22) targeting CA2 (−1.9 mm AP, ±2.2 mm ML, −1.6 mm DV). Following recovery, the tetrodes were slowly lowered over several days to CA1 pyramidal cell layer, identified by characteristic local field potential patterns (theta and sharp-wave ripples) and high amplitude multiunit activity. During the adjustment period the animal was habituated every day to a small box in which recording and stimulation were performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo recording protocol</title><p>Recording was commenced following tetrodes reaching CA1. To examine the impact of SuM terminal stimulation in CA2 the mice were returned to the small familiar box and trains of 10 light pulses (473 nm, 10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> and pulse width 50 ms) were delivered to the CA2 at 10 Hz. The pulse train was repeated every 10 s for at least 20 times as the animals freely explored the box. Multiunit activity was recorded using a DigitalLynx 4SX recording system running Cheetah v.5.6.0 acquisition software (Neuralynx). Broadband signals from each tetrode were filtered between 600 and 6000 Hz and recorded continuously at 32 kHz. Recording sites were later verified histologically with electrolytic lesions as described above and the position of the optic fiber was also verified from the track.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vivo data analysis</title><p>Spike and event timestamps corresponding to onset of each laser pulse were imported into Matlab (MathWorks) and spikes which occurred 50 ms before and 100 ms after each laser pulse were extracted. Raster plots were generated using a 1 ms bin size. Similar results were obtained using 5 ms and 10 ms bin size (data not shown). Firing rate histograms were calculated by dividing total number of spikes in each time bin by that bin’s duration. Each firing rate histogram was normalized by converting it into z-score values. Mean standard deviation values for the z-score calculation were taken from pre-laser pulse time period. To average the response across all mice, for each tetrode the firing rate in each bin was normalized to the average rate in the pre-laser period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Immunochemistry and cell identification</title><p>Midbrains containing the injection site were examined post-hoc to ensure that infection was restricted to the SuM.</p><p>Post-hoc reconstruction of neuronal morphology and SuM axonal projections were performed on slices and midbrain tissue following overnight incubation in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Midbrain sections were re-sliced sagittally to 100 µm thick sections. Slices were permeabilized with 0.2% triton in PBS and blocked overnight with 3% goat serum in PBS with 0.2% triton. Primary antibody (Life technologies) incubation was carried out in 3% goat serum in PBS overnight at 4°C. Channelrhodopsin-2 was detected by chicken primary antibody to GFP (Life technologies) (1:10,000 dilution) and an alexa488-conjugated goat-anti chick secondary. Other primary antibodies used were mouse anti-RGS14 (Neuromab) (1:300 dilution), rabbit anti- PCP4 (Sigma) (1:600 dilution), guinea pig anti-VGluT2 antibody (Milipore) (1:10,000 dilution), rabbit anti-parvalbumin antibody (Swant) (1:2000 dilution). Alexa-546-conjugated streptavidin (Life technologies), secondary antibodies and far-red neurotrace (Life technologies) incubations were carried out in block solution for 4 hr at room temperature. Images were collected with a Zeiss 710 laser-scanning confocal microscope.</p><p>Reconstructed neurons were classified as either PNs or INs based on the extension and localization of their dendrites and axons. PNs were classified as deep (closest to <italic>stratum oriens</italic>) or superficial (closest to <italic>stratum radiatum</italic>) based on the radial position of their soma in the pyramidal layer. CA1, CA2, and CA3 PNs were identified based on their somatic localization, dendritic arborization and presence of thorny excrescences (TE). Among INs with somas located in the pyramidal layer (<italic>stratum pyramidale</italic>, SP), discrimination between BCs and non-BCs was achieved based on the restriction of their axons to SP or not, respectively. When available, firing patterns upon injection of depolarizing current step injection, action potential (AP) half-width, amount of repolarizing sag current upon hyperpolarization from −70 mV to −100 mV by current step injection, membrane resistance (R<sub>M</sub>) and capacitance (C<sub>M</sub>) were additionally used for cell identification. CA2 and CA3a PNs as well as superficial and deep PNs displayed similar firing patterns, AP width, sag current, R<sub>M</sub> and C<sub>M</sub>; the only statistically difference being a larger R<sub>M</sub> of CA3a compared to CA2 PNs which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, INs had faster firing rates, shorter AP width, higher R<sub>M</sub> and lower C<sub>M</sub> than PNs. BCs further differed from non-BCs by the presence of a larger sag potential. All recorded neurons that could not be unequivocally identified as PNs or INs were excluded from analysis. SuM connectivity to each neuronal population was quantified by dividing the number of cells that displayed a post-synaptic response to SuM input stimulation by the total number of cells sampled for each neuronal population across all recording sessions with successful SuM-CA2 transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p> Electrophysiological recordings were analyzed using IGORpro (Wavemetrics) and Clampfit (Molecular devices) software. For accurate measurements of the kinetics and latencies of post-synaptic responses, the following detection process was used. For each cell, average traces were used to create a template waveform that was then fitted to individual traces and measurements were performed on the fitted traces. When only amplitudes of responses were needed, traces were baselined and amplitudes were simply measured at the peak of the responses. Firing adaptation indexes were computed as the ratio of the initial firing rate (instantaneous firing frequency of the first spikes) over the steady-state firing rate (average instantaneous firing frequency for spikes occurring after 500 ms in the 1 second-long current step). Results are reported ± SEM. Statistical significance was assessed using χ² test, Student’s T test, Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, one-way or two-way ANOVA where appropriate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Equipment for the IPNP mouse husbandry facility was funded by the <italic>Région Ile de France</italic>.

Given the importance of the mono vs. disynaptic innervation of different types of cells, the authors should go beyond the TTX experiments (as TTX would block a disynaptic EPSC) and also use 4-AP to recover the TTX blocked current to unequivocally prove that they inputs are monosynaptic.</p><p>4.

The authors identified direct excitatory and indirect inhibitory drive from SuM inputs on CA2 pyramidal neurons and showed that direct excitatory drive impinges on PV-positive basket cells. The overall effect of the input on CA2 activity was an increased precision of APs. The study also suggests that the input from the CA2 drives inhibition in the CA1 area. The study provides very interesting and new information about the cellular properties of SuM input in the CA2 area. This is an important question given the increasing importance of SuM inputs in social memory encoding. The study is timely, currently we have very limited data about the features and exact cellular profile of this input. The study is using elegant technical approaches o answer the central question of the study. While the study is addressing an important question and provides novel data, the authors central claim about the role of feedforward inhibition would need to be strengthened by the addition of experiments addressing how E-I balance changes in trains in individual neurons and how this can be linked to changes in the temporal precision of synaptically evoked APs.</p><p>Action potentials are evoked with a current step. Since the study is focused on the network effects of feedforward inhibition, it would be useful to see how the properties of synaptically evoked action potentials change. In the cortex and in the CA1 feed forward inhibition was shown to limit the temporal summation of excitatory inputs which lead to decrease in AP jitter (Gabernet et al., 2005, Pouille and Scanziani, 2001). In order to map these dynamics APs should be evoked via synaptic stimulation and not through current injection.</p><p>The authors show recordings of monosynaptic EPSCs in pyramidal cells and interneurons.

In addition, the authors provide evidence that modulation of the CA2 neurons by SuM afferents affects the activity pattern of CA1 neurons. Specifically, the study reveals that the 'functional' connectivity between SuM and CA2 is mainly mediated by the regulation of PV+ basket cells that are involved in the feed forward inhibition of CA2 principal neurons. This study is also relevant in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders where PV+ IN density in the CA2 area is preferentially reduced.</p><p>It would be good if some results and implications are further clarified for better understanding in the Discussion section:</p><p>1. The results indicate that SuM recruits a feed forward inhibition onto CA2 PNs, which contributes to the shaping of CA2 AP firing. However, it is not entirely intuitive how the feed forward inhibition of CA2 PNs by SuM also reduces CA1 activity, as CA2 has also been known to recruit strong feed forward inhibition onto CA1. This would intuitively suggest that decrease in CA2 activity by photostimulation of SuM afferents will in turn decrease the feed forward inhibition by CA2 onto CA1, and thereby increase CA1 activity. However, the results suggest otherwise. Would this be suggestive of a stronger direct excitatory projection from CA2 to CA1 PNs that is more dominant than the feed forward inhibition of CA1 PNs by CA2? This may be a good point to further elaborate on in the Discussion section, so that the effect of SuM-CA2 connectivity on CA1 output becomes clearer.</p><p>2. In the introduction section line 44, it is written that 'CA2 neurons do not undergo NMDA-mediated synaptic plasticity'. This may not be always the case; rather it may be better to rephrase 'NMDA-mediated' as 'high frequency stimulation-induced'. It has been shown previously that NK1 receptor activation by pharmacological application of substance P in hippocampal slices triggers a slow onset NMDA-dependent LTP in CA2 neurons by high frequency stimulation of CA3 afferents to CA2 (Dasgupta et al., 2017).</p><p>3. Line 250: &quot;BC transmission is insensitive to MOR activation (Glickfeld et al., 2008).&quot;</p><p>Was the Glickfeld study done in CA2 neurons? If not, it would be good to show that PV+ CA2 BCs are also sensitive to DAMGO and to what degree?</p><p>The experiment shows that IPSC in PNs are inhibited by DAMGO that should have enhanced light induced EPSCs if PV+ BCs are responsible for feed forward inhibition. But it seems that has not been observed. What are direct EPSCs – electrical stimulation of CA3-CA2 synapses?</p><p>4. Overall, the results seem to suggest that SuM stimulation would induce a net inhibition (?) of CA2 PNs by recruiting interneurons (INs). However, the role played by the direct glutamatergic connections from SuM to CA2 PNs is not entirely clear. Is it less prominent due to sparse SuM-PN projections compared to SuM-IN connections in the CA2 area? It may be good to elaborate on this a bit in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Robert et al., demonstrated that medial SuM send glutamatergic projections to the hippocampal CA2 region, and stimulation of these projections exert mixed excitatory and inhibitory responses in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, they showed that SuM-CA2 circuits recruit local PV basket cells to provide feedforward inhibition to CA2 pyramidal cells, which increases the precision of action potential firing in conditions of low and high cholinergic tone. Finally, they performed in vivo electrophysiology recording to show that stimulation of SuM-CA2 projections can influence CA1 activity. Overall, this is a well-designed study, and the quality of the data is high. The authors performed impressive amount of electrophysiology recording in acute slices and provided detailed information on how long-distance SuM projection neurons regulate CA2 pyramidal cell activity. These findings provide insights into how SuM activity directly acts on the local hippocampal circuit to modulate social memory encoding. However, there are some concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. The authors performed CAV-based retrograde tracing and demonstrated that medial SuM sends glutamatergic projections to CA2. These results are in contrast to a recent study (Li et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2020) showing that lateral SuM neurons send dense projections to both CA2 and DG, and the SuM-DG projections release both glutamate and GABA to dentate granule cells. Based on the results from this study and the study from Li et al., does that mean medial SuM neurons are different from lateral SuM neurons in terms of the neurotransmitters they release? The authors need to clarify this point and provide additional ephys data to show that pyramidal cells do not receive direct GABAergic inputs upon stimulation of SuM-CA2 projections using high-chloride internal solution to reveal the IPSCs.</p><p>2. The authors claim that SuM-CA2 circuits recruit local PV basket cells to provide feedforward inhibition to CA2 pyramidal cells. While the data presented are supportive, they are not entirely convincing. Specifically, MOR agonist DAMGO is not specific to PV BCs. Though DAMGO has a preferential effect on PV cells over CCK cells, other interneuron types have been shown to be sensitive to DAMGO manipulation. Therefore, these results are subject to alternative interpretation that other types of CA2 local interneurons maybe involved. To show whether PV BCs is the sole interneuron subtype involved, the authors may use a P/Q type calcium channel blocker, ω-agatoxin-TK, as P/Q Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are unique to PV BCs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition of PV BCs was used, but light-evoked IPSCs are not completely blocked. The authors claimed this could be due to partial silencing of PV BCs. However, there is no evidence showing the efficacy of 10µM CNO application in suppressing CA2 PV basket cell activity. These data should be provided in order to draw such conclusion.</p><p>3. CCK basket cells are known to excite PV basket cells (Lee et al., 2011) via a pertussin-toxin sensitive pathway. Is it possible that SuM-CA2 mediated excitation of PV basket cells includes a CCK intermediary? This point should be discussed.</p><p>4. The in vivo recording data showed that SuM-CA2 circuit stimulation decreases the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells followed by increased firing rate in these cells. Then the authors performed slice recording and showed that the reduced firing rate of CA1 neurons in vivo is likely caused by increased inhibitory inputs onto CA1 pyramidal cells. Figure 7G-H seems to explain the reduced events in the first phase of the tetrode recordings, but not the rebound part. Is there some circuit component that is lost when making slices? Furthermore, what does SuM-CA2 circuit stimulation do to theta/γ rhythms in CA1? These data should be available in the tetrode recordings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63352.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study describes the properties of inputs from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) to the CA2 area of the hippocampus.

The authors would need to show the effect of SuM stimulation on on synaptically triggered APs and not only on Aps evoked with a current step.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that establishing the role of SuM input in controlling synaptically-driven AP firing is most relevant. However, unlike other hippocampal pyramidal neurons, studying synaptically-evoked action potential firing in CA2 PNs is very difficult with optimal slice health and without blocking inhibitory transmission since CA2 PNs have low intrinsic excitability and receive strong inhibition as detailed below. Because of their low membrane resistance and very hyperpolarized membrane potential, CA2 PNs have an intrinsically low excitability which makes it difficult for any given input to cause AP firing in basal conditions. Furthermore, stimulation of CA3 axons evokes a very large feedforward inhibition that strongly prevents action potential firing. Likewise, distal dendritic inputs are extremely attenuated and also rarely lead to AP firing under physiological conditions. For these reasons we used current step injection-induced AP firing as a mean to induce spiking and test the effect of SuM input stimulation. Admittedly, this experimental design is somewhat artificial. We have previously discovered that CA2 PNs spontaneously depolarize and fire burst of action potentials under conditions of elevated cholinergic tone. It is known that the properties of these burst are strongly dependent on both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (Robert et al., 2020), and also the SuM is most likely to be active during theta rhythm, when cholinergic tone is elevated in the hippocampus. Therefore, we examined how the carbachol-induced bursting of CA2 PNs was altered by SuM input stimulation. We think that the results presented in Figure 7 are directly relevant to the reviewers’ request.</p><p>We acknowledge that this experimental design does not allow for the contribution of specific inputs to AP bursting to be established. Thus, we performed additional experiments using electrical stimulation of axonal inputs in SR (CA3 axons) or SLM (EC axons) paired with SuM inputs stimulation. This new data is presented in Figure 2 and described in the text (pages 7-8). Unfortunately, for the vast majority of our slices, we were unable to evoke AP firing with reasonable electrical stimulation intensities, as is very typical for CA2 PNs. However, we were able to determine how SuM input summates with SR and SLM synaptic inputs, as well as determine how the summation ratio of these separate inputs is altered by SuM activity. Notably, we observed a reduction in PSP summation from both SR and SLM repeated stimulation when paired with SuM input activation, which is consistent with a shunting effect of the perisomatic-targeting basket cells recruited by SuM to drive inhibition in CA2 PNs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The change in the balance of EPCs and IPSCs in a train should be demonstrated in a single cell.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point which is very important for the interpretation of the data with repeated SuM input stimulation presented in Figures 6, 7 and 8. In supplemental figure 4 we present IPSCs and EPSCs all recorded in the same CA2 PNs in the presence and absence of carbachol (described in pages 14-15). In short, we observed a consistent short-term depression of both SuM-driven monosynaptic EPSCs and di-synaptic IPSCs in CA2 PNs under basal conditions, with the resulting E/I ratio being stable over the train of SuM stimuli. Application of carbachol reduced initial amplitudes of both EPSCs and IPSCs while decreasing their short-term depression, resulting in a decrease of E/I ratio suggesting that the SuM inhibitory influence over CA2 PNs is even stronger and more sustained in conditions of elevated cholinergic tone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The properties of monosynaptic/disynaptic events should be compared and the lack of direct GABAergic input from the SuM demonstrated. The authors should quantify the delay time to light-evoked IPSCs to address whether the SuM-CA2 inputs are forming monosynaptic or disynaptic GABAergic connections to pyramidal neurons, as it is possible SuM neurons co-release glutamate and GABA to CA2. Given the importance of the mono vs. disynaptic innervation of different types of cells, the authors should go beyond the TTX experiments (as TTX would block a disynaptic EPSC) and also use 4-AP to recover the TTX blocked current to unequivocally prove that they inputs are monosynaptic.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are completely correct in asking for these experiments in order to confirm that indeed the SuM-CA2 inputs are entirely glutamatergic. All of these points are crucial to our investigation. In fact, we have already performed all of these requested experiments and analysis. These data were published as an extended data figure in Chen et al., <italic>Nature</italic> 2020. The exclusive mono-synaptic glutamatergic nature of the SuM-CA2 transmission was demonstrated and directly compared to the SuM-DG synapse with measurements of EPSC vs IPSC onset latency and application of TTX with 4AP or NBQX + APV. We regret not summarizing more clearly in the text of this manuscript our previous findings and have added a description of these results to our manuscript (page 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The preferential role of PV+ cells should be shown with a more selective pharmacological approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the advice from reviewer #3 and performed a series of experiments using the P/Q voltage-gated calcium channel blocker ω-agatoxin TK. Block of these channels is predicted to only inhibit Gaba release from PV+ interneurons. These results of these experiments are in figure 5 and described page 12. Our experiments showed a near-complete block of SuM-driven IPSCs in CA2 PNs consistent with PV+ INs mediating this feedforward inhibition. However, the interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that application of ω-agatoxin TK also reduced glutamatergic transmission at the SuM-CA2 synapse. If we assume that the SuM-IN synapse has a similar population of channels, then part of the reduction in inhibitory transmission may not be due to PV+ IN specificity, but by the reduction in glutamate release. While these results are not fully conclusive proof, we have still included them, as they further characterize the SuM input.</p><p>As for the chemogenetic inhibition of PV+ INs, we took the reviewers advice and provided more direct evidence that 10 µM CNO is not sufficiently suppressing CA2 PV basket cell activity. We performed recordings of PV+ INs in area CA2 and measured changes in the intrinsic properties and action potential firing of these cells before and following CNO application. We did observe a small hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, however we still observed AP firing in several of the cells, indicating that this hyperpolarization is insufficient to fully silence PV+ INs. This is shown in supplemental figure 3 and described on page 11. GiDREADD can also act on pre-synaptic terminals, so it is not entirely conclusive if the PV+ cells that fire action potentials still release GABA. However, we feel that in combination with the incomplete expression of the GiDREADD in all PV+ interneurons, and the residual AP firing, that the 10 µM CNO is not entirely effective at suppressing PV+ IN activity in our experiments.</p><p>We would like to mention that the expression of DOR receptors has been shown to be expressed in 35% of PV+ BCs in the hippocampus (Erbs, 2012) and furthermore, we have shown that transmission exclusively from PV+ cells in area CA2 undergoes a DOR-dependent depression (Piskorowski and Chevaleyre, 2013) that can be induced by application of DPDPE. We conclude that the effect of DPDPE on SuM transmission is compelling evidence that these inputs target PV+ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

In basal conditions, feedback inhibition is not at play because stimulation of the SuM input evokes only small amplitude EPSPs that remain subthreshold in CA2 PNs, as documented in Figures 1 and 2. Indeed, we never observed SuM-evoked AP firing from CA2 PNs in our recordings (n = 0 out of 78, Figure 3). However, when inducing action potential firing in CA2 PNs either by current injection (Figure 6) or CCh application (Figure 7), the contribution of feedback inhibition becomes very relevant. Indeed, it is likely that CA2 PNs recruit not only feedback inhibition (Mercer, 2012a, Mercer, 2012b) but also recurrent excitation (Cui, 2013, Hitti, 2014, Okamoto, 2019), both of which could impact the temporal precision of APs. In the case of current step injection-induced firing, the contribution of feedback inhibition and recurrent excitation to reducing AP jitter can be examined with our pharmacology experiments: in the GABA receptors blocked condition (Figure 6), the effect of SuM input stimulation on both the AP latency and jitter is abolished, thereby indicating that the main factor imposing the initial AP delay and constraining AP jitter is SuM-driven feedforward inhibition. This is because, at least for the first AP evoked by current step injection in the single CA2 PN recorded from, it is reasonable to assume that other CA2 PNs were not actively firing thus removing the possibility of feedback inhibition and recurrent excitation from the equation. Furthermore, the small probability of PNs to be connected (1.4%) and the small size of CA2-CA2 EPSP (~0.5mV) (Okamoto, 2019) makes it very unlikely that recurrent excitation plays any role when a single PN is depolarized. The problem becomes much more complicated when considering the CCh-induced AP burst firing conditions, as many CA2 PNs likely burst fire somewhat independently of the single CA2 PN recorded in any given experiment. Therefore, feedback inhibition and recurrent excitation are to be expected in these conditions, thereby potentially contributing to the temporal precision of AP firing in the recorded CA2 PN. Unfortunately, typical pharmacology blocking GABA or glutamate receptors is not suitable here as the CCh-induced AP burst firing pattern of CA2 PNs relies on intact synaptic transmission (Robert, 2020), thus making the examination of the respective roles of feedforward versus feedback inhibition in these conditions difficult to probe experimentally. Nevertheless, we deem reasonable to interpret our data with SuM input stimulation during CCh-induced spontaneous AP burst firing as follows: by recruiting perisomatic-targeted feedforward inhibition on most CA2 PNs, SuM input stimulation might effectively enforce a restricted time window during which CA2 PNs can undergo or sustain AP burst firing, thereby limiting independent burst firing from individual CA2 PNs and instead shaping a synchronized output from many CA2 PNs subsequently driving feedforward inhibition over area CA1 as shown in Figures 7 and 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The article brings to light the functional consequences of the activity of SuM afferents terminating at CA2 neurons in the hippocampus using a combination of a variety of methods like whole-cell voltage clamp and optogenetics.

The results indicate that SuM recruits a feed forward inhibition onto CA2 PNs, which contributes to the shaping of CA2 AP firing. However, it is not entirely intuitive how the feed forward inhibition of CA2 PNs by SuM also reduces CA1 activity, as CA2 has also been known to recruit strong feed forward inhibition onto CA1. This would intuitively suggest that decrease in CA2 activity by photostimulation of SuM afferents will in turn decrease the feed forward inhibition by CA2 onto CA1, and thereby increase CA1 activity. However, the results suggest otherwise. Would this be suggestive of a stronger direct excitatory projection from CA2 to CA1 PNs that is more dominant than the feed forward inhibition of CA1 PNs by CA2? This may be a good point to further elaborate on in the Discussion section, so that the effect of SuM-CA2 connectivity on CA1 output becomes clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is correct in that the connection between CA2 and CA1 is predominantly excitatory. CA2 PNs make a powerful excitatory connection with CA1 PNs (Chevaleyre and Siegelbaum, 2010, Kohara et al., 2014). CA2 PNs also drive feedforward inhibition onto CA1 PNs (Boehringer et al., 2017, Nasrallah et al., 2019). Here we show that under conditions that resemble active exploration (high cholinergic tone) the SuM-CA2-CA1 elicits a reliable poly-synaptic IPSC in CA1 PNs (Figure 8), as well as an occasional poly-synaptic CA1 EPSC. Our data does not directly show that SuM feedforward inhibition of CA2 causes a drop in CA2-CA1 excitation underlying the decreased CA1 activity following SuM-CA2 stimulation. Instead, our data shows that SuM inhibition of CA2 yields synchronized feedforward inhibition from CA2 to CA1 which decreases CA1 activity. We appreciate the complexity of this idea and have done our best to elaborate in the discussion (page 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the introduction section line 44, it is written that 'CA2 neurons do not undergo NMDA-mediated synaptic plasticity'. This may not be always the case; rather it may be better to rephrase 'NMDA-mediated' as 'high frequency stimulation-induced'. It has been shown previously that NK1 receptor activation by pharmacological application of substance P in hippocampal slices triggers a slow onset NMDA-dependent LTP in CA2 neurons by high frequency stimulation of CA3 afferents to CA2 (Dasgupta et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this clarification. In the text, “NMDA-mediated” has been replaced by “high frequency stimulation-induced” as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Line 250: &quot;BC transmission is insensitive to MOR activation (Glickfeld et al., 2008).&quot;</p><p>Was the Glickfeld study done in CA2 neurons? If not, it would be good to show that PV+ CA2 BCs are also sensitive to DAMGO and to what degree?</p><p>The experiment shows that IPSC in PNs are inhibited by DAMGO that should have enhanced light induced EPSCs if PV+ BCs are responsible for feed forward inhibition. But it seems that has not been observed. What are direct EPSCs – electrical stimulation of CA3-CA2 synapses?</p></disp-quote><p>In the experiments where we applied DAMGO, the EPSCs were recorded in presence of GABAR blockers. Therefore, any change in GABA transmission would not affect the light induced EPSC.</p><p>The Glickfeld study was performed in CA1 only. However, expression of MOR mRNA is very strong in area CA2 and a large fraction of PV+ INs are also positive for MOR throughout the hippocampus (Ralf et al., Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2004). We haven’t directly monitored the effect of DAMGO on PV+ transmission in area CA2. However, in an ongoing study, we stimulated CA3 inputs and monitors the electrically evoked IPSCs in CA2 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We found that DAMGO application strongly reduces IPSCs (by ~75%) and completely occludes subsequent effect of the DOR agonist DPDPE. We are confident that DPDPE is acting solely on PV+ cells in area CA2. Therefore, from these results we can conclude that PV+ INs in area CA2 are also strongly sensitive to DAMGO as they are known to be in area CA1.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63352-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Overall, the results seem to suggest that SuM stimulation would induce a net inhibition (?) of CA2 PNs by recruiting interneurons (INs). However, the role played by the direct glutamatergic connections from SuM to CA2 PNs is not entirely clear. Is it less prominent due to sparse SuM-PN projections compared to SuM-IN connections in the CA2 area? It may be good to elaborate on this a bit in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the combined excitation and feedforward inhibition from the SuM to area CA2 is acting together to coordinate the timing of CA2 PN output. We have expanded this explanation in the discussion (page 18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Robert et al. demonstrated that medial SuM send glutamatergic projections to the hippocampal CA2 region, and stimulation of these projections exert mixed excitatory and inhibitory responses in CA2 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, they showed that SuM-CA2 circuits recruit local PV basket cells to provide feedforward inhibition to CA2 pyramidal cells, which increases the precision of action potential firing in conditions of low and high cholinergic tone. Finally, they performed in vivo electrophysiology recording to show that stimulation of SuM-CA2 projections can influence CA1 activity. Overall, this is a well-designed study, and the quality of the data is high. The authors performed impressive amount of electrophysiology recording in acute slices and provided detailed information on how long-distance SuM projection neurons regulate CA2 pyramidal cell activity. These findings provide insights into how SuM activity directly acts on the local hippocampal circuit to modulate social memory encoding. However, there are some concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>1. The authors performed CAV-based retrograde tracing and demonstrated that medial SuM sends glutamatergic projections to CA2. These results are in contrast to a recent study (Li et al., eLife 2020) showing that lateral SuM neurons send dense projections to both CA2 and DG, and the SuM-DG projections release both glutamate and GABA to dentate granule cells. Based on the results from this study and the study from Li et al., does that mean medial SuM neurons are different from lateral SuM neurons in terms of the neurotransmitters they release? The authors need to clarify this point and provide additional ephys data to show that pyramidal cells do not receive direct GABAergic inputs upon stimulation of SuM-CA2 projections using high-chloride internal solution to reveal the IPSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point, and as we have detailed above, the experiments directly comparing the SuM transmission into the DG and area CA2 have been published as a supplemental figure in Chen et al., <italic>Nature</italic> 2020. As the reviewer mentions, in that publication we present multiple lines of evidence supporting the premise that the CA2-projecting and DG-projecting cells in the SuM are from different populations and use different neurotransmitter modalities. These results are supported by prior histological results by Soussi et al., EJN, 2010 that show the CA2-projecting SuMM fibers do not co-express GAD65 unlike the DG-projecting SUML fibers that express both VGLUT2 and GAD65.</p><p>In the Li et al., paper (<italic>eLife</italic>, 2020) the authors show that AAV5-DiO.eYFP injected into the SuM in a Vgat-cre mouse line results in fibers in area CA2. These results lack control data showing the specificity of the AAV5 viral vector in the vgat-cre line (co-labelling with Gad65/67…). In our experience, it is very easy to get non-specific expression of AA5 vectors in area CA2. In fact, we use this problem to our advantage in Dominguez et al., <italic>Cell Reports</italic> 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors claim that SuM-CA2 circuits recruit local PV basket cells to provide feedforward inhibition to CA2 pyramidal cells. While the data presented are supportive, they are not entirely convincing. Specifically, MOR agonist DAMGO is not specific to PV BCs. Though DAMGO has a preferential effect on PV cells over CCK cells, other interneuron types have been shown to be sensitive to DAMGO manipulation. Therefore, these results are subject to alternative interpretation that other types of CA2 local interneurons maybe involved. To show whether PV BCs is the sole interneuron subtype involved, the authors may use a P/Q type calcium channel blocker, ω-agatoxin-TK, as P/Q Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are unique to PV BCs. In addition, chemogenetic inhibition of PV BCs was used, but light-evoked IPSCs are not completely blocked. The authors claimed this could be due to partial silencing of PV BCs. However, there is no evidence showing the efficacy of 10µM CNO application in suppressing CA2 PV basket cell activity. These data should be provided in order to draw such conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we used ω-agatoxin-TK to explore whether PV+ BCs are the sole population of interneurons. Consistent with PV+ cells being the primary population underlying the feedforward inhibition onto CA2 PNs, we saw a nearly complete block of light-evoked IPSCs. However, we also examined the direct excitatory SuM-CA2 glutamatergic synapse and found that application of ω-agatoxin-TK resulted in a 50% block of glutamatergic transmission. Thus, if we assume that the glutamatergic SuM-IN synapse is also reduced then the reduction of feedforward IPSC may not be because of the specificity of P/Q Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel expression of PV+ cells, but because the SuM glutamatergic transmission is reduced. While these results do not provide the definitive result we were hoping for, we have still included them in Figure 5 to be considered in parallel with the other experiments (pages 11-12).</p><p>As for the chemogenetic inhibition of PV BCs, we took the reviewers advice and provided more direct evidence that 10 µM CNO is not sufficiently suppressing CA2 PV basket cell activity. We performed recordings of PV+ INs in area CA2 and measured changes in the intrinsic properties and action potential firing of these cells before and following CNO application. We did observe a small hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, however in we still observed AP firing in several of the cells, indicating that this hyperpolarization is insufficient to fully silence PV+ INs. This is shown in supplemental figure 3 and described page 11. GiDREADD can also act on pre-synaptic terminals, so it is not entirely conclusive if the PV cells that fire action potentials still release GABA. However, we feel that in combination with the incomplete expression of the GiDREADD in all PV+ interneurons, and the residual AP firing, that the 10 µM CNO is not entirely effective at suppressing PV-BC activity in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. CCK basket cells are known to excite PV basket cells (Lee et al., 2011) via a pertussin-toxin sensitive pathway. Is it possible that SuM-CA2 mediated excitation of PV basket cells includes a CCK intermediary? This point should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very intriguing point, and we thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Lee et al. 2011 demonstrates that CCK application results in a depolarization of PV+ cells via a nonselective calcium conductance linked to intracellular calcium store release. The idea that CCK release would potentially enhance ability of SuM inputs to recruit PV+ cells is quite interesting and have added this to the discussion (page 19). Similarly, we have also mentioned the other intriguing finding that CCK cells actively inhibit PV+ basket cells (Dodek 2021), presenting two ways in which CCK cells may be acting indirectly to modulate SuM input to area CA2 (page 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The in vivo recording data showed that SuM-CA2 circuit stimulation decreases the firing rate of CA1 pyramidal cells followed by increased firing rate in these cells. Then the authors performed slice recording and showed that the reduced firing rate of CA1 neurons in vivo is likely caused by increased inhibitory inputs onto CA1 pyramidal cells. Figure 7G-H seems to explain the reduced events in the first phase of the tetrode recordings, but not the rebound part. Is there some circuit component that is lost when making slices? Furthermore, what does SuM-CA2 circuit stimulation do to theta/γ rhythms in CA1? These data should be available in the tetrode recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point, and a central flaw in acute slice physiology. There are definitely circuit components that are lost when making transverse hippocampal slices. We have added two paragraphs to the Discussion section detailing the potential role of SuM-CA2 input to theta and γ oscillations (pages 19-21).</p><p>The in vivo data in the paper was based on short stimulation pulses in resting animals where theta and γ are minimal. Thus, further examination of theta and γ requires further distinct experiments. As this manuscript elucidates the local circuitry underlying the SuM input in area CA2, and the overall effect of SuM activity on action potential firing in this region, further examination of network oscillations is outside the scope of this work.</p><p>However, we still went through all of our data to try to determine if there is a large apparent effect of SuM activity in theta / γ. Because of the current Covid-19 crisis, we have not been able to continue with the majority of our experimental work for this project, so we can only present preliminary data from two animals with acceptable trials, tetrode locations (in CA1), fiber placement over the area CA2, and properly targeted virus in the SuM. We present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> our very preliminary results of CA1 LFP with and without optical stimulation on a circular linear track. As the mice ran on the track, we applied a protocol with 1 minute ON, 1 minute OFF of 10 Hz light stim in CA2. For analysis, we calculated the PSD from the CA1 LFP with the middle 40” of all laser ON periods and the middle 40” of all laser OFF periods, then averaged. Power across the theta (4-12Hz) and γ (30-90 Hz) bands was normalized to the total power in the 0-4 Hz band for each trial, then averaged across the two animals.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63352-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As visible in the wavelet spectragrams across the whole trial, we do not see any obvious change in theta or γ power when the laser is on.
