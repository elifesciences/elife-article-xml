While the effects of early-life stress on neuronal function have been well-described, we still know very little about the contribution of non-neuronal brain cells. Investigating the complex interactions between distinct brain cell types is critical to fully understand how cellular changes manifest as behavioural deficits following early-life stress. Here, using male and female mice we report that early-life stress induces anxiety-like behaviour and fear generalisation in an amygdala-dependent learning and memory task. These behavioural changes were associated with impaired synaptic plasticity, increased neural excitability, and astrocyte hypofunction. Genetic perturbation of amygdala astrocyte function by either reducing astrocyte calcium activity or reducing astrocyte network function was sufficient to replicate cellular, synaptic, and fear memory generalisation associated with early-life stress. Our data reveal a role of astrocytes in tuning emotionally salient memory and provide mechanistic links between early-life stress, astrocyte hypofunction, and behavioural deficits.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glial cell</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd><kwd>early-life stress</kwd><kwd>engram</kwd><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>neuron–glia interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>478629</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy-Royal</surname><given-names>Ciaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2021-03211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy-Royal</surname><given-names>Ciaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>296562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy-Royal</surname><given-names>Ciaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>309889</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy-Royal</surname><given-names>Ciaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007671</institution-id><institution>Fondation du CHUM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy-Royal</surname><given-names>Ciaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100021783</institution-id><institution>Fondation Courtois</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy-Royal</surname><given-names>Ciaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Réseau Québecois sur le Suicide, les troubles de l'humeur, et les troubles associées</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murphy-Royal</surname><given-names>Ciaran</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Depaauw-Holt</surname><given-names>Lewis R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Master's Scholarships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Adedipe</surname><given-names>Ifeoluwa I</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaugeois</surname><given-names>Juliette</given-names></name><name><surname>Rogers</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Investigator NARSAD;

We have gleaned tremendous insight into disorders of stress from these studies, yet the links between stress, brain circuits, and behaviour remain tenuous. Within this framework, the contribution of distinct brain cells, including astrocytes, remains largely untested. Glial cells, which comprise approximately half the cell population in the brain, have been shown to directly regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murphy-Royal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murphy-Royal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henneberger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Papouin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Covelo and Araque, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Panatier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Panatier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lefton et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guttenplan et al., 2024</xref>), thereby influencing many discrete behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nagai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wahis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doron et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kol et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2024</xref>). Despite research suggesting important roles for astrocytes in regulating affective states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wahis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>), fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>), reward and addiction behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doron et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kruyer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kruyer et al., 2019</xref>), whether astrocyte dysfunction prompts stress-induced behavioural impairments remains poorly understood.</p><p>First, we characterised whether ELS influenced stress hormone levels across our experimental paradigm from pre-stress until young adulthood. We report that that ELS induces a transient increase in blood glucocorticoids that peaks during late adolescence/young adulthood. Turning to behaviour, this increase in glucocorticoid levels was associated with anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus maze.</p><p>Next, we set out to determine whether ELS influenced cognitive function using an amygdala-dependent threat discrimination assay. This task was specifically chosen to test the effects of ELS on amygdala function as this brain region is involved with threat detection and associative learning that is acutely sensitive to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guadagno et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guadagno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ressler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Malter Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>). We employed an auditory discriminative fear conditioning paradigm that requires synaptic plasticity changes in the lateral amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim and Cho, 2017</xref>) and found that ELS impairs discriminative fear memory, resulting in fear generalisation. These hormonal and behavioural changes were associated with impaired synaptic plasticity and enhanced excitability of cells in the lateral amygdala, evidenced by increased c-Fos labelling.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the impact of ELS on astrocytes in the lateral amygdala revealing changes in specific proteins associated with morphological reorganisation and astrocyte network function. ELS resulted in decreased frequency and amplitude in astrocyte calcium activity. To directly implicate astrocytes with behavioural dysfunction, we used two distinct viral approaches to mimic stress-induced astrocyte dysfunction specifically in the lateral amygdala. Impairment of astrocyte network function, or decreasing calcium activity, recapitulated ELS-induced fear generalisation, synaptic, and excitability phenotypes, supporting the hypothesis that astrocytes play an influential role in the effects of stress on neural circuits and behaviour. Together, these findings identify astrocytes as central elements regulating amygdala-dependent affective memory and highlight astrocytes as putative targets for the treatment of stress disorders.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>ELS increases blood corticosterone and induces anxiety-like behaviours</title><p>We employed an ELS paradigm which combines limited bedding and nesting materials as well as maternal separation from postnatal days 10–17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and has been shown to induce lifelong stress susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peña et al., 2017</xref>). We first set out to determine the impact of this ELS paradigm on stress hormone levels across our experimental window. Taking trunk blood from mice across several litters at different time points in the ELS paradigm – pre-stress (P10), end of ELS paradigm (P17), at the start (P45), and end of our experimental window (P70) – we report that this ELS paradigm induces a latent increase in blood corticosterone with a significant increase occurring only in late adolescence P45, long after the termination of the stress paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of early-life stress (ELS) on anxiety-like behaviour.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of ELS and behavioural assays.

We found that while there were no changes in behaviour in the open-field task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), we did see an increase in locomotor activity, that is, distance travelled, following ELS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Using the elevated plus maze we, report increased anxiety-like behaviour with an increase in time spent in the closed arms and a reduction in time spent in the open arms of the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and I</xref>).

Further investigation of potential sex differences revealed that while there were no differences in c-Fos densities between naïve female and male animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>), we observed a significantly higher c-Fos density in ELS male mice compared to females following fear acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>).</p><p>Recently, astrocytes have been reported to be recruited to fear engrams during a hippocampus-dependent learning and memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williamson et al., 2024</xref>).

This effect was dependent on the increase in freezing to the neutral cue with freezing responses to the aversive tone being unaltered by astrocytic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Using a rodent model of ELS that employs maternal separation and limited bedding, we report increased blood glucocorticoid levels associated with heightened anxiety-like behaviours. These endocrine and behavioural changes were accompanied by impaired discriminative fear memory in an amygdala-dependent auditory discrimination task. More precisely, we observed that ELS mice displayed increased fear responses to neutral cues with no change in freezing responses to conditioned stimuli. These behavioural changes were further associated with alterations on the cellular scale including synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability. Investigating contributions of non-neuronal cells, we found robust changes in lateral amygdala astrocytes following ELS comprising increased GR translocation to the nucleus and decreased expression of key astrocyte network proteins. Functionally, we observed astrocyte hypoactivity with decreased frequency, amplitude, and size of calcium events following ELS.</p><p>To link astrocyte dysfunction with cellular, synaptic, and behavioural changes, we genetically targeted lateral amygdala astrocytes to mimic the effects we found in ELS. Astrocyte dysfunction alone, either decreasing gap junction coupling or reducing astrocyte calcium activity, phenocopied the effects of ELS across excitability, synaptic, and behavioural scales. Astrocytes have long been shown to be critical for memory formation, with the vast majority of studies reporting that astrocyte dysfunction impairs memory across various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Depaauw-Holt et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we show that astrocyte dysfunction in the lateral amygdala effectively impairs discriminative fear memory evidenced by fear generalisation, that is, the inappropriate expression of fear towards stimuli of neutral valence. These data reveal that astrocytes are critical for the appropriate behavioural responses to emotionally salient cues and provide evidence supporting the recently proposed contextual guidance theory of astrocyte function in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murphy-Royal et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Using an ELS paradigm that coincides with peak astrocyte postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rurak et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farhy Tselnicker and Allen, 2018</xref>), we found a latent increase in circulating glucocorticoids after ELS with peak levels appearing during late adolescence and subsiding towards adulthood. While the lack of endocrine response to stress during the stress paradigm might appear paradoxical, this ELS paradigm overlaps with the stress hyporesponsive period, a time window during which stressors fail to elicit increases in blood corticosterone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schmidt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sapolsky and Meaney, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmidt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vázquez, 1998</xref>). Indeed, similar to our findings, others have reported latent increases in blood corticosterone levels following ELS that were associated with increased anxiety-like behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sharma et al., 2022</xref>) and fear generalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elliott and Richardson, 2019</xref>) later in life. Increased levels of blood glucocorticoids had a direct impact on astrocytes with increased translocation of GR from the cytosol to the nucleus of astrocytes following ELS, indicative of a higher levels of glucocorticoid signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Kloet et al., 2005</xref>). While the effects of ELS on blood glucocorticoids were transient, this could have long-term consequences on protein expression levels, resulting in changes in stress susceptibility and behavioural deficits. The primary behavioural phenotype revealed by this work, that is, fear generalisation, is a common trait observed in anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dymond et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lissek and van Meurs, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lis et al., 2020</xref>). As such, these findings provide further insight into the neurobiological mechanisms of stress on endocrine, cellular, and behavioural scales.</p><p>Our work builds upon a growing literature that is interested in the potential roles of astrocytes in ELS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vivi and Di Benedetto, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbink et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunn et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we identified specific astrocytic impairments induced by ELS and followed up with precise genetic manipulation of these astrocyte functions in the lateral amygdala. These astrocyte-specific manipulations replicate cellular and fear generalisation phenotype observed following ELS. We did not, however, observe an anxiety-like phenotype using elevated plus maze and open field with local astrocyte manipulation which could be interpreted as a lack of amygdala astrocyte involvement in these discrete behaviours.</p><p>We found that both ELS and astrocyte dysfunction enhance neuronal excitability, assessed by local c-Fos staining in the lateral amygdala following auditory discriminative fear conditioning. One interpretation of these data is that astrocytes might tune engram formation, with astrocyte dysfunction, genetically or after stress, increasing c-Fos expression and a loss of specificity of the memory trace. In support of this notion, evidence of a cellular mechanism whereby c-Fos levels inversely correlate with memory accuracy has been recently shown in hippocampal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asok et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, early-life experience strongly shapes episodic memory development, with stress delaying maturation of memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramsaran et al., 2024</xref>). Early-life stress has even been shown to activate specific neuronal ensembles that contribute to stress hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balouek et al., 2023</xref>). Further support comes from recent demonstration of astrocyte-engram neuron interactions with astrocytes potentially forming part of engram stabilisation or even direct recruitment of astrocytes into engrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williamson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2023</xref>). Our data are in line with previous reports that have demonstrated clear roles for astrocytes in memory formation and consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Martin-Fernandez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kol et al., 2020</xref>) and reveal that astrocytes participate in the neurobiological mechanisms by which stress influences emotional memory.</p><p>Our work revealed unexpected sex differences in calcium signalling in lateral amygdala astrocytes. We found astrocyte calcium events were larger in amplitude and size in female mice compared to males. This higher basal activity could explain why CalEx induced a more profound impairment in fear discrimination in female mice. Interestingly, these sex differences are eliminated by stress inducing a homogenous calcium signature between both sexes. Sex differences in astrocytic development and function is starting to gain increased attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Depaauw-Holt et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rurak et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González-Vila et al., 2023</xref>), with much more to be learned regarding the potentially divergent functions of astrocytes in the female and male brain.</p><p>In sum, our data shed new light on the role of astrocytes as central regulators of amygdala-dependent behaviour, synaptic function, and excitability. In addition, our work suggests a key role of astrocytes in mediating stress-induced behavioural and cellular impairments, supporting the notion that astrocytic disruption is not simply downstream of neuronal dysfunction. These ideas are forcing a change in perception of how brain disorders develop, moving away from a neuro-centric cascade and placing astrocytes in the spotlight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murphy-Royal et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vivi and Di Benedetto, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seifert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Endo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khakh and Goldman, 2023</xref>).

During the task, mice were filmed, and the time spent in distinct parts of the box, that is, centre and periphery were quantified using AnyMaze software (Stoelting). The total time spent in the centre was used as a quantification of anxiety-like behaviour, where more time in the centre represented less anxiety-like behaviour and the total distance travelled was measured to quantify locomotor changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Elevated plus maze</title><p>This task comprised of a total of 5 min during which mice were removed from their cages and placed at the centre of the four arms of the maze, facing an open arm.

Anxiety-like behaviour was quantified by ratio of time spent in open vs closed arms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Acute brain slice preparation</title><p>Coronal slices containing lateral amygdala were obtained from mice between P45 and 70. Animals were anaesthetised with isoflurane and the brain was rapidly excised and placed in ice-cold choline-based cutting solution saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> containing the following (in m<sc>M</sc>): 120 choline chloride, 3 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 8 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 glucose, pH 7.2, and 295 mOsmol. Slices (300 μm thick) were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1200, Nussloch, Germany). Slices were transferred to oxygenated artificial CSF (ACSF) at 32 ± 0.5°C for 30 min containing the following (in m<sc>M</sc>): 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.3–7.4, and 300–305 mOsmol, then allowed to recover for at least 30 min before recordings in oxygenated ACSF at room temperature (RT). For experiments, the slices were transferred to a recording chamber where they were perfused (2 ml/min) with ACSF at 32°C for the course of the experiment. Slices were used for a maximum of 6 hr after cutting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Extracellular fEPSPs were recorded in current-clamp mode with a pipette filled with ACSF placed in the lateral part of the amygdala. Monosynaptic EPSPs were elicited by stimulation of cortical afferences with a tungsten concentric bipolar electrode (World Precision Instruments). LTP was induced using a theta burst stimulation protocol consisting of four pulses at 100 Hz repeated at 5 Hz intervals for 10 s. Signals were amplified using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) and digitised using the Digidata 1440 (Molecular Devices). Data were recorded (pClamp 10.2, Molecular Devices) for offline analysis. The magnitude of LTP was quantified by normalising and averaging the slope of fEPSPs following LTP induction relative to the last 5 min of baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging and analysis</title><p>Fluorescence calcium imaging was performed on a custom two-photon laser-scanning microscope (Scientifica). The microscope was equipped with a Ti:Sapph laser (Ultra II, Coherent), a green bandpass emission filter (525–40  nm), an orange/red bandpass emission filter (605–70  nm), and associated photomultiplier tubes (GaAsP, Hamamatsu). Time-series images were acquired through bidirectional laser scanning (920 nm excitation laser, 86.85 µm × 86.85 µm, 512 × 512 pixels at 1 Hz) at a single focal plane incorporating the entirety of the imaged astrocyte ramifications. All images were acquired using Scanimage (MBF Bioscience). Acute brain slices (350 µm) containing the lateral amygdala were obtained from mice (ages between P45 and 70) injected with the viral construct AAV2/5-gfaABC1D-lck-GCaMP6f 3 weeks prior. Animals were anaesthetised with isoflurane and the brain was rapidly excised and placed in ice-cold NMDG-based cutting solution saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> containing the following (in mM): 119.9 NMDG, 2.5 KCl, 25, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.4 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 20 D-glucose saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices (350 µm thick) were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1200, Nussloch, Germany). Slices were transferred to oxygenated NMDG cutting solution ACSF at 33 ± 0.5°C for 15 min followed by a 1 hr recovery period in ACSF at RT containing the following (in mM): 130 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 glucose, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.3–7.4, and 300–305 mOsmol. All time-series images were acquired in a recording chamber constantly perfused with ACSF as described above.</p><p>For unbiased, automatic calcium event detection, TIFF files of time-lapse images were processed with the AQUA2 pipeline in MATLAB. Parameters of interest (event frequency, amplitude, area, duration, rise time, and decay time) were directly extracted from the AQUA2 output file. For statistical testing, averages of all events from a single astrocyte were calculated for each parameter. In parallel, to better represent the diversity in calcium events, frequency distributions plots were created considering every detected event for all our experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Stereotaxic surgery and AAV delivery</title><p>P25-35 mice were given a subcutaneous (sc) injection of carprofen (20 mg/kg) 1 hr prior surgery. Animals were then deeply anaesthetised (2% isoflurane) before placing them into a stereotaxic frame (Kopf Instruments). Surgical site was infiltrated with bupivacaine/lidocaine (2 mg/kg sc) 15 min prior surgery. Bilateral injections of the following viral constructs produced at the Canadian Neurophotonics Viral Vector Core:AAV2/5-gfaABC1D-lck-GCamP6f (9.6 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml), AAV2/5-gfaABC1D-eGFP (1.2–1.5 × 10<sup>11–12</sup> GC/ml), AAV2/5-gfaABC1D-dnCx43-eGFP (1.2–1.7 × 10<sup>12</sup> GC/ml), and AAV2/5-gfaABC1D-hPMCAw/b-mCherry (1.2 × 10<sup>12</sup>) were delivered to the LA (coordinates relative to bregma: –1.4 mm AP, ±3.4 mm ML and –5 mm DV) of mice of either sex. Viral solutions were injected at a rate of 200 nl/min for a total volume of 650 nl per hemisphere using a 10 µl Hamilton syringe (Harvard apparatus) and a microinjection syringe pump (UMP3T-2 World Precision Instruments). Animals received 250 µl of saline for post-surgery hydration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Brain processing</title><p>Mice were anaesthetised in an enclosed chamber filled with isoflurane (5% for induction, 3–4% for maintenance, v/v) until loss of toe pinch reflex. A transcardial perfusion was used to ensure uniform preservation of tissue and brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr at 4°C. The fixed brains were then placed in falcon tubes containing 30% sucrose solution for a minimum of 2 days. Brains were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound and flash frozen in 2-methylbutane between –40 and –50°C and then stored at –80 until cryosectioning. Brains were cut at 30 um thickness at –20°C using a Leica CM3050S Cryostat. Slices were stored in cryoprotector solution at 4°C until immunohistochemistry.</p><p>For c-Fos labelling experiments, mice were anaesthetised and then perfused 90 min after the end of fear conditioning. The whole lateral amygdala was sectioned in 30-um-thick brain slices, and every fourth brain slice was selected for immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Free-floating brain slices were washed three times in 1× PBS for 15 min to remove cryoprotector solution. Slices were permeabilised in block-perm solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton<sup>10%</sup> in PBS) for a duration of 1 hr. Slices were incubated with antibodies for 24 hr at 4°C. Slices were incubated with primary antibodies; [rabbit] anti-S100β (1:1000, Abcam, ab52642), [mouse] anti-GR (1:500, Thermo Fisher, MA1-510), [chicken] anti-GFAP (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, PA1-10004), [mouse] anti-Cx43 (1:1000 Thermo Fisher, 3D8A5), [rabbit] anti-GLT-1 (EAAT2) (1:1000, NovusBio, NBP1-20136), and [rabbit] anti-c-Fos (1:2000, Synaptic Systems, Cat# 226008). After primary antibody incubation, slices were washed three times in 1× PBS for 15 min to remove non-specific binding. Slices were incubated with secondary antibodies in a DAPI solution (1:10,000) at RT in aluminium foil for 1 hr. Slices were incubated with secondary antibodies; [goat] anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (1:1000, Jackson ImmunoResearch, 111-545-144), [goat] anti-mouse Alexa 647 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, A32728), and [goat] anti-chicken Alexa 568 (1:1000, Thermo Fisher, A11041). After secondary antibody incubation, slices were washed again three times in 1× PBS for 15 min before being mounted onto Fisherbrand microscope slides using ProLong Glass Antifade mountant (P36982).</p></sec><sec id="s3-12"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Slices were imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope with oil immersion Plan-Apochromat ×63 objective 1.4 NA or using a Zeiss Observer Z1 spinning disk confocal microscope/TIRF with a ×20 objective 1.8 NA. 16-bit images of 246 × 246 um areas were acquired at 400 Hz (frame size (x*y); 1024 × 1024, pixel size; 250 nm). 25–30 um Z-stacks were acquired with a step size of 0.5 um. 15 um max intensity z-projections of the lateral amygdala were analysed using ImageJ (Fiji) to obtain A.U. fluorescence intensity measures of secondary antibodies attached to primaries with specificity to epitopes; GFAP, Cx43, GLT-1, and GR. We applied a fluorescence threshold for GFAP, Cx43, and GLT-1 fluorescence and measured integrated density A.U. (thresholds; Mean, Otsu, Otsu, respectively). For nuclear and cytosolic GR measures, astrocyte (S100<italic>β</italic>+DAPI) nuclei were thresholded and used as regions of interest (ROIs) for nuclear measures of GR fluorescence (S100β<sup>+</sup> + DAPI<sup>+</sup>). The same nuclear DAPI ROI was cleared from the previously thresholded s100b regions to obtain cytosolic astrocytic GR (S100β<sup>+</sup> - DAPI<sup>+</sup>). Integrated density A.U. of GR fluorescence was used to calculate nuclear:cytosolic GR ratios.</p><p>For c-Fos cell counting in the lateral amygdala, 16-bit images containing the lateral and basal amygdala nuclei were acquired. 20–30 Z-stacks were acquired with a step size of 1 um. For c-Fos particle counting analysis, a ROI was used to isolate the lateral amygdala and then 8-bit Z-stacks of the c-Fos channel were analysed semi-automatically by using the FIJI plugin Quanty-cfos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beretta et al., 2023</xref>). In brief, a threshold for area and fluorescence intensity was set manually to identify ROIs around all c-Fos-positive nuclei. These ROIs were then manually inspected to remove false positives and negatives found by the plug-in. c-Fos particle counts were then normalised by the volume of the Z-stack to calculate the c-Fos density. In order to calculate the volume, the area of the lateral amygdala was multiplied by the number of Z-stacks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Blood collection and corticosterone analysis</title><p>Trunk blood was collected via decapitation at ZT2 (08:30). To minimise handling-induced elevations in corticosterone, mice were housed with clear plastic tubes used to move individual mice into an enclosed chamber filled with 5% isoflurane for 2 min. Mice were placed in enclosed isoflurane until loss of toe pinch reflect (maximum elapsed time of 2 min). Mice were decapitated and trunk blood was collected into BD 365963 Microtainer Capillary Blood Collection Tubes and placed onto ice. Blood was centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C at 5000 rpm.

They took advantage of a fear conditioning paradigm followed by a discrimination test and complement learning and memory findings with measurements for anxiety-like behaviors. Next, astrocytic dysfunction in the lateral amygdala was investigated at the cellular level by combining staining for c-Fos with astrocyte-related proteins. Changes in excitatory neurotransmission were observed in acute brains slices after ELS suggesting impaired communication between neurons and astrocytes. To confirm causality of astrocytic-neuronal dysfunction in behavioral changes, viral manipulations were performed in unstressed mice.

In the revised version we have added new experiments that further support a role of astrocytes in ELS-induced behavioural dysfunction. Specifically, we carried out two-photon calcium imaging in lateral amygdala astrocytes using viral overexpression of membrane tethered GCaMP6f. These experiments revealed a decrease in astrocyte calcium activity following ELS (Figure 4). Interestingly these data also showed an important number of sex differences (Figure 4 - Figure supplement 1).</p><p>These new data allow us to strengthen the link between ELS-induced astrocyte hypofunction and behavioural changes. Indeed, we validated the impact of CalEx on astrocyte calcium activity in the lateral amygdala, again using two-photon microscopy, and show that CalEx resulted in an astrocyte calcium signature that very closely resembled that of ELS, i.e. reduced frequency and amplitude of events (Figure 5 - Figure supplement 2). As such, we feel like these data, while still correlative in nature, strengthen our findings and conclusion that astrocyte dysfunction alone is sufficient to recapitulate the effects of stress on excitability, synaptic function, and behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Guayasamin et al. show that early-life stress (ELS) can induce a shift in fear generalisation in mice. They took advantage of a fear conditioning paradigm followed by a discrimination test and complemented learning and memory findings with measurements for anxiety-like behaviors. Next, astrocytic dysfunction in the lateral amygdala was investigated at the cellular level by combining staining for c-Fos with astrocyte-related proteins. Changes in excitatory neurotransmission were observed in acute brains slices after ELS suggesting impaired communication between neurons and astrocytes. To confirm the causality of astrocytic-neuronal dysfunction in behavioral changes, viral manipulations were performed in unstressed mice. Occlusion of functional coupling with a dominant negative construct for gap junction connexin 43 or reduction in astrocytic calcium with CalEx mimicked the behavioral changes observed after ELS suggesting that dysfunction of the astrocytic network underlies ELS-induced memory impairments.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, this well-written manuscript highlights a key role for astrocytes in regulating stress-induced behavioral and synaptic deficits in the lateral amygdala in the context of ELS. Results are innovative, and methodological approaches relevant to decipher the role of astrocytes in behaviors. As mentioned by the authors, non-neuronal cells are receiving increasing attention in the neuroscience, stress, and psychiatry fields.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I do have several suggestions and comments to address that I believe will improve the clarity and impact of the work. For example, there is currently a lack of information on the timeline for behavioral experiments, tissue collection, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind comments and constructive feedback on our manuscript. We agree that certain aspects could have been made more clear and we have revised the manuscript and figures to be more explicit regarding timelines. Including the addition of timelines on figures and improved clarity in the text where possible. We have also addressed the private comments provided by the reviewers alluded to in this public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary</p><p>The authors show that ELS induces a number of brain and behavioral changes in the adult lateral amygdala. These changes include enduring astrocytic dysfunction, and inducing astrocytic dysfunction via genetic interventions is sufficient to phenocopy the behavioral and neural phenotypes. This suggests that astrocyte dysfunction may play a causal role in ELS-associated pathologies.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A strength is the shift in focus to astrocytes to understand how ELS alters adult behavior.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The mechanistic links between some of the correlates - altered astrocytic function, changes in neural excitability, and synaptic plasticity in the lateral amygdala and behaviour - are underdeveloped.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments. We are happy that they found our shift in focus towards astrocytes to be a strength of our work. Regarding mechanistic links being underdeveloped, we have attempted to address this by placing more effort into understanding the functional changes in astrocytes and how this relates to behaviour.</p><p>To address this comment we have used two-photon calcium imaging to quantify the impact of ELS on astrocyte calcium activity. As such, the revised manuscript contains several new figures including a detailed characterisation of the effects of ELS on astrocyte calcium activity (Figure 4), including sex differences in naive and the effects of stress (Figure 4 - Figure supplement 1), and an important validation of the impact of CalEx on astrocyte calcium activity. CalEx mirrors the impact of stress on astrocyte calcium activity reducing the frequency and amplitude of individual events (Figure 5 - Figure supplement 2).</p><p>Considering the strong overlap of the effects of ELS and CalEx on synapses, excitability, behaviour, and now astrocyte calcium activity, we hope that this added detail addresses some of the points highlighted by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>The reviewers all agree on one major issue for the authors to address. There is a bit of a lack of mechanistic linking between the astrocyte function and the early life stress and these data are more correlational than causal in nature. This could either be addressed by scaling back the data interpretation and title to be more reflective of the data at hand or if the authors would consider, doing the causal experiment of examining the manipulation of astrocyte activity following early life stress to see if this does influence the phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewers on this issue and realise that we have overstated our findings somewhat. As an immediate fix, suggested by reviewers, we have changed the title to more closely align with our data stating that astrocyte dysfunction is “associated with” rather than “induces” as well as adjusting our interpretations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to this one major comment, there are a list of minor comments that the authors should consider to improve the manuscript.</p><p>(1) A major caveat is the lack of information on the timeline for behavioral experiments, tissue collection, etc. The authors mention &quot;Mice between ages P45-70' but considering the developmental changes occurring between late adolescence and young adulthood, I recommend adding timelines on all Figures clearly indicating when behavioral tests were performed, and tissue collected for electrophysiology or immunostaining. With corticosterone (CORT) back at baseline at P70 vs a difference observed at P45 was this time point favored? It should be clarified throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the lack of clarity on this and have added more timelines on figures.</p><p>The age range favoured (p45-p70), relates to adolescence a time when latent psychiatric disorders tend to manifest in humans following early-life adversity. We have clarified this choice in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Given the transient increase in corticosterone levels in early-life stress mice, peaking at P45 and declining to control levels by P70, it would be informative to know whether the reported behavioral and synaptic changes differ within this time window. This may not be doable in the current approach, but this should be addressed nonetheless. Furthermore, it wasn't clear why the increase in blood corticosterone was delayed. Was this expected? How does this relate to earlier work? Wouldn't it be expected to be elevated at P17 (end of ELS period)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this observation was very unexpected. Initially, we expected CORT to be elevated at P17, end of ELS period. We believe that low CORT levels during the ELS paradigm can be attributed to this paradigm coinciding with the stress hyporesponsive period (SHRP) which in rodents lasts until roughly postnatal day 14. During this period, mild stressors fail to elicit CORT responses. Considering our ELS paradigm lasts from P10-P17, there is a significant overlap with the SHRP.</p><p>This point is now included in the discussion with several citations regarding this biological phenomenon, as well as other studies that report similar findings to our own, i.e. a delayed increase in blood corticosterone levels following early-life stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is mentioned that behavioral tests were performed in both sexes with no sex differences observed. Were animals of both sexes also included in other experiments (ephys, immunostaining, blood CORT analysis)? Behavioral outcomes could be the same but underlying biological processes different. This is a topic that should be discussed. Identification of males vs females on graphs would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for not having provided this data in the previous version of the manuscript. In the revised manuscript we provide analysis of sex differences for our initial behavioural observations (Figure 2 - Figure supplement 1), c-Fos (Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2), for GFAP and Cx43 (Figure 3 - Figure supplement 1), calcium signalling (Figure 4 - Figure supplement 1), and for CalEx and dnCx43 experiments across behaviour (Figure 5 - Figure supplement 4) and c-Fos (Figure 5 - Figure supplement 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) How long-lasting are the generalization phenotypes? Do they outlast the transient increase in blood corticosterone? Showing this would provide a more solid foundation for future explorations.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise a very important point. It remains unclear as to how long these effects last and this is something we are keen to address in future studies, with careful experiments designed to explicitly test this question, as well as subsequent questions regarding whether long-lasting effects are due to impaired brain development or whether these effects emerge due to CORT changes, or other changes, or a combination of them all?</p><p>As an aside, an additional manuscript from our lab (Depaauw-Holt et al. 2024 bioRxiv) which uses the same stressor but focuses on distinct brain regions and behaviours uses a prolonged time window in which the effects of stress are readily observable all the way to P90.</p><p>So while we do provide the answers in this work, it is a really great idea that we would like to follow up subsequently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) With the ELS-induced change in locomotion, I would recommend presenting open field (center, periphery) and elevated plus maze (open, closed arms) data independently. It could also be interesting to analyze corner time in the open field as well as center time in the elevated plus maze.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide data for the open field and elevated plus maze as requested. Our findings remain unchanged, but we agree with the reviewer that this way of representing the data is more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) For Figure 2C, the ideal stats would be an ANOVA with CS (+/-) as a within-subject variable and treatment (naive/ELS) as a between-subjects variable. Then the best support for the generalization claim would be a CS x treatment interaction. I encourage the authors to do these stats. I note that this point is mitigated by the discrimination analysis presented in 2D (where they compare naive and ELS groups directly).</p></disp-quote><p>We have carried out the analysis as requested and these data further support the notion of fear generalisation in ELS mice (Figure 2 - Figure supplement 2A, B). Additionally, the analyses are included in a supplementary table. We hope that we have understood correctly, and this figure accurately reflects the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figure 2H, why not evaluate c-Fos levels after the discrimination test which is the main behavioral outcome? This statement in the Discussion should be modified if, as per my understanding, c-Fos was measured after the fear paradigm only &quot;We find that both ELS and astrocyte dysfunction both enhance neuronal excitability, assessed by local c-Fos staining in the lateral amygdala following auditory discriminative fear conditioning. One interpretation of these data is that astrocytes might tune engram formation, with astrocyte dysfunction, genetically or after stress, increasing c-Fos expression resulting in a loss of specificity of the memory trace and generalisation of fear.'</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that further evaluation of c-Fos levels following the discrimination test would be insightful. We honestly did not consider this time point in our initial experimental design, as we considered previous reports in the literature that investigated how the numbers of cells recruited to the engram (c-Fos density) could influence memory accuracy at a later time point. As such, investigating c-Fos levels following training was our initial target. We have modified the text to be more explicit in our experimental approach.</p><p>This is nevertheless a fascinating point that we are keen to pursue in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Some thoughts on why dnCx43 suppression of astrocyte network activity is less effective at inducing fear generalization than CalEx suppression of astrocyte Ca2+ are warranted. One might predict that both manipulations should result in similar effects, as seen in fEPSP and cFos data in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting observation and the fact we did not observe the same behavioural phenotype despite fEPSP and c-Fos data to be the same is puzzling.</p><p>Nevertheless, we do see increased fear generalisation in both dnCx43 and CalEx. We hypothesise that CalEx had a more profound effect due to the wide range of processes that are presumably affected by reduced astrocyte calcium activity, whereas blocking gap junction channels still leaves a large number of astrocyte functions intact.</p><p>Overall, our conclusion is that behaviour is a more sensitive assay compared to the cellular phenotypes, which highlights the importance of answering these questions from multiple angles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Ideally changes in functional coupling following the dnCx43 manipulation should be shown here (line 169).</p></disp-quote><p>We, unfortunately, did not directly evaluate functional coupling in dnCx43 mice in this manuscript. This would have been a useful experiment, but we rely on our previous data where we extensively characterised this tool (Murphy-Royal et al. 2020 Nat Comms).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) It would be relevant to perform c-Fos staining with markers for astrocytes or neuronal cells. Is an increase in activity expected for both cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fascinating question, given recent work on this topic showing that astrocytes can indeed express c-Fos and may be recruited into engrams. We analysed our existing tissue, we found that indeed astrocytes were labelled with c-Fos following our behavioural conditioning paradigm. Our data align with recent reports, and we demonstrate a small percentage of astrocytes expressing c-Fos (Figure 2 - figure supplement 3). This modest number of astrocytes expressing c-Fos is discussed in the text and placed into context of very recent papers that have been published since our submission to eLife.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Were the same mice subjected to behavior analysis than immunostaining?</p></disp-quote><p>We generated separate cohorts of mice for immunostaining and behaviour, and have made this more clear in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Language describing learning paradigm. The CS+ (line 73) isn't in itself aversive (and shouldn't be described as such). It acquires that value after pairing with the US (which is aversive).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is poorly worded and have modified the text from “aversive cue” to “conditioned cue”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) It is hard to appreciate the glucocorticoid receptor translocation with the images provided. Would it be possible to increase magnification or at least, provide small inserts at higher magnification?</p></disp-quote><p>We have re-imaged our brain sections to get more detailed images. These are provided in revised manuscript (Figure 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) For the viral injection experiment, for how long is the virus expressed before running behavior/recording/c-Fos staining? Is the age of the tested mice the same as Figures1-3 or they were injected at P45 and tested weeks later?</p></disp-quote><p>We age-matched all mice for all experiments and tried to keep our experimental window as tight as possible (p45-70). All mice were injected at P25-30 in order to meet the experimental time window. To be more precise we have added timelines on all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) A validation of the virus is missing to confirm the reduction of Cx43 expression at mRNA and protein levels when compared to controls. A reference is provided but to my understanding age of the animals might be different.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, I believe the reviewer is referring to dnCx43. In this experiment we used a viral approach to overexpress a non-functional connexin 43 protein (Murphy-Royal et al. 2020 Nat Comms). As such, a PCR or immuno against this protein would be expected to reveal higher expression levels. We have tried to clarify this approach in the text.</p><p>It is true that we did not fully characterise this tool in the lateral amygdala which would have been useful but considering our extensive experience with this tool and in it’s development with our collaborators Baljit Khakh, Randy Stout, David Spray (see Murphy-Royal et al. 2020) we are confident in these data, despite the limitation of validation in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Same comment for the CalEx, a validation would be appreciated. Based on Yu et al. could a GCaMP6f virus be more appropriate as control?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important experiment as our lab has not fully validated this tool in house (compared to dnCx43, which we previously validated).</p><p>As such, mice were injected with both a membrane tethered GCaMP6f under the control of the short GFAP promoter - AAV2/5-gfaABC1D-lck-GCaMP6f and CalEx - AAV2/5-gfaABC1D-hPMCA2w/b-mCherry. Using this approach we were able to record calcium activity from CalEx positive and CalEx negative astrocytes in the same tissue (Figure 5 - figure supplement 2).</p><p>We report that this approach does indeed reduce astrocyte calcium but does not entirely eliminate it. In fact, CalEx expressing astrocytes displayed similar calcium activity dynamics to that we observed following ELS. Together, this further strengthens our rationale to use CalEx in order to mimic the effects of stress on astrocytes, and determine downstream effects on excitability, synapses, and behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) Have previous studies found ELS--&gt; generalization phenotypes in adulthood? If so, these should be discussed in more detail. If not, perhaps this point can be made more explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. After looking deeper into the literature in more depth we found an example of this in which ELS resulted in context fear generalisation in adult rats. This work is cited in the discussion in the context of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) A paper by Krugers et al (Biol Psychiatry 2020) seems especially relevant (glucocorticoids, fear generalization, engram size) and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this work to our attention.
