cell differentiation. Peri-follicular GC precursors first expressed intermediate levels of BCL6 while co-expressing the transcription factors RelB and IRF4, the latter known to repress Bcl6 transcription. Transition of GC precursors to the BCL6<sup>hi</sup> follicular state was associated with cell division, although the number of required cell divisions was immunogen dose dependent. Potentiating T cell help or CD40 signaling in these GC precursors actively repressed GC B cell maturation and diverted their fate towards plasmablast differentiation, whereas depletion of CD4+ T cells promoted this initial transition. Thus while CD40 signaling in B cells is necessary to generate the immediate precursors of GC B cells, transition to the BCL6<sup>hi</sup> follicular state is promoted by a regional and transient diminution of T cell help.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19552.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19552.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>germinal center</kwd><kwd>GC precursor</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd><kwd>CD40</kwd><kwd>plasmablast</kwd><kwd>T cell help</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI080850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haberman</surname><given-names>Ann M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI101704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haberman</surname><given-names>Ann M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Ting-ting</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CD40 signaling is necessary to generate the immediate precursors of GC B cells, transition to the BCL6hi follicular state is promoted by a regional and transient diminution of T cell help.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Germinal centers (GCs) are specialized structures that form within B cell follicles in response to immunization or pathogen exposure. Within defined anatomical niches of mature GCs, antigen specific GC B cells intermittently engage cognate T follicular helper cells (T<sub>fh</sub>). Competitive GC B cells are instructed to undergo further rounds of proliferation, and ultimately differentiate into memory B cells and long-term high-affinity plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Silva and Klein, 2015</xref>). In contrast to mature GCs, the initial formation of GC founder/precursor cells remains poorly understood. The initiation of GCs is regulated by a series of dynamic cellular events. After antigen binding and B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, activated follicular B cells migrate to the T/B border and interfollicular (IF) regions. At the periphery of follicles, responding B and T cells engage, separate and re-form contacts with new cognate partners over the course of several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>). Initial B cell commitment to the GC lineage and divergence from the short-term antibody secreting cell (ASC) path occurs during this time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>). Intermediate levels of BCL6 have been observed in some activated B cells prior to follicular re-entry and GC seeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitano et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Tfh migration into the follicle interior precedes that of GC committed B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to influence the mode of differentiation of activated B cells to either the GC or ASC lineages. In vitro culture studies have suggested that B cell fate decisions are a stochastic and B cell autonomous process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasbold et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hodgkin et al., 1996</xref>). Other studies have instead suggested that either the initial BCR signal strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paus et al., 2006</xref>) or competition for antigen and its presentation to cognate Th cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwickert et al., 2011</xref>) are deciding factors. B cell lineage commitment is orchestrated by opposing transcriptional networks thought to be mutually antagonistic. The transcriptional repressor BCL6 is essential for GC B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Silva and Klein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dent et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitano et al., 2011</xref>) and represses the transcription factors IRF4 and Blimp1, preventing ASC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2012</xref>). By contrast, high levels of IRF4 or induction of Blimp1 represses transcription of Bcl6 and facilitates ASC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>). Bcl6 protein levels can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>CD40 signaling plays a pivotal role in the generation of GCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foy et al., 1996</xref>). CD40 signals via the non-canonical NFκB pathway that uniquely invokes the nuclear translocation of heterodimeric RelB/p52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fusco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hömig-Hölzel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vallabhapurapu and Karin, 2009</xref>). Although CD40 signaling is clearly a necessary component of GC formation, a transcriptional program consistent with persistent CD40 signaling is not seen in GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, chronic CD40 signaling is known to antagonize GC B cell formation and instead promotes plasma cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolduc et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kishi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2007</xref>). This is in part mediated by IRF4, a transcription factor promoted by RelB. However, IRF4 appears to be essential for the differentiation of both GC B cells and ASCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Klein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sciammas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Willis et al., 2014</xref>). Distinct DNA binding modes of IRF4 dependent on protein concentration may account for these opposing roles of IRF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>). To further confound things, a key cytokine secreted by T<sub>fh</sub> cells, IL-21, has also been shown to be an important regulator of both GC B cell and plasma cell differentiation in a B-cell intrinsic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ozaki et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zotos et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Based on those paradoxical facts, we questioned whether GC differentiation involved multiple stages that were distinctly regulated. We hypothesized that GC B cell differentiation is completed by a stage that was not reliant on T cell-derived CD40. We observed an early peri-follicular presence of GC precursors that co-express RelB, IRF4 and BCL6, factors known to be mutually antagonistic. Using both in vivo and in vitro models, manipulating the extent or duration of T cell help and/or CD40 signaling during this early initiation stage significantly impacted the amount of precursor expansion and the capacity to transition to Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells. Here we show that prolonging the availability of T cell help or CD40 agonism in vivo alters the fate of the immediate precursors away from GC path prior to follicular re-entry, whereas their removal encourages it. Thus, CD40 signaling is required for the first increase in BCL6 protein, but must cease at the immediately subsequent stage in order to allow for GC B cell progression. Based on these results, we propose a model wherein initial GC B cell differentiation is a multi-staged process, the final steps of which are shaped by a transient diminution of T cell help within its microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intermediate levels of BCL6 are found in a subset of RelB<sup>+</sup> IRF4<sup>+</sup> Ag-specific B cells prior to the emergence of follicular BCL6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells that lack RelB and IRF4</title><p>To examine the cellular and molecular process governing GC formation, we assessed the CD40 signaling status of Ag-specific B cells destined for the germinal center B cell fate.

Throughout the study, we utilized an adoptive transfer system of nitrophenyl hapten (NP)-specific B cell to investigate early B cell responses in draining lymph nodes (LNs) following footpad (<italic>f.p.</italic>) immunization of NP-CGG in CFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, nuclear RelB was observed in a subset of transferred NP-specific B cells by IF histology day 2 and 3 p.i. (p.i.)

RelB was abundant in other cells, presumably myeloid derived cells, located in T zone, IF zone and near the subcapsular sinus (SCS), but absent in follicular naïve B cells. As blocking CD40 interactions resulted in the loss of RelB expression in responding B cells, we found elevated RelB to be a reliable indicator of CD40 signaling and used it as surrogate marker for recent signaling events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19552.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GC precursors co-express counter-regulatory factors BCL6, RelB and IRF4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the experimental protocol.

Two days p.i., GFP<sup>+</sup> NP-specific B cells were found predominantly in the IF zone and at the T / B border and were RelB<sup>+</sup> and IRF4<sup>+</sup>, but expressed undetectable levels of BCL6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). BCL6 expression was not observed in NP-specific B cells after CD40 blockage, corroborating the specificity of BCL6 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). At this point in time, nearly all RelB<sup>+</sup> responding B cells expressed elevated levels of IRF4, although the reverse was not true. Consistent with our prior study, expression of BCL6 was not apparent among NP-specific B cells until d3 p.i., a point in time when they remained largely constrained to the IF zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, we found that all BCL6 expressing B cells at this time point harbored nuclear RelB and IRF4, although the BCL6 expression levels of such cells was less than observed in fully differentiated GC B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and data not shown; discrimination of nuclear RelB from the cytoplasmic form is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Only a half day later (d3.5), GFP<sup>+</sup> B cells expressing higher levels of BCL6 with diminished levels of RelB and IRF4 began to emerge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). Image analysis comparing BCL6<sup>+</sup> RelB<sup>+</sup> cells to BCL6<sup>+</sup> RelB<sup>-</sup> cells revealed that the newly formed BCL6<sup>hi</sup> RelB<sup>-</sup> cells were located much deeper within follicles, whereas BCL6<sup>int</sup> RelB<sup>+</sup> cells resided mainly outside of follicles or close to follicular borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

In contrast, GC precursors were significantly less frequent among cells that have undergone seven or more divisions, coincident with the emergence of GC B cells at divisions 6–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). IRF4hi cells lacking Bcl6, presumably early plasmablasts, emerge with slightly faster kinetics than GC B cell and continue to undergo additional cell divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The lack of further divisions of GC precursors could be explained by either cell cycle arrest, exacerbated cell death or further differentiation to GC B cells. Cell cycle analysis indicated that GC precursors were predominantly in cell cycle and not evidently apoptotic compared to non-responding B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Therefore, the lack of GC precursors that have undergone more than six rounds of divisions does not appear to reflect a failure to enter into cell cycle or an increase of apoptotic cell death, but may result from differentiation into GC B cells. We further questioned whether expression levels of differentiation fate-determining transcription factors are linked to cell division of GC immediate precursors. In contrast to relatively stable expression of BCL6 and IRF4, a gradual reduction of RelB through rounds of cell divisions was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together, the results suggest the coordinated transition of GC precursors to GC B cells is associated with cell division and a loss of RelB expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A smaller immunogen dose increases the frequency of GC B cell differentiation over fewer rounds of cell division</title><p>We hypothesized that the reduction of RelB levels in GC precursors at later divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) reflected a lack of Th cell engagement. It has been suggested previously that the magnitude of Ag presentation by responding B cells decreases over the course of sequential cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thaunat et al., 2012</xref>). Immunogen dose might therefore influence how many rounds of cell division are necessary for GC B cell formation.</p><p>To examine the impact of hapten dose, recipients of CFSE labeled B cells were immunized with either 15 ug NP-CGG or 1.5 ug of NP-CGG supplemented with 13.5 ug CGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In order to provide comparable conditions for DC antigen presentation and early Th cell development, the amount of the carrier protein CGG did not vary. Regardless of the dose of haptenated protein, the extent of proliferation of transferred B cells was similar 3.5 days p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). A low dose of NP-CGG resulted in a smaller percentage of GC precursors but a significantly larger percentage of GC B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Moreover, the quantity of Ag affects the frequency of differentiation relative to rounds of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). With the lower dose of NP-CGG, GC B cells emerged at divisions 4–6, suggesting that GC precursors are predisposed to differentiate with fewer rounds of divisions when mice received lower doses of Ag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). With a lower Ag dose, a steep reduction in the RelB MFI observed at later precursor cell divisions was associated with an accelerated rate of transition to the matured GC B cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that the quantity of Ag at immunization impacts the kinetics and number of divisions required for the reduction of RelB in GC precursors and their transition to GC B cells.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19552.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A smaller immunogen dose promotes the transition of precursors to GC B cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the experimental protocol.

Although overall RelB levels were not affected, IRF4 levels were elevated in GC precursors compared to treatment controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). Further examination of CFSE-labeled B cells revealed that GC precursors did not display the typical pattern of RelB reduction at later cell divisions when either additional antigen or agonistic anti-CD40 is introduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that prolonged Ag exposure and T-cell help during the GC transition phase can drive the formation of GC precursors and impedes their transition to GC B cells. This did not represent just a delay in the kinetics, as the decrease in the GC population was evident 6 days p.i. as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). In sharp contrast, both treatments strongly promoted the formation of plasmablasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I,J</xref>). Together the results suggest that prolonged T-cell help or CD40 agonism during this critical transitional phase skews the fate of GC precursors toward plasmablast differentiation and away from GC B cell formation.

Although both treatments resulted in a rapid reduction in detectable GC precursors just a half day later, GC B cell frequencies remained comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>). This short-term blockade of CD40L did not lead to an increase in apoptosis of GC precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>) or cell cycle arrest (data not shown). Therefore transient disruption of B and T interactions or CD40 signaling in vivo does not prevent the furthered differentiation of precursor cells, and instead promotes this transition at this early phase of the immune response.

Compared to the pre-GC-like population, the BCL6<sup>hi</sup> RelB<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> cells show reduced CD38 and CD86 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In addition, cell division analysis of washout cultures indicated that BCL6<sup>hi</sup> RelB<sup>lo</sup> cells underwent several more rounds of cell division than BCL6<sup>int</sup> RelB<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), suggesting that BCL6<sup>hi</sup> cells differentiated from BCL6<sup>int</sup> RelB<sup>+</sup> precursors that have undergone at least one further division without T cell-associated stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether transcriptional and / or posttranscriptional regulation accounts for the shifts in Bcl6 protein levels between the BCL6<sup>int</sup> and BCL6<sup>hi</sup> populations, we utilized a PrimeFlow RNA assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Porichis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soh et al., 2016</xref>) that allows for the detection of <italic>bcl6</italic> mRNA in combination with intracellular staining of protein BCL6, RelB and IRF4 at single cell level. Hybridization and amplification of <italic>bcl6</italic> binding probes indicate that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation are involved in these phases of differentiation. Compared to αIgM-pulsed B cells with or without αCD40 activation, B cells with a continuous exposure to αCD40 and IL-4/21 had higher levels of both Bcl6 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). Washout of αCD40 and IL-4/21 further enhanced the transcription of <italic>bcl6</italic> mRNA in cultured B cells, which mostly correlated with protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A,B and C</xref>). Consistent with this, GC B cell precursors (BCL6<sup>int</sup> RelB<sup>+</sup> IRF4<sup>+</sup>) expressed much higher levels of <italic>bcl6</italic> mRNA than that of BCL6<sup>lo</sup> RelB<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> cells of washout cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Higher BCL6 protein levels in GC B cells (BCL6<sup>hi</sup> RelB<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup>) cells was associated with yet another increase of <italic>bcl6</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Notably however, BCL6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells evidenced a significantly greater increase of BCL6 protein than that of <italic>bcl6</italic> mRNA, suggesting both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of BCL6 expression occurs during the transition to the BCL6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><p>To directly evaluate which population gives rise to BCL6<sup>hi</sup> RelB<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> cells, sorted cells were re-cultured for differentiation. To unambiguously identify Bcl6 expressing cells based on their level of expression, we employed a strain of mice that express a Bcl6-YFP fusion protein under the direction of the Bcl6 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumjohann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kitano et al., 2011</xref>). Three day cultures of <italic>Bcl6<sup>yfp/+</sup></italic> splenocytes with continuous stimulation of αCD40 and IL-4/21 demonstrated that YFP expression mirrored that of Bcl6 protein with high fidelity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In order to enrich for viable cells distinguishable by their level of Bcl6 levels, we sorted YFP<sup>hi</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup> CD86hi and YFP<sup>lo</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup> CD86<sup>hi</sup> from cultured cells. Due to the time spent on cell staining and sorting, the initial culture period was shortened from 3 days to 2.5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Sorted cells were re-cultured in medium only in FL-YB-seeded wells for an additional half-day before analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Unsorted cells under washout conditions (positive control) were also deprived of T cell associated stimuli by day 2.5 of culture and likewise replated onto FL-YB-seeded wells. Although the shortened initial culture with αCD40 and IL-4/21 results in fewer BCL6<sup>hi</sup> RelB<sup>-</sup> IRF4<sup>-</sup> GC B cells, the results indicate that only the YFPhi population gives rise to BCL6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> RelB<sup>lo</sup> cells, but the YFPlo population does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). The sorted YFP<sup>hi</sup> cells generated two-fold more BCL6hi cells than the unsorted population. Although the rate of differentiation was lower than we expected, it is likely that the long duration of cell staining and sorting process compromised their further differentiation during the subsequent 12 hr re-culture.</p><p>Taken together, the in-vitro cultures confirmed that a physical separation of activated B cells from the CD40 agonism and cytokines typically associated with Th cells encourages the generation of BCL6<sup>hi</sup> RelB<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> cells expressing a GC B cell phenotype. Whereas transition of the Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> to the Bcl6<sup>int</sup> state involves primarily Bcl6 gene transcription, the transition to the Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> state also evidences post-transcriptional regulation of Bcl6 mRNA levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results presented here shed light on a longstanding conundrum; how can CD40 signaling be required for B cell commitment to the GC lineage while also inhibiting its formation? We find that GC B cell differentiation is a two-stage process; (1) a T-cell contact and CD40-dependent phase that generates RelB+ IRF4+ BCL6<sup>int</sup> GC precursors and (2) a phase immediately following that is prevented by further CD40 signaling but nevertheless needed to complete their transition to BCL6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells. The immediate precursors to GC B cells are poised at an incomplete state of differentiation that can be easily diverted by extending T cell help or by introducing anti-CD40. In this way, the impact of CD40 signaling depends on the distinct stage of GC B cell formation, promoting precursor formation, but diverting precursor progression once formed. Together our results are consistent with the idea that the transition of GC precursors to the Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> state is discouraged by Th-derived CD40L during the early stages of adaptive immune responses.</p><p>Our results indicate that the initial low level of BCL6 expression is limited to B cells that also harbor nuclear RelB and IRF4. A recent report indicates that the transient expression of IRF4 is also required for proper GC B cell progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, IRF4 is required for both ASC and GC development, although its sustained expression preferentially promotes ASC associated genes, subverting the GC pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>). The requirement for prior IRF4 expression had come as a bit of a surprise since IRF4 is known to directly bind to and represses the Bcl6 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 2007</xref>). Thus GC precursors co-express transcription factors known to be mutually antagonistic. In addition to transcriptional regulation of Bcl6 gene expression, post-transcriptional regulation can also modulate Bcl6 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saito et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, the comparison of Bcl6 RNA levels to protein levels under varied in vitro culture conditions suggests that each stage of differentiation may differ in this regard. Whereas RNA and protein levels appeared to have a mainly linear correlation within Bcl6<sup>int</sup> GC precursors, there was a disproportionate increase of Bcl6 protein within Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells generated in vitro, suggesting that some form of post-transcriptional regulation may be more involved in the transition to the Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cell state.</p><p>Within mature GCs, BCL6 controls B cell differentiation by regulating cell cycle genes and some terminal differentiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bunting and Melnick, 2013</xref>). Repressed BCL6 target genes in dark zone GC B cells include cd38, irf4 and prdm1, however precursor B cells displayed only a partial GC phenotype and have not yet fully suppressed surface expression of CD38. This might reflect either a requirement for higher levels of BCL6 or alternatively an inability of precursor cells to express other co-repressors necessary for effective transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basso and Dalla-Favera, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Béguelin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatzi et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, GC precursors retain some plasticity in that they can still give rise to ASC during this critical transitional time period with either larger amounts of T cell help or CD40 ligation. It is tempting to speculate that the co-expression of RelB, IRF4 and BCL6 together achieve a transcriptional program compatible with some degree of pluripotency.</p><p>What might mediate the transition of RelB+ IRF4+ precursors to the mature GC B cell state? Theoretically, exposure to IL-21 in the absence of CD40 signaling could promote higher levels of BCL6 without promotion of RelB. IL-21 is required for even intermediate Bcl6 levels in our in vitro culture system, and in vivo B cell expression of IL-21R is required for maximal BCL6 levels in GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Linterman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zotos et al., 2010</xref>). However, Tfh cells are known to express CD40L transcripts at levels comparable to Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nurieva et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, exposure to IL-21 in the absence of anti-CD40 within our in vitro culture system, even if there was prior CD40 ligation, leads to apoptosis without GC B cell formation, consistent with previous reports of IL-21 induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Spolski and Leonard, 2008</xref>). Together with the observation that prolonged CD40 agonism inhibits the formation of GC cells, our results suggest that precursor progression critically depends on a temporary abstinence from additional CD40 signaling that would otherwise subvert the second phase of GC B cell maturation. This cannot be explained by an inability of precursor cells to express CD40 or to respond to CD40 ligation, because they remain intrinsically responsive to anti-CD40 both in vitro and in vivo. For these reasons, we favor a model in which the maturation of GC precursor cells instead reflects a transient diminution of cognate T cell engagement.</p><p>Our results suggest that a reduction of nuclear RelB and the furthered differentiation of GC precursors is associated with cell division. At a population level both in vitro and in vivo, the emergence of RelB+ IRF4+ BCL6<sup>int</sup> B cells required multiple cell divisions, and interestingly appeared to be coordinately linked to the number of cell divisions. The Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> counterparts became evident after an additional cell division. An unequal distribution of BCL6 resulting from asymmetric cell division has previously been reported in a subset of germinal center B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnett et al., 2012</xref>). Unfortunately, we are unable to determine whether this occurs during the cell division of GC precursors induced with this model antigen, in part due to the rapid kinetics of cytokinesis, the requirement for real-time imaging of cell division and inadequacy of transcriptional reporters. These putative processes would be ideally defined by in vivo imaging of B cells expressing fusion proteins of these transcription factors.</p><p>Together our results are consistent with the idea that attenuated T cell engagement, and presumably fewer cycles of CD40 signaling, encourages the transition of precursors to the BCL6<sup>hi</sup> state during the early stages of adaptive immune responses. Depleting CD4 T cells in vivo during the critical transitional time period shifted the precursor/GC ratio in favor of GC B cell maturation. Similarly, varying or supplementing antigen dose influenced the timing and extent of GC precursor maturation. This is consistent with prior studies demonstrating that higher affinity B cells with a greater capacity to acquire and present antigen to T cells preferentially formed plasmablasts during early adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwickert et al., 2011</xref>). In this regard, it is interesting to note that particulate antigen has also been reported to be inequitably distributed between daughters during cell division, such that a subset of B cells receive less antigen and have a reduced capacity to stimulate cognate T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thaunat et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A reduced Ag presentation capacity subsequent to multiple cell divisions would be consistent with previous reports of progressively shorter T-B interaction lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, persistent pathogen-derived antigen during chronic <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection results in large numbers of extrafollicular ASCs and impaired GC responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Niro et al., 2015</xref>). However our results contrast with a previous finding that the introduction of additional Ag potentiates the magnitude of T<sub>fh</sub> and GC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumjohann et al., 2013</xref>). The discrepancy could be explained by their relatively delayed introduction of additional Ag when peri-follicular precursors are no longer present and GC B cells have begun their intra-follicular expansion. As GC precursors differentiate to the Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> state and move into the follicle interior, a new source of antigen becomes available within the follicular dendritic cell (FDC) network presented in the form of surface retained immune complexes and complement-tagged antigen, a feature unique to this stromal cell type in lymphoid tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Szakal et al., 1989</xref>). Once BCL6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells are within the intra-follicular environment, cell division is limited without additional rounds of Tfh engagement. However at this stage they have a rewired transcriptional program unlikely to completely resemble their peri-follicular precursor counterparts, and hence their interactions with and response to Tfh likely differs.</p><p>Germinal centers are from an organismal point of view a large investment in space, time and metabolic energy, as well as being mutually exclusive with other urgently needed B cell effectors. It would be strategic to postpone an investment into GCs until the pathogen burden is sensed as diminishing. The results presented here are consistent with the idea that sub-threshold antigen presentation by the precursors to GC B cells attenuates their engagement with cognate T cells during the end of their residence at follicular boundaries. In this regard it is interesting to note that mature GCs harbor a distinct micro-anatomic compartment, the dark zone, that has a paucity of Tfh cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauser et al., 2010</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that this unique feature of the dark zone, it’s dearth of T cell-derived CD40L, contributes to the phased self-renewal of GC B cells by providing an environment that allows them to escape continued T cell engagement.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>B1-8 mice, homozygous for the targeted insertion of the Vh 186.2 Ig heavy chain (<italic>Igh<sup>VNP/VNP</sup></italic>) allele derived from the B1-8 hybridoma specific for the hapten NP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maruyama et al., 2000</xref>) and also with a homozygous deletion of the Jk locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 1993</xref>) were bred locally and used as a source of hapten specific B cells.

Type 1 probe set (Alexa Fluor 647) was chosen for mouse <italic>bcl6</italic> or positive control <italic>actb</italic>. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACS LSR II (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, Portland, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cell sorting</title><p>Primary splenic <italic>Bcl6<sup>yfp/+</sup></italic> B cells were cultured as described above. About 62 hr after culture, cells were harvested and surface stained for CD38, CD86 and B220 with discrimination of dead cells. YFP-Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup> CD86<sup>hi</sup> and YFP-Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> CD38<sup>hi</sup> CD86<sup>hi</sup> cells were sorted with a BD FACSAria II.

Comparisons between two independent groups were assessed by unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests or multiple <italic>t</italic>-tests (different fraction of group); between two dependent groups were assessed by paired <italic>t</italic>-tests. Multiple comparisons were assessed by one-way ANOVA. A Repeated Measures ANOVA was used for comparison of different fraction within group. A <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Aaron J Marshall for critical review of the manuscript and Dr. K Mark Ansel for kindly providing the YFP-BCL6 knock-in reporter mice with permission from Dr. Takahura Okada.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Arup Chakraborty (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions (which are critically important) and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>In this manuscript, authors asked the longstanding important question of how pre-GC B cells make fate decisions such as differentiation into GC B cells versus plasmablasts. One of the most important conclusions is that Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>+</sup> cells are the precursor of Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> GC B cells. And, their observations by themselves are of potential interest.</p><p>However, as is clear from the reviewers' comments (appended below), the most critical concern of all reviewers is that this conclusion is not warranted without direct transfer experiments. Since you identify this precursor fraction by FACS using permeablized cells, this method cannot be simply applied for the transfer experiments. But, in principle, the Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>+</sup> cells could be purified by employing other methods such as using Bcl6 reporter mice or surrogate surface markers, thereby allowing you to address this issue. However, such experiments would require a major effort.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript has addressed the mechanisms underlying the fate decisions of pre-GC B cells, particularly differentiation into GC cells. In this regard, Brink's group initially demonstrated (JEM; 2006) that high affinity cells differentiate to plasmablasts, whereas lower affinity cells go to GC cells, thereby concluding that affinity is an instructive signal. In his group's consecutive paper (JI; 2009), they showed that affinity was promoting plasmablast expansion rather than directing the differentiation. Therefore, how to make decisions between GC and plasmablasts at this pre-GC phase is an important issue, but being still controversial.</p><p>Authors used Bcl6, IRF4, RelB as a marker for tracing the status of B cells, and employed in vivo as well as in vitro experiments. Then, they conclude that CD40 is required to generate the precursor of GC B cells, but their transition to mature GC cells is promoted by diminution of T cell help. I think that overall experimental designs are very good, and the conclusion is well guaranteed at this stage (although I have a couple of concerns as described below). Particularly, the novel points of this paper are to distinguish precursor GC and mature GC by using several markers, and to determine the effects of perturbation of T cell help and CD40 signal on precursor GC and mature GC.</p><p>My concerns:</p><p>1) Since authors utilized in vivo expression levels of RelB as a marker of CD40 signaling, they should show that this assay is trustable enough in vivo. Although previous papers (JBC;2008, JEM;2008, ARI; 2009) showed correlation between CD40 signal and RelB protein expression, this is just in vitro correlation. Two questions; 1) Do other signals such as BCR, cytokine and BAFF affect the expression of RelB in vivo? 2) How about quantity control? If, in vivo expression of RelB is weak, can we consider low level of in vivo CD40 signals?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, not only blue fraction (Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup>) but black fraction (Bcl6<sup>lo</sup>IRF4<sup>hi</sup>) appears to be differentiated from the GC precursors. Is the black fraction pre-plasmablasts? Characterization of this black fraction is not a main topic in this manuscript. But, considering that differentiation into GC or plasmablast is a key issue and that in Fig, 6, authors have assayed differentiation into plasma cells, too, some characterization of the black fraction could be well connected to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> data, thereby providing a more insight into this manuscript.</p><p>3) Since this manuscript addresses the pre-GC phase, extrapolating their results into events occurring during GC cycles is an overstatement. In this regard, I feel that the last paragraph in the Discussion (particularly from the sentence starting “It is unclear whether a transient …” to the end) is not appropriate. For instance, Bannard paper shows similar proliferation rate between wt and CXCR4 ko, although in the long term, ko was outcompeted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Zhang et al. addressed the long-standing question in B cell biology about the roles for CD40 signaling, which is required for GC B cell development but paradoxically inhibits Bcl6 expression. From the results of the in vivo and in vitro experiments, the two-step model of GC B cell differentiation is proposed as an answer to the above question. In this model, Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> GC precursors are formed in a CD40 signaling-dependent manner, and then the precursors become Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> GC B cells in a manner dependent on the attenuation of CD40 signaling. Overall, the experiments appear well designed and performed (especially the flow analysis of Bcl6 and IRF4), the results seem convincing (especially the effects of the in vivo treatments for 0.5 day), and the interpretations read mostly reasonable to justify the proposed model. By experimentally addressing the four points described below, the authors could strengthen the justification of the model and give more mechanistic insights into the steps of Bcl6 upregulation.</p><p>1) Although it seems most likely that Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> B cells are really the precursor of Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> GC B cells, there is no direct evidence for this. The authors could address this by sorting Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> B cells and Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> B cells from the culture system or from immunized mice and putting them in the culture. If Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> B cells become Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> B cells more quickly and/or more efficiently than Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> do, that would be the best compelling evidence. The culture system used in this work is really nice. However, without the sorting experiments, the in vitro results do not provide insights that the in vivo experiments could not.</p><p>2) The specificity of Bcl6 and IRF4 staining in the histological analysis need to be shown. It is particularly important to show the specificity of intermediate Bcl6 staining. Ideally, the use of knockout B cells would be preferable, but the anti-CD40 ligand treatment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> might be used because it should strongly diminish not only RelB signals but also intermediate Bcl6 and IRF4 upregulation at 3 days after immunization.</p><p>3) Nuclear vs. cytosolic staining of RelB is unclear in many cells. For example, there are two Bcl6<sup>+</sup>&quot;RelB<sup>-</sup>&quot; cells with clear RelB signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> (the right circle in the top row and the far left circle in the bottom row). Are the authors claiming that they are cytosolic signals? If so, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> there are several &quot;RelB<sup>+</sup>&quot; cells (polygon and square) in which RelB signals seem cytosolic. The author should show their criteria for nuclear staining using magnified images of individual cells.</p><p>4) It is known that Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells express upregulated amounts of both mRNA and protein of Bcl6. What about Bcl6int precursors? Do they, too, have elevated levels of Bcl6 mRNA, or only the protein expression is increased compared to activated Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> B cells or naïve B cells?

When B cells are provided more antigen, they will in theory signal to a greater extent through their BCR and present more peptide-MHC to T cells. Thus, this experiment on its own is uninterpretable, as any difference in outcome obtained by these means can be attributable to either BCR or T cell help.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors attempt to test the effect of &quot;sustained T cell help.&quot; The first way in which they do this is by injecting soluble antigen on day 3 of the response. The authors observe fewer GC cells and more Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells after soluble NP-CGG injection. It's unclear what this represents however because B cells do not acutely encounter a large amount of antigen in the soluble form in physiological responses. Moreover, as Shokat et al., Nature 1995 showed, acute injections of soluble antigen rapidly induce the death of GC B cells. These previous observations may account for the present authors' findings. The effect of soluble antigen on increasing Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells is unclear, given that it is not clear whether these are in fact only precursors of GC cells. Finally, CD40 antibody treatment is an imprecise and non-physiological means of mimicking &quot;persistent T cell help&quot; given the constant presence of antibody stimulation, in contrast to the frequent, yet intermittent, T-B contacts at this stage of the response. Finally, the notion that increased T cell help increases plasmablast production has already been shown by Schwickert et al., JEM 2011, which used a more physiological method to increase peptide-MHC on B cells and increasing their resulting T cell help. This should be acknowledged by these authors.</p><p>3) The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are puzzling. Blocking CD40 signaling has long been known to impair GC formation (for example, Han et al., Journal of Immunology 1995). The authors suggest that 0.5 days after injecting anti-CD40, they see fewer Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells but unchanged numbers of GC cells. Based on this, the authors conclude that this &quot;promotes this transition&quot; from precursors to GC cells at this early stage. This reviewer does not agree that such a conclusion can be made from this experiment. As previously mentioned, the precursor-product relationship of these cells is far from clear. Furthermore, the authors claim that Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells decline but are not undergoing more apoptosis, and suggest that they therefore must be transitioning instead into GC cells. However, ex vivo caspase stains such as the one used are notoriously unreliable measures of the true rates of cell death in vivo – as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> illustrates, only 0.27% of cells are undergoing apoptosis, a number that is incredulously low.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1) The authors mention that &quot;persistent CD40 signaling is not seen in GC B cells&quot; and cite Basso et al. 2004. This is not an accurate statement. Victora et al., Cell 2010 performed gene expression analysis on light zone GC B cells. They indeed found an enriched signature of CD40 signaling among these cells. This should be referenced by the authors.</p><p>2) Several inappropriate references to Kerfoot et al. 2011 are made in the Introduction. This was not the original work that delineated the cellular interactions between T and B cells at the T-B border that precede the GC phase of the antibody response.

And, their observations by themselves are of potential interest.</italic> </p><p><italic>However, as is clear from the reviewers' comments (appended below), the most critical concern of all reviewers is that this conclusion is not warranted without direct transfer experiments. Since you identify this precursor fraction by FACS using permeablized cells, this method cannot be simply applied for the transfer experiments. But, in principle, the Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>+</sup> cells could be purified by employing other methods such as using Bcl6 reporter mice or surrogate surface markers, thereby allowing you to address this issue. However, such experiments would require a major effort.</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] My concerns:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Since authors utilized in vivo expression levels of RelB as a marker of CD40 signaling, they should show that this assay is trustable enough in vivo. Although previous papers (JBC;2008, JEM;2008, ARI; 2009) showed correlation between CD40 signal and RelB protein expression, this is just in vitro correlation.</italic> </p><p>The point raised regarding the specificity of RelB as a marker of CD40 signaling in B cells is important. We have carefully examined it in vivo using CD40 ligand blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also tested by histology another NFkB molecule, p52, that is also known to play a role in the canonical pathway downstream of the BCR. As expected, RelB levels are quite reliant on CD40 signaling, in contrast to p52 expression in Ag-specific B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19552.018</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19552.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19552.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19552-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>Two questions; 1) Do other signals such as BCR, cytokine and BAFF affect the expression of RelB in vivo? 2) How about quantity control? If, in vivo expression of RelB is weak, can we consider low level of in vivo CD40 signals?</italic> </p><p>1) BCR is known to activate the canonical (classical) pathway of NF-κB through multiple mechanisms, but not the non-canonical NF-κB pathway that employs RelB (Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009 by Vallabhapurapu S et al.). Lymphotoxin (LT) can activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, but the receptor for LT is not expressed in B cells. We are aware that BAFF is secreted by macrophages, DCs and stromal cells, and can activate the non-canonical NF-κB pathway in B cells, known to be critical for mature B cell survival. However, the lack of RelB expression (in contrast to p52) in non-responding follicular B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1-Figure supplement 1</xref>) indicates that RelB is less affected by BAFF in vivo. Our in vitro culture data also suggest that RelB expression levels are less reliant on the BAFF produced by the FDC-derived feeder cell line than the introduced anti-CD40.</p><p>2) Throughout the study, we judged the positive signal of RelB based on a threshold set by non-responding B cells, which are lack of RelB expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). If the RelB signal is above the threshold but at a low level, we still consider it indicative of a low level of CD40 signaling, as shown by the MFI of RelB in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and 6.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, not only blue fraction (Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup>) but black fraction (Bcl6<sup>lo</sup>IRF4<sup>hi</sup>) appears to be differentiated from the GC precursors. Is the black fraction pre-plasmablasts? Characterization of this black fraction is not a main topic in this manuscript. But, considering that differentiation into GC or plasmablast is a key issue and that in Fig, 6, authors have assayed differentiation into plasma cells, too, some characterization of the black fraction could be well connected to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> data, thereby providing a more insight into this manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We had debated whether we should further discuss the Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>hi</sup> cells that are also prominent. We feared this could confound the main topic of this manuscript. Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>hi</sup> cells have been characterized as plasmablasts by Kyoko Ochiai et al. (2013 Immunity). Based on the earlier appearance of this subset and cell division data, the Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>hi</sup> population appeared less reliant on GC precursors. The BCL6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>hi</sup> cells that were evident during early generations continued to expand as aggressively as GC B cells towards later cell divisions. We have incorporated the data into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and added a sentence in the Results section (subsection “The coordinated transition of GC precursors to BCL6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells is associated with cell division and a loss of RelB”, second paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Since this manuscript addresses the pre-GC phase, extrapolating their results into events occurring during GC cycles is an overstatement. In this regard, I feel that the last paragraph in the Discussion (particularly from the sentence starting “It is unclear whether a transient …” to the end) is not appropriate. For instance, Bannard paper shows similar proliferation rate between wt and CXCR4 ko, although in the long term, ko was outcompeted.</italic> </p><p>This discussion was of course speculative and was designed to provide the reader with a broader perspective on how these molecular processes might also play a role in maintenance of established GCs. We have removed the discussion of the Bannard et al. paper and have instead merely drawn attention to the dark zone compartment’s paucity of T cells (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>Zhang et al. addressed the long-standing question in B cell biology about the roles for CD40 signaling, which is required for GC B cell development but paradoxically inhibits Bcl6 expression. From the results of the in vivo and in vitro experiments, the two-step model of GC B cell differentiation is proposed as an answer to the above question. In this model, Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> GC precursors are formed in a CD40 signaling-dependent manner, and then the precursors become Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> GC B cells in a manner dependent on the attenuation of CD40 signaling. Overall, the experiments appear well designed and performed (especially the flow analysis of Bcl6 and IRF4), the results seem convincing (especially the effects of the in vivo treatments for 0.5 day), and the interpretations read mostly reasonable to justify the proposed model. By experimentally addressing the four points described below, the authors could strengthen the justification of the model and give more mechanistic insights into the steps of Bcl6 upregulation.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Although it seems most likely that Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> B cells are really the precursor of Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> GC B cells, there is no direct evidence for this. The authors could address this by sorting Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> B cells and Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> B cells from the culture system or from immunized mice and putting them in the culture. If Bcl6<sup>int</sup> IRF4<sup>int</sup> B cells become Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> B cells more quickly and/or more efficiently than Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> IRF4<sup>lo</sup> do, that would be the best compelling evidence. The culture system used in this work is really nice. However, without the sorting experiments, the in vitro results do not provide insights that the in vivo experiments could not.</italic> </p><p>The issue raised by the reviewer is very insightful and constructive. We have performed experiments to further test the GC precursor-product relationship using purified precursor cells. For this we have employed a strain of mice expressing a Bcl6-YFP fusion protein under the direction of the Bcl6 promoter (Kitano M et al. Immunity 2011; Baumjohann D et al. JI 2011). By using a stringent gate for YFP combined with CD38 expression, a gene repressed by Bcl6 in mature GC B cells, and CD86 (up-regulated with NFκB activation). we have sorted in vitro cultured cells for YFP+ CD38<sup>hi</sup> CD86<sup>hi</sup> cells that are highly enriched for Bcl6int IRF4<sup>+</sup> RelB<sup>+</sup> precursor cells. After they were returned to culture under permissive conditions (CD40/cytokine washout), only the YFP<sup>hi</sup> population, but not the YFP<sup>lo</sup> population, gave rise to BCL6 hi IRF4 lo RelB lo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These results are consistent with the proposed precursor-product relationship. Although the rate of differentiation was lower than we had hoped, it is likely that the long duration of cell staining and sorting process compromised their further differentiation during the subsequent 12 hour re-culture. We have added relevant information in the Results section (subsection “Deprivation of T cell derived stimuli promotes the in-vitro generation of Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>-</sup> RelB<sup>-</sup> B cells”, fourth paragraph) with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>, and in Materials and methods section (subsection “Detection of Bcl6 RNA by flow cytometry”).</p><p><italic>2) The specificity of Bcl6 and IRF4 staining in the histological analysis need to be shown. It is particularly important to show the specificity of intermediate Bcl6 staining. Ideally, the use of knockout B cells would be preferable, but the anti-CD40 ligand treatment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> might be used because it should strongly diminish not only RelB signals but also intermediate Bcl6 and IRF4 upregulation at 3 days after immunization.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have included additional data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref> showing that after CD40L blockade in vivo, Bcl6 expression by B cells is not apparent (subsection “Intermediate levels of BCL6 are found in a subset of RelB<sup>+</sup> IRF4<sup>+</sup> Ag-specific B cells prior to the emergence of follicular BCL6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells that lack RelB and IRF4”, last paragraph). The specificity of IRF4 staining has been confirmed elsewhere (Kyoko Ochiai et al. 2013 Immunity), and it is upregulated by either BCR signaling and /or CD40 activation. We found that blockage of CD40L does not completely diminish IRF4 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19552.019</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19552.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19552.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19552-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) Nuclear vs. cytosolic staining of RelB is unclear in many cells. For example, there are two Bcl6<sup>+</sup>&quot;RelB<sup>-</sup>&quot; cells with clear RelB signals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> (the right circle in the top row and the far left circle in the bottom row). Are the authors claiming that they are cytosolic signals? If so, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> there are several &quot;RelB<sup>+</sup>&quot; cells (polygon and square) in which RelB signals seem cytosolic. The author should show their criteria for nuclear staining using magnified images of individual cells.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the issue raised the reviewer. We did observe that most activated B cells express RelB in the nuclear form, but some cells did express RelB in the cytosolic form. The later may be indicative of recent ligation of CD40 or cells that are active in the cell cycle after CD40 ligation. For the identification of RelB<sup>+</sup> cells, we had been less stringent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> by including all the transferred B cells with clear RelB signal without discrimination of nuclear vs cytosolic. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, we were more stringent with the selection criteria by comparing RelB expression vs nuclear staining of Bcl6. The point raised is well taken – we should be more consistent with our selection criteria. Therefore, we have applied the more stringent selection criteria for nuclear RelB as RelB<sup>+</sup> to the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and re-analyzed image data for the distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the MFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found that this did not change the results or the significance. In regard to the unclear staining pattern of RelB in some cells, we now show magnified images of individual cells with RelB and nuclear staining of Bcl6 in a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) It is known that Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells express upregulated amounts of both mRNA and protein of Bcl6. What about Bcl6int precursors? Do they, too, have elevated levels of Bcl6 mRNA, or only the protein expression is increased compared to activated Bcl6<sup>lo</sup> B cells or naïve B cells? Allman et al. (Blood, 1996) showed that CD40 signaling quickly reduced Bcl6 mRNA expression in B cells. It would be consistent if the Bcl6<sup>int</sup> precursors upregulated Bcl6 protein but not mRNA.</italic> </p><p>This is an insightful and exciting question and a great suggestion! Because the process of staining and sorting cells can lead to the death of Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cells due to their predisposition to apoptosis, we pursued this using an in-situ hybridization approach compatible with flow cytometry (PrimeFlow, Affymetrix) (details see Materials and methods subsection “Detection of Bcl6 RNA by flow cytometry”). Although there are some limitations in the dyes that can be used, we are quite pleased with the results. From this analysis we conclude that transcriptional regulation is primarily responsible for the increase in Bcl6 protein levels in Bcl6<sup>int</sup> precursor cells, but that both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is involved in the subsequent transition to the Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> GC B cell state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) (added in Results subsection “Deprivation of T cell derived stimuli promotes the in-vitro generation of Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>-</sup> RelB<sup>-</sup> B cells”, third paragraph; and also in Discussion section, second paragraph). We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion that has resulted in additional information to this differentiative process. To be clear however, we are unable to pursue further the mechanistic basis for the post-transcriptional regulation, which is clearly outside the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This reviewer's major concern with this manuscript is their central premise that Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells are the &quot;precursors&quot; of GC B cells that are Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> Relb<sup>-</sup>.

Presumably the reviewer is envisioning a CD40L independent mechanism for this hypothetical transition. Our results indicate that CD40L blockade 1 day after immunization both diminishes the number of Bcl6-int Relb<sup>+</sup> cells and prevents the formation of Bcl6 hi RelB lo cells. This suggests that Bcl6-lo RelB-lo cells cannot directly become Bcl6-hi Rel-lo cells without passage through a CD40L-dependent phase.</p><p>We hoped to address reviewer concerns about the precursor-product relationship using purified B cell subsets taken from Bcl6-YFP reporter mice (described above) and a direct transfer to recipients, as suggested. A couple of technical limitations and a theoretical caveat prevented us from taking that approach, namely the predisposition of Bcl6 expressing cells to apoptosis during sorting and the tendency of injected cells to first collect in the lungs and to vary in their arrival to lymphoid tissue. The end assay would involve a collection of those same cells roughly 12 hours after transfer, but most of the donor cells would not have resided in relevant tissue for much of that time period.</p><p>We instead employed the in vitro culture system as a source of activated B cell subsets and sorted them based on their YFP and CD38 levels followed by additional short-term culture for further differentiation. The results show that the YFP<sup>hi</sup> population, but not the YFP<sup>lo</sup> population, gave rise to BCL6 hi IRF4 lo RelB lo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</xref>) (added in Results subsection “Deprivation of T cell derived stimuli promotes the in-vitro generation of Bcl6<sup>hi</sup> IRF4<sup>-</sup> RelB<sup>-</sup> B cells”, fourth paragraph).

When B cells are provided more antigen, they will in theory signal to a greater extent through their BCR and present more peptide-MHC to T cells. Thus, this experiment on its own is uninterpretable, as any difference in outcome obtained by these means can be attributable to either BCR or T cell help.</italic> </p><p>We agree that varying immunogen dose could also affect the extent of BCR crosslinking. BCR signaling and subsequent Ag presentation for T cell help has been difficult to separate for their individual effects. However, we did not intend on having this experiment stand alone as sole proof of our working hypothesis. Instead, it was designed to compliment the other experimental approaches. We modified the text to further make clear that these results are only consistent with the working hypothesis, but does not prove it (subsection “Sustained T cell help at the initiation stage diverts the fate of GC precursors towards plasmablast formation”).</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors attempt to test the effect of &quot;sustained T cell help.&quot; The first way in which they do this is by injecting soluble antigen on day 3 of the response. The authors observe fewer GC cells and more Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells after soluble NP-CGG injection. It's unclear what this represents however because B cells do not acutely encounter a large amount of antigen in the soluble form in physiological responses. Moreover, as Shokat et al., Nature 1995 showed, acute injections of soluble antigen rapidly induce the death of GC B cells. These previous observations may account for the present authors' findings. The effect of soluble antigen on increasing Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells is unclear, given that it is not clear whether these are in fact only precursors of GC cells. Finally, CD40 antibody treatment is an imprecise and non-physiological means of mimicking &quot;persistent T cell help&quot; given the constant presence of antibody stimulation, in contrast to the frequent, yet intermittent, T-B contacts at this stage of the response. Finally, the notion that increased T cell help increases plasmablast production has already been shown by Schwickert et al., JEM 2011, which used a more physiological method to increase peptide-MHC on B cells and increasing their resulting T cell help. This should be acknowledged by these authors.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that injecting either model antigens or agonistic aCD40 is not a physiological way to provide persistent T cell help in vivo. Few experimental systems are irreproachably physiologic. We presume that the reviewer’s concern about “soluble” antigen reflects a concern about BCR crosslinking in the absence of adjuvant. The Shokat et al. study mentioned by the reviewer was instead designed to test the impact of BCR crosslinking on mature GC B cells in the <italic>absence</italic> of T cell help, a possible means by which self-reactive B cells could be eliminated. In that study, HEL-specific B cells were transferred into DEL-primed mice and then boosted with presumably soluble DEL to encourage the transferred B cells to enter into GCs at d12. It is important to note that a boost of HEL (with 1000-fold higher binding affinity than DEL) did not induce the transferred cells to proliferate because of the lack of T cell help capable of responding to the amino acid difference in the HEL epitope. They found that injection of an extremely large quantity of HEL (5mg) induced rapid apoptosis of HEL-binding GC B cells at d12. The authors concluded that this may represent a mechanism to eliminate self-reactive B cells that lacked T cell help. Thus, the Shokat study differs significantly from ours in that abundant T cell help is present in our system at the time the mice were boosted with 20 ug of soluble NP-OVA, a quantity comparable to the original immunization. Moreover, continuous injection of soluble Ag has been used previously to sustain T follicular helper cell responses, without evidence of an acutely induced cell death (Baumjohann D et al. 2013 Immunity).</p><p>Although the administration of agonistic aCD40 is not ideal, it has been a generally accepted method to mimic one type of T cell help both in vivo and in vitro. The ligated CD40 on the surface of B cells is internalized and in this way would have a limited signaling duration. Admittedly, this cannot perfectly simulate CD40 signaling during T-B encounters, because of course many other signaling pathways are simultaneously invoked during immunological synapse formation of variable durations. It is however an acceptable approach to discreetly mimic this one molecular event in the absence of others.</p><p>As the reviewer mentioned, there is an alternative way to deliver antigen to B cells that by-steps BCR crosslinking. The anti-DEC205 approach described by Schwickert et al., JEM 2011 can cause B cells to internalize targeted antigens, but it has its own underappreciated caveats as DEC205 ligation is known to directly and independently induce proliferation. The strain of mice required for DEC205 targeting in B cells is not available to the research community. As suggested, we cite this study along with the other studies reporting the impact of increased T cell help.</p><p><italic>3) The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> are puzzling. Blocking CD40 signaling has long been known to impair GC formation (for example, Han et al., Journal of Immunology 1995). The authors suggest that 0.5 days after injecting anti-CD40, they see fewer Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells but unchanged numbers of GC cells. Based on this, the authors conclude that this &quot;promotes this transition&quot; from precursors to GC cells at this early stage. This reviewer does not agree that such a conclusion can be made from this experiment. As previously mentioned, the precursor-product relationship of these cells is far from clear. Furthermore, the authors claim that Bcl6<sup>int</sup> Relb<sup>+</sup> cells decline but are not undergoing more apoptosis, and suggest that they therefore must be transitioning instead into GC cells. However, ex vivo caspase stains such as the one used are notoriously unreliable measures of the true rates of cell death in vivo – as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> illustrates, only 0.27% of cells are undergoing apoptosis, a number that is incredulously low.</italic> </p><p>To address one concern highlighted here, we would like to remind the reviewer that chronic and long-term CD40 signaling blockade in our system also impairs GC numbers at later time points (currently shown in a supplemental figure). The goal of the study presented in this manuscript was to examine the factors that influence peri-follicular differentiation that occurs with a very narrow window of time. We approached this using a short-term blockade of CD40 ligation (d3 to d3.5 post-immunization) and an assessment very shortly thereafter. This allowed us to observe stages of GC B cell development distinctly regulated by CD40 signaling that would otherwise not be discernable after protracted blockade.</p><p>The low rate of detected apoptosis among the precursors to GC B cells is questioned by the reviewer as being lower than their envisioned death rate for activated B cells during the earliest stages of an immune response. We would like to point out that mature GC B cells within established GCs have a very different transcriptional program that is uniquely predisposed to apoptosis ex vivo. The same cannot be presumed of precursor GC B cells a priori. Although there are no published reports of apoptotic rates for such an early stage of differentiation in vivo, there are numerous reports that examined fully established GCs. Active caspase 3 is apparent in around 5-10% of mature (d10-12) GC B cells (references: Ahmad Zaheen et al., Blood 2009; Sally E. Trabucco et al., JI 2016). Although we have not assessed the apoptotic rate in older GCs in this experimental system, at d4 and d6 we found a somewhat lower percentage of aCasp3+ GC B cells (2-4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 3</xref>).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19552.020</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19552.020">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19552.020</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19552-resp-fig3-v1"/></fig></p><p>In the literature, the percentage of apoptotic cells in mature GC B cells detected by active caspase 3 is consistent with the values observed using alternative approaches including TUNEL staining (Ref: Sally E. Trabucco et al., JI 2016) and CaspGLOW staining (Ref: Kin L. Good-Jacobson, JI 2012). TUNNEL staining of tissue sections has the advantage of detecting apoptotic nuclei engulfed by phagocytes but not yet degraded. To further validate our active caspase 3 staining, we have included additional negative and positive controls including a short-term staurosporine treatment to induce apoptosis for the repeated CD40L blockage experiments (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
