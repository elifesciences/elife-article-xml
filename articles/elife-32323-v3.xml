ammonium-limited chemostats. We found repeated selection for non-synonymous variation in the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional activator, GAT1, which functions with the repressor, DAL80 in an incoherent type-1 feedforward loop (I1-FFL) to control expression of the high affinity ammonium transporter gene, MEP2. Missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of GAT1 reduce its binding to the GATAA consensus sequence. However, we show experimentally, and using mathematical modeling, that decreases in GAT1 binding result in increased expression of MEP2 as a consequence of properties of I1-FFLs. Our results show that I1-FFLs, one of the most commonly occurring network motifs in transcriptional networks, can facilitate adaptive tuning of gene expression through modulation of transcription factor binding affinities.

Genetic variation causing evolutionary changes in gene expression impacts either the regulatory elements of a gene (<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory) or the factors that control its expression (<italic>trans</italic>-regulatory). The relative importance of these two classes of variation across evolutionary timescales is the source of long-standing debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wittkopp et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoekstra and Coyne, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soskine and Tawfik, 2010</xref>). A variety of approaches have been developed for identifying the genetic basis of intraspecific gene expression variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yvert et al., 2003</xref>) and defining the landscape of mutational changes that affect gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Metzger et al., 2016</xref>). Comparative genomics using extant organisms is typically used for inferring the evolutionary processes and outcomes that underlie the evolution of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wittkopp, 2010</xref>). However, these approaches face the challenge of distinguishing neutral from adaptive variation and cannot provide insights into the dynamics of gene expression evolution in evolving populations.</p><p>The regulation of gene expression typically comprises multiple regulatory factors with both activating and repressive functions that coordinately control the dynamics and output of gene transcription. Regulatory networks controlling gene expression are composed of network motifs, recurrently occurring patterns of interaction between regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alon, 2007</xref>). Studies of global regulatory networks in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shen-Orr et al., 2002</xref>) and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2002</xref>) identified three component feed-forward loops (FFL) as one of the most commonly occurring network motifs. A FFL comprises a transcription factor that regulates a second transcription factor. Both transcription factors bind the regulatory region of a third target gene and jointly control its expression. As transcription factors can be either activators or repressors, there are eight possible configurations of three component FFLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>). Of these variants, incoherent type-1 feed-forward loops (I1-FFL) are one of the most common, occurring hundreds of times in bacteria and yeast gene regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Milo et al., 2002</xref>). These network motifs are termed ‘incoherent’ as the upstream regulator directly activates the target gene and indirectly represses it by activating a repressor of the target gene. I1-FFL function to speed the response time of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mangan and Alon, 2003</xref>) and for particular parameter values, detect relative changes in input signals rather than absolute levels of inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goentoro et al., 2009</xref>). 1I-FFLs are found throughout gene regulatory networks in multiple organisms. Although the dynamic properties and behavior of the I1-FFL have been extensively studied, the significance of this network in evolution is not well understood. In particular, how I1-FFLs constrain or facilitate evolutionary pathways remains unknown.</p><p>Long-term experimental evolution (LTEE) provides a means of studying evolutionary dynamics, processes and outcomes. Performing replicated LTEE in controlled conditions and assessing the fitness and phenotypes of evolved lineages and populations enables tests of the role of gene expression evolution in response to selection and the extent to which selection results in recurrent outcomes. LTEE in microorganisms provides evidence for the role of adaptive changes in gene expression in response to selection as parallel changes in gene expression have been observed in replicated populations of both <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooper et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ferea et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>). However, proving that changes in gene expression are adaptive and identifying the underlying molecular bases of gene expression changes acquired during experimental evolution remains challenging.</p><p>Quantitative DNA sequencing enables the comprehensive identification of genomic variants, their frequencies and dynamics during adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao and Sherlock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wenger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>). In LTEE performed in conditions of constant nutrient-limitation using chemostats, increased expression of nutrient transporter genes is a primary mode of adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gresham and Hong, 2015</xref>). Copy number variants (CNVs), comprising gene amplifications that result in increased expression of transporter genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gresham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>), are a recurrent class of adaptive alleles in chemostat LTEE. However, adaptive mutations in trans factors, such as transcription factors (TFs) are also frequently identified in LTEEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kao and Sherlock, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>). These variant alleles are primarily missense, frame-shift or nonsense mutations that are likely to confer strong effects on gene expression in evolved lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carroll, 2008</xref>). However, how protein coding changes in transcriptional regulators identified during LTEE alter gene expression and how these changes in expression confer increased fitness remains unknown.</p><p>The regulation of nitrogen utilization in budding yeast represents one of the best understood gene regulatory networks in any system. Control of nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) transcription is achieved by four transcription factors, that bind to the same GATAA consensus sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magasanik and Kaiser, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofman-Bang, 1999</xref>). Two factors – GLN3 and GAT1 – have activating activity and two factors – DAL80 and GZF3 – have repressive activity. GLN3 is constitutively expressed and regulated post-translationally by TORC1-dependent phosphorylation that prevents its entry into the nucleus. In conditions in which TORC1 activity is low, dephosphorylation of GLN3 enables it to enter the nucleus where it activates expression of GAT1, DAL80 and GZF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The promoters of GAT1, DAL80 and GZF3 contain GATAA binding sites and thus they coordinately regulate expression of their targets and themselves. The NCR regulatory components comprise four interconnected I1-FFLs comprising either of the activators, GLN3 and GAT1, and either of the repressors DAL80 or GZF3, that function to regulate the expression dynamics and output of ~41 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Godard et al., 2007</xref>) that encode products required for assimilating diverse nitrogen sources. NCR is an ideal system for studying the evolution of gene expression owing to the well-characterized properties of its four regulators and the small number of well-defined direct targets.</p><p>Here, we used LTEE in ammonium-limited chemostats to investigate the functional basis of adaptive increases in gene expression. Leveraging our understanding of selection in chemostats primarily operating on nutrient transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gresham and Hong, 2015</xref>) and the detailed understanding of nitrogen-regulated gene expression in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magasanik and Kaiser, 2002</xref>) we studied how adaptive variation in the trans regulatory factor, GAT1, mediates its effects on fitness by altering gene expression. We find that the beneficial effects of recurrently selected missense mutations in GAT1 are a result of its effect on increasing expression of the high affinity ammonium transporter gene, <italic>MEP2</italic>. Surprisingly, we find that these effects are the result of decreased affinity for the GAT1 consensus binding site that differentially impact binding at the promoters of the repressor <italic>DAL80</italic> and their common transcriptional target, <italic>MEP2</italic>. Using functional assays and mathematical modeling we find that adaptive evolution acts to increase the transcriptional output from the I1-FFL comprising GAT1, DAL80 and MEP2 by decreasing transcription factor affinities. Thus, in addition to their important dynamic behavior, I1-FFL possess properties that may be exploited by evolution to tune their output thereby increasing organismal fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>De novo missense mutations in <italic>GAT1</italic> are positively selected in ammonium-limited chemostats</title><p>Previously, we identified repeated selection of independent missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of GAT1 within a single LTEE population maintained in ammonium-limited chemostats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>). In this study, we aimed to determine whether adaptive mutations in <italic>GAT1</italic> result in alteration of its regulatory activities and, if so, how these changes impact fitness. First, we tested the repeatability of adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations in initially clonal populations maintained in ammonium-limited environments by performing LTEE in triplicate using asexually reproducing populations in ammonium-limited chemostats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

The frequency of the MEP2 amplification was defined as the proportion of clones bearing more than 2 copies of MEP2 among 96 randomly selected clones.

As DAL80 is a negative regulator of <italic>MEP2</italic>, a quantitative decrease in DAL80 expression is expected to result in increased expression from the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter. However, GAT1 variants also reduce affinity for the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter sequence potentially decreasing its direct activation. Thus, while the overall topology of the GAT1-DAL80-MEP2 I1-FFL is maintained in evolved lineages, the increase in <italic>MEP2</italic> expression, and likely other targets with strong promoters (including <italic>GAT1</italic> itself), must be mediated by maintenance of direct binding at the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter and an indirect effect through reduced activation of the repressor, <italic>DAL80</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Using a mathematical model of I1-FFLs we confirmed that a net increase in <italic>MEP2</italic> expression results when decreased activation at the <italic>DAL80</italic> promoter is the only functional effect of <italic>GAT1</italic> variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). However, using this model we also find that a GAT1 variant that results in a decrease in direct activation of the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter will result in increased expression of <italic>MEP2</italic> when activation of the <italic>DAL80</italic> promoter is also decreased. Increased <italic>MEP2</italic> expression, despite decreased activation of the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter, is enhanced by a greater relative decrease in <italic>DAL80</italic> activation. Thus, our model of a I1-FFL is consistent with the finding that decreased binding affinity of GAT1, leading to decreased activation of both the <italic>DAL80</italic> and <italic>MEP2</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>) can simultaneously result in decreased expression of the repressor, <italic>DAL80</italic> and increased expression of the target gene, <italic>MEP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Thus, defining the complete spectrum of adaptive mutations in evolving populations requires methods for detecting low frequency mutations that are beneficial but do not persist in the population.

Here, we have shown that decreasing the binding affinity of GAT1 for its target sequence increases expression output from the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter as well as other GAT1 targets with strong promoters. We attribute the increase in <italic>MEP2</italic> expression to decreased affinity of GAT1 for its consensus sequence, which reduces transcriptional output from the <italic>DAL80</italic> promoter, a comparatively weak promoter.

Surprisingly, we also observe reduced affinity of GAT1 variants for the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter, which one would expect might reduce its transcriptional output. However, as illustrated by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), a proportionally greater decrease in <italic>DAL80</italic> expression can outweigh the effect of reduced activation of the <italic>MEP2</italic> promoter.

Thus, quantitatively different effects of transcription factor variants on promoters of differing strengths, in the context of gene regulatory architectures, can lead to counterintuitive impacts on gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The long-term fate of <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations in evolving populations</title><p>In our repeated LTEE we detected multiple <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations during the first ~100 generations of selection in ammonium limitation. The preponderance of these mutations within and between populations suggests that remodeling the GAT1-DAL80-MEP2 I1-FFL is a frequently occurring repeatable mode of adaptive evolution during the earliest stages of adaptive evolution in ammonium-limited environments. However, adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> alleles likely do not represent a fitness optimum in the ammonium-limited environment as, in contrast to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong and Gresham, 2014</xref>), we found that ultimately these alleles were outcompeted by lineages containing <italic>MEP2</italic> amplifications. <italic>MEP2</italic> amplifications have the same functional effect as adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations: they increase expression of <italic>MEP2</italic> enabling improved ammonium transport capabilities. However, the increased expression of other high affinity transporters in <italic>GAT1</italic> lineages that are unable to transport ammonium may confer a fitness cost that is not associated with <italic>MEP2</italic> amplification alleles. It should be noted that our method for detecting MEP2 amplifications has limited detection power until CNVs rise to high frequencies in the population. Thus, it is likely that <italic>MEP2</italic> amplification alleles co-exist with adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations during the early phases of evolution but are undetectable using our sampling and assay scheme.</p><p>Our results provide insight into NCR regulation and suggest additional levels of regulatory complexity. First, it is notable that we do not detect <italic>DAL80</italic> loss of function alleles in our LTEE. Given the current model of NCR regulation, loss of the repressor DAL80 would be expected to result in increased expression of <italic>MEP2</italic> and other NCR regulated genes resulting in increased fitness. Similarly, we do not see selection for variation in the other NCR repressor, <italic>GZF3</italic>. Finally, <italic>GLN3</italic>, the upstream activator of NCR genes, which is itself not a target of NCR regulation does not appear to harbor any adaptive variation. Combining LTEE with targeted studies of functional and fitness effects of regulatory components of NCR may provide further insights into how these four GATA factors coordinately regulate the NCR regulon.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Parallels with oncogenic transcription factors mutations in human tumors</title><p>Experimental evolution in eukaryotic microbes has many parallels with the molecular processes, and evolutionary dynamics, underlying tumorigenesis. The evolutionary hotspot in the DNA binding domain of <italic>GAT1</italic> identified in this study is reminiscent of hotspots in transcriptional regulators important in tumorigenesis including recurrent missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of TP53, a driver in the majority of human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</xref>), and CTCF, a poly-zinc finger transcription factor regulating oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>). As with adaptive evolution, missense mutations in the DNA binding domain of these transcription factors result in altered binding affinities at the promoters of target genes resulting in aberrant transcriptional activation in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Inga et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Filippova et al., 2002</xref>).

Selection in chemostats provides the benefit of defined selective conditions and testable hypotheses regarding the functional basis of increased fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gresham and Hong, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gresham and Dunham, 2014</xref>). Our study highlights the importance of network motifs and incorporation of biophysical parameters in gene regulatory models in order to predict their functional output in the context of evolution. As I1-FFL are one of the most frequent motifs in transcriptional networks they may serve a general evolutionary role as facilitators of transcriptional tuning through modulation of transcriptional factor binding affinities. Further work is required to determine whether the properties of I1-FFL afford this motif unique evolutionary potential.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>The ancestral strain used for all LTEE is a prototrophic haploid derivative (FY4; MATa) of the S288c reference strain. To isolate individual <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations, we crossed each evolved lineage to an isogenic haploid strain of the opposite mating type (FY5; MATα) and, following sporulation, recovered meiotic products bearing different combinations of derived adaptive alleles. To genotype individual segregants, we used allele-specific PCR for which two allele specific forward primers and one common reverse primer were prepared. We also knocked out the entire <italic>GAT1</italic> locus by replacing it with nourseothricin resistance (NatR) marker using a standard high efficiency transformation protocol. We engineered GFP fused promoter constructs for four GAT1 targets (<italic>GAP1</italic>, <italic>MEP2</italic>, <italic>DAL80</italic> and <italic>GZF3</italic>) and integrated them at the <italic>HO</italic> locus using homology based transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each construct, we fused GFP with 1 kb of sequence 5’ and 1 kb of sequence 3’ of the open reading frame (ORF) for each target gene, which encompasses regulatory elements including promoter and UTRs. We attempted to construct a GFP-based transcriptional reporter using the <italic>GAT1</italic> promoter but found that including as much as 2 kb of sequence 5’ to the <italic>GAT1</italic> ORF failed to activate GFP expression in either ancestral or adaptive <italic>GAT1</italic> backgrounds (data not shown).

We constructed diploid strains that are heterozygous at the <italic>GAT1</italic> locus by mating the GFP reporter constructs in the ancestral background and three <italic>GAT1</italic> mutant backgrounds to an isogenic strain of the opposite mating type (FY5). All constructed strains were verified using Sanger sequencing.

We used 2 × 50 bp paired end mode on a HiSeq 2500 and all fastq files were processed using bwa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>), samtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2009</xref>), and SNVer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wei et al., 2011</xref>) to generate a list of mutations with significant allele frequencies in each population. The average sequence read coverage was around 50x, resulting in a detection limit for SNPs around 10% (i.e. we required that each variant was present in at least five reads). We identified CNVs by normalizing read depth at each nucleotide position to the median read depth of the entire genome by processing BAM files using samtools and R. We identified CNVs that include <italic>MEP2</italic> in all three populations at 250 generations using read depth analysis. At each time point during the LTEE, we estimated the allele frequency of CNVs in the population by randomly selecting 96 clones and conducting qPCR to measure the copy number of <italic>MEP2</italic> for all clones. We found that most clones possess one or two copies of <italic>MEP2</italic> but some possesses up to eight or nine copies (data not shown).

These loci are either genes that (1) contain high frequency SNPs identified in population sequencing or (2) have been repeatedly identified as containing acquired variants in prior LTEEs in nutrient-limited chemostats. For each locus, we amplified the entire coding sequence plus 1 kb upstream and downstream of the ORF using PCR. We then randomly fragmented PCR products using sonication to a size of ~250 bp and prepared DNA sequencing libraries using the identical protocol used for population sequencing. Amplicon libraries were sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq in a 2 × 250 bp mode such that the two paired reads overlapped and each insert was sequenced twice. Only overlapping regions were used for allele frequency estimation and thereby we were able to dramatically reduce the false positive SNP call rate. For SNP frequency estimation, the average read coverage from amplicon sequencing was ~50,000. Using SNVer, we determined minor allele frequency mutations for all variants present at a frequency of ≥1%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>dN/dS test</title><p>We obtained 42 different GAT1 sequences from multiple yeast isolates that were reported in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liti et al., 2009</xref>).

For population-level fitness assay, we established cultures containing the ancestral mCitirine-labeled strain (DGY500) alongside chemostats vessels in which LTEE were performed and let them reach the steady state conditions at the same dilution rate. We then mixed a sample from the LTEE with the fluorescence labeled ancestor strain in ratio of 1:9. To determine population fitness, each competing culture was sampled at multiple (5 -10) time points over a total period of less than 20 generations. At least 10,000 cells were assayed using an Accuri flow cytometer to determine the relative abundance of each genotype, and relative fitness determined using linear regression of the natural logarithm of the ratio of the two genotypes against the number of elapsed generations. We tested the fitness of three evolved mutants, three segregants from backcrossing experiments that contained only <italic>GAT1</italic> mutations and one engineered <italic>GAT1</italic> KO strain in four different nitrogen-limited chemostat conditions – using either ammonium, glutamine, proline or urea – and in YPD rich medium using batch culturing and serial dilution.

RNA extractions were performed using an acid phenol-chloroform method. For mRNA enrichment, we used poly-A selection and the final yield of selected RNA molecules was around 10–50 ng in total. For cDNA synthesis, we used Superscript III kit (Invitrogen) and dNTPs mixtures for the first strand synthesis and <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA ligase and polymerase I (Invitrogen) for second strand synthesis with a mixture of dATP, dCTP, dGTP and dUTP. Then, we performed end-repair, A-tailing and adapter ligation based on the standard Illumina TruSeq library preparation protocol. All reaction cleanups between each step were performed using AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc). For directional sequencing of first strand cDNA only, we treated with UNG (Thermo) and amplified the ligated molecules using Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) using 12 or 15 of PCR cycles. Adapter dimers were removed by conducting two rounds of size selection using AMPure XP beads.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Kevin J Verstrepen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors evolve yeast in nitrogen-limited conditions. They find that cells increase expression of MEP2, the ammonium permease either by increasing the gene copy number (reported before) or through mutations in the MEP2 transcription factor GAT1. Surprisingly, these mutations reduce the binding of Gat1 to the MEP2 promoter, but still increase the expression of MEP2 by decreasing the expression of its repressor DAL80. This is indeed an interesting and surprising discovery that shows how the connectivity of molecular circuits could impact on their ability to evolve.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Report expression and fitness for all lineages, as suggested by reviewer #3.</p><p>2) Change the model to include auto-regulation of GAT1, as requested below.</p><p>3) Discuss the ability to distinguish the contribution of DAL80 vs. GAT1 to the increased MEP2 expression.</p><p>4) Discuss the generality of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Gresham and colleagues examine the molecular basis of adaptive evolution in an experimental evolution setting. They evolve asexual yeast strains in nitrogen-limited conditions and use whole-genome population sequencing to identify the molecular changes associated with fitness gains. The major target of selection in this context is the expression level of MEP2, coding for an ammonium permease. One of the most advantageous changes at this locus is increase in copy number, which was dissected in previous papers. Other changes that occur are non-synonymous changes in GAT1, a transcription factor positively regulating MEP2. Surprisingly, through functional analyses, the authors show that these amino acid changes reduce the binding of Gat1 to the MEP2 promoter. The decreased binging affinity would contribute to increase the expression of MEP2 by decreasing the expression of DAL80, a repressor of MEP2.</p><p>This paper appears to be an important contribution because the evolution of gene expression is generally reduced to a very low level of complexity (including in my own work) by characterizing changes as being in cis or trans and as positive or negative. However, transcriptional networks are very complex and network motifs can produce expression levels and patterns that are not necessarily changing in a simple way, at least not in a way that would be expected based for instance on simple changes in TF affinities. The findings presented here are a good example of this and also illustrate the need to consider molecular changes in the context of molecular networks in order to be able to map fitness changes to phenotypes and genotypes. The experiments are well done, the paper is well written and clearly of interest to a large community.</p><p>My major comments would be regarding the interpretation of the data:</p><p>- It would be useful to eliminate effects that could come from outside the GAT1-DAL80-MEP2 motif and that could explain why MEP2 expression goes up when Gat1 affinity decreases. The gene expression data produced could be used for this purpose, for instance by showing that other potential MEP2 regulators are not affected in the Gat1 mutant backgrounds.</p><p>- Third paragraph of Discussion. It would be useful to have a stronger conclusion as to how the increased expression of MEP2 is achieved. The dynamic model constructed maybe useful in terms of supporting one mechanism or the other, for instance self-regulation of Gat1 versus weaker effect of GAT1 mutations on DAL80 than on MEP2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper Hong and colleagues attempt to understand the functional significance of specific adaptive mutations that evolve in yeast under N<sub>2</sub> limited chemostat growth. They find that a large number of early adaptive mutations – although not clear what proportion – are missense mutations in one particular TF (GAT1) that acts on multiple genes but in particular is a positive regulator of the N<sub>2</sub> transporter. These mutations eventually get outcompeted by the expansion of the transporter itself (MEP2) but the early adaptation is (apparently) dominated by the GAT1 missense mutations.</p><p>Long story short their argument is that most of the GAT1 are loss (reduction) of function in terms of the binding affinity to the GAT1 binding site but because the downstream targets are regulated through an incoherent FF loop this reduction of binding leads to an <italic>increase</italic> in expression of MEP2 because the GAT1 mutations decrease the expression of the repressor of MEP2, the TF called DAL80.</p><p>I was very much prepared to like the paper but was left underwhelmed. The evidence that their model is correct in broad strokes is quite convincing. But they do not seem to be able to link the TF binding to fitness despite having a large number of mutants and do not in any way describe the difference between the two GAT1 mutants they study in great detail. One leads to a much stronger reduction of binding – what does that imply for function?</p><p>I am also unclear about the overall message. What do they mean by claiming that the incoherent FFL enhances the ability of yeast to adapt? Is it that in this context loss of function mutants in terms of binding that are more common can generate a gain of function phenotype in terms of expression of the key gene? Is this particular to this structure? What about the other properties of this structure – like the ability to generate a pulse of expression? I was left without a clear sense of how generalizable the findings are and what they mean broadly. Without this sense of general importance it is hard for me to see why this paper out to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> rather than in a more particular molecular biology journal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This study shows that evolution in ammonium-limited chemostats repeatedly selects for modulation of the DNA binding affinity of GAT1, one of the transcription factors controlling nitrogen catabolite repression. Due to it being a part of an incoherent type-1 feedforward loop, this alteration in binding affinity results in an increased expression of MEP2, a high-affinity ammonium transporter. This increase ultimately results in an improved fitness in ammonium-limited conditions. As such, network motifs like feedforward loops might facilitate adaptive tuning of gene expression.</p><p>This is an elegant study highlighting the importance of network motifs, such as feedforward loops, a nuance often overlooked up until now in the interpretation of experimental evolution data. One of the major strengths of this study is the reproducibility of the experimental evolution, exemplifying that this mechanism of adaptive gene expression tuning might be more general than previously thought. Granted the authors take some of the below-mentioned comments and concerns into account, this study will certainly improve our understanding of the dynamics of evolution.</p><p>• Something that is not really explored in this study, is the influence of GAT1 mutations on its own expression. The data suggest that its expression is also increased (even more than MEP2). This fact is never mentioned in the interpretation of the data, but it might be very important. It is also not included in the mathematical model, which seems a bit simple. As previously said, the expression of GAT1 also depends on the level of GAT1 itself and even on the expression of DAL80. On the other hand, DAL80 supposedly also influences its own expression, and this is also not included in the model. These are very important parts of the feedforward loop, so in my opinion a better model could be made, more resembling the real structure of a feedforward loop. These facts should also be incorporated in the interpretations and discussions.</p><p>• The authors suggest several times that the mutation of the DNA-binding domain of GAT1 is a quick way to increase the expression of MEP2 during evolution, before the expression can be increased even more by duplicating MEP2. However, MEP2 expression is never measured in lineages with MEP2 CNVs. As such, the proposed progression of MEP2 expression during evolution is never really shown. As this is one of the main underlying assumptions (increased MEP2 expression equals increased fitness, and CNV has the highest expression), this is a crucial experiment to do. Measure expression and fitness for all lineages, including those with CNVs. Then, correlate this expression with fitness.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32323.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Report expression and fitness for all lineages, as suggested by reviewer #3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now quantified fitness and expression of lineages containing MEP2 amplification alleles.

The other direct activator of <italic>MEP2</italic> is GLN3 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). We find that GLN3 expression is not significantly altered in strains containing GAT1 variants (Supplementary file 1B).

This suggests that the increased expression is not attributable to changes in the activity of GLN3.

We revisited our data and made some interesting observations. First, we find that the residue mutated in the <italic>GAT1-1</italic> (W321L) allele is only hit once in our repeated evolution experiments whereas the residue mutated in the <italic>GAT1-3</italic> (R345G) allele is the most frequently mutated site (Figure 1E). In addition, <italic>GAT1-1</italic> shows significantly lower fitness compared to <italic>GAT1-3</italic> (R345G) (Figure 2B). Given these results, we suggest that selected GAT1 variants differ in their fitness effects, such that strongly reduced TF binding results in lower fitness increase than does a more moderate reduction in TF binding.

We explored using a more complicated model including GAT1 autoregulation and DAL80 self-inhibition. However, the model quickly becomes unwieldy because there are too many unknown parameters. Although the model we present is simple, our goal in constructing it was to test whether our experimental observation that decreased affinity for both MEP2 and DAL80 promoters is consistent with increased expression output of MEP2 as this seemed entirely counterintuitive. As we report, the model is consistent with our findings. We did not measure affinity of GAT1 variants for its own promoter, but as the reviewer points out our gene expression data indicate that GAT1 expression is increased. Therefore, we tested the effect of increased GAT1 expression on MEP2 expression output across the entire parameter space studied in Figure 4F. We find that increased GAT1 expression results in a linear increase in MEP2 expression. We have included this result in a new supplementary figure, Figure 4—figure supplement 2</p><p>“Figure 4—figure supplement 2.Increasing GAT1 expression results in increased MEP2 expression.
