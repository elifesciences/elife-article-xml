important for behaviors highly dependent on the correct sequencing and timing of muscle activity patterns, such as acoustic signaling. Acoustic signaling is an important communication modality for vertebrates, including many teleost fishes. Toadfishes are well known to exhibit high temporal fidelity in synchronous motoneuron firing within a hindbrain network directly determining the temporal structure of natural calls. Here, we investigated how these motoneurons maintain synchronous activation. We show that pronounced temporal precision in population-level motoneuronal firing depends on gap junction-mediated, glycinergic inhibition that generates a period of reduced probability of motoneuron activation. Super-resolution microscopy confirms glycinergic release sites formed by a subset of adjacent premotoneurons contacting motoneuron somata and dendrites. In aggregate, the evidence supports the hypothesis that gap junction-mediated, glycinergic inhibition provides a timing mechanism for achieving synchrony and temporal precision in the millisecond range for rapid modulation of acoustic waveforms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>toadfish</kwd><kwd>vocal system</kwd><kwd>opsanus beta</kwd><kwd>feed-forward</kwd><kwd>network</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1457108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bass</surname><given-names>Andrew H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1656664</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bass</surname><given-names>Andrew H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC870/B17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chagnaud</surname><given-names>Boris P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition provides a means for achieving temporal precision for rapid modulation of an acoustic signal in a vertebrate vocal network.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Complex behaviors often depend on temporally precise neuronal firing that coordinates network activity at brain levels ranging from cortical microcircuits to hindbrain pattern generators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Llinás, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kros et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sober et al., 2018</xref>). Mechanisms known to increase precision at single cell and network levels include, for instance, feed-forward inhibition in auditory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Grothe, 2003</xref>), recurrent inhibitory input in cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>), and neuronal synchrony in cortical and sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tiesinga and Sejnowski, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Uhlhaas et al., 2010</xref>). Synchronous, concurrent activation of neurons is widely distributed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Llinás, 2014</xref>) and especially important for behaviors requiring both rapid and precise motoneuron activation such as electrogenesis in fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bennett, 1971</xref>) and vocalization in fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chagnaud et al., 2012</xref>) and tetrapods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kwong-Brown et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several mechanisms by themselves or in combination contribute to neuronal synchrony: coherent excitatory firing, electrotonic coupling, and inhibitory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Singer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Uhlhaas and Singer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kapfer et al., 2007</xref>). While coherent (i.e., phasic) input leads to neuronal coupling mainly by excitation, inhibition might be the predominant way to synchronize activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Van Vreeswijk et al., 1994</xref>). Electrotonic coupling enhances synchrony by spreading voltage changes, for example, during synaptic inputs, that lead to concomitant membrane potential changes within an electrotonic, interconnected population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bennett and Zukin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pereda, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Unlike motor systems controlling locomotion and respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ramirez and Baertsch, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Grillner and El Manira, 2020</xref>), in-depth inquiries of cellular and network properties of brainstem neurons influencing acoustic signaling remain relatively unexplored, despite advances in characterizing the musculoskeletal periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kwong-Brown et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Riede et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bowling et al., 2020</xref>). A neurobehavioral challenge often facing soniferous species is fine temporal control of rapid modulations of acoustic waveforms.</p><p>The vocal network of toadfishes, a marine order of teleosts that is highly dependent on acoustic signaling for social interactions and successful reproduction, exhibits unusually high levels of synchronous activity, making it ideal for investigating mechanisms underlying precise neuronal firing (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bass et al., 2015</xref>). This includes Gulf toadfish (<italic>Opsanus beta</italic>), the species studied here, which produce two main types of vocalizations with pulse repetition rates (PRRs) in the range of ~200–250 Hz – broadband agonistic grunts and multiharmonic advertisement calls known as boatwhistles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tavolga, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Winn, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maruska and Mensinger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elemans et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bass et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Toadfish vocalization and underlying vocal motor circuity, which includes electrotonically coupled glycinergic neurons.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photograph of Gulf toadfish (courtesy of Aaron Rice, Cornell Lab of Ornithology) and waveform of toadfish vocalization (blue) composed of a grunt and a boatwhistle recorded with a hydrophone.

These roots give rise to the vocal nerve, which innervates a single pair of so-called ‘superfast’ muscles attached to the swim bladder that have physiological and molecular properties allowing them to generate power at frequencies 20–100-fold greater than fast and slow twitch muscle, respectively (avian syrinx, bat larynx and rattlesnake shaker also have superfast muscles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rome, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mead et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nelson et al., 2018</xref>). To achieve high contraction rates, toadfish superfast muscles require precise neural input provided by the vocal motor volley, termed fictive vocalization in electrophysiological preparations, that is a highly stereotyped, repetitive series of compound nerve potentials (VOC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) (motor volleys driving non-superfast muscles, e.g., those used in limb movement, show low temporal coincidence; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McLean et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Berkowitz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chagnaud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Song et al., 2016</xref>). Individual VOC potentials arise from synchronous motoneuron activity in the midline vocal motor nucleus (VMN) and are matched 1:1 with individual motoneuron action potentials (APs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bass and Baker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chagnaud et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>) and synchronous contraction of superfast vocal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elemans et al., 2014</xref>). Each individual VOC potential represents the synchronous activity of VMN motoneurons; variable potential amplitude reflects different levels of synchronous motoneuron firing and motoneuron recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chagnaud et al., 2012</xref>). VOC potential amplitude is easily quantified and serves as a convenient readout of the extent of VMN synchrony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chagnaud et al., 2012</xref>). VOCs occur either spontaneously or can be evoked by brief trains of low amplitude, electrical microstimulation in midbrain sites comparable to the periaqueductal gray of birds and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kittelberger and Bass, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Motoneurons possess 3–5 main dendritic branches and an axon arising from a primary dendrite or soma that lacks collaterals and exits the brain ipsilaterally via the vocal tract (VoTr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d, e</xref>) and joins the ipsilateral vocal nerve root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bass and Baker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>). Each VMN is bilaterally innervated by adjacent vocal pacemaker neurons (VPN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d, e</xref>) that provide coherent excitatory input and determine VMN firing rate that directly translates into PRR or F<sub>0</sub> (see above) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bass and Baker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>). Both VPN and VMN receive input from a more rostral vocal prepacemaker nucleus (VPP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) that encodes call duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Pappas and Bennett discovered the VMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref>) and showed, along with studies of electric fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bennett, 1971</xref>), the contribution of electrotonic coupling to motoneuronal synchrony. This included ultrastructure evidence for gap junction contacts between VMN motoneurons and axons of unidentified origin (likely VPN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bass and Marchaterre, 1989</xref>). More recent studies show that vocal nerve labeling with gap junction impassable tracers only leads to dense retrograde labeling of the ipsilateral VMN, while gap junction passable tracers lead to dense transneuronal, bilateral labeling of VMN, VPN, and VPP (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>). Besides electrotonic coupling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref> speculated that inhibitory input to the VMN arose from recurrent inhibitory activity (antidromic stimulation of vocal nerve led to hyperpolarization (HYP) at high, but not low, stimulation amplitudes). How this putative inhibition could be induced by activating motoneuron axons in the vocal nerve remained to be tested.</p><p>Recent studies of other motor systems provide a framework for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref> observations by showing a role for electrotonic coupling between motoneurons and (inhibitory) premotoneurons in patterning vocalization in frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lawton et al., 2017</xref>) and locomotion in adult zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Song et al., 2016</xref>) and larval flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matsunaga et al., 2017</xref>). We also recently reported in Gulf toadfish a subset of glycinergic VPN neurons transneuronally labeled with the gap junction passable tracer neurobiotin, strongly suggestive of electrotonic coupling within the vocal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rosner et al., 2018</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Could the electrotonically coupled glycinergic premotoneurons be involved in the patterning of motoneuron firing in the toadfish vocal pattern generator, as shown for other motor systems?</p><p>Here, we took advantage of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref> intracellular recording approach, especially the use of antidromic nerve stimulation to investigate electrotonic coupling, to reveal intrinsic and network properties underlying concurrent motoneuron firing in the VMN. We provide evidence demonstrating coherent, high-frequency excitatory input as well as inhibitory glycinergic input to VMN motoneurons contributing to coordinated network activity. We further show that a strong HYP in these motoneurons after spiking (also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref>), not seen during intracellular current injection, enhances synchronized vocal network activity and that HYP amplitude directly depends on motoneuron population activation. Next, using pharmacology combined with antidromic stimulation, we provide evidence that glycinergic VPN neurons activated via electrotonic coupling can account for the HYP. In aggregate, these findings strongly suggest that the HYP is mediated by a glycinergic inhibition dependent on gap junctional coupling. Besides its potential involvement in motoneuronal patterning, as recently shown in locomotor systems (see above), this provides an adaptive mechanism to enhance temporal precision in the activation of acoustic signaling networks and perhaps time coding in other motor systems requiring high levels of precision.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All statistical results are summarized in a table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">supplementary file 1</xref> (see Materials and methods for details on the test used).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synchronous motoneuron firing and post-spiking HYP</title><p>Midbrain stimulation led to membrane depolarizations in motoneurons that increased in amplitude until a single AP was fired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a1, 2</xref>).

In cases where intracellular current injection elicited an AP, motoneurons showed rapid adaptation of AP firing, likely due to weak somatic repolarization ability (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Gulf toadfish are, however, able to repetitively contract their superfast vocal muscles for several hundred milliseconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). How can the muscle achieve this if motoneurons cannot fire for extended time periods due to the rapid AP adaptation seen during square pulse current injections? To test whether the HYP was required to de-inactivate motoneurons, we stimulated the motoneurons in which current injection led to AP firing with pulse trains of different frequencies. In contrast to long (&gt;50 ms) duration pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), motoneurons showed no signs of AP adaptation to pulse trains with brief (&lt;5 ms) pulses, indicating the necessity of membrane repolarization for sustained motoneuron firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Stimulation was reliable into the behaviorally relevant physiological range (the PRR/fundamental frequency of toadfish vocalizations) with train frequencies tested up to 110 Hz. The weak repolarization capability and low excitability of the motoneurons thus provide the means to prevent sustained AP firing, which would decrease the extent of firing synchrony and precision across the VMN population.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Network activity induces HYP</title><p>The presence of the HYP only at high antidromic stimulation amplitudes, that is, high levels of motoneuron recruitment, strongly suggested a network-dependent activation of the HYP. To test this hypothesis, we ipsilaterally evoked an AP antidromically in a VMN motoneuron (ad-ipsi) at low threshold stimulation (i.e., without an HYP), followed by stimulation of the contralateral nerve (ad-contra), which resulted in a small electrotonic depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a, b</xref>). Subsequently, the delay of this second stimulation was reduced up to the time point of the first ipsilateral nerve stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Once close to the antidromic AP, an HYP started to appear that increased in amplitude the closer the contralateral-evoked potential came to the ipsilateral-evoked antidromic AP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>; heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). These experiments suggested that an increase in overall depolarization in the vocal network is needed to generate the HYP. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the prominent, wide depolarization that often appeared in motoneurons at the end of a VOC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2c</xref>).

With decreasing lag between the antidromically evoked potential and the depolarization during the VOC, an HYP started to appear in the contralateral-evoked potential that increased in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c, d</xref>).

After intracellular iontophoresis of QX314, motoneurons exhibited a small, but significant, decrease in AP amplitude compared to baseline conditions during VOCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>) (baseline: 31 ± 2.67 mV vs. QX314: 27.27 ± 2.53 mV; n = 7, N = 2; p=0.015).

This seemingly contradictory result is likely due to the electrotonic coupling of the network where other motoneurons contribute to the potential of individual motoneurons. Even though unlikely, due to the effect on the antidromic AP, an alternative interpretation is that an insufficient quantity of QX 314 was injected. Manipulation of only one out of the hundreds of motoneurons in VMN via QX314 injections is thus not sufficient to reveal the full extent of the HYP activity. These experiments demonstrated that (i) the contribution of the recorded motoneuronal AP firing to the firing of that motoneuron is rather small during VOC activity (the activity of the neuron is dominated by gap junction-coupled potentials); (ii) during a VOC, the HYP amplitude of the recorded neuron only partly depends on its firing an AP (also see above); and (iii) most of the activity displayed by a given motoneuron reflects population-level motoneuronal activity.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Network activity and gap junctional coupling are essential to generate the motoneuron hyperpolarization (HYP).</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) Baseline (black) intracellular recording of vocal motor nucleus (VMN) neuron action potentials (APs) and with QX314-filled electrodes (blue) during fictive vocal activity (top trace vocal nerve, VN) (<bold>a</bold>) and ipsilateral antidromic stimulation (<bold>b</bold>).

An important and novel role of gap junctional coupling in the toadfish vocal network is its involvement in generating the prominent HYP in toadfish motoneurons detected during both midbrain-evoked VOCs and antidromic motoneuron stimulation. This HYP, which could not be elicited upon intracellular current injection, is essential to generating vocalizations with high temporal precision.</p><p>A distinguishing temporal feature between grunts and boatwhistles, the two main call types of toadfishes, is the greater stability of time intervals between successive sound pulses in boatwhistles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Maruska and Mensinger, 2009</xref>), which is also the case for the grunt and boatwhistle-like ‘hum’ of midshipman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brantley and Bass, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McIver et al., 2014</xref>). Our results strongly imply a salient role for glycinergic premotoneurons in determining this temporal feature of toadfish calls that varies with social context (aggression versus courtship). Interestingly, for fish of both sexes collected during the non-breeding season, the HYP did not appear during antidromic stimulation, although it was present during the VOC (not shown). While we did not quantify this result, a seasonal variability in the expression of the HYP upon antidromic stimulation appeared to be present. This variation might be due to the previously observed seasonal variability in expression levels of connexin transcripts in the closely related midshipman fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Feng et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Feedback or feed-forward inhibition?</title><p>Our antidromic stimulation experiment suggests a feedback loop of glycinergic inhibitory neurons activated upon by depolarization of the VMN–VPN network. Antidromic activation is a highly artificial condition in which depolarizations are first elicited in VMN, and then transmitted via gap junctions to VPN. Thus, a recurrent inhibitory pathway is activated during antidromic stimulation. However, the shorter latency of the inhibitory potential during vocalization compared to antidromic activation argues against a recurrent inhibition hypothesis and favors a feed-forward hypothesis. During natural vocal behavior, VPN would be feeding forward to VMN, given that VPN fires before VMN during VOCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bass and Baker, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>). Consequently, excitatory VPN neurons could activate VPN’s glycinergic neurons, via elecrotonic coupling, before the motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This condition is far more likely considering the temporal appearance of the HYP during vocal behavior compared to antidromic (unnatural) conditions. Electrotonic coupling of VPN excitatory neurons to glycinergic VPN neurons thus most likely activates the latter, which causes feed-forward inhibitory action upon motoneurons. Electrophysiological recordings from VPN glycinergic neurons during vocal activity are, however, needed to verify this hypothesis. If proven, we expect these neurons to fire rhythmically like other VPN neurons directly coupled to VMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Anatomical evidence for local activation within VPN comes from transneuronal labeling of local VPN neurons after filling an intracellulary-recorded VPN neuron with neurobiotin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>). While optogenetic inactivation of VPN could provide evidence for this anatomical substrate in the antidromic activation, optogenetic tools are not yet available in toadfishes. Due to the close proximity of VPN to VMN, and its bilateral organization into extended columns along the length of VMN, pharmacological or surgical approaches appear impossible in VPN. Due to the difficulties in obtaining VPN recordings, dual intracellular recordings from VMN and VPN neurons have proven very difficult in the intact preparation (B. Chagnaud, personal observations).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Summary of proposed action of glycinergic vocal pacemaker nucleus (VPN) neurons in the activation sequence generating vocal behavior.</title><p>Temporal activation of the hyperpolarization strongly suggests a feed-forward inhibitory role.

This can only be via electrotonic coupling of glycinergic VPN neurons to the vocal network. Activation of motoneuron axons by antidromic stimulation results in motoneuron depolarization as the AP invades the soma and dendrites. Due to synchronous axon activation, the potential of a substantial number of motoneurons is changed (at high stimulation amplitudes). The potential change in motoneurons is conducted to VPN premotoneurons via electrotonic junctions as premotoneurons are smaller and much more easily excited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>) than motoneurons. This, in turn, would activate other VPN neurons, including glycinergic ones electrically coupled to VMN and VPN neurons via gap junctions. While transneuronal labeling supports glycinergic VPN neurons being coupled to the VMN network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rosner et al., 2018</xref>), we do not know if they contact motoneurons or premotoneurons via gap junctions. Unfortunately, we have so far been unsuccessful using electron microscopy together with the available antibodies for dual labeling of glycinergic and gap junction synapses. In any case, glycinergic neurons are activated and project via a chemical synapse onto motoneurons.</p><p>Inhibitory action in this network can serve multiple functions. First, it repolarizes motoneurons, a feature essential to VMN’s ability to repetitively fire APs, as seen by our pulse train experiments. Second, it generates a window of decreased excitability that prevents motoneuron misfiring outside of the VPN rhythm due to the long time course of inhibitory action compared to the normal activation rhythm of ca. 100 Hz (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This is essential to the ability of the next incoming excitatory input of rhythmically firing VPN neurons to set the firing frequency of vocal motoneurons. A gap junction-mediated, feed-forward glycinergic inhibition could account for temporal patterning in the millisecond time range that characterizes the vocal network and behavior of toadfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pappas and Bennett, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bass and Baker, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chagnaud et al., 2012</xref>).

This would mean that excitatory potentials from the VMN network are shunted by the presumed feed-forward inhibitory action, while the inhibitory potentials would be allowed to travel through gap junctions to contribute to VPN patterning (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chagnaud et al., 2011</xref>). Further recordings from VPN neurons are needed to test the contribution of motoneurons to their pattern generating ability.

From a behavioral perspective, call types differing in temporal properties, including PRR, indicate behavioral state. For example, brief, broadband signals with variable PRRs such as grunts (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) inform conspecifics of an aggressive state during defense of resources such as nest sites, whereas mutliharmonic advertisement calls with a more stable PRR (i.e., F<sub>0</sub>) like the boatwhistle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) can function as courtship signals, indicating readiness to mate (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bass and McKibben, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ladich et al., 2006</xref>).

The principal limitation to call PRR and F<sub>0</sub> in species like toadfishes that generate calls with frequency content mainly below 500 Hz is muscle contraction rate that determines swim bladder vibration rate. A superfast motor system, driven by a central network that directly determines high temporal precision in synchronous activation of muscle fibers to maximize call amplitude as well as PRR and F<sub>0</sub>, enhances transmission distance.

Even more broadly, they may contribute to time coding in other motor systems requiring high levels of precision.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top"><italic>Opsanus beta</italic></td><td valign="top">Gulf specimens (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gulfspecimen.org/">https://gulfspecimen.org/</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Specimens taken from the wild</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 568, polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:AB_143157">AB_143157</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-rabbit AlexaFluor 568, polyclonal</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:AB_2535805">AB_2535805</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-glycine, rabbit, polyclonal</td><td valign="top">MoBiTec</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RRID:AB_2560949">AB_2560949</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:200</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-synaptic vesicle protein 2, monoclonal</td><td valign="top">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2315387">AB_2315387</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:50</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">488 anti-streptavidin</td><td valign="top">Jackson ImmunoResearch Labs</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2337249">AB_2337249</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">IGOR PRO</td><td valign="top">Wavemetrics</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_000325">SCR_000325</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">pClamp</td><td valign="top">Molecular devices</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">NeuroMatic</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com">http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com</ext-link></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_004186">SCR_004186</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Gulf toadfish of both sexes (n = 18; six females, standard length: 11.7–13.6 cm; 12 males, 15.3–25.7 cm) were obtained from a commercial source (Gulf Specimen, Panacea, FL) and housed in saltwater aquaria in an environmental control room held at 22°C on a 14:10 hr light:dark cycle.

Animals were deeply anesthetized during all surgical procedures (immersion in aquarium water containing 0.025% benzocaine [ethyl p-amino benzoate]; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). For antidromic stimulation of VMN motoneurons, bipolar silver wire electrodes insulated with enamel except at the tips (0.15 mm diameter; 0.3 mm between tips) were implanted at the level of the swim bladder between each muscle and the bladder wall, immediately adjacent to the vocal nerve. A dorsal craniotomy was performed to expose the brainstem and the paired occipital nerves that give rise to the vocal nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>). After surgery, animals received an intramuscular injection of bupivacaine anesthetic (0.25%; Abbott Laboratories, Chicago, IL) with 0.01 mg/ml epinephrine (International Medication Systems, El Monte, CA) near the wound site, and then an intramuscular trunk injection of the muscle relaxant pancuronium bromide (0.1–1 μg/g of body weight); bupivacaine was administered every four hours until euthanasia. Animals were placed in a plexiglass tank and perfused over the gills with artificial seawater at 18–20°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Monitoring and activation of vocal motor behavior</title><p>Teflon-coated, silver wire electrodes (75 μm diameter) with exposed ball tips (50–100 μm diameter) were used to record the vocal motor volley, hereafter referred to as a fictive vocalization (VOC), from the vocal nerves that innervate the vocal muscles attached to the swim bladder. Signals were amplified 1000-fold and band-pass filtered (300–5000 Hz) with a differential AC amplifier (Model 1700, A-M Systems). VOCs were evoked by current pulses delivered to vocal midbrain areas via insulated tungsten electrodes (5 MΩ impedance; A-M Systems). For display purposes, electrical artifacts were truncated in the illustrations (marked by black arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Current pulses were delivered via a constant current source (model 305-B, World Precision Instruments). A stimulus generator (A310 Accupulser, World Precision Instruments) was used to generate TTL pulses with a standard stimulus of five pulses at 200 Hz. Each pulse train equaled one stimulus delivery with inter-stimulus intervals of 1 s. During recordings, inter-pulse intervals (100–300 Hz) and total pulse number (2–10) varied. Occasionally, VOCs also occurred spontaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Neurophysiological recordings</title><p>Glass micropipettes (A-M Systems) for intracellular recordings were pulled on a horizontal puller (P97, Sutter Instruments) and were filled with either a 5% neurobiotin solution in 0.5 M KCOOH (resistance 35–50 MΩ) or with 2 M KCOOH. Neuronal signals were amplified 100-fold (Biomedical Engineering) and digitized at a rate of 20 kHz (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices) using pCLAMP 9 software (Axon Instruments). An external clock (Biomedical Engineering) sending TTL pulses was used to synchronize stimulus delivery and data acquisition. Electrode resistance was monitored while searching for neurons by a current step applied to the recording electrode. In some cases, small amounts of negative current were applied to stabilize the membrane potential after penetration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Pharmacological manipulations</title><p>The dorsal roots at the level of the vocal occipital roots were cut with iridectomy scissors in two animals. We first recorded the activity of several motoneurons before and several after the transsection. To quantify the contribution of voltage-dependent sodium channels to single motoneuron activity, QX 314-containing electrodes (100 mM in 2 M KCOOH) were used to impale motoneurons and QX314 was electrically driven into the neurons via current injections. The firing patterns directly after the impaling of the neuron and after QX314 injection were compared in the same neurons.</p><p>To block gap junction coupling, a CBX solution (10 mM in 0.1 M PB) was injected into the VMN with micropipettes (tip diameters, 20–30 µm). Due to the long time course of gap junction blockage, CBX was also superfused over the fourth ventricle that lies directly above the VMN (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rozental et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Beaumont and Maccaferri, 2011</xref>). After waiting 30–40 min for the CBX to take effect, recordings were resumed.</p><p>Strychnine (10 mM in 0.1 M PB) was applied as described above for CBX to block glycine receptors, respectively. After baseline recordings, the pipette solution was pressure-ejected using a picospritzer (Biomedical) set to deliver three pulses, 10–50 ms duration each, at 25–30 PSI at three locations along the rostro-caudal axis of the VMN. Baseline and post-injection vocal activity was recorded from five motoneurons prior to and after strychnine injections in multiple animals.</p><p>Lastly, 3 M KCl-filled electrodes were used to increase intracellular chloride concentration in order to reveal inhibitory input. After electrode penetration and a brief recording of baseline activity, current injection was used to drive chloride ions into the recorded motoneuron, after which its activity was further recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Neuronal data were processed using Igor pro 6 (Wavemetrics), the software package neuromatic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com">http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com</ext-link>) with custom written scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chagnaud, 2020</xref>). The firing pattern of VMN neurons was visualized using a phase plane plot of the recorded voltage (<italic>V</italic>) against the difference in voltage over time (d<italic>V</italic>/d<italic>t</italic>). Summary graphs were generated using the ggplot2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wickham, 2016</xref>). Violin plots show the distribution of data from all traces, superimposed with the predicted means and standard error from the model. Statistical analysis was performed with R (3.5.1) using the lme4 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) with consultation provided by the Cornell University Statistical Consulting Unit. Data were fit with linear mixed models, treating neuron and animal as random effects, with neuron nested within animal, thus accounting for the nonindependence of multiple recordings of neurons from the same fish. If residual plots revealed that the assumptions of a linear model were not met, data were fit using a generalized linear mixed model. Statistical significance values were determined using the lmerTest package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>), fitted using restricted maximum likelihood and the Satterthwaite approximation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Luke, 2017</xref>). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Effect sizes, reported as Cohen’s d, were calculated using the EMAtools package. AP and HYP amplitude were measured as follows: the baseline was evaluated by averaging 10 s prior to the stimulus; the maximum and minimum amplitude was then determined during a 30 s window after the stimulation pulse for multiple traces of different neurons. To account for differences in RMP across neurons, we calculated the voltage difference from baseline and included RMP as a covariate. For repeated measures from the same neuron (QX314 and KCl injections), a random coefficient for the effect of treatment on neuron was included. To quantify the effect of strychnine on the variability of motoneuron ISI, we calculated the coefficient of variation from the interval between the first and second spikes across all traces from a given neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Vocal motoneuron labeling and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Surgical and nerve labeling methods follow those in prior neuroanatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chagnaud and Bass, 2014</xref>). As with neurophysiology (see above), animals were deeply anesthetized during all surgical procedures by immersion in aquarium water containing 0.025% benzocaine. Following ventral exposure of one vocal nerve at the rostral pole of the swim bladder, crystals of 10 kDa dextran-biotin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were applied to the cut end of the nerve. Two juvenile males were deeply anesthetized by immersion in aquarium water containing 0.025% benzocaine and then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB; all Sigma); survival times were 2 (5.3 cm, standard length) or 4 (10.8 cm) days. Brains were postfixed for 1 hr, and then washed and stored in 0.1 M PB at 4°C. Prior to sectioning, brains were transferred to 30% sucrose in 0.1 M PB overnight at 4°C. Brains were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrence, CA), cryo-sectioned at 25 µm in the transverse plane, and collected onto Superfrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

The authors provide support for the hypothesis that the presence of the AHP at high levels of motoneuron recruitment strongly suggests a network-dependent activation of the AHP. There are some concerns that detract from my enthusiasm for an otherwise thorough study. Principally these concerns stem from unsupported statements, but unfortunately, the paper also does not identify the source of the glycinergic neurons.</p><p>1) The synchronous firing does not conform to the typical performance for extreme temporal precision in motoneuronal firing, I suggest the authors modify these statements. The authors state &quot;The extent of temporal precision across an entire neuronal population generated in toadfish far exceeds the magnitude of synchronization known for other vocal circuits&quot;, but provide no data to support the statement.</p><p>2) The authors make a strong case for network-dependent activation of the AHP, via glycine action. First, glycinergic roles in achieving temporal precision are well known (see Grothe references, for example). The network action is interesting, and the authors convincingly demonstrate the presence of glycinergic boutons. Nevertheless, since the role of glycine in AHP is the major finding, it would seem important to identify the source of this input.</p><p>3) With respect to the AHP, the authors write that it is essential to generating a highly synchronous motor output...with extreme temporal precision, but do not test this hypothesis.</p><p>4) Some data do not appear to contribute to the paper in a significant way. For example, the intracellular injections of chloride to not appear to add to our understanding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors report recordings from swim bladder muscle motoneurons and their inputs to study the capacity of toadfish to rapidly set its swim bladder muscles into sustained and rapid oscillation, a feature that clearly requires a degree of synchrony of firing in the motoneurons. The authors also report evidence suggestive of feed-forward inhibition in this system which would be remarkable in this system. Pharmacological experiments and SR-SIM microscopy on dextran-filled motoneurons support the notion of feedforward-inhibition and narrow down the nature of the chemical synapses involved. In its present stage I do however have a number of major concerns that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) Novelty-concerns. It is essential that the authors clarify in how far their measurements and interpretation go beyond those reported in Pappas and Bennett, 1966. This study already reports many of the experiments that are presented here and so it would be important to work out as clearly as possible the specific focus of the present study. This would probably also help to substantially shorten the complex manuscript and to emphasize the specific merits of the new findings.</p><p>2) Direct evidence for feedforward inhibition.</p><p>All findings nicely fit together and are very clearly compatible with feedforward inhibition but they are not yet conclusive (and the authors are very clear about this point). I imagine that it will be very difficult to try double intracellular recordings and I therefore do not want to suggest experiments that simply cannot be done in this system. But I wonder whether it might be feasible to attempt multiple simultaneous patch-clamp recordings for an additional line of reasoning?</p><p>3) “ultra precise temporal patterning”</p><p>While it is clear that the activity must cause powerful in-phase contractions of the swim bladder I fail to see why this requires “ultra-precise temporal patterning”. With a jitter of 1.5 ms in a periodic event of 4 ms the coefficient of variation is in the low-accuracy range of periodic biological phenomena. I think the term is more of an obstacle for seeing the beauty of the system. It should either be explained better or avoided.</p><p>4) Basic writing, Figures, Data presentation: I found the manuscript exceptionally difficult to read, although I am sure that the authors thought very carefully about what they report. I strongly suggest that all figure legends (including the supplementary figures) should start with a first sentence that says what lesson is to be learned from the particular figure.</p><p>My prediction is that the paper would very much profit from shortening and from a focus on the specific effects that are (A) new relative to the pioneering work e.g. of Pappas and Bennett (1966 )and (B) makes the system interesting despite the wonderful and direct evidence on feed-forward inhibition in the particularly accessible Mauthner system. Also, a small schematic of the proposed connections might be helpful to shorten the text and to guide readers of what’s currently examined. Regarding data presentation: All N's need to reported with an indication of how many trials were contributed from each preparation. e.g, 3 fish, 7 cells, with n=2 to 9 recordings each. All asterisks and stats should also be explained in the figure legends as well as details shown in the figures (e.g. scaling/labels in the phase plots etc)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors carried out a series of elegant electrophysiological and anatomical experiments and identified glycine-mediated hyperpolarization after spiking that appear to be important for temporal patterns of the vocalizations produced by the toadfish. By comparing intracellular recordings obtained from the vocal motor neurons during fictive vocalizations, current step injections, and antidromic stimulation, the authors were able to make a great advance in the understanding of how neuronal activity is synchronized. However, there are some issues that I will list below.</p><p>1) The authors propose that the glycinergic inputs that mediate HYP originate from the premotor nucleus, which presumably are activated by descending inputs in a feed-forward manner. However, they did not perform a critical experiment to make this conclusion. VPN should be removed (either pharmacologically or surgically) from the vocal circuitry and examine if the action potentials elicited by the antidromic stimulation is followed by HYP. If VPN is the source of glycinergic inputs, HYP is expected to be absent in this preparation. Given that this is one of the major conclusions of the manuscript, the experiment is necessary.</p><p>2) In most electrophysiological experiments, the authors repeated experiments multiple times using the same neuron, and treated each data as an independent sample (n=21 from 5 neurons, for example). However, the replicate data are still obtained from the same cell, so they cannot be considered as independent samples. Thus, the issue of pseudoreplication should be rectified.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Gap junction mediated glycinergic inhibition ensures precise temporal patterning in vocal behavior&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I think it was really worth the effort. The importance of the work, its major thrust, and its underlying logic and importance have become clear now as has its building upon the findings of Pappas and Bennet, its novelty, its neuroethological importance, and potential significance on a wider scope. I enjoyed reading the new manuscript and also seeing its remarkable transformation. I have just very few remaining points that should be addressed but do not require formal revision.</p><p>1) The interpretation of the experiments with intracellularly injected QX314 is convincing but should be complemented with something to convince readers that you would have gotten sufficient QX314 into the neurons and (if possible) to say that QX314 also acts on the sodium channels in the acoustic motoneurons you used. I am asking, because a positive control (with an isolated motoneuron) is impossible. Perhaps positive controls from a test injection into a similar sized neuron, when available, would help. In the event that nothing could be said on this point, then it would be important to add that, even though unlikely, QX314 may not have been injected in insufficient quantity.</p><p>2) Subsection “Dependence of HYP activation on glycinergic inhibitory input to VMN” paragraph two. 400 ms: is this really correct? Why would this be a “short” delay? If not a typo I'd be lost here. And: p23 l712 were any controls made to say that the injection would have gotten enough substance into the neuron?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59390.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

By no means was it our intention not to give appropriate credit to Pappas and Bennett and if it came across that way then it was sloppy writing by us. We realize in hindsight that we should have been more direct about what we report compared to Pappas and Bennett (1966). We now do this in paragraphs six to eight of the Introduction and in sections of the Results (Vocal premotor neurons are excited by gap junctional coupling; Motoneuron electrical coupling and HYP [hyperpolarization], Vocal premotor neurons are excited by gap junctional coupling) and Discussion (Electrical coupling and inhibition in vocal network). We also more clearly state in paragraph six of the Introduction that Pappas and Bennett only speculated on the role of inhibition in output of the vocal (sonic) motor nucleus (VMN) without experimentally testing it. Unlike Pappas and Bennett, we provide evidence for glycinergic inhibition dependent on gap junctional coupling in this system. This rests upon: (1) evidence from gap junctional coupling of the inhibition (Results section: Motoneuron electrical coupling and HYP), (2) blocking gap junctions (Results: Pharmacological manipulations), (3) testing for glycinergic dependency of HYP (Results: Glycine-dependent HYP), (4) recording from motoneuron afferents whose identity was unknown at the time to show that they are VPN neurons, and that they could be activated by antidromic stimulation of motoneurons (the latter had been shown in part by Pappas and Bennett; Results: Vocal premotor neurons excited by gap junctional coupling). Paragraph four of the revised Introduction also more clearly explains that individual vocal nerve potentials in this neurophysiological preparation represent the synchronous firing of motoneurons. Perhaps equally important, the nerve potentials comprising an entire motor volley (<italic>fictive vocalization</italic>) determine the physical attributes of natural vocal behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are some concerns that detract from my enthusiasm for an otherwise thorough study. Principally these concerns stem from unsupported statements, but unfortunately, the paper also does not identify the source of the glycinergic neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>The need to better substantiate “unsupported statements” (also see response below to reviewer 2) largely arose from misinterpretations due to our writing style (this was clearly our fault), e.g., what we meant by synchrony (see below). We agree that it was critical to “identify the source of the glycinergic neurons“. As we stated in the original manuscript, “We previously identified a subpopulation of glycinergic VPN neurons, suggesting direct glycinergic input onto motoneurons (Rosner et al., 2018)”. Rosner et al. is a publication in the Journal of Comparative Neurology showing the location of transneuronally labeled (gap junction coupled) glycinergic somata within the column of vocal pacemaker neurons (We meant the delay between midbrain stimulation and antidromic stimulation). We deleted this statement as it added confusion.</p><p>That are adjacent to, and directly innervate, the VMN (see paragraph four of revised manuscript). This anatomical finding was one of the major reasons that we pursued the key glycinergic experiments reported in our manuscript. We have now revised Figure 1 to illustrate this background information (Figure 1F). The super resolution imaging in the current paper was intended to only show glycinergic synaptic boutons located on motoneuron somata, and whose presence we only speculated on in the earlier Journal of Comparative Neurology paper. As we also report (next to last section of Results), we recorded from VPN neurons to show that they can be electrotonically activated.</p><p>We have also revised the title of the paper in two major ways. We removed “ultra” from the title and from the text in response to the above and comments by reviewers 2 and 3 (see below). We also removed feed-forward from the title as this was too strong a claim – we now consider both feed-forward and feedback in the Discussion – Feed-forward or feedback inhibition?</p><p>In response to other major comments by reviewers and as discussed more below, we also changed the title of the manuscript and shortened and streamlined the manuscript in several ways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The synchronous firing does not conform to the typical performance for extreme temporal precision in motoneuronal firing, I suggest the authors modify these statements. The authors state &quot;The extent of temporal precision across an entire neuronal population generated in toadfish far exceeds the magnitude of synchronization known for other vocal circuits&quot;, but provide no data to support the statement.</p></disp-quote><p>Here is an example of where our writing appeared to mislead the reviewers to equate <italic>repetition rate</italic> with <italic>sychnrony</italic>. We recognize that we needed to do a much better job of clarifying this important point. This is now more completely explained in paragraph four of the Introduction. To test the contribution of single motoneurons to vocal network activity, we performed intracellular recordings of motoneurons using QX314 that blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels intracellularly (Figure 5). As stated in the Results, “These experiments demonstrated that (i) the contribution of the recorded motoneuronal AP firing to the firing of that motoneuron is rather small during VOC activity (the activity of the neuron is dominated by gap junction coupled potentials), (ii) during a VOC, the HYP amplitude of the recorded neuron only partly depends on its firing an AP, and (iii) most of the activity displayed by a given motoneuron reflects population-level motoneuronal activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors make a strong case for network-dependent activation of the AHP, via glycine action. First, glycinergic roles in achieving temporal precision are well known (see Grothe references, for example). The network action is interesting, and the authors convincingly demonstrate the presence of glycinergic boutons. Nevertheless, since the role of glycine in AHP is the major finding, it would seem important to identify the source of this input.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recognition that we <bold>“</bold>make a strong case for network-dependent activation of the AHP, via glycine action”. We cited Benedikt Grothe’s work already in the initial submission, although it is in a different context than ours: sensory vs motor (paragraph one, Introduction). As stated above, we described the cells of origin of the glycinergic input in Rosner et al., 2018.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With respect to the AHP, the authors write that it is essential to generating a highly synchronous motor output…with extreme temporal precision, but do not test this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an example of a flaw in our writing that likely misled the reviewers as to what we meant by <italic>synchronous motor output</italic> and thus also appeared to be an <italic>unsupported statement</italic> (see above). As stated above, the QX314 experiment showed that during a VOC, the recorded neuron only partly contributes to the recorded response; it more completely depends on synchronous population-level motoneuron activity. The influence of the HYP on synchronous motor output was tested by injecting strychnine into the vocal motor nucleus (VMN). Immediately after strychnine injection, the HYP of VMN motoneurons disappeared. Similarly, the HYP during antidromic stimulation was completely abolished, symptomatic of decreased synchrony within the VMN population. After strychnine injections, spontaneous VOCs appeared with similar decreases in motoneuron HYP amplitude not seen for spontaneous VOCs under control conditions without prior strychnine injections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some data do not appear to contribute to the paper in a significant way. For example, the intracellular injections of chloride to not appear to add to our understanding.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer comment and modified the text. We believe, however, that a paper dealing with inhibition that does not change the chloride reversal potential of neurons is not complete.

We hope to have now done a much better job of making this distinction in the latter half of paragraph four of the Introduction (sentence beginning “The motor volley’s highly stereotyped, repetitive series…”). When an entire nucleus with hundreds of neurons fires within 1.5 ms, that is synchronous.

This section first presents anatomical results, originally a separate section at the end of the Results, showing glycinergic contacts on vocal motoneuron somata and dendrites. We then focus on glycine-related neurophysiology. We removed the results showing effect of bicuculline injection as these were redundant with prior ones reported for the closely related midshipman fish.

Given that this is one of the major conclusions of the manuscript, the experiment is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>It would be great to remove VPN (either pharmacologically or surgically), from the vocal circuitry and examine if the action potentials elicited by the antidromic stimulation is followed by a HYP.

However, the replicate data are still obtained from the same cell, so they cannot be considered as independent samples. Thus, the issue of pseudoreplication should be rectified.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our analyses and illustrations to address this important issue.To account for the non-independence of multiple recordings of neurons from the same animal, we reanalyzed our data using linear and generalized linear mixed models. This approach accommodates nested data structures, avoiding issues of pseudoreplication. This statistical correction only changed the following original result that had no consequences for the overall interpretation of the results. We originally reported that chloride injections reduced the antidromically evoked hyperpolarization. In the new analysis, this difference is no longer statistically significant (p = 0.093).</p><p>We originally only looked at intervals between VOC potentials after strychnine application. We now also look at the intervals between motoneuron action potentials, showing significant increases in the frequency of the interspike interval as well as in the variability of the intervals, as measured by the coefficient of variation.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have done a magnificent job in reorganizing and rewritten their manuscript and I would like to thank them for taking my concerns and those of my colleagues so seriously. I think it was really worth the effort. The importance of the work, its major thrust, and its underlying logic and importance have become clear now as has its building upon the findings of Pappas and Bennet, its novelty, its neuroethological importance, and potential significance on a wider scope. I enjoyed reading the new manuscript and also seeing its remarkable transformation. I have just very few remaining points that should be addressed but do not require formal revision.</p><p>1) The interpretation of the experiments with intracellularly injected QX314 is convincing but should be complemented with something to convince readers that you would have gotten sufficient QX314 into the neurons and (if possible) to say that QX314 also acts on the sodium channels in the acoustic motoneurons you used. I am asking, because a positive control (with an isolated motoneuron) is impossible. Perhaps positive controls from a test injection into a similar sized neuron, when available, would help. In the event that nothing could be said on this point, then it would be important to add that, even though unlikely, QX314 may not have been injected in insufficient quantity.</p></disp-quote><p>At this point it is not possible to do control injections, as the first author [who has done the physiological experiments; BPC] is on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean (Austria), yet the fishes are only available in the US. As requested by the reviewer we have added a statement into the text: “Even though unlikely, due to the effect on the antidromic AP, an alternative interpretation is that an insufficient quantity of QX 314 was injected.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Dependence of HYP activation on glycinergic inhibitory input to VMN” paragraph two. 400 ms: is this really correct? Why would this be a “short” delay? If not a typo I'd be lost here. And: p23 l712 were any controls made to say that the injection would have gotten enough substance into the neuron?</p></disp-quote><p>We meant the delay between midbrain stimulation and antidromic stimulation. We deleted this statement as it added confusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
