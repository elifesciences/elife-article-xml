values of future rewards. The phasic activity of midbrain dopamine neurons signals these values. Because reward values often change over time, even on a subsecond-by-subsecond basis, appropriate behavioral regulation requires continuous value monitoring. However, the phasic dopamine activity, which is sporadic and has a short duration, likely fails continuous monitoring. Here, we demonstrate a tonic firing mode of dopamine neurons that effectively tracks changing reward values. We recorded dopamine neuron activity in monkeys during a Pavlovian procedure in which the value of a cued reward gradually increased or decreased. Dopamine neurons tonically increased and decreased their activity as the reward value changed. This tonic activity was evoked more strongly by non-burst spikes than burst spikes producing a conventional phasic activity. Our findings suggest that dopamine neurons change their firing mode to effectively signal reward values in a given situation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine neuron</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>value</kwd><kwd><italic>Macaca fuscata</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI JP16H06567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsumoto</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CREST JPMJCR1853</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsumoto</surname><given-names>Masayuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although the phasic activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is known to represent reward values, these neurons displayed a tonic firing mode to continuously track reward values changing moment-by-moment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>We often experience situations in which the value of future rewards changes on a moment-by-moment basis. For example, as a bartender pours a cocktail into your glass, the amount (i.e., the value) of the cocktail that you will receive gradually increases. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been considered to function as a key neural substrate that signals reward values and regulates reward-seeking behavior. These neurons respond to rewards and reward-predicting cues with phasic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawagoe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Satoh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schultz, 1998</xref>). An influential theory proposed that such phasic activity of dopamine neurons represents reward prediction errors, discrepancies between obtained and predicted reward values, in reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doya, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), and the reward-evoked phasic activity of dopamine neurons has been shown to regulate this type of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stauffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the cue-evoked phasic activity of dopamine neurons has been reported to reflect the value of cued rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roesch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>) and has recently been demonstrated to influence behavior associated with cued rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morrens et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although a wealth of studies have revealed roles of the phasic dopamine neuron activity in reward processing, it is unclear whether the same principle is applicable to real-life situations. Indeed, if reward values gradually change moment-by-moment as in the cocktail situation described above, the phasic activity of dopamine neurons, which is sporadic and has a short duration (around a couple of hundred milliseconds), likely fails to continuously track these changing values. Therefore, the phasic activity seems to be unable to properly regulate reward-seeking behavior in changing environments in which reward values fluctuate. To address whether and how dopamine neurons signal changing reward values, we designed a Pavlovian procedure in which a visual cue indicated the value (i.e., the amount) of a liquid reward that gradually increased or decreased moment-by-moment. We recorded single-unit activity from dopamine neurons while macaque monkeys were conditioned with this Pavlovian procedure. Here, we demonstrate a tonic firing mode of dopamine neurons that effectively tracks changing reward values.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pavlovian procedure in which the value of a cued reward gradually changed</title><p>We designed a Pavlovian procedure with three different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>) and applied it to two macaque monkeys (monkey H and monkey P). In each condition, a bar stimulus with red and green areas was presented as a conditioned stimulus (CS) after a fixation period. The size of the green area indicated the amount (i.e., the value) of a liquid reward that the monkey would receive. The larger the green area became, the larger the associated reward value. In the first condition (value-increase condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the green area was minimal at the beginning and gradually increased (3.8Â°/s), thatÂ is, the reward value gradually increased (0.082 ml/s)Â (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The gradual increase randomly stopped within 2450 ms after the onset of the bar stimulus. In the second condition (value-decrease condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the green area was maximal at the beginning and gradually decreased (3.8Â°/s), thatÂ is, the reward value gradually decreased (0.082 ml/s)Â (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The gradual decrease randomly stopped within 2450 ms after the bar onset. In the third condition (value-fixed condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the size of the green area did not change and was instead fixed at the minimum, half, or maximum that predicted a 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 ml reward, respectively. In addition to these CSs, a CS with a longitudinally halved green area was included and was randomly followed by a 0.1-0.3 ml reward (i.e., the reward value was uncertain). In each condition, the monkeys received the reward indicated by the green area immediately after the offset of the bar stimulus. The delay between the CS onset and the reward delivery was fixed at 2850 ms in each condition and did not change across trials. Each condition consisted of a block of 50 trials and was repeated once or more for each recording session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pavlovian procedure in which the value of a cued reward gradually changed.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) Value-increase (<bold>A</bold>), value-decrease (<bold>B</bold>), and value-fixed (<bold>C</bold>) conditions in the Pavlovian procedure.

The monkeys were required to choose one of the bar stimuli by making a saccade. These bar stimuli were identical to those used in the Pavlovian procedure except that the green area did not increase or decrease. The size of the green area indicated the reward value and was randomly assigned to each bar stimulus. We observed that the monkeys were more likely to choose the bar stimulus with the larger green area, thatÂ is, the logistic regression slope between the choice rate of the right bar stimulus and the value difference (right barâs value â left barâs value) was significantly larger than zero (monkey H: nÂ =Â 85 sessions, mean Â± SDÂ =Â 0.94Â Â±Â 1.64, p=1.17Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â15</sup>; monkey P: nÂ =Â 68 sessions, mean Â± SDÂ =Â 0.98Â Â±Â 1.65, p=7.64Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â13</sup>; Wilcoxon signed-rank test)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This suggests that the monkeys correctly predicted the reward values according to the size of the green area.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tonic activity of dopamine neurons tracking gradually changing reward values</title><p>While the monkeys participated in the Pavlovian procedure, we recorded single-unit activity from 99 dopamine neurons (monkey H, nÂ =Â 46; monkey P, nÂ =Â 53) in and around the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref> for the characteristic spike waveforms of the recorded dopamine neurons). Here, we presumed that a possible way for dopamine neurons to signal changing reward values is to track the changing values by tonically increasing and decreasing their activity in parallel with the value change. Indeed, an example dopamine neuron tonically increased its activity as the reward value gradually increased in the value-increase condition (left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This tonic increase in activity was clearly in contrast with the phasic responses to the CSs in the value-fixed condition, in which the reward value did not change (right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This neuron did not exhibit clear activity modulation as the reward value gradually decreased in the value-decrease condition (middle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Another example dopamine neuron tonically decreased its activity in the value-decrease condition (middle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), but it did not exhibit clear activity modulation in the value-increase condition (left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

These results suggest that the tonic increase and decrease in activity were not caused by spikes of non-dopamine neurons contaminating single-unit recording. Furthermore, to exclude the possibility that the difference in activity patterns among the value-increase, value-decrease, and value-fixed conditions (i.e., tonic increase, tonic decrease, and phasic changes, respectively) was due to the loss of spikes or emergence of spikes of other neurons during single-unit recording, we compared the baseline firing rate (i.e., firing rate from 500 to 0 ms before the fixation point onset) of the 19 and 15 dopamine neurons among the three conditions. On average, these was no significant difference in baseline firing rate among the conditions for the 19 dopamine neurons (nÂ =Â 19, value-increase condition: mean Â± SDÂ =Â 3.4Â Â±Â 1.2 spikes/s, value-decrease condition: mean Â± SDÂ =Â 3.2Â Â±Â 1.3 spikes/s, value-fixed condition: mean Â± SDÂ =Â 3.6Â Â±Â 1.2 spikes/s, p=0.50; Kruskal-Wallis test) or the 15 dopamine neurons (nÂ =Â 15, value-increase condition: mean Â± SDÂ =Â 3.7Â Â±Â 1.0 spikes/s, value-decrease condition: mean Â± SDÂ =Â 3.8Â Â±Â 1.3 spikes/s, value-fixed condition: mean Â± SDÂ =Â 3.8Â Â±Â 1.0 spikes/s, p=0.94; Kruskal-Wallis test). Even at the single-neuron level, only a few neurons (4 of the 19 neurons and 4 of the 15 neurons) exhibited a significant difference in baseline firing among the three conditions (p&lt;0.05; Kruskal-Wallis test). These results suggest that the three different activity patterns were not due to the loss of spikes or emergence of other spikes during single-unit recording.</p><p>Although each condition consisted of a block of 50 trials and was repeated once or more for each recording session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the tonic increase and decrease in activity were consistently observed between the first and latter blocks of each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5A,B</xref>). No neuron exhibited a significantly different regression slope between the first and latter blocks (p&gt;0.05; comparison of two regression slopes). Furthermore, the tonic increase and decrease in activity were also consistently observed within each block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5C,D</xref>). No neuron exhibited a significantly different regression slope between the first half and latter half trials of blocks (p&gt;0.05; comparison of two regression slopes). These results suggest that the tonic activity changes occurred in consistent manner between and within blocks.</p><p>A previous study reported that dopamine neurons exhibited a tonic increase in activity when future rewards were uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fiorillo et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, the tonic increase in activity, which we observed in the value-increase condition, might be accounted for by an uncertainty-evoked activity increase, because the reward value was uncertain until the green area stopped increasing in this condition. Contrary to this assumption, the 19 dopamine neurons, which exhibited a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition, did not exhibit a tonic increase in activity when the CS did not predict the future reward with certainty in the value-fixed condition (dotted curves in the right column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). On average, the regression slope between firing rate and time was not significantly different from zero (nÂ =Â 19 neurons, mean Â± SDÂ =Â 0.015Â Â±Â 0.098, p=0.20; Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This result suggests that the tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition was not evoked by uncertainty.</p><p>Recent studies using rodents have shown that a subgroup of dopamine neurons increases their activity when animals simply initiate a body movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>), although such movement-related dopamine neuron activation has not been reported in primates. In the present study, we observed that the monkeys sporadically licked the spout for reward delivery while the reward value gradually changed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6A and C</xref> for the value-increase and value-decrease conditions, respectively). To examine whether the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity were evoked by licking, we aligned the activity of the dopamine neurons exhibiting a tonic increase or decrease in activity by the onset of each licking event. These dopamine neurons did not exhibit clear activity modulation around the onset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6B</xref> for the dopamine neurons with a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition, and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2âfigure supplement 6D</xref> for the dopamine neurons with a tonic decrease in activity in the value-decrease condition), suggesting that the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity were not caused by licking. We also observed that the monkeys often made eye movements along the vertical bar stimulus (i.e., CS) while the reward value gradually changed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7A and E</xref> for example trials in the value-increase and value-decrease conditions, respectively). To examine whether the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity were evoked by eye movements, we aligned the activities of the dopamine neurons exhibiting a tonic increase and decrease in activity by the onset of each saccade. These dopamine neurons did not exhibit clear activity modulation around the onset (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7B</xref> for the dopamine neurons with a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition, and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7F</xref> for the dopamine neurons with a tonic decrease in activity in the value-decrease condition). We further analyzed the relationship between firing rate and vertical gaze position. In this analysis, we used the time window from 650 to 2450 ms (divided into 200 ms bins) after the CS onset (see the horizontal white bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7C,G</xref>), which we used to calculate the regression slope between firing rate and time. In each 200 ms bin, we calculated the correlation coefficient between firing rate and vertical gaze position for each of the dopamine neurons with a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7D</xref>) and each of the dopamine neurons exhibiting a tonic decrease in activity in the value-decrease condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2âfigure supplement 7H</xref>). On average, these dopamine neurons did not exhibit a significant correlation coefficient between firing rate and vertical gaze position in either bin except the bin from 1650 to 1850 ms in the value-increase condition (nÂ =Â 19 neurons, mean Â± SDÂ =Â â0.14Â Â±Â 0.20, p=0.011; Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

The phasic activity increase of these neurons, which has been shown to reflect reward prediction errors, is produced by burst spike firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bayer et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we attempted to determine which firing mode produced the tonic activity increase of dopamine neurons. The burst and non-burst spike firing modes were identified based on interspike intervals (ISIs) using previously established criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grace and Bunney, 1984a</xref>). These criteria were (1) an ISI of 80 ms or less to identify the onset of the burst spike firing mode and (2) an ISI of more than 160 ms to identify the end of the firing mode. We calculated the averaged activity of the 19 dopamine neurons that exhibited a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition separately for burst and non-burst spikes, and found that non-burst spike firing in these neurons increased tonically as the reward value gradually increased (left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). On the other hand, burst spike firing in these neurons increased when the reward value came close to the maximum value near the end of the value-increase period.

Particularly, the tonic activity was more largely produced by non-burst spike firing than burst spike firing.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>What variable does the tonic activity of dopamine neurons represent?</title><p>Although the phasic activity of dopamine neurons has attracted attention for its crucial roles in reward processing, recent studies using freelyÂ moving rodents reported that dopamine release in the striatum exhibited a tonic increase (or ramp) as animals approached rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). Such tonic increase has not been observed in dopamine neuron spike activity, at least in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). Although the phasic activity of dopamine neurons has long been thought to represent reward prediction errors, the tonic increase in dopamine release has been proposed to represent âstate valuesâ that gradually increase as animals spatially and temporally approach rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is not immediately clear whether the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron spike activity, which we observed in head-fixed monkeys, represent state values or reward prediction errors. Because both the state values and reward prediction errors gradually changed in the same fashion in our Pavlovian procedure, we were unable to definitely identify which variable the tonic activity of dopamine neurons represented. On the other hand, we observed that, even if dopamine neurons exhibited a strong phasic activity, these neurons did not necessarily display a tonic increase or decrease in activity. That is, the tonic activity occurred independently of the phasic activity that has been thought to represent reward prediction errors. This suggests that the tonic activity might not represent reward prediction errors, and appears to be in accord with a recent perspective that dopamine neurons represent not only reward prediction errors but also multiple signals related to various events and behaviors, including punishments, movements, subjective sensory experience, response inhibition, decision-making, and working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Lafuente and Romo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engelhard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Howard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matsumoto and Takada, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ogasawara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yun et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>An attribute that might cause the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity is the motion of the green area. Since the green area dynamically increased and decreased in the value-increase and value-decrease conditions, respectively, in which we observed the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity, it might be possible that these motions of the green area caused the tonic activity changes irrespective of the changing reward value. On the other hand, a previous study in monkeys observed that dopamine neurons exhibited a phasic activation but not tonic activity change in response to moving-dot images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nomoto et al., 2010</xref>). According to this observation, the motion itself was unlikely to cause the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity. Another attribute that might cause the tonic activity changes is the time distance to the reward delivery. This time distance became shorter as the green area increased and decreased. However, dopamine neurons exhibited the opposite modulations (i.e., the tonic increase and decrease in activity) in the value-increase and value-decrease conditions in which the time distance to the reward delivery equally became shorter as the green area changed. Therefore, the time distance was also unlikely to cause the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What roles does the tonic activity of dopamine neurons play in behavior?</title><p>While the phasic dopamine activity, which is presumed to represent reward prediction errors, has been considered to provide teaching signals in reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doya, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Montague et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), the tonic dopamine activity has been proposed to regulate motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cagniard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Niv, 2007</xref>). A theory called âincentive salience theoryâ proposes that dopamine signals assign incentive values to goals or actions of behavioral processes and motivate actions aimed at acquiring rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge and Robinson, 1998</xref>). According to this theory, the tonic dopamine neuron activity, which we observed in the present study, seems to be a good candidate for a neural substrate that regulates the motivational vigor of actions in changing environments in which reward values fluctuate. That is, by tracking the changing values of future rewards, the tonic activity might enhance and suppress the motivational vigor of actions to obtain the rewards on a moment-by-moment basis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that, instead of phasic firing, tonic firing of dopamine neurons continuously tracked reward values changing moment-by-moment. This tonic activity was produced more largely by non-burst spikes than burst spikes that evoked the phasic dopamine neuron activity. Our findings expand the current knowledge on dopamine neuron signals by highlighting the alternating firing modes of these neurons, which effectively signal reward values in a given situation. Further investigations are called for to definitely determine whether the tonic activity of dopamine neurons represents state values, reward prediction errors, or other reward-related variables.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Macaca fuscata</italic></td><td valign="top">National Bio Resource Project of the MEXT, Japan</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">MATLAB</td><td valign="top">MathWorks</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Two adult macaque monkeys (<italic>Macaca fuscata</italic>; monkey H, female, 6.6 kg, 8 years old; monkey P, female, 6.8 kg, 7 years old) were used for the experiments. All procedures for animal care and experimentation were approved by the University of Tsukuba Animal Experiment Committee (permission number 14â137), and were carried out in accordance with the guidelines described in <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> published by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral tasks</title><p>Behavioral tasks were controlled using MATLAB (Mathworks, MA) with Psychtoolbox, a freely available toolbox for MATLAB. The monkeys sat in a primate chair facing a computer monitor in a sound-attenuated and electrically shielded room. Eye movements were monitored using an infrared eye-tracking system (EYE-TRAC 6; Applied Science Laboratories, MA) with sampling at 240 Hz. A liquid reward was delivered through a spout that was positioned in front of the monkey's mouth. Licking of the monkeys was monitored during the recording of 68 of the 99 recorded dopamine neurons. To monitor licking, a strain gauge was attached to the spout and measured the strain of the spout caused by licking.</p><p>We designed a Pavlovian procedure with three different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>) and applied it to the two monkeys. In each condition, trials started with the presentation of a central fixation point (0.8Â°Ã0.8Â°). The monkey was required to fixate this point. After a 400 ms fixation period, a bar stimulus (2.9Â°Ã9.4Â°) with red and green areas was presented as a CS. The size of the green area indicated the amount (i.e., the value) of a liquid reward that the monkey would receive. The larger the green area became, the larger the associated reward value. In the first condition (value-increase condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the green area was minimal at the beginning and gradually increased (3.8Â°/s), thatÂ is, the reward value gradually increased (0.082 ml/s)Â (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The gradual increase randomly stopped within 2450 ms after the onset of the bar stimulus (uniform distribution from 0 to 2450 ms) so that the monkey was unable to precisely predict the reward value until the green area stopped increasing. In the second condition (value-decrease condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the green area was maximal at the beginning and gradually decreased (3.8Â°/s), thatÂ is, the reward value gradually decreased (0.082 ml/s)Â (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). The gradual decrease randomly stopped within 2450 ms after the bar onset (uniform distribution from 0 to 2450 ms). In the third condition (value-fixed condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the size of the green area did not change and was instead fixed at the minimum, half, or maximum that predicted a 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 ml reward, respectively (these reward amounts were the same as those indicated by the green area in the value-increase and value-decrease conditions). In addition to these CSs, a CS constituting of vertical red and green bars was included, and this was randomly followed by a 0.1-0.3 ml reward (i.e., the reward value was uncertain). These four CSs were presented with an equal probability (25% each). In each condition, the total time during which the CS was presented was fixed at 2850 ms, and the monkey was required to maintain the central fixation during this period. Immediately after the offset of the bar stimulus, the reward indicated by the green area was delivered simultaneously with a tone (1000 Hz). The delay between the CS onset and the reward delivery did not change across trials. Each condition consisted of a block of 50 trials, and we collected data by repeating the three conditions once or more for each neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The order of the three conditions, (1) the value-fixed, (2) value-increase, and (3) value-decrease conditions, was fixed across recording sessions. The total amount of reward was the same (10 ml) among blocks. Trials were aborted immediately if the monkey (1) did not start the central fixation within 4000 ms after the onset of the fixation point or (2) broke the central fixation during the initial 400 ms fixation period or the 2850 ms CS period (i.e., a continuous 3250 ms fixation was required). These error trials were signaled by a beep tone (100 Hz) and excluded from analyses.</p><p>We also used a choice task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Each trial started with the presentation of a central fixation point (0.8Â°Ã0.8Â°), and the monkey was required to fixate this point. After a 400 ms fixation period, two bar stimuli with red and green areas (2.9Â°Ã9.4Â°) were presented on the right and left sides of the fixation point (eccentricity: 8.8Â°). The monkey was required to choose one of the bar stimuli by making a saccade immediately after the presentation of the bar stimuli. These bar stimuli were identical to those used in the Pavlovian procedure except that the green area did not increase or decrease over time. The size of the green area indicated the value of the reward that the monkey would obtain by choosing that bar stimulus and was randomly assigned to each bar stimulus (uniform distribution from 0.1 to 0.3 ml). Immediately after the monkey chose a bar stimulus, the other bar stimulus disappeared. Then, the reward indicated by the green area of the chosen bar stimulus was delivered simultaneously with a tone (1000 Hz). Trials were aborted immediately if the monkey (1) did not start the central fixation within 4000 ms after the onset of the fixation point or (2) broke the central fixation during the 400 ms fixation period. These error trials were signaled by a beep tone (100 Hz) and excluded from analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-unit recording</title><p>A plastic head holder and recording chamber were fixed to the skull under general anesthesia and sterile surgical conditions.

We first divided the calculation time window (650-2450 ms after the CS onset), which we used to detect the significantly positive regression slope of the 19 dopamine neurons (horizontal gray bar in the left column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), into initial (650-1250 ms), middle (1250-1850 ms), and late (1850-2450 ms) periods. The 19 dopamine neurons were randomly resampled with replacements to form a new bootstrap dataset that had the same number of neurons as the original dataset. Using the new dataset, we compared the firing rate (original firing rate â baseline firing rate) between burst and non-burst spike firing for the initial, middle, and late periods. This random resampling and comparison process was repeated 1000 times. If the firing rate was larger for burst spike firing than for non-burst spike firing or vice versa in more than 975 repetitions, the difference in firing rate was regarded as significant (p&lt;0.05; bootstrap test with 1000 repetitions).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank K Bunzui, T Okano, and Y Narita for animal care, and Dr. T Kawai for supporting analyses.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Daeyeol Lee as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.

This is an important question, since the commonly accepted reward prediction error RPE hypothesis would predict that the same dopamine neurons encoding the RPE would also gradually increase or decrease their activity when the expected reward changes gradually. Although the authors found such signals, interestingly, they were not correlated with the phasic signals of dopamine neurons, suggesting that the phasic and tonic RPE signals of dopamine might be processed by separate channels. The experiments are designed cleverly and the analysis is performed well. Nevertheless, there are some concerns that must be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection âTonic activity of dopamine neurons tracking gradually changing reward valuesâ.

We added statistical results in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âContrary to this assumption, the 19 dopamine neurons, which exhibited a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition, did not exhibit a tonic increase in activity when the CS did not predict the future reward with certainty in the value-fixed condition (dotted curves in the right column of Figure 2E). On average, the regression slope between firing rate and time was not significantly different from zero (n = 19 neurons, mean Â± SD = 0.015 Â± 0.098, p = 0.20; Wilcoxon signed-rank test).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In this experiment, dopamine neurons can display two different phasic signals, one associated with the CS presentation, and the other associated with the end of value increase or decrease.

To investigate whether the same dopamine neurons tended to display both of the phasic responses, we calculated the correlation between the magnitudes of these responses (new Figure 4E and F in the revised manuscript). We found that these phasic responses significantly correlated with each other, suggesting that the same dopamine neurons tended to display both of the phasic responses. We added this result in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âWe also examined the relationship between the cue-aligned phasic activity in the value-fixed condition and the stop-aligned phasic activity in the value-increase or value-decrease condition (Figure 4E, F).

For example, were waveforms that had tonic changes during trials any different than waveforms that had phasic changes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for this critical comment. To exclude the possibility that the tonic increase and decrease in activity were caused by spikes of non-dopamine neurons contaminating single-unit recording, we compared spike waveforms that caused these tonic activity changes and spike waveforms that caused the conventional, CS-aligned phasic dopamine responses in the control (i.e., value-fixed) condition. Consequently, we observed that these spike waveforms (i.e., the widths of these spikes) were not significantly different. This result suggests that the tonic increase and decrease in activity were not caused by spikes of non-dopamine neurons contaminating single-unit recording. We added the description of these analysis and result in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âTo exclude the possibility that the tonic increase and decrease in activity were caused by spikes of non-dopamine neurons contaminating single-unit recording, we compared spike waveform (i.e., the width of spikes: a characteristic electrophysiological feature of dopamine neurons) between the time window during which the tonic activity changes occurred in the value-increase and value-decrease conditions and the time window during which the conventional, CS-aligned phasic dopamine responses occurred in the value-fixed condition (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A, B). [â¦] These results suggest that the tonic increase and decrease in activity were not caused by spikes of non-dopamine neurons contaminating single-unit recording.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Several previous studies have suggested that DA encodes movement parameters.

Did monkeys' ramp up and decrease anticipatory licking during these tonic changes in firing? Was activity correlated to licking?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a really important point. The reviewer raised the possibility that the monkeys increased and decreased anticipatory licking as the reward value gradually increased and decreased, respectively. The tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity might be caused by such liking rather than the gradually changing reward value. We had measured licking of the monkeys during the recording of 12 of the 19 dopamine neurons with a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 6A) and during the recording of the 15 dopamine neurons with a tonic decrease in activity in the value-decrease condition (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 6C). We analyzed these licking data to respond to the reviewerâs concern. First, we observed that the monkeys did not increase or decrease anticipatory licking as the reward value gradually changed. We did not expect this result because anticipatory licking correlated with reward value has been generally observed in previous studies. But, this result does not indicate that the monkeys did not predict the reward value from the CSs. Indeed, in the choice task in which two of the CSs were presented as options (Figure 1E), the monkeys chose the option associated with a larger reward (Figure 1F).</p><p>Although we observed that the monkeys did not increase or decrease licking as the reward value gradually changed, we analyzed the relationship between dopamine neuron activity and licking (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 6B and D). We found that the activity of dopamine neurons was not influenced by licking. We added the description of these analysis and result in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âRecent studies using rodents have shown that a subgroup of dopamine neurons increases their activity when animals simply initiate a body movement (da Silva et al., 2018; Howe and Dombeck, 2016), although such movement-related dopamine neuron activation has not been reported in primates. [â¦] These dopamine neurons did not exhibit clear activity modulation around the onset (see Figure 2âfigure supplement 6B for the dopamine neurons with a tonic increase in activity in the value-increase condition, and see Figure 2âfigure supplement 6D for the dopamine neurons with a tonic decrease in activity in the value-decrease condition), suggesting that the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity were not caused by licking.â</p><p>The reviewer further raised the possibility that the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity might be caused by gaze. We therefore analyzed the relationship between dopamine neuron activity and eye movements, and found that the activity of dopamine neurons was not influenced by them (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 7). We added the description of these analysis and result in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âWe also observed that the monkeys often made eye movements along the vertical bar stimulus (i.e., CS) while the reward value gradually changed (see Figure 2âfigure supplement 7A and E for example trials in the value-increase and value-decrease conditions, respectively). [â¦] These results suggest that the tonic increase and decrease in dopamine neuron activity were not caused by eye movements.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Did the total amount of reward differ between blocks of trials? If so, was this reflected in the firing?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important information. The total amount of reward was the same among blocks (10 ml). We added this information in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âThe total amount of reward was the same (10 ml) among blocks.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Did tonic firing patterns change across blocks of trials and were they consistent between the first and second runs of the same trial block?</p></disp-quote><p>This is also an important point. To test whether the tonic activity increase and decrease patterns changed across blocks of trials, we compared the activity patterns between the first and later blocks (new Figure 2âfigure supplement 5A and B). Consequently, we observed no significant change in the patterns. We added the description of these analysis and result in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âAlthough each condition consisted of a block of 50 trials and was repeated once or more for each recording session (Figure 1D), the tonic increase and decrease in activity were consistently observed between the first and later blocks of each condition (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5A, B). No neuron exhibited a significantly different regression slope between the first and later blocks (p &gt; 0.05; comparison of two regression slopes).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Since this was a blocked paradigm, some of the effect might be due to drift in the signal or loss of cells or emergence of new cells. How stable were the recording over time?</p></disp-quote><p>We observed that a subgroup of dopamine neurons exhibited a tonic activity increase in the value-increase condition, tonic activity decrease in the value-decrease condition, and phasic responses in the value-fixed condition. As the reviewer pointed out, these different activity patterns might be due to the loss of spikes or emergence of spikes of other neurons during single-unit recording. To respond to the reviewerâs concern, we compared the baseline firing rate of the dopamine neurons exhibiting the tonic activity increase (19 neurons) and decrease (15 neurons) among the three conditions. At the single neuron level, only a few of these neurons exhibited a significant difference in baseline firing rate among the three conditions. As a population, there was no significant difference in baseline firing rate among the conditions. These results suggest that the three different activity patterns were not due to the loss of spikes or emergence of other spikes during single-unit recording. We added the description of these analysis and result in the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>âFurthermore, to exclude the possibility that the difference in activity patterns among the value-increase, value-decrease, and value-fixed conditions (i.e., tonic increase, tonic decrease, and phasic changes, respectively) was due to the loss of spikes or emergence of spikes of other neurons during single-unit recording, we compared the baseline firing rate (i.e., firing rate from 500 to 0 ms before the fixation point onset) of the 19 and 15 dopamine neurons among the three conditions. [â¦] These results suggest that the three different activity patterns were not due to the loss of spikes or emergence of other spikes during single-unit recording.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors might be going one step too far by suggesting this might be involved in action selection. Why didn't they record during the choice task?</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree that our results are not sufficient to discuss the role of the tonic dopamine activity in action selection. We therefore removed the term âaction selectionâ from the manuscript (the previous Abstract and Discussion had included this term). Instead, we discussed its role in regulating âmotivational vigor of actionsâ, which can be expected from previous studies. The following are from the new Abstract and Discussion:</p><p>âAnimal behavior is regulated based on the values of future rewards. [â¦] Our findings suggest that dopamine neurons change their firing mode to effectively signal reward values in a given situation.â</p><p>âWhile the phasic dopamine activity, which is presumed to represent reward prediction errors, has been considered to provide teaching signals in reinforcement learning (Doya, 2002; Montague et al., 1996; Schultz et al., 1997), the tonic dopamine activity has been proposed to regulate motivation (Cagniard et al., 2006; Niv, 2007). [â¦] That is, by tracking the changing values of future rewards, the tonic activity might enhance and suppress the motivational vigor of actions to obtain the rewards on a moment-by-moment basis.â</p></body></sub-article></article>
