secreted endopeptidase targeting extracellular matrix proteins, creating permissive environments for neuronal development and plasticity. Developmental dysregulation of MMP-9 may also lead to neurodevelopmental disorders (ND). Here, we test the hypothesis that chronically elevated MMP-9 activity during early neurodevelopment is responsible for neural circuit hyperconnectivity observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles after early exposure to valproic acid (VPA), a known teratogen associated with ND in humans. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles, VPA exposure results in excess local synaptic connectivity, disrupted social behavior and increased seizure susceptibility. We found that overexpressing MMP-9 in the brain copies effects of VPA on synaptic connectivity, and blocking MMP-9 activity pharmacologically or genetically reverses effects of VPA on physiology and behavior. We further show that during normal neurodevelopment MMP-9 levels are tightly regulated by neuronal activity and required for structural plasticity. These studies show a critical role for MMP-9 in both normal and abnormal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autism</kwd><kwd>matrix metalloproteinase</kwd><kwd>visual development</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>MMP9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY027380</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aizenman</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name><name><surname>Gore</surname><given-names>Sayali V</given-names></name><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006418</institution-id><institution>Brown University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Carney New Frontiers and OVPR SEED award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aizenman</surname><given-names>Carlos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY011261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cline</surname><given-names>Hollis T</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Lin-chien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS076006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cline</surname><given-names>Hollis T</given-names></name><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Lin-chien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chronic dysregulation of matrix-metalloproteinase 9, which is associated with some neurodevelopmental disorders, leads to local hyperconnectivity in the developing brain, resulting in altered sensory processing and increased seizure susceptibility.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a highly heterogeneous set of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by a complex behavioral phenotype and deficits in both social and cognitive functions. Over 100 gene mutations have been associated with ASD suggesting very different underlying etiologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betancur, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Betancur and Coleman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Swanwick and Banerjee-Basu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grove et al., 2019</xref>). This complex neurodevelopmental disorder, which is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, results from profound changes in brain function and connectivity. The pathophysiology of ASD is often attributed to abnormal synaptic maturation and plasticity, defects in microcircuitry organization, disruption of the brain excitation to inhibition balance, local overconnectivity and long-range underconnectivity throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Markram and Markram, 2010</xref>). Even though some aspects of the etiology of ASD have been studied, how ASD-related behaviors arise from synaptic dysfunction and abnormal neural circuit development remain elusive.</p><p>Studies in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bromley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christensen et al., 2013</xref>) and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Markram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rodier et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Roullet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schneider et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schneider and PrzewÅocki, 2005</xref>) have shown that prenatal exposure to valproic acid (VPA), a common antiepileptic drug, results in a higher incidence of ASD in humans or ASD-like deficits in animals. In rodents, in utero exposure to VPA results in autistic-like behaviors in offspring; namely decreased socialization, increased repetitive behaviors, and hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kataoka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mehta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moldrich et al., 2013</xref>). These behavioral deficits are accompanied by corresponding deficits in brain physiology, including increased local recurrent connectivity, synaptic activity, and decreased intrinsic neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Markram and Markram, 2010</xref>). <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles when exposed to VPA have abnormal sensory-motor and schooling behavior which is accompanied by hyper-connected neural networks in the optic tectum, increased excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drive, elevated levels of spontaneous synaptic activity and decreased neuronal intrinsic excitabilityÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with these findings, VPA-treated tadpoles also have increased seizure susceptibility and decreased acoustic startle habituationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2015</xref>). VPA, a known histone-deacetylase inhibitor, causes these effects by hyperacetylation of gene promoters, and thus, by altering gene expression of various targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghodke-Puranik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Terbach and Williams, 2009</xref>). Preliminary studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> using microarrays and qPCR identified MMP-9 upregulation as a potential downstream effect of VPA exposure, suggesting that dysregulation of this protein may be important for mediating effects of VPA.</p><p>MMP-9 is a secreted zinc-dependent extracellular endopeptidase that can cleave ECM and several cell surface receptors facilitating synaptic and circuit level reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ethell and Ethell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Niedringhaus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinhard et al., 2015</xref>). Early formation of proper synaptic connections and neural circuits is heavily regulated by the pericellular environment, and dysregulation of proteins important for extracellular matrix function could disrupt this process resulting in circuit abnormalities associated with ASD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferrer-Ferrer and Dityatev, 2018</xref>). During development, experience-dependent activity during critical periods can drive neural plasticity and MMP-9 plays an important role in this critical period plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murase et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oliveira-Silva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinhard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, MMP-9 is thought to play a role in adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain, and has been implicated in neural circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujioka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Peixoto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pielecka-Fortuna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies from the lab have utilized the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tadpole CNS as a model for understanding the synaptic origin of neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pratt and Khakhalin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Truszkowski et al., 2016</xref>). The optic tectum, a region in <italic>Xenopus</italic> CNS, receives converging inputs from multiple sensory modalities and is responsible for carrying out multisensory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deeg and Aizenman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pratt and Aizenman, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pratt and Aizenman, 2007</xref>). The retinotectal circuit and local circuits within the optic tectum are known to refine during development in an activity-dependent manner and mediate robust visually-guided behaviors that are very sensitive to abnormal circuit development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), providing a strong link between neural circuit dysfunction and behavior and provide a robust model for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders at various levels of organization - from synapses to behavior. The present work investigates (1) whether upregulation of MMP-9 by whole-brain electroporation mimics electrophysiological effects induced by VPA, (2) whether downregulation of MMP-9 using a pharmacological agent or an antisense morpholino directed against MMP-9 rescues VPA-induced electrophysiological and behavioral effects, and (3) whether MMP-9 is required for activity-dependent structural plasticity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MMP-9 overexpression increases spontaneous synaptic activity and network connectivity, an effect also observed after VPA exposure</title><p>Exposure to VPA increases spontaneous synaptic activity, network connectivity and excitability in the developing tectum in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2015</xref>). Previous microarray studies from the lab have shown that VPA exposure results in striking alterations in gene expression, including a greater than two-fold increase in matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). Here, we validated this finding by performing qPCR on tectal samples of VPA-exposed tadpoles and found a several-fold increase in mRNA levels for MMP9 <italic>[increase in MMP9 mRNA: 2.7Â±0.3 fold increase over control, n=three replicates]</italic>. This suggested the hypothesis that chronically elevated levels of MMP-9 may mediate some of the effects of VPA by promoting excess plasticity leading to local hyperconnectivity. Thus, we first tested whether overexpression of MMP-9 mimics the VPA-induced effects on synaptic connectivity and excitability in the developing tectum. MMP-9 was overexpressed in tectal neurons of stage 42 tadpoles (approximately 7 days post-fertilization) using whole-brain electroporation, which results in expression in a small percent of tectal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haas et al., 2002</xref>). We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from MMP-9-expressing tectal neurons of stage 47â48 tadpoles (approximately 15 days post-fertilization) using an ex vivo whole-brain preparation. One-way ANOVA showed significant differences in sEPSC frequencies between groups [sEPSCs frequency (events/s): p = 0.002, sIPSCs frequency (events/s): p = 0.03]. Post-hoc pairwise comparison indicated a significant increase in the frequency of sEPSCs [<italic>sEPSCs frequency (events/s): GFP control, 1.37 Â± 0.39, n = 11; MMP-9 transfected, 6.74 Â± 1.54, n = 15; MMP-9 non-transfected, 2.92 Â± 0.63, n = 19; p (GFP control and MMP-9 transfected) = 0.004; p (MMP-9 non-transfected and MMP-9 transfected) = 0.02</italic>] and sIPSCs [<italic>sIPSCs frequency (events/s): GFP control, 5.22 Â± 0.97, n = 11; MMP-9 transfected, 8.09 Â± 0.73, n = 13; MMP-9 non-transfected, 6.34 Â± 0.52, n = 15; p (GFP control and MMP-9 transfected) = 0.03; p (MMP-9 non-transfected and MMP-9 transfected) = 0.25</italic>] in the transfected MMP-9 overexpressing tectal cells compared with GFP controls and non-transfected neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). There were no significant differences in the sEPSC amplitude [<italic>sEPSCs amplitude (pA): GFP control, 5.53 Â± 0.56, n = 11; MMP-9 transfected, 6.18 Â± 0.33, n = 15; MMP-9 non-transfected, 6.51 Â± 0.99, n = 19; p = 0.45</italic>] or sIPSCs amplitude [<italic>sIPSCs amplitude (pA): GFP control, 5.22 Â± 0.33, n = 11; MMP-9 transfected, 5.99 Â± 0.46, n = 13; MMP-9 non-transfected, 4.93 Â± 0.43, n = 15; p = 0.19</italic>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), consistent with VPA-induced effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2015</xref>). Increased synaptic transmission observed in MMP-9 overexpressing tectal neurons is consistent with dysfunctional synaptic plasticity of sensory and local synaptic connections during development. Various theories of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders suggest that hyperconnected and hyperexcitable networks are the hallmarks of these disordersÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Supekar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takarae and Sweeney, 2017</xref>). In the developing <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum, spontaneous barrages of recurrent synaptic activity are often used as a measure of intra-tectal connectivity and network excitabilityÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pratt and Aizenman, 2007</xref>). To gather more information about the tectal connectivity and excitability, we counted the number of spontaneous recurrent barrages occurring in MMP-9 overexpressing tectal cells as well as from GFP control cells. Increased number of spontaneous recurrent barrages were observed in both transfected and non-transfected cells from MMP-9 overexpressing animals, compared to GFP controls, indicating persistent local connectivity which usually is pruned during developmentÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pratt et al., 2008</xref>) [<italic>Mean number of barrages/min: GFP control, 0.1 Â± 0.1, n = 11; MMP-9 transfected, 1.13 Â± 0.37, n = 15; MMP-9 non-transfected, 1.10 Â± 0.40, n = 19</italic>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The increased amount of barrage activity in non-transfected neurons, indicates that a small number of MMP-9-overexpressing cells are also sufficient to drive enhanced activity in the whole tectal network.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MMP-9 overexpression increases spontaneous synaptic activity and network connectivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Representative sEPSCs and sIPSCs recorded at â45 mV and +5 mV, respectively, from control and MMP-9 transfected cells.

One prediction from this is that increases in spontaneous transmission are due to an increased number of synapses in the tectum after chronic VPA exposure. We directly tested this hypothesis by measuring synapse density by co-expressing GFP-tagged PSD95 to label postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sanchez et al., 2006</xref>) together with red fluorescent marker mCherry to label cell morphology.

Interestingly, MMP25 has been implicated in development of sensory neurons in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>) and it would be interesting to examine hindbrain and tectal innervation by other sensory modalities after VPA exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deeg et al., 2009</xref>). Although changes in these other MMPs are yet to be confirmed by qPCR, they raise the intriguing possibility that multiple MMPs may be working in concert to regulate development and their dysregulation can also potentially have an impact in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>Early life sensory experience during critical periods of development modifies functional circuits in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chklovskii et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hensch and Fagiolini, 2005</xref>). Periods of high MMP-9 activity correlate with structural and functional synaptic reorganization during critical period plasticity (CPP) and developmental windows across CNS regions, suggesting a role for MMP-9 in determining the developmental time course of CPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaliszewska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oliveira-Silva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Spolidoro et al., 2012</xref>). The results from our study are consistent with these observations in that MMP-9 levels increase in response to enhanced visual activity during a key period of development. Furthermore, this increase in MMP-9 correlates with visual activity induced plasticity and the inhibition of MMP-9 using a pharmacological inhibitor prevents visual-activity-induced dendritic growth. The secretion and activation of MMP-9 is tightly regulated by a wide variety of factors and once activated, it can act on multiple targets including various components of the ECM, cell adhesion molecules, cell surface receptors, cytokines, growth factors, and other proteases, each of which can have differential effects in creating permissive environments for structural plasticity in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Van den Steen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vandooren et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>This central role for MMP-9 is further supported by recent studies in adult mice, in which upon light reintroduction, intense MMP-9 activity is observed surrounding excitatory synapses in the binocular visual cortex suggesting that MMP-9 can modulate plasticity even after closure of critical periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murase et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murase et al., 2017</xref>). Enzymatic activity of MMP-9 has been known for inducing and maintaining long-term potentiation and causes elongation and thinning of dendritic spines in the hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huntley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Michaluk et al., 2011</xref>). MMP-9 knock-out mice and overexpressing models show significantly reduced synaptic plasticity suggesting that appropriate levels of MMP-9 are needed for structural and functional reorganization of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wiera et al., 2013</xref>). Local activation of MMP-9 at the level of individual synapses can induce the maturation of spine heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Szepesi et al., 2014</xref>). MMP-9 can act on various cell surface receptors like integrins, BDNF, ICAMs, NGL, all of which are known to be important for developmental and adult plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fiore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michaluk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamamori et al., 2013</xref>). MMP-9, through activation of cell surface and cell adhesion molecules, is implicated not only in active dendritic spine remodeling and stabilization but also in pre- and postsynaptic receptor dynamics; consolidation of LTP; myelination and synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reinhard et al., 2015</xref>). Perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are extracellular matrix components, are often associated with inhibitory interneurons and regulate their development and functions. Recent studies have shown that MMP-9 can rapidly degrade the PNNs surrounding various neurons enabling synaptic and network reorganization during experience dependent plasticity, and could also provide a mechanism by which dysregulation of MMP-9 can lead to abnormal development of neural circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murase et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murase et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wen et al., 2018</xref>). As we show in our data, VPA exposure also leads to degradation of PNNs in the developing tectum, suggesting that this is one possible downstream target in this system. Going forward, understanding the precise downstream targets and functions of MMP-9 will be critical for understanding various cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders. Our study highlights the importance of MMP-9 in the etiology of neurodevelopmental disorders and future studies will focus on investigating the downstream molecular targets of MMP-9 and the role of other MMPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain,Â strain background <break/>(<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Tadpole</td><td valign="top">Nasco</td><td valign="top">WT and Albino strains; LM00456, LM00456(A)</td><td valign="top">Bred in house</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Valproic Acid</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat.

Stage 49 tadpoles were placed in the experimental arena and acoustic stimuli (one period of a 200 Hz sine wave, 5 ms long) were presented every 5 s which evoked a reliable startle response. The observed startle response is likely due to a combination of inner ear-mediated and lateral line-mediated inputs, and, for the purposes of this study, we did not attempt to differentiate between the two. The amplitude of stimuli for habituation experiments was set at two times above the startle threshold. Each train of stimuli lasted for 2 min; trains 1 to 5 were separated by 5 min gaps, whereas train six was separated from train 5 by a 15 min gap. In order to compensate for possible variation in stimulus delivery across the wells, the location of treatment (1 mM VPA and 1 mM VPA + 3 uM SB-3CT) tadpoles and matched controls within the six-well plate was alternated across experiments.

Synaptic stimulation experiments were conducted by collecting EPSCs evoked by stimulating the optic chiasm at a stimulus intensity that consistently evoked maximal amplitude EPSCs. Polysynaptic stimulation experiments were performed by collecting EPSCs evoked by stimulating the optic chiasm at a stimulus intensity that evoked the maximal amplitude EPSC. Quantification of polysynaptic activity was calculated by measuring the total change in current over 100 ms time bins beginning at the onset of the evoked response.

Approximately 3 days after electroporation (around developmental stages 48â49), the animals were screened to check for successful fluorescence. Tadpoles were selected for those in which a single neuron in the tectum was expressing GFP and could be imaged clearly. A Zeiss LSM 800 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope was used to image tadpoles containing labeled neurons. Prior to the experiment, tadpoles were either immersed in control media or media containing SB3CT. Animals were then anesthetized in 0.02% MS-222 and imaged under the 40X water immersion objective. For each animal, the clearest, most isolated and identifiable cell in the tectum was imaged. Initially, a z-stack encompassing the cell body and the entire length of all neurites was taken for each animal (as the reference image). After these reference images were taken, the tadpoles were transferred to the rearing media (Control or 3 uM SB3CT) and incubated in dark for 3 hr. The same cell that had been previously imaged was identified for each animal and imaged after the 3 hr dark exposure.

Tadpoles were anesthetized and isolated neurons/regions with well-defined puncta were imaged with a 40x objective (40x Water, NA 1.2) in a Zeiss LSM 800 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (with 4x averaging). For each tadpole, optical sections (0.5 Âµm thick) of well isolated neurons/regions were gathered simultaneously at two wavelengths (green and red) to get precise identity and position of synaptic processes along the dendritic arbor. PSD95-GFP punctate distribution was used to quantify post-synaptic processes, while pcDNA-mCherry expression was used to trace neuronal morphology. Data analysis for quantification of GFP-puncta was performed on raw z-stack images using the 3D Objects Counter plug-in Fiji. All the images had distinct punctate GFP expression along dendritic arbors with some background non-punctate GFP. An in-built thresholding function of 3D Objects Counter was used to detect discrete individual puncta. The criteria used for thresholding involved subtracting pixel values of background non-punctate GFP along the dendritic arbors. Any background non-punctate GFP in the cell body and surrounding region was excluded from the data analysis. Various parameters like total number of puncta, size, intensity, etc. were obtained from the 3D Objects Counter plugin output. For the same image, dendritic arbors were reconstructed in 3D and analyzed using the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin in Fiji to measure various parameters including total dendritic length. The ratio of total number of puncta (obtained from 3D Objects Counter) and total dendritic length (obtained from Simple Neurite Tracer) was used to calculate synapse density.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Detection and quantification of perineuronal nets (PNNs)</title><p>Tadpoles were exposed to VPA/Steinbergâs solution at stage 42 until they reached stage 47â48. A fluorescein-tagged Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (F-WFA) was used to visualize the distribution of the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPGs) component of PNNs across <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum for VPA/control treated animals. At stage 49, tadpoles were anesthetized, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr followed by serial sucrose gradient (overnight incubation with 15%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solution each). The tadpoles were then frozen in OCT and thin (20 Âµm) horizontal sections were obtained using cryostat (Leica). Sections were blocked in 3% normal donkey serum (NDS) in 1X PBS for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were then incubated in 1:500 dilution of F-WFA (Vector Labs FL-1351â2, Fluorescein labeled Wisteria Floribunda Lectin, WFA, WFL) in 1X PBS with 2% NDS at 4Â°C for 20â24 hr. F-WFA incubation was followed by nuclei staining using DAPI and slides were mounted with DPX for imaging. Sections were imaged with a 40x (1.2 NA) objective in a Zeiss LSM 800 Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (with 4x averaging) and the distribution of PNNs in the optic tectum was analyzed. <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum consists of a well-defined layer of cell bodies extending their dendrites to the neuropil layer. F-WFA staining showed diffused distribution of CSPGs across the cell body and neuropil layer. Occasionally, we observed intact PNNs surrounding specific cell bodies. Since the majority of images contained diffuse staining, we decided on using average F-WFA intensity as a measure for PNNs distribution. Maximum intensity projections were obtained for each image and average intensity values were measured for cell body and neuropil region using Fiji. Average F-WFA intensity for a tadpole was calculated by averaging the F-WFA intensity of at least three sections from that tadpole. In order to minimize error in F-WFA intensity for every slide, we separated the slide in two halves, and placed sections from each control and VPA in each half. Introduction of Chondroitinase ABC (Sigma, 9024-13-9) results in degradation of PNNs, which was seen by decrease in F-WFA intensity in tectum and was used as a positive control in all the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>For all the data, averages and SEs are given in the text, whereas median values and interquartile range (IQR) are shown in the figures. Sample sizes were based on power analyses and known variability from prior work in our experimental system. No outliers were removed from the data analysis; however, data points that were above 1.5 times IQR may be indicated as outliers in some graphs for data presentation purposes and increased clarity. One-way ANOVA was used to compare differences between overall values of the groups. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare differences between startle speed (cm/s) with treatment groups as between-subjects variables and bouts as a repeated measure to assess habituation response upon repeated stimulation. Student two-tailed t-test with unequal variances was used to assess differences in relative MMP-9 levels across different treatments. Differences were considered statistically significant at p&lt;0.05, and significant results followed by Bonferroni post-hoc pairwise comparisons. All statistical analyses were carried out in R (R v3.6.1, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">http://www.R-project.org</ext-link>) with supplementary installed packages âreadrâ,âlsrâ, âggplot2â, ânlmeâ, âezâ,âdplyrâ, 'stats', and 'lme4â, âemmeansâ.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for valuable intellectual input from members of the Aizenman lab.

circuit and behavioral manifestations of valproic acid (VPA) treatment, a teratogen associated with autism spectrum disorder in humans. In the current manuscript they demonstrate that the deficits induced by VPA treatment, including enhanced spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity, are blocked by pharmacological or morpholino based inhibition of MMP9. Inhibition of MMP9 also reverses the effects of VPA treatment on seizure susceptibility and the startle habituation response. Over-expression of MMP9 pheno-copies the effect of VPA, and inhibition of MMP9 in single tectal neuronal blocks the expression of experience-dependent structural plasticity. Overall, this is a convincing demonstration of the impact of MMP9 in the regulation of experience dependent structural plasticity in a model system. Of note, the authors are advised to state the potential caveats of the PSD-95 expression approach as pointed about in the re-review comments.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Role of matrix metalloproteinase-9 in neurodevelopmental disorders and plasticity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tadpoles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. We apologize that it took longer than we hope for the review as it took longer than expected to secure reviewers. Your article has now been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors and reviewers have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary</p><p>The Aizenman lab has previous demonstrated the utility of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum as a model to examine neuronal, circuit and behavioral manifestations of valproic acid (VPA) treatment, a teratogen associated with autism spectrum disorder in humans. In Gore et al., they demonstrate that the deficits induced by VPA treatment, including enhanced spontaneous and evoked neuronal activity, are blocked by pharmacological or morpholino based inhibition of MMP9. Inhibition of MMP9 also reverses the effects of VPA treatment on seizure susceptibility and the startle habituation response. Over-expression of MMP9 pheno-copies the effect of VPA, and inhibition of MMP9 in single tectal neuronal blocks the expression of experience-dependent structural plasticity. Although the reviewers expressed enthusiasm for the manuscript there were concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. What is the exact nature of &quot;increased connectivity&quot;? Is there an increase in synapse numbers or solely an increase in dendritic complexity coupled with a functional plasticity? The authors should document properties of mEPSCs and mIPSCs recording in TTX to isolate synaptic properties. Coupling this &quot;mini&quot; analysis to quantification of synapse numbers will address whether the changes are solely due to structural plasticity or also due to a functional potentiation of transmission. These experiments should at least be conducted in MMP-9 overexpression, VPA treatment and VPA treatment+MMP-9 loss-of-function cases to validate the basic premise that there is an increased connectivity.</p><p>2. How is increased MMP-9 produces the synaptic and behavioral effects? What is the downstream target (specific receptor?) that would produce the broad changes in synaptic and behavioral phenotypes? Or is this a rather non-specific effect of extracellular matrix? Based on years of data on MMP-9 function its impact on &quot;structural plasticity&quot; in general terms is not surprising but further mechanistic details and specific targets would help move this field forward.</p><p>3. The authors refer to microarray data as the rationale for pursuing the role for MMP9 in VPA-induced hyperconnectivity. Please cite the microarray study(ies?). How many other MMPs or proteases with documented roles in development are similarly upregulated? The authors should say how other possible candidate genes did or did not change, perhaps presenting the list with data in a table (at least other MMPs and proteases). If others have changed, the authors should discuss their data in that context.</p><p>4.

In fact this experimental question is the topic of a separate set of studies we are currently working on, which involve a combination of serial EM reconstructions, neuronal morphology and electrophysiology.</p><p>Here, we have used some of this work to address the reviewerâs questions in combination with prior published data. In terms of the mini analysis proposed by the reviewer it is not clear whether this experiment will yield enough additional information, in the past our analysis of mEPSCa has closely matched our analysis of sEPSCs. We imagine the reason for proposing this was to distinguish a change in frequency caused by elevated network activity vs one caused by having a proliferation of synapses, however both things may be occurring simultaneously, so a change observed in mini frequency would not necessarily rule out that any changes in network activity are not occurring. Furthermore, a change in connectivity is not necessarily expected to result in a change in dendritic complexity. In James et al. 2015, we had shown that VPA exposure alters branching patterns of tectal dendrites while not necessarily changing complexity.</p><p>Thus, we used a different metric of synapse number by overexpressing fluorescently tagged postsynaptic marker PSD-95 in control and VPA treated animals. This experiment was a lot more time consuming than we anticipated, taking several months, and we found that VPA exposure does increase the density of PSD-95 labelled puncta. This, combined with the sEPSC observation, indicates that VPA exposure results in increased synapse density, and that sEPSCs are a good proxy for this and can be used for the MMP9 specific experiments in this paper. A more comprehensive examination of changes in synaptic connectivity, presynaptic function, dendritic structure and the role of MMP9 in this process is beyond the scope of this paper, and subject of another set of major studies in the lab. We have incorporated the PSD-95 findings into the text and added them as a supplementary figure:</p><p>A PSD95-GFP containing-plasmid was overexpressed in combination with pcDNA-mCherry in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum to visualize dendritic processes to allow us to quantify synapse density in control and VPA groups (Sanchez et al., 2006). PSD95-GFP construct has been used previously in <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum and shows a punctate distribution which is very similar to the endogenous presynaptic SNAP-25 punctate pattern, indicating its location at synaptic sites. Exposure to VPA/control was initiated at stage 42; when tadpoles reached stage 44-45, they were electroporated with PSD95-GFP and pcDNAmCherry. Tadpoles were screened at stage 49 for well-isolated tectal neurons coexpressing mCherry and punctate GFP distribution. We quantified GFP puncta using FIJI plugin (3D object counter) and simultaneously measured dendritic length (using simple neurite tracer) to calculate synapse density (#GFP puncta divided by total dendritic length in microns).</p><p>Our results indicate that VPA-exposed tadpoles show increased tectal synapse density compared to control. These results in combination with the electrophysiological experiments suggest that the increased connectivity arises due to increased density of post-synaptic processes.</p><p>This finding is mentioned in the Results section, prior to the behavioral results (p. 13).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How is increased MMP-9 produces the synaptic and behavioral effects? What is the downstream target (specific receptor?) that would produce the broad changes in synaptic and behavioral phenotypes? Or is this a rather non-specific effect of extracellular matrix? Based on years of data on MMP-9 function its impact on &quot;structural plasticity&quot; in general terms is not surprising but further mechanistic details and specific targets would help move this field forward.</p></disp-quote><p>Like the question before, this is a very open ended question with a large parameter space and currently the object of two separate ongoing large projects in the lab. Likely MMP9 is acting on multiple targets to coordinate its effect on structural plasticity, including ECM proteins, growth factor activation and trans-synaptic signalling complexes. To begin to address this within the context of this paper and in response to the reviewerâs comments, we have added data to the effect that VPA exposure results in breakdown of peri-neuronal nets, something which would promote circuit remodelling. Since these findings are not part of the main points being made in the paper, they have been added as a supplementary, and mentioned at the end of the Results section as a potential future direction. A more complete study of PNNs, both during development, plasticity and VPA exposure and the role of MMP9 activation in this process will constitute a future paper in its own right:</p><p>Described in Results (p. 24) and discussion (p. 29): MMP9 is a versatile molecule known to regulate pericellular environment by local proteolytic action on various ECM components. We are currently working on identifying downstream molecular targets of MMP9. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are lattice-like structures that cover soma and proximal dendrites. Studies in rodent models of developmental plasticity have shown that MMP9 cleaves various components of perineuronal nets to modify neuronal plasticity (Murase et al., 2017). We used fluorescein tagged Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (F-WFA) to visualize the distribution of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) component of PNNs across <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum for VPA/control treated animals. <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum consists of a well defined layer of cell bodies extending their dendrites to the neuropil layer. We studied the WFA distribution across the cell body and neuropil layers of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> tectum. Tadpoles exposed to VPA had significantly less WFA intensity in the cell body layer in comparison to controls; suggesting potential role of MMP9 in mediating proteolysis of PNNs. The WFA intensity for the neuropil layer was not significantly different across control/VPA groups, possibly due to its more diffuse structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

It is important to know that these other MMPs have not yet been validated by qPCR like we did with MMP9:</p><p>âIn addition to MMP9, there is also the possibility that other MMPs may be involved in this process. [â¦] Although changes in these other MMPs are yet to be confirmed by qPCR, they raise the intriguing possibility that multiple MMPs may be working in concert to regulate development and their dysregulation can also potentially have an impact in neurodevelopmental disorders.â</p><p>We have included short description about the role of various MMPs in Discussion section (p. 27).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should comment on the specificity of the SB-3CT, particularly with regard to other MMPs or proteases that may/may not have been found to be upregulated in the microarray experiment. Importantly, does SB-3CT rescue the expression levels of MMP-9?</p></disp-quote><p>SB-3CT is a specific inhibitor of MMP9 and MMP2 (Brown et al. 2000). In our microarray screen we did not find alterations in MMP2 levels, and baseline application of SB-3CT had no effect on synaptic transmission (Figure 2), thus it is unlikely that the effect of SB-3CT in reversing VPA-induced changes is due to inhibition of MMP2. Furthermore, the observations that the morpholino experiment replicates the effects of SB-3CT and that antisense MO was made specifically for MMP9, further indicate that MMP2 is not involved. While SB-3CT would not be expected to rescue levels of MMP9 expression (since it is an inhibitor) application of the MO does result in a measurable difference in MMP9 protein levels, as shown in Figure 3A. Combined, the inhibitor data plus the MO data provide strong evidence that a specific decrease in MMP9 activity can reverse the effects of VPA exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The finding that a small number of MMP9 overexpressing cells is fascinating. Have the authors stained the tissue for MMP9 after VPA?</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear what the reviewer is referring to in this case, we are assuming that they are referring to the fact that a small number of overexpressing cells can result in network effects in Figure 1.On one hand we found this surprising as well as we did not expect to see network-wide effects. On the other hand, this was not completely unexpected, as we were recording from transfected neurons, and since MMP9 is secreted, it would be expected to have an effect on its local network of surrounding cells. In terms of the second question, we have not done this, but we have qPCR data indicating elevated MMP9 expression levels in the tectum after VPA exposure, but no finer scale data beyond that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

This is consistent with James et al., where these changes were not observed. Furthermore in James et al. there was a slight decrease in intrinsic excitability (as measured by spike output) in the VPA treated group, suggesting that the changes in spontaneous activity are not driven by increased cellular excitability. This has been noted in the methods (p. 37) and added as a Supplementary Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Please report the number (or %) of tectal neurons in which MMP9 was over-expressed following whole-brain electroporation (Figure 1). -Does MMP9 transfection change the E/I ratio, as previously reported for VPA?

Consistent with previously reported effects of VPA (James et al. 2015), we did not observe any significant difference in E:I ratio across MMP9 overexpression and GFP control groups (E:I ratio: MMP9 overexpression n = 9, 1.14 Â± 2.12, GFP control n = 9, 0.31 Â± 1.70, p = 0.393). In terms of measuring the early latency response, we also looked at values for total charge over the first 50ms window from evoked responses of excitation and was not significantly different for GFP control and MMP9 overexpression (MMP9 overexpression n = 9, -1146 Â± 1030, GFP control n = 9, -577.22 Â± 409, p=0.143).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. please report statistics for total number of barrages or barrage distribution across experimental groups (latter also for Figure 3).</p></disp-quote><p>The meanÂ± standard error for the number of barrages is reported throughout the text where appropriate. We did not perform any statistical comparisons on the barrage data. Since these are discrete (vs. continuous) data points, the number of cells is not sufficiently high for a Fisherâs exact test. However we felt it was of value to still report the numbers of barrages observed as distributions in the relevant figures, as this could be informative to the reader and indicative of enhanced network activation. However, the increased spontaneous activity shown throughout, and evoked polysynaptic activity in figures 2 and 3 also are consistent with network hyperexcitability. If the reviewer feels strongly about this, we can remove the barrage data as it is not essential to our conclusions which are already supported by the sEPSC and polysynaptic activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.
