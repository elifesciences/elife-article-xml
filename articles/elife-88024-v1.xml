By immunofluorescence (IF), the putative BAF DNA binding subunit, ARID1A (AT-rich Interaction Domain 1 a), appeared enriched on the male sex chromosomes during diplonema of meiosis I. Germ cells showing a Cre-induced loss of ARID1A arrested in pachynema and failed to repress sex-linked genes, indicating a defective MSCI. Mutant sex chromosomes displayed an abnormal presence of elongating RNA polymerase II coupled with an overall increase in chromatin accessibility detectable by ATAC-seq. We identified a role for ARID1A in promoting the preferential enrichment of the histone variant, H3.3, on the sex chromosomes, a known hallmark of MSCI. Without ARID1A, the sex chromosomes appeared depleted of H3.3 at levels resembling autosomes. Higher resolution analyses by CUT&amp;RUN revealed shifts in sex-linked H3.3 associations from discrete intergenic sites and broader gene-body domains to promoters in response to the loss of ARID1A. Several sex-linked sites displayed ectopic H3.3 occupancy that did not co-localize with DMC1 (DNA meiotic recombinase 1). This observation suggests a requirement for ARID1A in DMC1 localization to the asynapsed sex chromatids. We conclude that ARID1A-directed H3.3 localization influences meiotic sex chromosome gene regulation and DNA repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiotic sex chromosome</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodelers</kwd><kwd>ARID1A</kwd><kwd>sex-linked DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM101974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnuson</surname><given-names>Terry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ARID1A is implicated in BAF-A-governed meiotic sex chromosome gene regulation and sex-linked chromatin dynamics in DNA repair.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meiosis is central to the formation of haploid gametes from diploid progenitors. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes pair, exchange genetic material, align at the metaphase plate, and then segregate during the first meiotic cell division. Unlike autosomal homologs, the X and Y chromosomes share limited homology. Unique mechanisms have evolved to ensure these chromosomes become sequestered and processed in a parallel but distinct process from autosomes.</p><p>XY chromosomes pair along the pseudo-autosomal region (PAR), leaving extensive regions of the X and Y unpaired. These regions become enriched for DNA damage response (DDR) factors, including ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related), TOPBP1 (DNA topoisomerase II-binding protein 1), and MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1), which amplifies γH2A.X across XY chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alavattam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">ElInati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernandez-Capetillo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). XY chromatin acquires further distinguishing features when the variant histone H3.3 replaces the canonical histones H3.1/3.2, and H3K9me3 (histone lysine9 trimethylation) becomes elevated on XY chromatin relative to autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Heijden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>). As the XY chromosomes become epigenetically distinct from autosomes, they also become physically separated into a unique nuclear sub-compartment known as the XY body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Handel, 2004</xref>). Transcriptional silencing of unpaired chromatin occurs during this phase of meiosis I, known as meiotic silencing of unpaired chromatin (MSUC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turner, 2007</xref>). MSUC of autosomal chromatin, such as in response to an abnormal karyotype, causes pachynema arrest and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baarends et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schimenti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turner et al., 2005</xref>). However, silencing unpaired XY chromatin results in a different outcome known as meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). Sex chromosomes are required to undergo MSCI and become transcriptionally inactivated. Failure to achieve MSCI triggers arrest and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Chromatin factors that influence MSCI include the H3K9 methyltransferase, SETDB1 (SET domain, bifurcated 1), PRC1 associated SCML2 (Sex comb on midleg-like protein 2), and testis-specific reader of histone acetylation, BRDT (bromodomain testis-specific protein; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasegawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirota et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Manterola et al., 2018</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated a critical requirement for SWI/SNF-directed transcriptional regulation during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The germ-cell-specific depletion of the SWI/SNF catalytic subunit, BRG1 (Brahma-related gene-1), resulted in an early pachytene arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). BRG1 is associated with the XY body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), but its requirement for MSCI is unknown. This lack of evidence for MSCI is also true for the PBAF (POLYBROMO1- BRG1/BRM associated factor) remodeler within the SWI/SNF family, which we have shown is required for meiotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menon et al., 2021</xref>). Whether these data suggest a role for PBAF in MSCI remains an open question, given that BRG1 associates with both SWI/SNF remodelers, PBAF and BAF.</p><p>Here, we find that ARID1A (AT-rich interaction domain 1 a), a BAF-specific putative DNA binding subunit, is required for the transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes during pachynema, thereby ensuring meiotic progression through prophase-I. Mechanistically, ARID1A is necessary to establish MSCI hallmarks, such as the eviction of elongating RNA polymerase-II (phosphorylated on Serine2 of carboxy-terminal domain; pSer2-RNAPII), limited sex-linked chromatin accessibility, and hyper-accumulation of histone H3.3 on the sex body. Additionally, ARID1A is required for the targeted localization of DMC1 to the unpaired sex chromatids, implicating BAF-A-governed sex-linked chromatin dynamics in DNA repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Meiotic progression requires ARID1A</title><p>Meiotic progression in male mice depends on SWI/SNF-regulated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menon et al., 2021</xref>).

The number of undifferentiated spermatogonia that stained positive for Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF<sup>+</sup>, also known as Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 16: ZBTB16) remained unchanged in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO testes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). The proportions of undifferentiated spermatogonia (PLZF+) with detectable (ARID1A+) and non-detectable (ARID1A-) levels of ARID1A protein determined by immunostaining on testes cryosections obtained from 1 month old <italic>Arid1a</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> (control) and <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO (CKO) males was 74% ARID1A<sup>-</sup> (CKO, n=179) and 26% ARID1A<sup>+</sup> (CKO, n=65) as compared to 95% ARID1A<sup>+</sup> (n=88) and 5% ARID1A<sup>-</sup> (n=5) in controls. Western blot analysis also showed a significant reduction in ARID1A protein in mutant pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the <italic>Arid1a</italic> conditional knockouts generated with a <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> did not appear to impact earlier stages of spermatogenesis. Potential defects early in spermatogenesis might occur with an earlier-acting germline Cre transgene. In this case, an inducible Cre transgene would be needed, given the haploinsufficiency associated with <italic>Arid1a</italic>.</p><p>Contrary to our expectations, meiosis appeared unperturbed, as evidenced by seminiferous tubules featuring round and elongated spermatids in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO epididymis featured mature spermatozoa, suggesting that <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO testes are capable of normal spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Although these data indicate that ARID1A is dispensable for spermatogenesis, we wanted to confirm that these results were not a technical artifact arising from inefficient <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> mediated excision of the <italic>Arid1a</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> alleles.</p><p>To address this question, we examined <italic>Arid1a</italic> transcripts isolated from <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT and <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO Sta-Put purified populations of pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids using RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). For cDNA synthesis, we used primers that amplify a 612 bp region spanning the <italic>Arid1a</italic> floxed exons 5 and 6. Assuming 100% CRE efficiency, we would expect to observe a 281 bp cDNA product associated with mRNA isolated from <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO spermatogenic cells. Instead, we observed cDNAs representative of the floxed (fl) allele and, to a greater extent, the excised (Δ) allele from mRNA isolated from <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO pachytene spermatocytes. These results indicated inefficient CRE activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). More importantly, the data suggest that a fraction of pachytene spermatocytes in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO testes fail to undergo CRE-mediated excision, resulting in escapers. An examination of ARID1A levels in testes cryosections and meiotic spreads by immunofluorescence (IF) revealed a heterogenous population of pachytene spermatocytes consisting of mutants lacking and escapers expressing ARID1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). On average, 70% of pachytene spermatocytes were observed lacking detectable levels of ARID1A signal by IF.</p><p>Furthermore, examining the meiotic profile associated with <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO revealed an accumulation of mutant spermatocytes (ARID1A<sup>-</sup>), some at leptonema and zygonema and a majority at mid-pachynema relative to <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT spermatocyte spreads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Some diplotene spermatocytes displaying a moderate reduction in ARID1A levels occurred in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO relative to <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT meiotic spreads and represent escapers due to inefficient <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>- bottom two lines with asterisks, also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). However, diplotene and metaphase-I spermatocytes lacking ARID1A protein by IF were undetectable in the <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These results indicate that those spermatocytes lacking ARID1A arrest at the mid-pachytene stage. The spermatocytes that escape Cre activity progress to subsequent meiotic stages, giving rise to genotypically normal gametes. All round spermatids isolated from <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO testes appeared only to express the normal transcript associated with the floxed allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Furthermore, our evaluation of the first round of spermatid development based on DNA content (1 C, 2 C, and 4 C), revealed a significantly reduced abundance of round spermatids (1 C) in mutant testes compared to wild-type testes. This finding, obtained through flow cytometry, supports the observed meiotic block at the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–B</xref>). Therefore, the perceived lack of a phenotype is an artifact of inefficient <italic>Stra8-Cre</italic> activity. But more importantly, the data indicate that ARID1A is essential for progression beyond pachynema.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Meiotic profile of P23 the wild type floxed and the conditional mutant allele.</title><p>The loss of ARID1A results in a pachytene arrest.

To address this question, we performed RNA-seq on Sta-Put purified populations of pachytene spermatocytes to profile changes in transcript abundance upon ARID1A deficiency. Differential analysis of gene expression using DeSeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Love et al., 2014</xref>) revealed an equal proportion of significantly (FDR &lt;0.05) misexpressed genes displaying either elevated (up-regulated, n=5824) or reduced (down-regulated, n=5821) transcript abundance in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO relative to <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Notably, we detected significant misexpression of 53% of all the sex-linked coding genes (593/1105) in response to an ARID1A deficiency. Amongst these, 86.4% displayed elevated expression (n=512), whereas only 13.6% displayed reduced (n=81) transcript abundance. This skew was even greater when only considering sex-linked genes misexpressed by a magnitude of 2 LOG-fold or higher. Here, 97% (297/306) of the misexpressed sex-linked genes displayed increased transcript abundance in response to an ARID1A deficiency. Therefore, ARID1A predominantly affects the repression of sex-linked genes during pachynema.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Requirement of ARID1A for the repression of sex-linked genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MA plot describing the LOG2-fold-change (LFC, y-axis) in mean expression (x-axis) of genes displaying significant (FDR ≤0.05, magenta dots) changes in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO relative to <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT pachytene spermatocytes.

Therefore, ARID1A regulates the transcriptional repression of the sex chromosomes, implicating it in MSCI. ARID1A’s influence on sex-linked gene regulation may result from its association with the sex chromosomes, particularly during diplonema, where ARID1A hyper-accumulates on the XY. However, during pachynema, when MSCI initiates, ARID1A associates with the XY at autosomal levels as detected by IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that, at the onset of pachynema, local ARID1A association rather than chromosome-wide coating dictates its role in sex-linked gene repression.</p><p>To address ARID1A’s association with the XY chromosomes, we determined its genomic localization at a higher resolution by CUT&amp;RUN (cleavage under targets &amp; release using nuclease) in pachytene spermatocytes.

This result is consistent with the genome-wide distribution of ARID1A observed in pachytene spermatocyte spreads by IF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although not detectable by IF, pachytene spermatocytes displayed a preferential association of ARID1A with promoters of normally repressed sex-linked genes, when detected by CUT&amp;RUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5B</xref>), emphasizing its role in MSCI.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ARID1A does not influence DNA damage response signaling on the sex body</title><p>Unlike autosomal homologs that complete pairing during pachynema, the non-homologous regions of the sex chromosomes feature unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These DNA DSBs recruit γH2Ax, a product of DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathways essential for establishing and maintaining MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Turner, 2007</xref>). Therefore, to determine whether ARID1A regulated MSCI by influencing DDR signaling, we first monitored the association of γH2Ax with the sex chromosomes in response to the loss of ARID1A. By IF, γH2Ax accumulation on the sex body appeared unperturbed in the mutant (ARID1A<sup>-</sup>) relative to escapers (ARID1A<sup>+</sup>) and <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Consistent with this, the recruitment of ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related), a kinase known to phosphorylate γH2Ax and initiate MSCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turner et al., 2004</xref>), appeared normal in the absence of ARID1A. These data indicate that sex-linked DDR signaling occurred independently of ARID1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6B</xref>). As expected, MDC1, a known γH2Ax reader that is essential for sex body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>), remained associated with the asynapsed sex chromosomes upon ARID1A deletion during pachynema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C</xref>). These data indicate that the failure to silence sex-linked genes in response to a loss in ARID1A occurred in the presence of major DDR signaling factors known to govern sex body identity. It is possible that DDR signaling recruits BAF-A to the sex chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ARID1A limits RNAPII localization to the sex chromosomes during pachynema</title><p>Apart from γH2Ax, the association of the sex chromosomes with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) distinguishes the sex body from the autosomes during pachynema. Normally, pachytene spermatocytes display reduced levels of RNAPII on the sex body relative to autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khalil et al., 2004</xref>). This sub-nuclear localization of RNAPII coincides with increased transcriptional output, which peaks at diplonema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>), underscoring the importance of targeted mechanisms regulating sex chromosome repression. Therefore, we were curious to test whether ARID1A influenced the nuclear localization of RNAPII during pachynema. We performed IF to monitor the localization of the actively transcribing (elongating) form of RNAPII marked by Serine2 phosphorylation (pSer2) on its carboxy-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noe Gonzalez et al., 2021</xref>).

By co-staining for RNAPII (pSer2) and SYCP3, we could stage pachynema and identify the sex chromosomes.

We performed IF to monitor the association of H3.1/3.2 with the sex chromosomes marked by HORMAD1 in response to the loss of ARID1A. Like H3.3, canonical H3.1/3.2 appeared uniformly distributed genome-wide in most early pachytene spermatocytes (92%). At the onset of pachynema, sex chromosomes mostly displayed comparable H3.3 and H3.1/3.2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). However, this balance changed during the subsequent sub-stages of pachynema. Although robust H3.3 levels remained, H3.1/3.2 appeared excluded from the sex chromosomes in most mid (56%) and all late pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). In contrast, the loss of ARID1A increased the proportion of mid (66%) and late (40%) pachytene spermatocytes retaining H3.1/3.2 on sex-linked chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The abnormal retention of canonical H3.1/3.2 coincides with a lack of H3.3 enrichment on sex-linked chromatin in response to the loss of ARID1A.</p><p>To determine whether these abnormal kinetics result from a genome-wide deficiency in H3.3, we compared its levels by western blotting to find no difference in H3.3 abundance in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO relative to <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT spermatocyte enriched populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also considered an alternative possibility that ARID1A might promote the sex-linked enrichment of H3.3 by influencing the expression of cognate chaperones like DAXX and HIRA during murine pachynema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rogers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Heijden et al., 2007</xref>). We addressed this by monitoring DAXX and HIRA levels in response to the loss of ARID1A using IF. In the case of DAXX, we examined meiotic spreads to find no changes in either the overall levels or sex chromosome localization of DAXX in response to the loss of ARID1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The same was also true of HIRA, whose levels and nuclear localization in mutants appeared comparable to that seen in escaper (from <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO) and normal (<italic>Arid1a</italic> WT) spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, ARID1A impacts H3.3 accumulation on the sex chromosomes without affecting its expression during pachynema. Overall, our data suggest that ARID1A influences MSCI by regulating the composition of sex-linked chromatin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>ARID1A prevents the promoter accumulation of H3.3</title><p>To define the changes in the sex-linked associations of H3.3 at a higher resolution, we performed CUT&amp;RUN on pachytene spermatocytes isolated from <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT and <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO testes. Despite the appearance of a robust H3.3 IF signal from the sex body during normal pachynema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), the Macs2 peak caller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) identified very few sex-linked peaks (n=224). These peaks were overwhelmingly associated with intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Comparatively, a dramatically higher number of peaks (n=12183) primarily associated with genic (promoter, intron, and exon) regions occurred in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). More interestingly, there appeared to be a shift from few but overwhelmingly sex-linked H3.3 peaks (n=224; 98%) to autosomal H3.3 peaks (n=11512; 94.5 %) in response to the loss of ARID1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additionally, while the proportion of H3.3 sex-linked peaks in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO pachytene spermatocytes was few (n=671; 5.5%), they outnumbered their <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT counterparts by threefold. These data suggest that the loss of ARID1A strongly influences H3.3 genomic associations.</p><p>Due to the increased representation of promoter-associated peaks in response to the loss of ARID1A, we monitored H3.3 association with TSSs of genes differentially regulated by ARID1A. Consistent with the genomic annotation of H3.3 peaks, we could not detect H3.3 enrichment at TSSs associated with ARID1A-regulated sex-linked genes relative to IgG control. H3.3 signal spread gene-wide in <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-top panel</xref>). In contrast, we observed a striking accumulation of H3.3 at the TSSs of sex-linked genes misexpressed without ARID1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). There is a transition from the gene-wide spreading of H3.3 to promoter-proximal enrichment in response to the loss of ARID1A. Concomitantly, X and Y-linked intergenic regions undergo a significant decrease in H3.3 occupancy upon ARID1A loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A similar loss of H3.3 occupancy occurred at a handful of autosomal intergenic peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref> - top).</p><p>Unlike the sex-linked targets, TSSs of ARID1A-regulated autosomal genes displayed H3.3 enrichment relative to the IgG control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref> - bottom).

Therefore, TSSs of both sex-linked and autosomal gene targets display concordant changes in H3.3 occupancy. Overall, ARID1A occupancy at TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) of differentially regulated genes prevents the accumulation of H3.3 at target promoters.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>ARID1A restricts H3.3 occupancy to intergenic regions on the sex chromosomes</title><p>Our analysis of the genome-wide localization of H3.3 in response to the loss of ARID1A would argue that the abnormal increase in promoter-associated H3.3 results from its redistribution from high-affinity sites (peaks) that are predominantly sex-linked and intergenic during normal pachynema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We focused our attention on these H3.3-occupied intergenic sex-linked sites. Although the Macs2 algorithm identified only 224 sex-linked intergenic peaks, we speculated that this approach filtered out regions enriched for H3.3 that failed to meet the peak calling threshold compounded by the pervasive spreading of H3.3 on the sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

To gain further insight, we performed k-means clustering, based on H3.3 occupancy, to identify four clusters associated with either common (C1-C4) or gained (G1-G4) peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The clusters associated with common ATAC-seq peaks displayed contrasting changes in H3.3 occupancy in response to the loss of ARID1A. C1 and C2 represented regions deficient for H3.3, while C3 and C4 represent regions that gained H3.3 binding in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO relative to <italic>Arid1a</italic> WT pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel). Similarly, clusters associated with gained ATAC-seq peaks, namely, G1 and G3, represented sites that gained H3.3 occupancy, while G2 identified sites that lost H3.3 occupancy. In contrast to clusters G1-G3, regions associated with G4 displayed an unremarkable association with H3.3 in response to the loss of ARID1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right panel). Genomic annotations of common and gained k-means clusters revealed that the sites that displayed a loss of H3.3 binding (represented by C1 +C2, G2) in response to the loss of ARID1A were intergenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, those that gained significant H3.3 localization (represented by C3, C4, and G1 +G3) distributed differentially between intergenic and genic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, these data support our idea that ARID1A restricts H3.3 occupancy primarily to intergenic sites on the sex chromosomes. Furthermore, the loss of ARID1A triggers an abnormal redistribution of H3.3 to genic regions. Therefore, the increased promoter occupancy of H3.3 is an indirect consequence of ARID1A loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>ARID1A-governed H3.3 localization influences the sex-linked association of DMC1</title><p>To gain further insight into the mechanisms regulating H3.3 associations on the sex chromosomes, we examined the regions associated with various k-means clusters to investigate the enrichment of relevant motifs.

These regions also displayed a dichotomous association with H3.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). C3 and C4, usually deficient in H3.3, showed an increased frequency of PRDM9 motifs relative to C2, which typically displays H3.3 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, bottom). These data illustrate an antagonistic relationship between H3.3 and meiotic DNA DSBs.</p><p>Since the PRDM9 motifs identified from SSDS (Single-Stranded DNA Seq) data were generated to map the genomic associations of DNA repair factor DMC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brick et al., 2012</xref>), we monitored its enrichment at the various k-means clusters. We also monitored the association of markers of meiotic DNA DSBs, such as the PRDM9 catalyzed H3K4me3 at common and gained k-means clusters using published ChIP-seq data from pachytene spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maezawa et al., 2018a</xref>).

To test this conclusion, we monitored the association of DMC1 on the sex chromosomes in response to the loss of ARID1A by IF. Normally, DMC1 foci appear distributed along the non-homologous arms of the X and Y chromosomes from early to mid-pachynema, only disappearing by late pachynema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, left, panel insets; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moens et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, in the absence of ARID1A, we observed a marked reduction in the number of DMC1 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, right, panel insets). Quantification of DMC1 foci in <italic>Arid1a</italic> cKO relative to Arid1a WT pachytene spermatocytes revealed a significant decrease in the sex-linked association of DMC1 in the absence of ARID1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Along with DMC1, the mitotic DNA recombinase, RAD51, is also known to localize to the non-homologous arms of the sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moens et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moens et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we determined whether ARID1A also influenced the sex-linked association of RAD51. First, we analyzed previously generated RAD51-SSDS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinch et al., 2020</xref>) to monitor its enrichment across the various k-means clusters associated with common and gained ATAC-seq peaks.

A dramatic change in the composition of sex-linked chromatin accompanies this chromosome-wide repression. From mid to late pachynema, spermatocytes display a hyper-accumulation of the variant histone H3.3 (Ochre shading and gradient) on the sex chromosomes (magenta) relative to autosomes (green). Concomitantly, the canonical histones H3.1/3.2 levels and elongating pSer2-RNAPII complex (grey gradients) appear depleted from the sex body by late pachynema. The loss of ARID1A dramatically alters the chromatin composition of the sex body, which features low H3.3 (yellow bar) association at levels indistinguishable from autosomes throughout pachynema. Concomitantly, canonical H3.1/3.2 and pSer2-RNAPII levels (grey bar) on the sex body remain abnormally stable throughout pachynema. These sex-linked chromatin aberrations, along with persistent transcription owing to the association of pSer2-RNAPII with mutant sex body, fail meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) and, consequently, pachytene arrest. This defect also coincides with an abnormal loss of DMC1 (blue foci) localization to the unpaired sex chromatids in response to the loss of ARID1A. Therefore, along with transcriptional repression, ARID1A-governed chromatin dynamics appear to influence DNA repair on the sex chromosomes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88024-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously demonstrated a spermatogenic requirement for the mammalian SWI/SNF complex based on its role in coordinating germline transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menon et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that the SWI/SNF PBAF subcomplex activates genes essential for reductional meiosis and gamete formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menon et al., 2021</xref>). These data highlight that distinct SWI/SNF subcomplexes govern specific meiotic transitions.</p><p>Our current study demonstrates a requirement for the ARID1A-associated BAF (BAF-A) subcomplex for MSCI. It does so by promoting the accumulation of the variant histone H3.3 on the sex chromosomes at the onset of mid-pachynema, coinciding with the eviction of canonical histones H3.1/3.2 and RNA polymerase II from the sex body (Model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In contrast, when depleted of ARID1A, chromatin accessibility increased along with a deficiency of H3.3 and the continued presence of H3.1/3.2 and pSer2-RNAPII (an elongating form of RNA polymerase II) in the sex body. These data indicate that BAF-A helps define features distinguishing sex chromosomes from autosomes and that the absence of the BAF-A subcomplex during meiosis I results in the failure of MSCI during pachynema.</p><p>Although previous work described the association of H3.3 with the sex body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van der Heijden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuen et al., 2014</xref>) and its requirement for meiotic repression of sex-linked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontaine et al., 2022</xref>), our study revealed the need for BAF-A in the preferential localization of H3.3 to the sex body relative to autosomes. Interestingly, a similar role for BAF-A in promoting H3.3 incorporation occurs in human endometriotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reske et al., 2022</xref>). In this case, the genomic localization of H3.3 to super-enhancers required ARID1A. Our study describes the ARID1A-dependent localization of H3.3 at a chromosome-wide scale comprised of (i) local enrichment at intergenic loci and (ii) larger domains that resembled spreading much like that of <italic>Xist</italic> during female X chromosome inactivation (XCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaumeil et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) requires SWI/SNF subunits SMARCA4 and SMARCC1 in female mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Keniry et al., 2022</xref>). Here, SMARCC1 promotes XCI by increasing promoter accessibility of the inactive X chromosome (Xi). Although sex-linked chromatin accessibility is thought to increase during MACI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maezawa et al., 2018b</xref>), our studies showed that BAF-A limits rather than enhances sex-linked chromatin accessibility at pachynema. These data highlight a mechanism that checks chromosome-wide relaxation during MSCI. The divergent outcomes of SWI/SNF-governed sex-linked chromatin accessibility during XCI and MSCI probably reflect noticeable sex-specific differences or arise from potentially perturbing distinct SWI/SNF subcomplexes.</p><p>Along with altered chromatin composition and structure, pachytene spermatocytes lacking ARID1A also displayed an abnormal association of pSer2-RNAPII (elongating form) with the sex body. Normally, total transcriptional output peaks towards the end of meiotic prophase-I, even with MSCI coinciding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ernst et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monesi, 1964</xref>). The dynamic switching from the paused (pSer5-RNAPII) to the elongating (pSer2-RNAPII) state of RNAPII drives this burst of transcription on autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2023</xref>). The association of pSer2-RNAPII with the sex chromosomes without ARID1A renders them more autosome-like, underlying the defect in sex-linked gene repression. The BAF-A-governed H3.3 dynamics on the sex chromosomes may limit the switch from the paused to the elongating state of RNAPII. In a human cell culture model, ZMYND11, a known tumor suppressor and reader of Lysine 36 trimethylation on H3.3 (H3.3K36me3), suppresses RNAPII elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wen et al., 2014</xref>). Whether similar H3.3 readers affect RNAPII pausing during meiosis in mice remains unknown.</p><p>The initiation and maintenance of MSCI are known to be regulated by DNA damage response (DDR) factors, ATR, and MDC1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ichijima et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Royo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Turner et al., 2004</xref>). However, ARID1A deficient pachytene spermatocytes appeared proficient in sex-linked DDR signaling, evidenced by the normal enrichment of ATR, γH2Ax, and MDC1 on the sex body. It is possible that BAF-A-mediated transcriptional repression of the sex chromosomes occurs independently of DDR signaling. However, given that the accumulation of ATR and MDC1 on the sex body precedes that of ARID1A, which only manifests late in diplonema, it is reasonable to hypothesize that DDR signaling might recruit BAF-A to the sex chromosomes.</p><p>ARID1A did not appear necessary for sex-linked DNA DSB formation. In contrast, the expected association of DMC1, the meiosis-specific DNA recombinase, with the asynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes do require ARID1A. Interestingly, sex-linked intergenic sites displaying an ARID1A-dependent enrichment of H3.3 appeared depleted for DMC1. Consistent with this antagonism, the loss of ARID1A resulted in the re-distribution of H3.3 to regions normally associated with DMC1. However, a subset of normal DMC1-associated regions (G4) displaying a distinct chromatin composition with little or no occupancy of H3.3 may undergo different dynamics of ARID1A regulation. Although only correlative, these data suggest that regions displaying a localized enrichment of H3.3 might be unfavorable for DNA repair. Determining the extent to which a deficiency in BAF-A activity might impede sex-linked DNA repair is challenging. RAD51 binding to the sex chromosomes remained stable without ARID1A, suggesting that some sex-linked DNA repair remains. Furthermore, RAD51 and DMC1 bind ssDNA at PRDM9/SPO11 designated DSB hotspots. However, these recombinases occupy unique domains. DMC1 localizes nearest the DSB breakpoint, promoting strand exchange, whereas RAD51 is further away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinch et al., 2020</xref>). Our data suggest that loss of ARID1A decreases DMC1 foci on the XY chromosomes without affecting RAD51. These findings indicate that BAF-A may play a role in the loading and/or retention of DMC1 to the XY chromosomes. Additionally, monitoring the formation of DMC1 and RAD51 foci early in meiosis I (Leptonema-Zygonema) in response to ARID1A loss would be interesting. However, this analysis would require a conditional mutation of <italic>Arid1a</italic> using a different <italic>Cre</italic> line. Nonetheless, our studies highlight a model in which BAF-A promotes meiotic progression by facilitating MSCI and DNA repair on the sex chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Whole testes were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF) at 4°C for 20 min. They were cut in half, followed by 40 min of incubation in 10% NBF. Fixed tissues were washed three times (10 min per wash) in room temperature (RT) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH7.4. The tissues were then treated with a series of sucrose washes - 10% (30 min), 20% (30 min), and 30% (1 hr). Tissues were then incubated at 4°C overnight in a 1:1 ratio of a solution of 30% sucrose/optimum cutting temperature (OCT, Tissue-Tek; 62550–01), followed by embedding in OCT, sectioning, and storage at –80° C.

Tubules were minced in 100 mM sucrose (200 µL/testis) until the solution turned turbid. The resulting cell suspension was isolated, avoiding tissue debris, and held on ice. Cells were fixed and spread by dropping 20 µL of cell suspension directly onto glass slides coated with paraformaldehyde solution (1% Paraformaldehyde; 0.15% Triton X-100; 625 nM Sodium Borate, pH 9.2). Uniform spreading was ensured by tilting the slides along the near and opposite edges.

The authors develop a germ cell specific conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model using Stra8-cre and observe that ARID1A-deficient cells fail to progress beyond pachytene, although due to inefficiency of the Stra8-cre system the mice retain ARID1A-expressing cells that yield sperm and allow fertility. Because ARID1A was found to accumulate at the XY body late in Prophase I, the authors suspected a potential role in meiotic silencing and by RNAseq observe significant misexpression of sex-linked genes that typically are silenced at pachytene. They go on to show that ARID1A is required for exclusion of RNA PolII from the sex body and for limiting promoter accessibility at sex-linked genes, consistent with a meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) defect in cKO mice. The authors proceed to investigate the impacts of ARID1A on H3.3 deposition genome-wide. H3.3 is known be regulated by ARID1A and is linked to silencing, and here the authors find that upon loss of ARID1A, overall H3.3 enrichment at the sex body as measured by IF failed to occur, but H3.3 was enriched specifically at transcriptional start sites of sex-linked genes that are normally regulated by ARID1A. The results suggest that ARID1A normally prevents H3.3 accumulation at target promoters on sex chromosomes and based on additional data, restricts H3.3 to intergenic sites. Finally, the authors present data implicating ARID1A and H3.3 occupancy in DSB repair, finding that ARID1A cKO leads to a reduction in focus formation by DMC1, a key repair protein. Overall the paper provides new insights into the process of MSCI from the perspective of chromatin composition and structure and raises interesting new questions about the interplay between chromatin structure, meiotic silencing and DNA repair.</p><p>In general the data are convincing. The conditional KO mouse model has some inherent limitations due to incomplete recombination and the existence of 'escaper' cells that express ARID1A and progress through meiosis normally. This reviewer feels that the authors have addressed this point thoroughly and have demonstrated clear and specific phenotypes using the best available animal model. The data demonstrate that the mutant cells fail to progress past pachytene, although it is unclear whether this specifically reflects pachytene arrest, as accumulation in other stages of Prophase is also suggested by the data in Table 1.</p><p>The revised manuscript more appropriately describes the relationship between ARID1A and DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. The authors don't see defects in a few DDR markers in ARID1A CKO cells (including a low resolution assessment of ATR), suggesting that ARID1A may not be required for meiotic DDR signaling. However, as previously noted the data do not rule out the possibility that ARID1A is downstream of DDR signaling, and the authors note the possibility of a role for DDR signaling upstream of ARID1A.</p><p>A final comment relates to the impacts of ARID1A loss on DMC1 focus formation and the interesting observation of reduced sex chromosome association by DMC1. The authors additionally assess the related recombinase RAD51 and suggest that it is unaffected by ARID1A loss. However, only a single image of RAD51 staining in the cKO is provided (Fig. S11) and there are no associated quantitative data provided. The data are suggestive and conclusions about the impacts of ARID1A loss on RAD51 must be considered as preliminary until more rigorously assessed.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors have effectively addressed the minor issues raised in the most recent round of non-public reviews. This reviewer has no additional recommendations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88024.5.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Menon</surname><given-names>Debashish U</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Genetics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chapel Hill</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>Prabuddha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Genetics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chapel Hill</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Murcia</surname><given-names>Noel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Genetics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chapel Hill</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Magnuson</surname><given-names>Terry</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Genetics, and Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chapel Hill</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1</bold>:</p><p>I understand that the only spermatids observed in cKO testes are coming from cells that escaped the Cre system.
