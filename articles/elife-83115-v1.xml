environment. Here, using gene expression and DNA methylation as molecular phenotypes, we study environmentally induced variation among <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> plants grown at lowland and alpine field sites. Our results show that gene expression is highly plastic, as many more genes are differentially expressed between the field sites than between populations. These environmentally responsive genes evolve under strong selective constraint – the strength of purifying selection on the coding sequence is high, while the rate of adaptive evolution is low. We find, however, that positive selection on cis-regulatory variants has likely contributed to the maintenance of genetically variable environmental responses, but such variants segregate only between distantly related populations. In contrast to gene expression, DNA methylation at genic regions is largely insensitive to the environment, and plastic methylation changes are not associated with differential gene expression. Besides genes, we detect environmental effects at transposable elements (TEs): TEs at the high-altitude field site have higher expression and methylation levels, suggestive of a broad-scale TE activation. Compared to the lowland population, plants native to the alpine environment harbor an excess of recent TE insertions, and we observe that specific TE families are enriched within environmentally responsive genes. Our findings provide insight into selective forces shaping plastic and genetic variation. We also highlight how plastic responses at TEs can rapidly create novel heritable variation in stressful conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reciprocal transplant</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic></kwd><kwd>selective constraint</kwd><kwd>local adaptation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>132611</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Savolainen</surname><given-names>Outi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002341</institution-id><institution>Academy of Finland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>339702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hämälä</surname><given-names>Tuomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Environmentally responsive genes evolve under strong selective constraint in <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To maintain viability in a changing environment, populations need to track shifting fitness optima through genetic adaptation or phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghalambor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Parmesan, 2006</xref>). Although environmentally induced variation within a generation can efficiently facilitate population persistence in novel environments, selection on heritable variation is ultimately required for long-term adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wright, 1931</xref>). As such, strong phenotypic plasticity may constrain adaptive evolution by masking genetic variation from directional selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falconer, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grant, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wright, 1931</xref>). On the other hand, increased population persistence due to plasticity might provide more opportunities for selection to act on heritable variation, making adaptive plasticity an important first step in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldwin, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schmalhausen, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Waddington, 1942</xref>). Given the importance of phenotypic plasticity in adaptive evolution, understanding the selective forces that shape plastic and genetic variation is valuable for predicting how organisms respond to both natural and human-mediated selection pressure.</p><p>In most cases, plasticity in morphological, developmental, and physiological traits is thought to result from changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>), making the study of expression plasticity a promising approach for uncovering the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity. Although studies of environmentally responsive genes have discovered a wide range of expression responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hodgins-Davis and Townsend, 2009</xref>), many populations and species have reacted consistently to environmental stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lowry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wos et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yeaman et al., 2014</xref>). As gene expression is primarily controlled by regulatory elements acting either in cis (affecting nearby genes) or trans (affecting distant genes), the conserved expression responses are indicative of conserved regulatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Horvath et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rodgers-Melnick et al., 2016</xref>). Such consistently expressed genes have also shown signals of strong purifying selection at the coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodgins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hunt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lasky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lowry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that the regulatory conservation is frequently coupled with the conservation of the gene product. Consistent with this expectation, genes exhibiting genetically variable responses to the environment have harbored signals of relaxed selective constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hodgins et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Koenig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lasky et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Given these general observations, we may expect that strong evolutionary conservation at environmentally responsive genes limits the emergence of heritable variation, whereas such variation is more likely to arise in rapidly evolving genes.</p><p>Besides inducing phenotypic plasticity through changes in gene expression, environmental stress may invoke plastic responses at transposable elements (TEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casacuberta and González, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McClintock, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pietzenuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Wos et al., 2021b</xref>). TEs are commonly divided into two major classes depending on their mode of transposition: retrotransposons (or class I) that move by ‘copy-and-paste’ mechanism and DNA transposons (or class II) that move by ‘cut-and-paste’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wicker et al., 2007</xref>). Both classes can be further separated into distinct orders and superfamilies, which often occupy different ‘niches’ within the host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stitzer et al., 2021</xref>). The activation of TEs leads both to proliferation of new TE copies and mobility of existing ones, which can have a considerable influence on the adaptive potential of a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgeois and Boissinot, 2019</xref>). On one hand, a large majority of new TEs and other structural variants are expected to be deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baduel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgeois and Boissinot, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hämälä et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kou et al., 2020</xref>), and so TE activation likely increases the genetic load of a population. On the other hand, such activation can create novel functional variants, which may facilitate adaptation under new selective environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casacuberta and González, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">McClintock, 1984</xref>). Indeed, TEs have been associated with the emergence of several adaptive phenotypes, including industrial melanism in peppered moth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Van’t Hof et al., 2016</xref>), early flowering in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Quadrana et al., 2016</xref>), and single-stalk branching pattern in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Studer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to study selective processes underlying environmental responses. To do so, we grew <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic> plants from three populations at natural low- and high-altitude field sites, leading to sharp differences in exposure to abiotic (e.g. temperature and solar radiation) and biotic (e.g. herbivores and pathogens) factors. Besides examining variation in gene expression, we searched for differentiation in DNA methylation between our experimental plants. DNA methylation is a common epigenetic modification that modulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). The regulatory mechanisms underlying DNA methylation can be rapidly activated by the environment, thus modifying gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu and He, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Thiebaut et al., 2019</xref>). In plants, DNA methylation may also be transmitted from parent to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lloyd and Lister, 2022</xref>), although most stably inherited methylation variants have a genetic (and not plastic) basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kawakatsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lloyd and Lister, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Muyle et al., 2022</xref>). DNA methylation is further involved in epigenetic silencing of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>), and thus environmentally induced changes in the DNA methylome could either promote or suppress TE activity. Therefore, characterizing patterns of DNA methylation in naturally contrasting conditions may help us to better understand environmental effects in gene expression and TE activity. Using these data, we address the following questions: how are gene expression and DNA methylation influenced by the growing environment and population history? Is differential methylation associated with differential gene expression? Are differentially expressed and methylated genes under strong or relaxed evolutionary constraint? Do we find evidence of environmentally induced TE activation? Does TE activation create novel genetic variation capable of influencing environmental adaptation?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To study patterns of short- and long-distance local adaptation in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>, we grew plants from three populations at two contrasting common garden sites in Norway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At both low- (300 meters above sea level [m.a.s.l.]) and high-altitude (1100 m.a.s.l.) field, we planted individuals from local Norwegian populations (J1, 300 m.a.s.l.; J3, 1100 m.a.s.l.) as well as individuals from a nonlocal population from Germany (GER; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the field sites were closely situated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the altitudinal difference resulted in considerable environmental differences between the fields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), thus leading to distinct responses in ecologically important traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Using multi-year fitness estimated during the experiment, we found evidence of home-site advantage between the J1 and J3 populations, while individuals from the GER population fared poorly at both field sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hämälä et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we combine this reciprocal transplant experiment with transcriptome and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to examine variation in gene expression and DNA methylation. Leaf samples from the plants were collected 1 year after planting, thus allowing long-term exposure to the environment. By comparing the field sites and populations, we can distinguish between three types of expression and methylation responses: (1) plastic (difference between the fields, but no difference between populations), (2) genetic (difference between populations, but no difference between the fields), and (3) plastic × genetic (difference between the fields and populations).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reciprocal transplant experiment to study environmental adaptation in <italic>A. lyrata</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Locations and altitudes of the Norwegian populations and field sites.

Consistent with the PCA results, most DEGs were found between the field sites (DEG ~ field), and most DMGs were found between populations (DMG ~ population). Despite the relative lack of methylation plasticity, differential methylation between the field sites was more common at non-CG than CG sites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Field × population interactions (DEG ~ field:population) were rare in gene expression, and using the same criteria for outlier detection as with DEG ~ field and DEG ~ population, only 28 genes passed the DEG threshold. As this small number did not allow us to examine selective signals at the field × population genes, we used a more lenient threshold for multiple correction (see Materials and methods), while acknowledging the potentially higher false-positive rate among these genes. Of the 21,969 genes expressed in our experimental plants, we defined 3933 (18%) as environmentally responsive. Although methylation levels were correlated with gene expression levels (Spearman’s ρ<sub>CG</sub> = 0.29, ρ<sub>CHG</sub> = –0.23, ρ<sub>CHH</sub> = –0.21; p&lt;2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>), DEG ~ field shared fewer than expected genes with the DMG groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Besides methylation of gene bodies, changes in gene expression may result from methylation of the promoter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Law and Jacobsen, 2010</xref>). To explore this, we compiled methylation data from 1 kb upstream of each gene and searched for an overlap between differentially methylated promoter regions and DEGs. For DEG ~ field and DEG ~ field:population, these results did not deviate from random expectations. DEG ~ population, by contrast, was associated with differential methylation at both gene bodies and promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Models for likelihood-ratio tests (LRTs) and the number of identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated genes (DMGs).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Gene set</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Full and reduced model</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DEG ~ field</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression ~ population + field<break/>Expression ~ population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3456</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DEG ~ population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression ~ field + population<break/>Expression ~ field</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1476</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DEG ~ field:population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression ~ field + population + field:population<break/>Expression ~ field + population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">477</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DMG-CG ~ field</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CG methylation ~ CH% + population + field<break/>CG methylation ~ CH% + population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">112</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DMG-CG ~ population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CG methylation ~ CH% + field + population<break/>CG methylation ~ CH% + field</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">641</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DMG-CG ~ field:population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CG methylation ~ CH% + field + population + field:population<break/>CG methylation ~ CH% + field + population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">260</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DMG-CH ~ field</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CH methylation ~ population + field<break/>CH methylation ~ population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1036</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DMG-CH ~ population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CH methylation ~ field + population<break/>CH methylation ~ field</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3580</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle">DMG-CH ~ field:population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CH methylation ~ field + population + field:population<break/>CH methylation ~ field + population</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">680</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>CH = CHG and CHH.</p></fn><fn><p>CH% = methylation rate at CHG and CHH contexts.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Based on gene ontology (GO) terms, most DEG and DMG sets were enriched for genes involved in specific biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Among the top five terms were also ‘response to cold’ and ‘response to light intensity,’ which were previously found as enriched terms among local adaptation candidates in J3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hämälä and Savolainen, 2019</xref>). Genes showing genetic expression responses (DEG ~ population) were enriched for only three GO terms, two of which were related to defense against pathogens (‘defense response to bacterium and virus’). DEG ~ field:population showed enrichment for multiple different processes, including ‘response to cold.’ Although we found fewer enriched GO terms among the DMGs, terms involved in cellular signaling and transport (e.g. ‘signal transduction’ and ‘cation transport’) were strongly represented among the non-CG DMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Footprints of selection at candidate gene sets</title><p>To examine selective signals at DEGs and DMGs, we used whole-genome sequence data from independent J1, J3, and GER individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hämälä et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mattila et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takou et al., 2021</xref>).

In particular, the promoter regions at DEG ~ field:population genes exhibited a combination of low genetic diversity and high differentiation, suggesting that parts of the transcriptional machinery, such as cis-regulatory elements, may have been subject to differential selection.

To study this in more detail, we inferred the strength of selective constraint on the coding sequence of DEGs and DMGs by modelling the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new nonsynonymous mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2017</xref>) and by estimating the rate of adaptive evolution (α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Messer and Petrov, 2013</xref>). In all three populations, genes belonging to the DEG ~ field and DEG ~ field:population groups appeared under strong purifying selection: fewer than expected mutations were predicted to be nearly neutral (2<italic>N<sub>e</sub>s</italic> &lt;1) and more predicted to be deleterious (2<italic>N<sub>e</sub>s</italic> &gt;10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2A</xref>; p=0.004). If the strong selective constraint is due to localized increase of <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic>, we might expect a similar increase in the efficacy of positive selection. However, α estimates indicated that fewer than expected nonsynonymous mutations have been fixed by positive selection in the DEG ~ field and DEG ~ field:population groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2B</xref>; p&lt;0.004, LRT). In contrast to the plastic DEG groups, the DFE and α estimates indicated relaxed evolutionary constraint at other candidate gene groups. In particular, the DMGs had higher than expected α in all three populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2B</xref>; p&lt;0.0002, LRT), suggesting long-term adaptive evolution. Together, these results are indicative of reduced evolutionary rates at the plastic DEG groups as well as rapid molecular evolution at the DMGs. Both results were further supported by an analysis of coding sequence conservation among 26 eudicot species, which identified higher than expected conservation at the two DEG groups and lower than expected conservation at the DMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; p&lt;0.0005, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Furthermore, by searching for conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) 1 kb upstream of each gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haudry et al., 2013</xref>), we found that CNSs were overrepresented at the DEG ~ field and DEG ~ field:population genes and underrepresented at the DMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that the promotor regions are similarly (un)conserved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The efficacy of negative and positive selection at the candidate gene sets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The distribution of fitness effects of new nonsynonymous variants.

To examine this in our data, we quantified TE methylation and TE expression. In contrast to genes, we found that methylation levels across TEs were clearly influenced by the field sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Compared to the low-altitude field, TEs at the high-altitude field site had higher methylation levels in all three cytosine contexts, but CHH methylation responded most strongly to the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>; logistic regression <italic>β</italic><sub>CG</sub> = 0.07, <italic>β</italic><sub>CHG</sub> = 0.12, and <italic>β</italic><sub>CHH</sub> = 0.17; p&lt;2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, LRT). Population effects were also evident in TE methylation: J1 and J3 exhibited clearer environmental responses compared to GER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). As methylation is commonly involved in epigenetic silencing of TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisch, 2009</xref>), we explored a connection between TE methylation and TE expression. Consistent with the notion of TE silencing, expression levels were negatively correlated with methylation levels (Spearman’s ρ<sub>CG</sub> = –0.28, ρ<sub>CHG</sub> = –0.16, and ρ<sub>CHH</sub> = –0.14; p&lt;6 × 10<sup>–10</sup>). However, increased methylation at the high-altitude field site did not lead to a large-scale silencing of TEs, as expression levels of both retrotransposons and DNA transposons were lower in the low-altitude field site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>; p&lt;2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). By comparing the TE results to randomly compiled gene sets of equal size, we found that the observed expression differences are unlikely caused by technical bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Therefore, rather than DNA methylation proactively suppressing TEs in the more stressful environment, these patterns suggest that hypermethylation at the high-altitude field site is a response to increased TE activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lisch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lloyd and Lister, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, increased TE activation can directly influence gene expression, as genes whose promoters lie close to TEs may also get silenced by the DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horvath and Slotte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wyler et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, by examining the association between gene’s expression level and its distance from a methylated TE, we found evidence that epigenetic regulation directed at TEs suppresses the expression of nearby genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). TE methylation did not, however, appear to underlie the expression differences observed between the field sites (or vice versa, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Secco et al., 2015</xref>), as we found that DEG ~ field genes were, on average, further away from differentially methylated TEs than other genes (683 bp vs. 214 bp; p = 3.9 × 10<sup>–8</sup>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Environmental response at transposable elements (TEs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Methylation levels across meta-genes and meta-TEs, shown for CG, CHG, and CHH contexts.

Furthermore, if TE activation has resulted in an excess of recent TE insertions, we might expect different effects on retrotransposons and DNA transposons; as retrotransposons move by ‘copy-and-paste’ mechanism and DNA transposons move by ‘cut-and-paste’ mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wicker et al., 2007</xref>), the number of new retroelements likely increases more rapidly as a result of such activation. As the probability of TEs impairing gene function is increased along with their activation, the number of active DNA transposons could also be more effectively reduced by purifying selection. Consistent with these expectations, we found an enrichment of LTR retrotransposons and a deficit of DNA transposons in J3 compared to J1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s8">Figure 5—figure supplements 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s9">9</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that stress-induced TE activation could have resulted in recent proliferation of retrotransposons (and potentially purging of DNA transposons) in the alpine population, although we cannot rule out the role of drift in shaping the composition of the TE landscape. Finally, by examining the locations of the TE insertions, we discovered that many genes belonging to the six candidate groups were more likely to harbor TE insertions than the average gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s10">Figure 5—figure supplement 10</xref>). In particular, the DEG ~ field:population group was highly enriched for <italic>Ty3</italic> retrotransposons in the J3 population (p=1.3 × 10<sup>–6</sup>, Fisher’s exact test). We also found that DMGs were TE insertion hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), suggesting that many of the non-CG methylation changes may have arisen as a result of TE methylation spreading to genic regions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Gene expression is strongly influenced by the environment</title><p>We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to study environmentally induced variation in gene expression and DNA methylation in three populations of <italic>A. lyrata</italic>. Our study had the benefit of exposing the plants to full extent of environmental stressors for an entire year, likely proving a more realistic view of transcriptome and DNA methylome responses in the face of environmental change than laboratory experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Savolainen et al., 2013</xref>). We found that gene expression variation was strongly plastic, as we detected many more DEGs between the field sites than between populations. In particular, the two Norwegian populations had highly similar transcriptional responses, likely owing to their close geographical and genetic similarity (diverged ~1700 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hämälä et al., 2018</xref>). However, we previously found evidence of local adaptation between these populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hämälä et al., 2018</xref>), demonstrating that some ecologically important traits are genetically differentiated despite the strong plasticity (e.g. flowering time, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, if such differentiation is primarily manifested at earlier life history stages, our sampling after 1 year likely missed those effects. Compared to the Norwegian populations, GER exhibited distinct expression responses, consistent with its greater genetic dissimilarity (diverged from the Norwegians ~150,000 years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takou et al., 2021</xref>) and different growing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leinonen et al., 2009</xref>). Given that GER plants fared poorly at both field sites during our multi-year experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hämälä et al., 2018</xref>), we may assume that much of the expression differentiation in GER is maladaptive in the Norwegian environment. Nevertheless, as such differentiation can arise from evolved effects in the local populations (i.e. for some genes GER exhibits the ancestral expression), comparing the Norwegian populations to GER likely revealed adaptive expression responses. Such differences may have further been amplified by the timing of our sampling (late August), as the local and nonlocal plants likely differed in their physiological preparation for winter.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The DNA methylome is largely insensitive to the environment</title><p>In contrast to gene expression, variation in DNA methylation was mainly shaped by population history, and environmental effects were largely restricted to TEs. As such, our experiment revealed little evidence of environmentally induced DNA methylation influencing gene expression. Studies conducted in controlled conditions have discovered similar results in the sister species <italic>A. thaliana</italic>; patterns of DNA methylation have been weakly influenced by temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dubin et al., 2015</xref>), phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Secco et al., 2015</xref>), salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wibowo et al., 2016</xref>), drought stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganguly et al., 2017</xref>), and light intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganguly et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the DNA methylome in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> species is largely insensitive to environmental factors and thus unlikely to induce large-scale changes in gene expression within a single generation. We note, however, that here, we only studied DNA methylation, whereas other epigenetic modifications might be more readily induced by the environment. For example, as histone modifications are known to exert a major influence on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lloyd and Lister, 2022</xref>), future work studying environmental induction of histone modifications in natural conditions holds promise to expand our understanding of the evolutionary consequences of epigenome plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Husby, 2022</xref>). In any case, we discovered greater than expected overlap between genes that were differentially expressed and methylated between the populations, suggesting that changes in DNA methylation, when they accumulate over generations, may influence patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Muyle et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Takuno et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Environmentally responsive genes evolve under strong selective constraint</title><p>We found that environmentally induced expression responses were highly consistent across our experimental plants, indicating that the underlying regulatory elements are largely conserved between the three <italic>A. lyrata</italic> populations.

Although our results qualitatively support these findings, as genes showing consistent expression responses to the environment (DEG ~ field) were under stronger purifying selection than those showing genetically variable responses (DEG ~ field:population), we discovered that both gene sets exhibited stronger than expected signals of evolutionary constraint. By examining nucleotide diversity and differentiation upstream of the TSS, we further found that population-specific selection at promoter regions (potentially at cis-regulatory variants) has likely contributed to the maintenance of heritable expression variation at the DEG ~ field:population genes. We note, however, that our experimental design did not allow us to associate selective signals with trans-acting variants, which may have also played a role in the observed expression differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hämälä et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lopez-Arboleda et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that genes whose products are involved in conserved processes are prone to exhibit plastic expression responses to environmental stressors, but genetic variation in the environmental response still arises through changes at regulatory elements. However, the expression differentiation was almost exclusively found between the Norwegian populations and GER, indicating that such rewiring of the regulatory network may primarily happen over long evolutionary timescales.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Plastic responses at TEs create novel genetic variation</title><p>Although DNA methylation at genic regions was largely insensitive to the environment, we discovered clear environmental effects in TE methylation. TEs at the high-altitude field site had increased methylation and expression levels, suggestive of stress-induced TE activation. Compared to the lowland population, plants native to the alpine environment harbored an excess of rare TE insertions, suggesting that certain TE families, particularly LTR retrotransposons, may have recently expanded their copy numbers. On average, such TE mobilization is likely to have detrimental effects, as TEs can impair gene function by either directly disrupting coding regions and regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgeois and Boissinot, 2019</xref>) or by influencing the expression of nearby genes through the spread of epigenetic silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hollister and Gaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horvath and Slotte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wyler et al., 2020</xref>).

Although we lack functional validation for the detected TEs, such enrichment demonstrates that TEs have the potential to create new heritable variation that is relevant for environmental adaptation. The role of TEs in creating novel functional variants is also seen in results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Quadrana et al., 2019</xref>, who found experimental evidence that retrotransposons of the <italic>Copia</italic> superfamily preferentially integrate into the bodies of environmentally responsive genes in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. This integration is likely mediated by the histone variant H2A.Z, which is commonly found within the gene bodies of temperature sensing genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Talbert and Henikoff, 2014</xref>), providing a possible mechanism for the observed TE accumulation in the J3 population. Indeed, by searching the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> genome for H2A.Z binding sites defined in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chow et al., 2019</xref>), we confirmed that the DEG ~ field:population genes were more likely to carry such sites than the average gene (OR = 3.10; p&lt;2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, Fisher’s exact test). Interestingly, the DEG ~ field genes were also enriched for H2A.Z binding sites (OR = 2.93; p&lt;2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>, Fisher’s exact test), suggesting that these genes may be similarly targeted by TE insertions, but due to stronger selective constraint, TEs are purged more efficiently. However, although we also detected an enrichment of <italic>Copia</italic> elements in the environmentally responsive genes, the enrichment of <italic>Ty3</italic> elements was far greater (OR: 4.5 vs. 11.7).

We found that the coding and promoter regions of most environmentally responsive genes are slowly evolving, which could influence the adaptive potential of these <italic>A. lyrata</italic> populations by keeping the pool of segregating variants small. In particular, as adaptation to rapidly shifting fitness optima can be limited by the lack of standing genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Matuszewski et al., 2015</xref>), the strong selective constraint and low genetic diversity at environmentally responsive genes could pose a risk in cases where environmental perturbations exceed the buffering mechanism provided by phenotypic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghalambor et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Price et al., 2003</xref>). However, one caveat with this interpretation is that mutations in large-effect trans-loci could lead to wide-ranging expression effects despite the conservation of the cis-regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Josephs et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lopez-Arboleda et al., 2021</xref>).

We then estimated the allelic dosage, or the expected genotype, from the posterior probabilities as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Ε</mml:mi><mml:mfenced open="[" close="]" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> , where <italic>G</italic> is the genotype.

We used the method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Weir and Cockerham, 1984</xref> to estimate <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> for both three- and two-population comparisons. We estimated π and <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> for each candidate gene group, defined CIs for the estimates by resampling with replacement across genes 1000 times, and compared the estimates against π and <italic>F</italic><sub>ST</sub> calculated across all genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Distribution of fitness effects</title><p>We examined the strength of selective constraint on the candidate gene sets by modelling the DFE. To do so, we estimated folded site frequency spectra (SFS) for synonymous (fourfold) and nonsynonymous (zerofold) sites using ANGSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Korneliussen et al., 2014</xref>). We then used ∂a∂i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutenkunst et al., 2009</xref>) to fit three-epoch demographic models to synonymous SFS and inferred a deleterious gamma DFE for nonsynonymous sites, conditional on the demography, using fit∂a∂i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Population mutation rates (θ=4<italic>N<sub>e</sub>μ</italic>) were estimated from the synonymous data and multiplied by 2.76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Takou et al., 2021</xref>) to approximate θ at nonsynonymous sites. This approach, as opposed to optimizing θ along with the DFE parameters, can take into account variants expected to be missing due to strong purifying selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). Demographic parameters were estimated from the whole-genome data and fixed for the analysis of candidate gene sets. We estimated CIs for the DFE parameters by fitting the models to 500 parametric bootstrap SFS. We assumed that counts in the bootstrap replicates followed a multinomial distribution with number of trials corresponding to total number of sites in the SFS and the probability of success corresponding to proportion of sites in a given allele frequency bin. We then discretized the DFE into three bins, nearly neutral (2<italic>N<sub>e</sub>s</italic> &lt;1), intermediate (1≤ 2<italic>N<sub>e</sub>s</italic> ≤10), and deleterious (2<italic>N<sub>e</sub>s</italic> &gt;10) and compared bins in the candidate gene sets to the genome-wide average. p Values were defined as twice the proportion of overlapping bootstrap replicates in each bin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>The rate of adaptive evolution</title><p>We examined the efficacy of positive selection by estimating the proportion of sites fixed by positive selection (α) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith and Eyre-Walker, 2002</xref>).

We used LRTs to determine whether the fitted functions differ between the candidate gene sets and the genome-wide average and estimated CIs by fitting the models to 500 parametric bootstrap SFS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Sequence conservation</title><p>To examine the conservation of selective processes, we used GERP++ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davydov et al., 2010</xref>) to estimate nucleotide conservation at DEGs and DMGs. We chose 25 eudicot species belonging to the clade Superrosidae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), whose divergence times in relation to <italic>A. lyrata</italic> ranged from 1.6 million years (<italic>A. halleri</italic>) to 123 million years (<italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hohmann et al., 2015</xref>). We first identified homologs by conducting BLAST queries against protein databases constructed for the species, keeping only the best match with alignment <italic>e</italic>-value &lt;1 × 10<sup>–5</sup> for each gene. For sets of homologs with ≥13 species, we aligned the coding sequences with MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nakamura et al., 2018</xref>). As GERP++ requires an evolutionary tree, we used the R package phangorn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schliep, 2011</xref>) to estimate a maximum likelihood tree across 1000 randomly selected genes with no missing species. Using the species tree and multiple alignments, we had GERP++ estimate the rejected substitutions (RS) score for sites in the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> coding sequence, quantifying the level of nucleotide conservation in relation to neutral substitution rate. Last, using the range of possible values at each site, we rescaled the RS scores from 0 to 1, where 0 is the weakest possible conservation and 1 is the strongest.</p><p>As our RS scores were estimated only for the coding sequence, we further used publicly available data on CNSs (based on the comparison of nine Brassicaceae species, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haudry et al., 2013</xref>) to assess nucleotide conservation at the promoter regions. To do so, we searched for the presence of CNSs 1 kb upstream of each gene and tested whether they are over- or underrepresented at our candidate gene groups using the Fisher’s exact test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Scan for selective sweeps</title><p>To identify genes that have undergone recent selective sweeps, we used RAiSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alachiotis and Pavlidis, 2018</xref>) to scan the genomes for patterns of segregating sites, linkage-disequilibrium, and nucleotide diversity indicative of positive selection. We excluded regions that contained no sequencing data, estimated the composite statistic μ in 50 SNP sliding windows, and characterized selective signals at each gene using the maximum μ value of windows within 2 kb. We then ran RAiSD on simulated neutral data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hämälä and Savolainen, 2019</xref>) to find outliers.

Following the recommended workflow, we masked the <italic>A. lyrata</italic> consensus TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amselem et al., 2019</xref>) from the reference genome using an iterative mapping approach; simulated TE reads were aligned to the genome with BWA-MEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li, 2013</xref>), aligned regions masked from the reference with BEDtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), and the process repeated until no new unmasked regions were found. We then merged the consensus TEs with the masked genome, aligned quality-trimmed DNA-seq reads to the TE merged reference using BWA-MEM, and removed duplicated reads using Picard tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/">https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/</ext-link>). We only used samples with an average coverage ≥10 × across the eight main chromosomes (this excluded five individuals from J3 and two from GER) and required each site to have a minimum coverage of 6×. Furthermore, to compare how many TE insertions have accumulated in the three populations without biasing our estimates with different sample sizes and sequencing depths, we chose nine individuals from each population (i.e. the sample size of J1) and randomly sampled an equal number of aligned read pairs (20 million) from each individual. We then had PoPoolationTE2 estimate the proportion of reads supporting TEs in each individual and filtered the list to remove overlapping TEs. Last, we discretized the read proportions into genotypes: &gt;0.85 TE homozygote, 0.85–0.15 TE heterozygote, and &lt;0.15 non-TE homozygote.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Number of read pairs and mapping rates for each sample.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83115-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Bisulfite conversion efficacy for each sample.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83115-supp2-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Species used in estimating nucleotide conservation with GERP++.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-83115-supp3-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-83115-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The transcriptome and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data are available at NCBI SRA: PRJNA459481.

sec-type="appendix" id="s8"><title>Quantification of batch effect on detection of differentially expressed genes</title><p>Because our samples were sequenced on four lanes, we first determined whether sequencing batches may confound the detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). To do so, we examined the results of stably expressed reference genes, which, compared to other genes, are less likely to be influenced by treatment (here field site and population) but equally likely influenced by batch effect. We used the direct <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> orthologs of 20 genes identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Czechowski et al., 2005</xref> and 13 genes identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kudo et al., 2016</xref>. We normalized the read counts with variance stabilization transformation in DESeq2 and used principal component analysis to identify the main sources of variation. Although these reference genes have shown stable expression across treatments in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, four first principal components from both gene sets were primarily impacted by the field site and population rather than sequencing batch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). We also found no DEGs (see main text for details) between batches B1 and B2 (containing samples from the high-altitude field) or between batches B3 and B4 (containing samples from the low-altitude field), whereas 4 of the 33 genes were differentially expressed between the field sites.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Environmental response in gene expression and DNA methylation reveals factors influencing the adaptive potential of <italic>Arabidopsis lyrata</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>Regrettably, after consultation among the reviewers, we have agreed that the work in its current form cannot be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. As you will see, there was considerable enthusiasm from the reviewers for what you are trying to achieve, but they also agreed that it is currently unclear whether the analyses are robust enough for the far-reaching inferences made. Having said this, we remain very interested in the work, and would reconsider an extensively revised paper, albeit as a new submission. We would of course try to retain the same reviewers, should you decide to come back to us with such a manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I very much liked the author's goal here of going beyond SNP data to evaluate changes in expression, methylation, and TE polymorphism in common garden experiments in order to better understand adaptation.</p><p>They really dig into this data and have a number of nice findings.</p><p>My main concern is with the overall interpretation of the findings.</p><p>The authors claim their TE results show that TEs could be an important source of adaptive variation. While this is certainly true in principle (anything that creates novel genetic variation could be potentially adaptive), I have trouble seeing how the results move us past this? For example, if we interpret the data as showing increased insertion specifically in environmentally responsive genes, and most TEs are deleterious and we see no evidence of TEs generating adaptive change in these data, what have we learned beyond the above? Also, if I'm interpreting correctly, of the 12 DEG-field or DEG-field:population enrichment comparisons with retroelements, enrichment is only found in 3. How does this constitute strong evidence of enrichment?</p><p>The authors also claim that evidence of conservation at environmentally responsive genes will constrain adaptation. I have trouble understanding this argument. Does constraint in the past necessarily predict inability to adapt in the future to novel climates? If these are the genes that are most responsive expression-wise, and those expression changes are adaptive, wouldn't these be the genes most likely to see subsequent cis-regulatory change canalize adaptive expression? The total list of DE genes is a few hundred, but if most traits are polygenic, how much would adaptation really be limited even if these genes remain constrained? Finally, what is the interpretation of the strong enrichment of DEG~Field:Pop for number of sweeps? This seems inconsistent with the argument these genes are super conserved and/or constrained for adaptation.</p><p>Many of the differences seen in the paper are between German and the Norwegian populations. I would like to see more discussion of how to interpret this, especially in the light of adaptation. We know Germany is poorly adapted to both sites, so what does DE or DM in Germany tell us about adaptation?</p><p>Methodological questions:</p><p>– How do you deal with multiply mapping reads in evaluating TE expression and methylation?</p><p>– Please verify you used a version of RAISd that accounts for variable numbers of bp sequenced in each window.</p><p>– To correct bismark, for some genes, WGS SNP data were used, and RNA-seq for others. Do these two sets (WGS genes and RNA-seq genes) show differential methylation?</p><p>– There are a number of enrichment analyses done in the paper; are these corrected for multiple testing?</p><p>– Figure 6D looks at the % of TEs.

This is a very interesting paper but there was a bit of an assumption about how DMGs and DEGs are cis variants that needs strengthening or supporting. Without this support, it isn't clear if the evolution of cis sequences is informative of what is happening with DMGs if they are largely trans effects as one might see for a FRI/FLC or similar polymorphism causing large transcriptomic effects.</p><p>One complication I'm struggling with is the analysis of differentially expressed genes. The analysis directly compares DEGs to DMGs and to genetic variation with an implicit assumption that they are comparable. However, DEGs can be caused by cis or trans events such that the majority of DEGs are caused by a single causal locus. This maybe comes up the strongest when the analysis shifts to looking for footprints of selection at the DEGs (line 225). This seems to assume the DEGs are all caused by cis but it isn't clear what the support is for this claim. Is there evidence that these are mainly cis (e.g. loci with known PAVs, large bimodal effects, etc)? Some support should be provided for an assumption that a DEG is being caused in cis.</p><p>In contrast, DMGs are almost always cis as shown by work from the Springer and Schmitz groups. Although there are known loci influencing global methylation levels which does appear to be the case with the German collection having lower methylation across the board as well as a lack of relative plasticity (Figure 2A and 2D) in comparison. How does this lack of plasticity influence the ability to assess the DMG ~ Field and DMG ~ Field:Population terms as the overall methylation in the German collection is non plastic. In the local populations, one could assume the DMGs are local events but when comparing J1/J2 to Ger there is the possibility that DMGs are a blend of cis/trans. Is there evidence similarly supporting DMGs in this comparison as mainly cis?</p><p>A similar concern is that in the closely related <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, a large fraction of cis causality for DEGs is actually not promoter polymorphisms but actually PAV or other structural variation within the loci. Is there evidence in this collection that cis causality is mainly SNP based as the analysis on selection is suggesting? This is partly a concern because, at least in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, this can lead to these loci having an elevated level of error in short read sequencing leading to a ponderance of rare SNPs (See recent work by Nordborg and colleagues on variation in gene duplication and SNP error rates).</p><p>Similarly work by Schmitz and Ecker has shown that DMGs can also be biased towards genes with structural variants. In this studies, DEGs and DMGs seem to not be behaving in coordination so structural variants aren't likely a universal problem but some assessment of their potential in influencing the data would be necessary to understand how pangenome variation may be introducing error.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study was aimed at identifying the adaptive potential of genomes in response to different environments. To accomplish this aim, the authors performed reciprocal transplant experiments with distinct populations of Arabidopsis lyrata. These plants were grown over a year and then tissue was harvested and used for gene expression and DNA methylation profiling genome wide. A strength of this research is the unique samples available to investigate. This allows the evaluation of impact on differential expression/methylation to be attributed to the environment, genotype or both. Many of the conclusions are justified, but analysis of the DNA methylation data is confounded by the way it was defined and analyzed. The weakness in this analysis stems from only investigating the impact of CG methylation. It is well established in plant genomes (including A. lyrata) that there are two distinct categories of methylated regions. One region is defined as GBM (gene body DNA methylation), which is defined by CG-only methylation in a gene body. The second category of methylation is found anywhere in the genome (including genes) and contains CG + non-CG (CHG and CHH) methylation. This study has not properly distinguished these regions and it has likely led to improper conclusions.</p><p>With regards to the findings presented on plasticity of DNA methylation, many of the findings are somewhat expected. It has been established that DNA methylation variation is largely driven by genetic variation within plant genomes. The variation in methylation found between different environments on non-gene regions also reflects common observations. There are lots of environments that lead to genome-wide changes in methylation. It's important to note that not all of these changes are causal. In fact, many of them are likely an indirect effect of 3D nuclear genome compaction and access of DNA methyltransferases to target sequences. Notice the changes in methylation are very subtle and they exclusively occur at regions that already possess methylation. It is not like mammalian systems where methylation is completely lost or gained at regions.</p><p>The section of TE activation by stress was not fully supported by the data presented. It's an intriguing possibility, but not well supported by the data. This entire section needs to be revisited with additional analyses.</p><p>Overall, although this is a unique population the conclusions presented are incremental to the field. The shortcomings presented in the analysis can be easily remedied, although it will be curious to see how they change the conclusions.</p><p>The DNA methylation data must be partitioned into CG and CG/CHG/CHH regions in the analysis. Using CG methylation alone mixes two distinct groups together. It is well established that CG/CHG/CHH methylated regions are generally silenced whereas CG only methylated genes are expressed.</p><p>More information is required for understanding how DMGs were defined. What is the size distribution of DMGs? What proportion of DMGs are GBM vs those that contain CG/CHG/CHH? The rapidly evolving DMGs mentioned on line 252 are likely those that contain CG/CHGCHH, as worked by Gaut et al. have shown that GBM genes have low rates of nucleotide substitutions.</p><p>I'm not convinced by the TE analysis. Are these full length TEs? Or are they TE fragments? How are multiple mapping reads handled in the RNA-seq analysis? Read counts of 5-6 as presented in 6b are not very convincing for &quot;expressed&quot; TEs. I found this to be another weak aspect of the study. What's the evidence these TEs are &quot;stress induced&quot;? It is stated that TEs overlapping genes were removed, but these genotypes were mapped to a reference genome? There will be differences and no genomes have 100% annotation. This is especially true of out-crossing species. Overall, I found the evidence of stress induced activation of TEs not well supported by the data.</p><p>Line 405 – there is not assignment of cause and effect from the results of this study. The authors should be careful not to state methylation is affecting expression. It could equally be possible that expression is affecting methylation.</p><p>I found the section on rates of evolution of 1kb upstream regions worthwhile, but to extend this make conclusions about cis-regulatory elements is a bit of a stretch. No CREs were identified and there are lots of non-CREs located upstream of genes that could impact these results.</p><p>The bisulfite conversion rates need to be presented for each of the 24 samples instead of an average.</p><p>The number of reads sequenced per RNA-seq/BS-seq library need to be presented in a supplementary table along with their alignments rates (and bs conversion rates).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83115.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

However, the idea of canalization (or genetic assimilation) relies on heritable variation existing for plasticity, so that selection can act on such variation in new selective environments. Our reasoning here is that strong selective constraint at both the coding and regulatory regions of environmentally responsive genes keeps the pool of segregating variants small, and any subsequent adaptive variants need to arise de novo. This would likely decrease the rate of adaptive evolution compared to a case where variants are readily available, especially under rapid environmental change. We now make this point clearer in the manuscript (lines 407 – 411).</p><p>The question about polygenicity is a tough one, as we don’t know how polygenic the adaptive traits are. We may assume that the genetic architecture is highly polygenic, and that the loci identified here are primarily of large effect (although, we would argue that 3933 environmentally responsive genes, which is 18% of all expressed genes, is already a nontrivial number). In that case, high polygenicity would reduce the effectiveness of directional selection (compared to an oligogenic architecture), and if also the loci with largest effect are constrained, this could have a considerable influence on the adaptive potential of these populations. We now mention this point of the effect sizes at line 189. However, as similar questions could be asked of almost any genomicsoriented local adaptation studies (i.e., how much do selection outliers / GWAS hits actually contribute to adaptation), we keep this section rather brief.</p><p>Last, increased number of sweeps in DEG ~ Field:Population genes might, at first glance, seem inconsistent with the strong signals of selective constraint at coding regions. However, as we now more carefully describe (line 256), sweep signals were primarily found upstream of the TSS. We also detect low diversity and high differentiation at these regions, suggesting positive selection may have acted on cisregulatory regions. Given that we already found genetically variable expression responses at these genes, less constrained regulatory variants are perhaps not so surprising.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim their TE results show that TEs could be an important source of adaptive variation. While this is certainly true in principle (anything that creates novel genetic variation could be potentially adaptive), I have trouble seeing how the results move us past this? For example, if we interpret the data as showing increased insertion specifically in environmentally responsive genes, and most TEs are deleterious and we see no evidence of TEs generating adaptive change in these data, what have we learned beyond the above? Also, if I'm interpreting correctly, of the 12 DEG-field or DEG-field:population enrichment comparisons with retroelements, enrichment is only found in 3. How does this constitute strong evidence of enrichment?</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that out of the six different plastic gene groups we find strong TE enrichment in only one of them (DEG ~ Field:Population in J3), but we think that this is consistent with the expression and methylation results. We find higher TE expression and methylation levels at the high-altitude field site, indicating stress-induced TE activation. We see the same pattern in all three populations (although the signal is more subtle in GER). However, out of the whole-genome sequenced individuals, only J3 population is native to the alpine environment and therefore could have accumulated recent TE insertions due to the activation. We don’t see an enrichment of TEs in the DEG ~ Field genes in J3, which could be related to them being more constrained than DEG ~ Field:Population genes (lines 439 – 441). Therefore, these results, combined with previous results from <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, suggest that certain LTRs may be preferentially integrating into the gene bodies of environmentally responsive genes, but are still being purged from the most highly constrained genes.</p><p>Our reasoning related to the potentially adaptive effects of TEs stems from the points made above, namely that canalization of plastic effects relies on existing genetic variation: these genes have a smaller pool of segregating SNPs but a larger pool of segregating TEs (on top of that, they may be more likely targeted by new TE insertions, which can happen at a considerably higher rate than point mutations). Therefore, there is an increased chance that any functional effects will arise as a result of TE insertions, although we acknowledge that most such insertions are likely detrimental. We realize that some of this discussion is quite speculative, and we have now moved it to the new “Ideas and speculation” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of the differences seen in the paper are between German and the Norwegian populations.

In short, although much of the expression (and potentially methylation) differentiation in GER is likely maladaptive, many differences likely reflect evolved responses in the Norwegian populations (i.e., the GER response is ancestral). Furthermore, as most expression responses were consistent in the three populations, including GER informs about the conservation of the environmental effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methodological questions:</p><p>– How do you deal with multiply mapping reads in evaluating TE expression and methylation?</p></disp-quote><p>Earlier we only used uniquely mapped reads, but now we also included multi mapping reads in the quantification of TE expression (following Anderson et al. 2019). Methylation calling still only uses uniquely mapped reads because it is done site-by-site basis (i.e., the same way as SNP calling) and we are not aware of an approach that accurately takes multimapping reads into account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please verify you used a version of RAISd that accounts for variable numbers of bp sequenced in each window.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We used the newest version of RAiSD, but it appears that the unmappable regions need to be excluded using the -X option, which we didn’t do before. We now removed regions that contained no sequencing data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To correct bismark, for some genes, WGS SNP data were used, and RNA-seq for others. Do these two sets (WGS genes and RNA-seq genes) show differential methylation?</p></disp-quote><p>Genes not found in the RNA-seq data do have higher non-CG methylation levels than expressed genes (CG<sub>expressed</sub> = 0.270, CHG<sub>expressed</sub> = 0.0156, CHH<sub>expressed</sub> = 0.006; CG<sub>non-expresse</sub>d = 0.231, CHG <sub>non-expressed</sub> = 0.151, CHH <sub>non-expressed</sub> = 0.038). However, this pattern is expected, because higher non-CG methylation is associated with lower gene expression (line 190), and it is unlikely that the difference would be an artifact of the correction (if indeed this is what the reviewer had in mind).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– There are a number of enrichment analyses done in the paper; are these corrected for multiple testing?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We have now been more careful to add Q values to all enrichment tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6D looks at the % of TEs. Are total numbers of new DNA insertions higher in J3 than J1? That would change the interpretation I think?</p></disp-quote><p>We focus on frequencies and percentages because the total number of TE insertions is strongly dependent on the samples, with higher sequencing coverage resulting in more TEs. It is true that if the total number of DNA transposons is higher in J3 than in J1, then more efficient purging in J3 would be unlikely. In fact, it may be equally likely that both class I and II TEs are more numerous in J3, but we see relatively more class I TEs simply because they move through copying (i.e., it has nothing to do with purging). We have modified the text to take this more careful interpretation into account (lines 314 – 320).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Does Figure 4 look different if you plot the 95% range rather than the CI?</p></disp-quote><p>Ranges do overlap between the different candidate gene groups, but we don’t think that this is inconsistent with any of our interpretation of the results.

We have now been more careful in interpreting our results and described our reasoning in more detail in the manuscript. That said, we don’t actually assume that the observed differences are only due cis variants: we examined putative promoter regions because we were able to do so using the current dataset. In the manuscript we study two processes that may influence adaptive phenotypes: variation in expression levels, which is primarily affected by cis and trans regulatory elements, and variation in the gene product, which is primarily affected by the coding sequence. Our first observation is that the environmentally induced expression responses are highly consistent across the three populations (and any differences are mainly between Norway and Germany), indicating that the regulatory systems are largely conserved. For cis elements, this assumption was supported by our analysis of the promoter regions. Although we can’t conduct similar analysis on trans-regulatory elements, we believe them to be similarly conserved (line 388). We then find that the coding sequences (and by extension, the gene products) of the environmentally responsive genes are highly constrained. Therefore, given the lack of heritable variation at the expression and sequence levels, we infer that the environmentally responsive genes have weak potential for evolutionary change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast, DMGs are almost always cis as shown by work from the Springer and Schmitz groups.

For finding DMGs due to field site, we compare the fit of models: methylation ~ population + field and methylation ~ population (we now describe the models in Table S1). Since GER has fewer plastic effects and lower methylation across the board, the population term attempts to correct for this effect. Of course, the lower methylation levels and more subtle plastic effects likely reduce the power to detect DMGs, but since our goal was to find representative gene sets for quantification of selective constraint, not to identify all DMGs, we believe our conclusion to be valid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A similar concern is that in the closely related Arabidopsis thaliana, a large fraction of cis causality for DEGs is actually not promoter polymorphisms but actually PAV or other structural variation within the loci.

For example, we found increased Fst within the promoter regions of DEG ~ Field:Population genes, which could, at least in part, be due to SVs that are in LD with the SNPs. However, given that these types of analyses don’t assume that any of the SNPs are causative (just that they are in LD with the causative variant), such a scenario would not invalidate our results. Furthermore, we think that a comparison to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is not as straight forward as one might think: large-effect SVs are well known to influence flowering time in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (as the reviewer points out), but no evidence of similar effects have been found in A. lyrata (Kuittinen et al. 2008). This difference could be related to the mating system, as large effect loci may be less likely to reach high frequencies in outcrossing species (as also found in maize, Buckler et al. 2009).</p><p>We agree that SVs within the coding regions would complicate the alignment of sequencing reads, but for plastic DEGs this seems like an unlikely source of error. First, for this to cause the observed expression difference, SVs would need to be present only in individuals planted either in the low- or high-altitude field site (for few genes this could be the case, but unlikely for the majority). Second, we conducted the selection analysis using independent whole-genome sequenced individuals, meaning that the same SVs could not cause both the expression difference and signals of strong selective constraint. Third, much of our selection analysis is based on comparing the synonymous and nonsynonymous sites (DFE and α), which indicated stronger than expected constraint at functional sites. We would not expect alignment errors to primarily influence nonsynonymous sites (indeed, assembly-based studies have found that genes with signals of strong selective constraint are, on average, less likely to overlap SVs, Hämälä et al. 2021). Fourth, our selection inferences were confirmed by two comparative tests (one for coding and for promotor sequence), which are unaffected by SV polymorphisms. In contrast to DEGs, non-CG DMGs may be more likely affected by SVs given the signals of relaxed selective constraint. In fact, we find an enrichment of TE polymorphism at these genes, which could (at least in part) be driving the plastic methylation responses observed at these genes (i.e., TEs are environmentally responsive and methylation spreads to the genic regions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study was aimed at identifying the adaptive potential of genomes in response to different environments.

The second category of methylation is found anywhere in the genome (including genes) and contains CG + non-CG (CHG and CHH) methylation. This study has not properly distinguished these regions and it has likely led to improper conclusions.</p><p>With regards to the findings presented on plasticity of DNA methylation, many of the findings are somewhat expected. It has been established that DNA methylation variation is largely driven by genetic variation within plant genomes. The variation in methylation found between different environments on non-gene regions also reflects common observations. There are lots of environments that lead to genome-wide changes in methylation. It's important to note that not all of these changes are causal. In fact, many of them are likely an indirect effect of 3D nuclear genome compaction and access of DNA methyltransferases to target sequences. Notice the changes in methylation are very subtle and they exclusively occur at regions that already possess methylation. It is not like mammalian systems where methylation is completely lost or gained at regions.</p><p>The section of TE activation by stress was not fully supported by the data presented. It's an intriguing possibility, but not well supported by the data. This entire section needs to be revisited with additional analyses.</p><p>Overall, although this is a unique population the conclusions presented are incremental to the field. The shortcomings presented in the analysis can be easily remedied, although it will be curious to see how they change the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the insightful comments. It does appear that we should have also considered CHG and CHH methylation in our DMG analysis. To remedy this, we now conducted the DMG analysis separately for CG (while controlling for variation in non-CG sites) and non-CG methylation. As pointed out by the reviewer, our previous results related to DMGs were likely driven by non-CG methylation (or the combined CG+CHG+CHH methylation). Our revised results show that CG-only methylation at gene bodies shows few environmental effects, consistent with the idea that GBM is highly conserved.</p><p>We agree that results related to the plasticity of DNA methylation are not novel, and we cite many previous studies done in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. However, the examination of methylation variation at genes and TEs is only a small part of our study. The main point was to combine the analysis of plastic and genetic variation in gene expression and DNA methylation with population genetic analyses of selection to assess how such variation influences adaptive evolution. This, to our knowledge, has not been done before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The DNA methylation data must be partitioned into CG and CG/CHG/CHH regions in the analysis. Using CG methylation alone mixes two distinct groups together. It is well established that CG/CHG/CHH methylated regions are generally silenced whereas CG only methylated genes are expressed.</p><p>More information is required for understanding how DMGs were defined. What is the size distribution of DMGs? What proportion of DMGs are GBM vs those that contain CG/CHG/CHH? The rapidly evolving DMGs mentioned on line 252 are likely those that contain CG/CHGCHH, as worked by Gaut et al. have shown that GBM genes have low rates of nucleotide substitutions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. As we describe above, we now separate CG and non-CG DMGs and find that most methylation changes occur in the non-CG sites (consistent with the idea that GBM is highly conserved). We define DMGs as genes with differential methylation in the gene bodies and therefore sizes of the DMGs depend on the length of the genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm not convinced by the TE analysis. Are these full length TEs? Or are they TE fragments? How are multiple mapping reads handled in the RNA-seq analysis? Read counts of 5-6 as presented in 6b are not very convincing for &quot;expressed&quot; TEs. I found this to be another weak aspect of the study. What's the evidence these TEs are &quot;stress induced&quot;? It is stated that TEs overlapping genes were removed, but these genotypes were mapped to a reference genome? There will be differences and no genomes have 100% annotation. This is especially true of out-crossing species. Overall, I found the evidence of stress induced activation of TEs not well supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>The consensus sequences are full length TEs but reads may also map to TE fragments. To strengthen our TE analysis, we followed reviewer 1’s suggestion and quantified TE expression using the same approach as Anderson et al. 2019 (quantification at the level of TE families, using also multimapping reads). Although we would expect that only full length TEs are expressed, reads may also map to TE fragments due to sequence similarity. The approach we use now takes those reads better into account by assigning them to TE families.</p><p>We have now added a unit to the y-axis label of 5B: what’s shown are read counts after variance stabilization transformation (to account for different library sizes), not raw counts (which have an average of around 80 reads). Subsequently, we observed considerably higher TE expression levels at the more stressful high-altitude field site. This result may be due to three reasons: stress induced TE activation, technical bias (e.g., batch effect), or unaccounted gene expression. We have now conducted additional analysis to rule out technical bias and gene expression (line 293). Briefly, technical bias would influence the whole library, whereas we only see higher TE (and not gene) expression in the high-altitude field (Figure S14). Similar reasoning also applies to the effects of genes that have been missed in the genome annotation. It is unlikely that such missing genes would be systematically upregulated in the high-altitude field site, especially given that differentially expressed genes exhibited no such bias.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 405 – there is not assignment of cause and effect from the results of this study. The authors should be careful not to state methylation is affecting expression. It could equally be possible that expression is affecting methylation.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s a fair point. We have modified the sentence (line 384).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found the section on rates of evolution of 1kb upstream regions worthwhile, but to extend this make conclusions about cis-regulatory elements is a bit of a stretch.
