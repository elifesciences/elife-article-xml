emerging model organism for neuroscience due to its small size, transparency, genetic tractability, and regenerative nervous system; however, fundamental properties of its sensorimotor behaviors remain unknown. Here, we use microfluidic devices combined with fluorescent calcium imaging and surgical resectioning to study how the diffuse nervous system coordinates <italic>Hydra</italic>'s mechanosensory response. Mechanical stimuli cause animals to contract, and we find this response relies on at least two distinct networks of neurons in the oral and aboral regions of the animal. Different activity patterns arise in these networks depending on whether the animal is contracting spontaneously or contracting in response to mechanical stimulation. Together, these findings improve our understanding of how <italic>Hydra</italic>’s diffuse nervous system coordinates sensorimotor behaviors. These insights help reveal how sensory information is processed in an animal with a diffuse, radially symmetric neural architecture unlike the dense, bilaterally symmetric nervous systems found in most model organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hydra</kwd><kwd>mechanosensory behavior</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>sensory-motor response</kwd><kwd>diffuse nerve net</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1829158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juliano</surname><given-names>Celina</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Jacob T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1250104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Badhiwala</surname><given-names>Krishna N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG067034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Juliano</surname><given-names>Celina</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Jacob T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Despite lacking traditional ganglia or centralization, the <italic>Hydra</italic> nervous system computes sensorimotor responses via localized neuron ensembles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Discovering the fundamental principles of neural activity and behaviors requires studying the nervous systems of diverse organisms. Animals have evolved different neural structures like the nerve net (e.g., <italic>Hydra</italic>), nerve cords and ganglia (e.g., <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, <italic>Aplysia</italic>, planaria), and brain (e.g., <italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, rodents, and primates). Despite the vastly different structures, many behaviors are conserved across species, including sensorimotor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clark et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaplan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haesemeyer et al., 2018</xref>) and sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raizen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artiushin and Sehgal, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kayser and Biron, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gandhi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhdanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zimmerman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kanaya et al., 2020</xref>). By comparing neural circuits that support similar behaviors despite different architectures, we can discover organizational principles of neural circuits that reflect millions of years of evolutionary pressure. While there are many potential organisms that would support this type of comparative neuroscience, only a small group of animals have the qualities to support laboratory experiments: short generation span, ease of breeding and manipulation in laboratory conditions, small and compact size, optical transparency, and a well-developed genetic toolkit with a complete spatial and molecular map of the nervous system.</p><p>Transparent, millimeter-sized animals in particular offer a number of advantages for neuroscientists because it is possible to image neural activity throughout the entire nervous system using genetically encoded calcium or voltage-sensitive fluorescent proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broussard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lemon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prevedel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Portugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vladimirov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonzales et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, some millimeter-sized animals are compatible with microfluidic devices for precise environmental control and microscopy techniques that offer cellular-resolution functional imaging of the entire nervous system. These properties, combined with genetic tractability, provide a powerful way of revealing neuronal dynamics across the entire nervous system (not just a small region) during behaviors. For instance, whole nervous system imaging of confined or freely moving animals has revealed the neuronal dynamics underlying locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prevedel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>) and sensory-motivated global state transitions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nichols et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gonzales et al., 2019</xref>), responses to noxious odor and visuomotor behaviors in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prevedel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Portugues et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vladimirov et al., 2014</xref>), responses to light and odor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lemon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aimon et al., 2019</xref>), and neuronal ensembles correlated with basal behaviors and response to light and heat in <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badhiwala et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p><italic>Hydra</italic> is unique among the small, transparent organisms discussed above due to its regenerative ability and highly dynamic nervous system. While most small, transparent model systems (like <italic>C. elegans</italic> or zebrafish larvae) suffer permanent behavioral deficits from the loss of one or a few neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bargmann and Horvitz, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargmann and Avery, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">El Bejjani and Hammarlund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kroehne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hecker et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>Hydra</italic> can completely recover from a significant neuronal loss to regain normal contractile behavior in as little as ~48 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itayama and Sawada, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soriano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gierer et al., 1972</xref>). This radially symmetric freshwater cnidarian has a nervous system composed of two diffuse networks of neurons, one embedded in the endoderm and another embedded in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burnett and Diehl, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lfntz and Barrnett, 1965</xref>). While <italic>Hydra’s</italic> diffuse nerve net is highly dynamic with continuous cellular turnover and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bode et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Campbell, 1967</xref>), regions with increased neuron density resembling nerve rings have a comparatively lower neuronal turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bode et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epp and Tardent, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koizumi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hufnagel and Kass-Simon, 2016</xref>). One of these regions is in the oral end in the apex above the ring of tentacles (‘hypostomal nerve ring’), and another is in the aboral end in the foot (‘peduncle nerve ring’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

This existing molecular and spatial map of the nervous system suggests that there is no overlap in the neuronal cell types that make up the hypostomal and peduncle nerve rings, and the distribution of the cell types varies along the length of the body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Finally, the demonstration of microfluidic and transgenic tools combined with <italic>Hydra’s</italic> dynamic yet ‘simple’ neural architecture has enabled observations of basal and sensory motivated behaviors in the regenerating nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badhiwala et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of neurons in the <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Fluorescent image of <italic>Hydra</italic> nervous system.

While it is well documented that <italic>Hydra</italic> contract when mechanically agitated or poked with a pipette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mast, 1903</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wagner, 1905</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rushforth, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rushforth et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rushforth and Burke, 1971</xref>), we found no quantitative reports of how this behavior depends on stimulus intensity or is mediated by neural activity. Although significant insights in <italic>Hydra</italic> behavior have been made over the last several decades with simple methodologies and manual observations, including that the tentacles and/or the hypostome are needed for mechanosensory response, these experiments lack quantitative characterization of neuronal or behavioral response. Forceps-induced touch allows local stimulation, but it is difficult to control the force applied manually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takaku et al., 2014</xref>). While stimulation with mechanical agitation allows control over stimulus intensity, these observations are limited to changes in body lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rushforth et al., 1963</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use whole-animal functional imaging combined with resection studies to discover that despite the apparently diffuse nerve net in <italic>Hydra</italic>, these animals process sensorimotor responses in specialized regional networks. To study the mechanosensory response, we first developed a microfluidic system to apply a local mechanical stimulus and quantify <italic>Hydra’s</italic> behavioral and neural response. We then measured these responses in the absence of select regions of the body and found at least one of the neuron-rich regions, the hypostome (oral) or the peduncle (aboral), is required to coordinate spontaneous contractions, though the oral network plays a more significant role. We found a significant reduction in the mechanosensory response with the removal of the hypostome, the region where sensory information is likely processed. These sensorimotor experiments combined with whole-animal neural and epitheliomuscular imaging reveal that <italic>Hydra</italic> is capable of receiving sensory information along the body column; however, the oral region is necessary for coordinating the motor response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Hydra’s</italic> mechanosensory response is dependent on stimulus intensity</title><p>To better understand sensory information processing in <italic>Hydra</italic>, we developed a double-layer microfluidic system that can apply a local mechanical stimulus while we image the response of the entire nervous system using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This local mechanical stimulation is made possible by push-down microfluidic valves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) that deliver mechanical stimuli to a portion of the <italic>Hydra</italic> body with precise temporal and spatial control (see Materials and methods). For all experiments, we pressurized a valve (400 µm diameter) that was directly above the animal (for 1 s every 31 s, see Materials and methods) to stimulate the body column while simultaneously performing functional calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). We selected the middle of the body for stimulation region to help ensure that we stimulated roughly the same region of the animal throughout each experiment. This choice was based on the observation that the body column region was relatively stationary, whereas the oral and aboral extremities had large displacements during body contractions and elongations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title><italic>Hydra’s</italic> neuronal response depends on the mechanical stimulus intensity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (Left) Side view of double-layer microfluidic device for mechanical stimulation.

To measure the locality of this stimulus, we performed an experiment using transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> (nGreen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>) expressing GFP pan-neuronally (and in neural progenitors) and tracked the position and fluorescence intensity (GFP) from individual neurons during mechanical stimulation (N = 222 neurons over 1 min). When the microfluidic valve was pressurized to deliver mechanical stimulation, we found significantly increased average cellular (or tissue) displacement (p&lt;0.001). Further analysis of the cellular movements showed the spatial distribution of mechanical force from the stimulation was primarily experienced by the neurons directly under the valve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, we found that the tissue directly below the valve was compressed (z direction) when mechanically stimulated – the neurons directly under the valve had a small magnitude of lateral (x–y direction) displacement. The tissue bordering the valve was stretched away from the valve center – the neurons in the neighboring regions around the valve had the largest lateral displacement. This lateral displacement decreased for neurons that were farther from the center of the valve. Neurons more than 750 µm from the microfluidic valve center showed a negligible displacement of less than 5 µm (95% CI lower bound = 5.8 µm), which is ~550% less than the displacement of neurons bordering the valve.</p><p>Having established our method to provide local mechanical stimuli, we characterized <italic>Hydra’s</italic> sensitivity to local touch and the associated neural response. We performed experiments using transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> expressing GCaMP6s in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>). When we delivered mechanical stimuli, we found bright calcium signals generated by a small number of neurons in the hypostome and body column and a striking co-activation of many neurons in the ectodermal peduncle nerve ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). This nerve ring activity appeared as either a single bright calcium spike (or ‘contraction pulse’) or a volley of bright calcium spikes (or ‘contraction burst’). We also found that the calcium-sensitive fluorescence averaged over a region of interest (ROI) surrounding the peduncle faithfully represented the contraction pulses and bursts measured from individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we analyzed single-neuron calcium dynamics from this peduncle nerve ring, we found extremely high correlated activity as previously reported for contractions pulses and bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badhiwala et al., 2018</xref>). Given the similarity of these data between large and small ROIs, we chose to use the peduncle ROI to measure neuronal contraction bursts and pulses because it does not require single-neuron tracking, which significantly increased the throughput of our data analysis. We further confirmed that this signal is not the result of motion artifacts by measuring fluorescence from <italic>Hydra</italic> (nGreen) that express GFP pan-neuronally using a similar ROI. In that case, we did not see the strong fluorescence signals associated with contraction pulses and bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3e, f</xref>). Body length proved to be an unreliable quantification of contractions due to the stimulation artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d</xref>); however, we were able to accurately measure muscle activity associated with contractions by imaging calcium spikes in the epithelial muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>).

During mild stimuli, there was a slight increase (~2×) in response probability above the spontaneous activity, although this increase was not statistically significant compared to spontaneous contraction bursts or pulses (valve pressure 10 and 15 psi; response probability = 0.23 ± 0.01 and 0.24 ± 0.03, mean ± SEM, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e, h</xref>).

While spontaneous contraction pulses or bursts were observed roughly once every minute in microfluidics, when we stimulated <italic>Hydra</italic> with a strong mechanical stimuli, we found that the frequency nearly matched the 31 s between stimuli (Interval between spontaneous contraction bursts or pulses = 72.98 s ± 4.58, mean ± SEM; 66.68 ± 5.73 s median ± SE; Interval between stimulated contraction bursts or pulses = 20 psi, 38.28 ± 1.77 s, mean ± SEM; 31.14 ± 2.21 s, median ± SE; 25 psi, 32.20 ± 1.04 s, mean ± SEM; 31.14 ± 1.30 s, median ± SE; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f, h</xref>). While the majority of spontaneous calcium spikes formed bursts, stimulated calcium spikes were roughly three times more likely to be a single contraction pulses (percentage of spontaneous spiking activity that is a single contraction pulse = 0 psi, 16.87 ± 5.38% mean ± SEM; percentage of stimulated spiking activity that is a single contraction pulse = 20 psi, 56.84 ± 2.48%; 25 psi, 62.50 ± 5.23%, mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g, h</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Hydra</italic> sensitivity to mechanical stimuli is lowest near the aboral end</title><p>Because of the diffuse neural architecture of <italic>Hydra</italic>, we expected each patch of <italic>Hydra</italic> tissue to be equally responsive to mechanical stimuli. However, when we stimulated transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> expressing GCaMP6s (N = 3 whole animals, stimulated 40 times per region with 22 psi) at three different regions along their body (oral, middle body, and aboral, stimulated 40 times at each region with 22 psi), we found the aboral end of <italic>Hydra</italic> to be less sensitive than the center of the body (aboral region response probability = 0.1 ± 0.025; mid-body region response probability = 0.42 ± 0.025; mean ± SEM; p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7a</xref>). Epitheliomuscular calcium imaging (N = 8 whole animals expressing GCaMP7b in endodermal epitheliomuscular cells, stimulated 40 times in body column region with 22 psi) also showed that the sensitivity to mechanical stimulation generally decreases towards the aboral end of the <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7b</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the difference in sensitivity along the body was not an artifact due to differently sized <italic>Hydra</italic> experiencing different pressures from the microfluidic valves. We observed no statistically significant trend between animal size and response probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7c</xref>). These findings, combined with the transcriptional analysis and in situ hybridizations that indicate higher density of sensory neurons in the oral half of the <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>), suggest that the oral end may be more sensitive to mechanical stimuli. Unlike other organisms that have unique motor responses like reversals or acceleration depending on the location of mechanical stimuli (e.g., <italic>C. elegans</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chalfie et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wicks et al., 1996</xref>), we observed that the same motor program was initiated regardless of where on the body the animal was touched. The only difference we observed was the fact that the response probability depended on where along the oral and aboral axis we delivered the mechanical stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>Hydra</italic>’s mechanosensory response is mediated by electrically coupled cells</title><p>Based on the latency of the mechanosensory response, we hypothesized that sensorimotor information is transmitted by electrical activity in the <italic>Hydra</italic> and not by passive calcium diffusion through epithelial cells. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that aneural <italic>Hydra,</italic> which no longer spontaneously contract in the absence of stimuli, are capable of aversive contractile response to touch; however, their responses are slow and require strong mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campbell et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takaku et al., 2014</xref>). To further test our hypothesis, we created a transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> strain that expresses the calcium indicator GCaMP7b (under the EF1ɑ promoter, see Materials and methods) in the endodermal epitheliomuscular cells. During body contractions, both endodermal and ectodermal epitheliomuscular cells are co-activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). With this transgenic line we measured contraction pulses and contraction bursts by averaging calcium activity in all epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). We hypothesized that if the mechanosensory response was primarily mediated by calcium diffusion through epitheliomuscular cells, we would expect to see propagation of calcium activity from the site of the stimulation. However, this was not the case; we observed fast propagation of calcium activity throughout the entire endoderm. Imaging calcium activity in the peduncle neurons showed that changes in neural activity correlated with the observed changes in epithelial muscle cells with increasing stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests that the mechanosensory response is indeed mediated by the electrically coupled cells. Although <italic>Hydra</italic>’s behavioral responses are slow compared to other invertebrates, the 0.5 s average response time in our data could not be explained by calcium diffusion alone, which would take ~100 s to travel the average distance of ~0.5–1 mm between the stimulation site and the peduncle or hypostome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8a</xref>). Our data show that the calcium signals from the peduncle neurons or endodermal muscles start increasing within ~0.1–0.2 s following stimulation onset, reaching peak fluorescence at ~0.5–0.6 s regardless of the stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8b–e</xref>). We found no difference in the calcium response times between neural and muscle calcium imaging, though this could be influenced by the dynamics of the calcium indicator, which typically cannot give information about latencies less than 50 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Aboral neurons are not necessary for mechanosensory response in <italic>Hydra</italic></title><p>Having quantitatively established <italic>Hydra’s</italic> sensorimotor response to mechanical stimuli, we next asked if specific regions of the nervous system play primary roles in mediating this response.

However, the animal’s regenerative abilities allow us to resect large portions of tissue without killing the animal, thus we can borrow from the tradition of lesioning brain regions to study their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rushforth et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vaidya et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krug et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Passano and McCullough, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pierobon, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because the <italic>Hydra</italic> body plan is radially symmetric with cell types primarily varying along the oral-aboral axis of the body column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we chose to make axial cuts across the body column to remove select neuronal populations from the animal. Our rationale was that these resections would remove entire or nearly entire groups of neuronal cell types. We then allowed ~6–12 hr for the animal to recover. This recovery time helps to reduce the confounding contributions from initial tissue regeneration and allows animals to recover enough to tolerate microfluidic immobilization. This period is long enough to allow the wounds to close, the molecular response to injury to be completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cazet and Juliano, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tursch et al., 2020</xref>), and the initial molecular events of regeneration to start; but it is <italic>not</italic> long enough for the animal to regenerate lost neurons, which takes approximately 30–72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Itayama and Sawada, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pierobon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bode, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goel et al., 2019</xref>). We confirmed that 6–12 hr after resection the animals indeed showed loss of specific neuronal cell types by measuring the expression levels of subtype-specific neuronal markers via qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). To limit the stress from microfluidic immobilization that could exacerbate the resection wounds and affect activity, we shortened the duration of these experiments for the majority of the animals (40 min total, 20 min of no stimulation, 20 min of stimulation – valve on 1 s at 22 psi or 0 psi, off 30 s). Only three animals per each condition (stimulated and non-stimulated, and five different resections) were experimented on with a longer duration protocol as used previously (100 min total, 20 min no stimulation, 60 min of stimulation – valve on 1 s at 22 psi or 0 psi, off 30 s, 20 min no stimulation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We began resection studies by removing the peduncle and basal disk to create a ‘footless’ <italic>Hydra.</italic> We hypothesized that aboral neurons may be important for coordinating and enhancing body contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

In addition, the neuropeptide Hym-176C has been shown to induce ectodermal muscle contractions and is selectively expressed in the ectodermal peduncle neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klimovich et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, the presence of gap junction protein innexin-2 in aboral neurons could facilitate fast electrical conductions that allows these neurons to fire synchronously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takaku et al., 2014</xref>).

We found that these longitudinally ‘bisected’ animals showed mechanosensory responses that were not significantly different from that of the whole, ‘headless,’ or ‘footless’ animals (‘bisected’ N = 3 animals stimulated for 60 min, mechanosensory response probability = 0.54 ± 0.14, mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b, c</xref>). However, the magnitude of increase in contraction bursts or pulses activity due to stimulation in ‘bisected’ individuals, though lower than whole and ‘footless’ individuals, was larger than ‘headless’ individuals (‘bisected’ N = 8 animals stimulated for 20 min, p&lt;0.001, Cohen’s d = 2.32, Cliff’s delta = 1.0). This suggests that our observations in ‘headless’ <italic>Hydra</italic> indeed depended upon the types of neurons removed during the headless resection and not simply an injury response. We also found that these longitudinally ‘bisected’ animals had a lower probability of spontaneous contraction bursts or pulses than the whole animals but higher than ‘headless’ animals. This suggests that the entire network needs to be intact for normal contraction bursts or pulses activity, and the loss of roughly half the network leads to some reduction in contractile activity (‘bisected’ N = 3 animals not stimulated, spontaneous contraction probability = 0.08 ± 0.02, mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">Videos 14</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">15</xref>).</p><media id="video14" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-64108-video14.mp4"><label>Video 14.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous endodermal epitheliomuscular calcium activity in bisected animals.</title><p>Dashed blue square indicates the region of interest (ROI) (entire frame) used for the calcium trace shown in blue (bottom).

To answer this question, we completely removed both oral and aboral regions. In ‘body column’ animals, we found significant reduction in both the mechanosensory response and spontaneous contraction bursts and pulses relative to whole animals. The ‘body column’ animals had a mechanosensory response probability that was not different from the mechanosensory response in ‘headless’ animals, while the spontaneous contraction bursts and pulses probability was lower compared to that of ‘headless’ animals (‘body column’ N = 3 animals stimulated for 60 min, mechanosensory response probability = 0.19 ± 0.08; ‘body column’ N = 3 animals not stimulated, spontaneous contraction probability = 0.02 ± 0.01 mean ± SEM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b, c</xref>). Although we found a significant increase in contraction bursts and pulses with stimulation as compared to spontaneous contraction bursts and pulses activity in ‘body column’ individuals similar to all resections, the magnitude of the increase was the lowest in ‘body column’ animals (even lower than ‘headless’ animals) (‘body column’ N = 6 animals stimulated for 20 min, p&lt;0.05, Cohen’s d = 1.10, Cliff’s delta = 0.50; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Videos 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">17</xref>). Moreover, we did not observe significant increases in contraction bursts and pulses over the same time period (comparing activity from 0 to 20 min with activity from 20 to 40 min, see Materials and methods) in non-stimulated animals, suggesting that the higher probability of contraction bursts and pulses was in fact due to mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Thus, based on the comparison between the probability of spontaneous contraction bursts and pulses and mechanosensory response in all resections, we found that the ‘body column’ animals had a weak response to touch despite their slightly increased contraction bursts and pulses probability with mechanical stimulation.</p><media id="video16" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-64108-video16.mp4"><label>Video 16.</label><caption><title>Spontaneous endodermal epitheliomuscular calcium activity in body column animals.</title><p>Dashed blue square indicates the region of interest (ROI) (entire frame) used for the calcium trace shown in blue (bottom).

We found that there were at least two independent networks of neurons based on a correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Specifically, we time-aligned the calcium activity with either spontaneous contractions or mechanical stimulation events to classify these groups of neurons based on their activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, e, g</xref>). One group of correlated neurons found throughout the entire body showed averaged calcium activity less than 1 s after a mechanical stimulus and spontaneous activity that is consistent with previously reported contraction burst (CB) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>).

In addition to these CB neurons, we found other groups of correlated neurons with average calcium activity that is independent of the CB network. One group showed a distinctive pattern of activity following mechanical stimulation, but no distinctive activity associated with spontaneous contractions.

Because the activity of the MR neurons occurs after the contraction, their role in the behavioral response remains unclear.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our experiments with ‘footless,’ ‘headless,’ ‘bisected,’ and ‘body column’ animals show that mechanosensory and spontaneous behaviors are regulated by neural ensembles that are localized to select regions of the animal; however, some properties of the mechanosensory response may be evenly distributed throughout the body. We demonstrate that localized touch produces an increased calcium activity in both peduncle neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and endodermal epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is associated with body contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badhiwala et al., 2018</xref>). We identified at least two neuronal networks (MR and CB network) with distinct neuronal activities mediating the stimulated responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), where the CB network of neurons show fast calcium responses, and the MR neurons show slower calcium response. It is possible that the MR neurons, primarily found in the oral end (N = 3 <italic>Hydra</italic>), may consist of ec4 neurons, which are the only neuronal subtype in the oral end with an unknown function. The other orally located ectodermal neuron populations, ec1B and ec3C, are suggested to belong to the CB and RP1 circuits, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>Hydra’s</italic> responsiveness (i.e., probability of response to a mechanical stimuli) depends on the stimulus intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the ‘headless’ and ‘footless’ animals can still respond to mechanical stimuli despite missing an entire regional neuronal network; however, ‘headless’ animals show reduced responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The ‘body column’ animals missing both regional neuronal networks have the most dramatically reduced responsiveness, suggesting that these two neuronal networks work together and play compensatory roles in mediating the mechanosensory response.</p><p>Surprisingly, although the activity of the peduncle nerve ring is strongly associated with spontaneous contractions, these neurons are not necessary for body contraction and response to mechanical stimulation. This raises the question of what role the peduncle nerve ring plays in <italic>Hydra</italic> behavior. One possible explanation is that this nerve ring coordinates body contractions by enhancing the neural signal to epithelial cells. An additional 4 s reduction in body contraction duration in ‘body column’ animals compared to headless animals supports the idea that the peduncle nerve ring is also involved in coordination of contractile behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Furthermore, calcium activity propagates from the foot to the hypostome in whole animals during body contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Szymanski and Yuste, 2019</xref>), supporting a hypothesis that the peduncle network of neurons may be motor neurons.</p><p>Based on these observations, we propose a simple model for sensorimotor information flow in <italic>Hydra</italic> where we consider the hypostome as an integration point where sensory and motor information converge. The information is then communicated to the peduncle where it is amplified for coordinated whole-body control. There may be sufficient functional redundancy between the hypostome and peduncle regions such that removal or damage to one of them is well tolerated in <italic>Hydra</italic>. Moreover, the diffuse network in the body column may retain minimal processing capabilities needed for weak sensorimotor responses. The fast and slow calcium responses from the CB and MR neurons, respectively, indeed support the hypothesis that <italic>Hydra</italic> have multiple, separate pathways for behavioral response.</p><p>Overall, the quantitative characterization of <italic>Hydra’s</italic> sensorimotor responses reported here helps to build the foundation for a more comprehensive investigation of information processing in <italic>Hydra – </italic>an animal with clear advantages to supplement commonly studied model organisms in neuroscience. Important next steps include developing mechanistic models to describe sensory information processing that supports our results. Although our experiments describe general information flow in <italic>Hydra</italic>, having a cellular-level control of neuronal activity would be a clear advantage for revealing the function of neuronal cell types as well as their functional connectivity in the sensorimotor circuits. We expect additional future work with optogenetic manipulation of specific neuronal subtypes combined with fast, volumetric and ratiometric imaging techniques will provide a more comprehensive approach for characterizing this sensorimotor processing in <italic>Hydra</italic>. Recognizing that calcium fluorescence imaging is limited in its ability to measure single spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), we also expect other activity sensors (such as voltage indicators) will reveal what role the MR neurons play in behavioral response. Building upon the work reported here, one can then interrogate the roles of these regional networks with multiple sensory modalities, such as light and heat, to answer questions about how diffuse nervous systems may be capable of centralized information processing and multisensory integration. These studies may help reveal a comprehensive model for how internal states and external stimuli shape the behavioral repertoire in an organism with a highly dynamic neural architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Hydra</italic> strains and maintenance</title><p><italic>Hydra</italic> were raised in <italic>Hydra</italic> medium at 18°C in a light-cycled (12 hr:12 hr; light:dark) incubator and fed with an excess of freshly hatched <italic>Artemia nauplii</italic> (Brine Shrimp Direct, Ogden, UT, #BSEP8Z) three times a week (protocol adapted from Steele lab).

We used a pressure regulator to manually control the air pressure into the valve manifold. In summary, we set the stimulation pressure with a pressure gauge to regulate the flow of air into the valve manifold. This valve manifold was controlled with a USB valve controller that allowed us to programmatically inflate the valve (turn it ‘on’) with pressurized air with custom stimulation parameters.</p><p>To test sensory motor response to mechanical stimuli, we used pressurized air to inflate the push-down valve and cause it to press down on the <italic>Hydra</italic> immobilized in the bottom layer.

From these tracks, we calculated the displacement of each of the neurons between each frame (~50 ms). The average cellular displacement (0.4 µm per frame, 50 ms) was calculated by averaging the cellular displacements from all frames when the valve was not pressurized. We found a significantly increased displacement (6.2 μm, p&lt;0.001) just after the valve was pressurized (and after the valve was depressurized 1 s later). We then generated a vector map of neuronal displacements by calculating the change in position of each of the neurons in the frame just after the valve was pressurized for the first stimulation trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We also plotted the cellular displacement for each of the neurons and the location of those neurons relative to the center of the valve. We averaged the highest three displacements in 50 µm radial band increments from the valve center to quantify how far the mechanical forces extended. This was a more conservative measurement as the neurons in different tissue layers (endodermal and ectodermal layers furthest from the valve) may have experienced different forces. By taking the average of the highest three displacements in 50 µm radial bands increments from the valve center, we identified the majority of the (shear) force was experienced by neurons bordering the valve in 250 µm radius.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fluorescence intensity from GFP <italic>Hydra</italic></title><p>To prove that the fluorescence intensity changes we observed with calcium imaging are due to calcium activity and not motion artifacts from body contractions, we compared the average fluorescence intensities from three different transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> lines: (1) expressing GFP pan-neuronally (nGreen line), (2) expressing GCaMP6s pan-neuronally, and (3) expressing GCaMP7b in ectodermal epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Briefly, transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> expressing GCaMP6s in the ectodermal epitheliomuscular cells starved for at least 48 hr were used to measure the activity of the muscles (10 fps, 30 min, 4× objective with 15% light intensity). An inverted microscope with GFP filter and Andor Zyla 4.2 were used for capturing images. All electrical data was obtained with an Intan Technologies RHD2132 unipolar input amplifier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intantech.com">http://intantech.com</ext-link>) at a sampling rate of 1 kHz, low-frequency cutoff and DSP filter of 0.1 Hz and high-frequency cutoff of 7.5 kHz. From the calcium activity traces, we identified 30 s intervals of either high-amplitude activity or low-amplitude activity to perform cross-correlation analysis. The high- and low-amplitude activity regions were manually identified with a threshold of 20% of the highest peak in the calcium activity. The high-amplitude activity region occurred during contraction bursts. The low-amplitude activity region occurred during tentacle contractions for muscular activity imaging. Both the Intan amplifier and the Zyla were triggered with the same TTL signal. However, to account for any offset in the timing of the electrical and optical data, we measured the maximum of the cross-correlogram in a 50 ms (approximately one duty cycle of the trigger signal) window rather than the cross-correlation at zero offset to generate the correlation maps. For correlation map, each frame was down sampled to 64 × 64 pixels, and the fluorescence trace for the downsampled pixels across the 30 s intervals was cross-correlated with electrical activity during the same 30 s interval. The intensity of color in the correlation map was used to indicate correlation values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Whole-animal imaging of epitheliomuscular activity at different stimulus intensities</title><p>We characterized the muscle response to mechanical stimuli using animals that expressed GCaMP7b under the EF1a promoter in endodermal epitheliomuscular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

These raster plots were used to calculate the probability for spontaneous contraction and mechanosensory response.</p><p>For contractile behavior analysis, we then annotated the calcium spikes. Single-calcium spikes were labeled as single-pulse contraction. A volley of calcium spikes was labeled as a contraction burst.

Percent of contractions that are single-pulse contractions was calculated as the fraction behavioral contractions that were single-calcium spikes (not bursts).

We calculated the average calcium fluorescence traces from small ROIs for individual neurons and large ROI for the peduncle region. Each of the fluorescence traces were corrected by calculating ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub>is the mean fluorescence intensity of the trace.</p><p>We performed the correlation analysis (MATLAB) of the calcium fluorescence time series for the individual neuron ROIs and peduncle ROI to identify groups of neurons with correlated activity. We calculated the correlation coefficients for the individual neurons and the peduncle ROI by correlating the entire 30 min calcium fluorescence trace for each of the neurons. These correlation coefficients were shown to be statistically significant then randomly reshuffled calcium fluorescence. We divided each of the neuronal calcium time series into 30 blocks. These individual blocks were randomly recombined to generate reshuffled time series for each of the neurons to calculate correlation coefficients. This random reshuffling of each neuron was repeated 1000 times to obtain the mean correlation coefficients for each of the neuron pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3d–f</xref>). We then calculated the z-score (x-μ)/σ, where x is the correlation coefficients of the original raw time series, μ is the mean correlation coefficients of the time series randomly reshuffled 1000 times, and σ is the standard deviation of the correlation coefficients of the time series randomly reshuffled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3g–i</xref>). To identify the neuronal clusters, we used a hierarchical clustering algorithm (MATLAB function ‘linkage’ with Euclidean distance of correlation coefficients) on the correlation coefficients. We then used leaf order from the linkage tree to sort the neurons and generate the correlation heat map.</p><p>We calculated the average fluorescence traces from the time-aligned calcium fluorescence to either spontaneous contractions or stimulus events to identify the roles of these neurons. For spontaneous contractions, the calcium fluorescence (t = 0–20 min) was time-aligned to the onset of contraction bursts or pulses from the peduncle ROI. For stimulated contractions, the calcium fluorescence (t = 20–30 min) was time-aligned to the onset of stimulus recorded with a DAQ (see ‘Whole-animal imaging of neural activity at different stimulus intensities’). We further confirmed the different neuronal clusters identified by performing correlation analysis on all neurons from all three <italic>Hydra</italic> by calculating the correlation coefficients for the average fluorescence traces from the time-aligned calcium fluorescence to stimulus events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>, g).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr. Rob Steele (UC Irvine), Dr. Christophe Dupre (Harvard University), and Dr. Rafael Yuste (Columbia University) for sharing transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic>.

Some of the foundational neuroscience papers in this field have only come out in the past few years, and new studies such as the one here, have the potential to contribute to an important early literature. Despite clear reasons for enthusiasm, there are a few issues in this work that require attention prior to publication. Although I appreciate building the microfluidic device with simultaneous pan-neuronal imaging, the nature of the new biological insights provided here are somewhat limited. The preliminary nature of some experiments also make it challenging to judge the potential implications of the work.</p><p>1. The pressurized stimulation of the hydra appeared to be specific to the center of the body. The authors don't mention why this region was chosen, which seems critical to this study. Relatedly, it appears important to test multiple areas across the hydra with this system. Might we expect to see different sensorimotor behaviors, and thus different neural outputs?</p><p>2. The authors reference a recent single cell study characterizing multiple neuronal cell types in hydra. This work would greatly benefit by using some cell-type resolution studies to determine the functional nature of the neurons being activated as opposed to solely using pan-neuronal GCAMP imaging. It appears that since they can put GCAMP in all neurons, they may be able to also introduce GCaMP into specific subsets of neurons based on cellular identity. This point becomes more salient because a major take-home from this paper is that the spontaneous behavior and firing patterns is nearly identical to the stimulus evoked patterns, except for an apparent increase in firing rate. The true nature of the mechanosensory response might be revealed with cell-type specific experiments.</p><p>3. Although the authors reference whole animal imaging, they focus imaging analysis on peduncle and hypostomal nerve rings, despite the videos showing calcium activity in other areas throughout the body. Moreover, are the authors certain their pan-neuronal genetic strategy equally samples neurons throughout the body? In other words, is it possible that the apparent increase in activity in the nerve ring over other areas is being driven by a technical artifact of these neurons being labeled better?</p><p>4. While I appreciate the resection studies to get at &quot;loss-of-function&quot; experiments, this is a somewhat blunt hammer approach, and potentially confounds clear interpretation. It is important to establish which neurons are killed and to what extent, and how many, if any began to regenerate throughout this process. The concern is that residual activity from neurons not ablated may be driving this response, especially in light of the authors surprising finding that &quot;footless&quot; animals show that the aboral nerve ring is not required for spontaneous or mechanosensory responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The Hydra, in the phylum cnidaria, is a near microscopic freshwater animal that has recently resurfaced as an attractive model organism in neuroscience due to its optically accessible transparent body, sparsely distributed neural network, and simple behaviors. In this manuscript, Badhiwala and colleagues use calcium imaging of the Hydra neural network, combined with surgical resection and microfluidics pressure stimulation to identify body regions indispensable for mechanosensory activity. They report that while resection of the aboral region did not abolish the mechanical response, resection of the oral region attenuated this response, while combined resection of oral and aboral regions showed the greatest effect. They also find a correlation between reduced stimulated activity and spontaneous activity, suggesting a common mechanism that gives rise to both activities. While this study takes on an innovative approach by using a microfluidics device to mechanically stimulate the hydra under optical recording there are a number of conceptual and technical limitations. Perhaps my biggest concern is that despite the potential, the data are rather low resolution (body transections and bulk calcium responses) and as such the conclusions supported by the provided data do not significantly extend our current knowledge.</p><p>1. The authors have designed a microfluidic device that allows them to simultaneously mechanically stimulate, monitor movement and functionally image a hydra. The highly quantifiable nature of the microfluidic device a great asset, although this potential is not deeply explored. While I can see how the microfluidic stimulation could offer benefits over fluid jet or blunt probe, more in-depth characterization is needed.</p><p>2. What is the spatial distribution of the pressure pulse stimulus on the Hydra body? How far does the mechanical force spread from the region directly touching the pressure valve?</p><p>3. The use of the microfluidic device was limited. Have the authors attempted to map mechanical sensitivity across the Hydra body by stimulating different sites?</p><p>4. The authors spatially average a population response from a large region of interest as compared to recording calcium responses from single neurons. This should be specifically stated in the Results section. More importantly, to provide insight into network function much smaller ROIs over multiple sites are needed instead of the bulk activity of the entire peduncle. This analysis would allow the authors to significantly extend the findings from this work, as the lure of the optically clear and small hydra is that neural representation and coding can be tracked over large portions of the network at cellular resolution.</p><p>5. It is unclear where the recorded signals are coming from and if movement is creating artifacts. Have authors corrected for movement? The supplemental movies show a stationary region of interest and moving animal, in some cases parts of animal moving in and out. Furthermore, please explain how the background is subtracted. There is a large fluorescent signal coming from of the entire body/ middle columnar part of the body and spontaneous firing that makes interpretation of the data difficult.</p><p>6. Contraction is a behavioral response of the animal; however, the authors use 'contraction' do describe calcium imaging responses throughout the figures and text. This should be avoided.</p><p>7. The authors may wish to rephrase the wording of the paper title. I do not think this work establishes definitively that &quot;multiple nerve rings&quot; are important for coordinating mechanosensory behavior.</p><p>8. Furthermore, the claim that the observed &quot;linear relationship&quot; between the spontaneous contraction probability and resection type is evidence for shared neural pathways is not strongly supported by the provided data. These data are fairly coarse resolution and include only 3 animals in each group with highly variable responses (Figure 4C). Additionally, they do not provide evidence to distinguish the motor circuits they hypothesized these neural nets converge upon.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors probe mechanosensory processing in Hydra by measuring calcium activity in neurons and muscles in response to precise mechanosensory stimulation in whole and resected animals. The authors' claims are well supported by the evidence. The development of a mechanosensory delivery system for Hydra is also a significant methodological advancement. Taken together, the work advances our understanding of the Hydra nervous system and is a needed step towards developing Hydra as a powerful model for systems neuroscience.</p><p>1) One issue is that different measures of &quot;mechanosensory response&quot; are used at different places in the manuscript. In some contexts, a response is defined as calcium activity in neurons (Figure 2), and elsewhere as calcium activity in muscles (Figure 3 and 4). And in Figure 2 SuppFig2 muscle contractions are also measured using MeKs. The relation between neural activity, muscle activity and body movement is, of course, of high interest, and the paper explores this. But, if technically possible, it would be helpful to report a single metric of behavior that could be used in all experiments. For example, it might be possible to use video of the animal's pose or body length to measure contractions in all experiments. At a minimum the reasoning behind choice of measurement of response for each experiment could be discussed explicitly.</p><p>2) Related: Without a consistent measure of behavior, it will be important to further clarify figures so that a reader can tell at-a-glance how contraction probability is being measured.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64108.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Experiment E1 (Reviewer 1,2,3): Mapping mechanical sensitivity/response across the <italic>Hydra</italic> body.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion to map mechanical sensitivity across the <italic>Hydra</italic> body. We performed new experiments to test <italic>Hydra</italic>’s response to stimulation along the body. Unlike in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> where the location of stimulation leads to different behavioral responses, we find the same aversive contractile response regardless of where along the body <italic>Hydra</italic> is stimulated. However, we did observe differences in response probability (sensitivity) depending on where the animal was stimulated. Specifically, we found the aboral region of <italic>Hydra</italic> to be less sensitive to mechanical stimulation than the center of the body.</p><p>We describe the new experiment with this new text in the methods:</p><p>“Whole-animal imaging of neural activity with different stimulation regions</p><p>To map the sensitivity of different body parts to mechanical stimuli, we performed calcium imaging of multiple animals (N = 3, whole animals expressing GCaMP6s in neurons) using imaging settings previously described with modified experimental protocol. Based on the range animal sizes (1-2.5 mm) and the size of the valve (400 um), we stimulated Hydra body at three different regions along the oral-aboral axis: (1) the oral end (upper third of the body), (2) the aboral end (lower third of the body), and (3) the third near the mid-body column. Each animal was stimulated at three different locations (20 min no stimulation, stimulation region #1 – 1 sec every 31 sec for 20 min, ~2 min no stimulation, stimulation region #2 – 1 sec every 31 sec for 20 min, ~2 min no stimulation, stimulation region #3 – 1 sec every 31 sec for 20 min using 22 psi). We randomized the order in which the three different body regions were stimulated in each of the three animals to avoid any stimulus entrainment artifacts. We then analyzed the peduncle nerve ring activity in response to mechanical stimulation of different body regions as details in “Analysis of calcium activity” and “Analysis of mechanosensory response”.”</p><p>We have added this new section to the results:</p><p>“Hydra sensitivity to mechanical stimuli is lowest near the aboral end</p><p>Because of the diffuse neural architecture of Hydra, we expected each patch of Hydra tissue to be equally responsive to mechanical stimuli. […] The only difference we observed was the fact that the response probability depended on where along the oral and aboral axis we delivered the mechanical stimulus.”</p><p>2. Experiment E2 (Reviewer 1, 2): Single cell resolution of neuronal activity.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this work would greatly benefit from some single cell-type resolution study. In theory, we should be able to take advantage of the optical transparency of the animal to track individual neurons or drive the expression of GCaMP in specific subsets of neurons based on the cell-type specific biomarkers. However, we currently do not have these transgenic lines and generating these transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> lines would take more than a year.</p><p>While we are unable to automatically track individual neurons due to the lack of nuclear fluorescent reporter (i.e., ratiometric imaging with RFP), we were able to manually track several neurons that were visible for the entirety of the experiment (30 minutes) in three different <italic>Hydra</italic>.</p><p>By analyzing these data, we have made two new findings that we found surprising:</p><p>1. There are a group of neurons whose pattern of activity is qualitatively different from neurons that belong to contraction burst or rhythmic potential networks. We refer to these neurons as ‘mechanically responsive’ (MR) neurons because these neurons showed a clear response following mechanical stimulus but not spontaneous contractions. The CB network showed very similar activity for both stimulated and spontaneous contractions. Together, these data show a unique neural program for simulated vs spontaneous contractions.</p><p>2. The MR neurons showed a significantly delayed response to mechanical stimulation responding approximately 10 seconds after a stimulus evoked contraction. These data suggest that these MR neurons (found primarily in the oral network) may have a separate activation pathway that parallels the activation of the CB neurons and plays a unique role in stimulated contractions compared to spontaneous contractions. This is the first evidence of parallel sensory processing in <italic>Hydra</italic> and was not expected from our initial data.</p><p>We have included these new results and a discussion of how they advance our knowledge on pgs. 15-17. We thank the reviewers for suggesting we take this closer look – we were surprised by what we found!</p><p>We describe the new experiment with this new text in methods:</p><p>“Whole animal imaging with single neuron resolution</p><p>We performed fluorescence imaging in transgenic Hydra (N = 3) expressing GCaMP6s in neurons for ~30 min (30 min of imaging: 20 min of no stimulation, 10 min of stimulation every 31 sec). We captured frames at ~16Hz (50 msec exposures) with a 10x objective (0.45 N.A.) and Andor Zyla 4.2 sCMOS camera with 3x3 binning (682x682 frame size) using MicroManager. […] We calculated the average fluorescence traces from the time-aligned calcium fluorescence to either spontaneous contractions or stimulus events to identify the roles of these neurons. For spontaneous contractions, the calcium fluorescence (t = 0-20 min) was time-aligned to the onset of contraction bursts or pulses from the peduncle ROI. For stimulated contractions, the calcium fluorescence (t = 20-30 min) was time-aligned to the onset of stimulus recorded with a DAQ (see “Whole-animal imaging of neural activity at different stimulus intensities”). We further confirmed the different neuronal clusters identified by performing correlation analysis on all neurons from all three Hydra by calculating the correlation coefficients for the average fluorescence traces from the time-aligned calcium fluorescence to stimulus events (Figure 4f.g).”</p><p>We have added this new Results section to the main text: “Oral and aboral networks show different patterns of activity during spontaneous contractions compared to mechanically stimulated contractions”</p><p>And we have added three new supplementary figures (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1-3) to present results from biological replicates for single cell resolution of neuronal activity and show statistical significance of our correlation analysis.</p><p>3. Experiment E3 (Reviewer 1 and 2): cell-type resolution studies to determine the functional nature of the neurons.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that this work would greatly benefit from some single cell-type manipulation study and in theory, we should be able to genetically modify specific subsets of neurons based on the cell-type specific biomarkers to inhibit or excite specific neurons to study their function. However, we currently do not have these transgenic lines and generating these transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> lines may take more than a year since we may have to test several promoters.</p><p>While we cannot at this time perform cell-type specific optogenetic experiments, we can take advantage of the spatial distribution of neuronal subtypes along the oral-aboral axis in <italic>Hydra</italic>. By resecting specific body regions, we can remove specific neuronal subtypes. We have now added an experiment to the manuscript to demonstrate that we were successful in removing specific neuron subtypes. We performed quantitative PCR to measure the expression levels of subtype specific neuronal marker genes in differently resected animals. We found evidence of a complete loss of the predicted specific neuronal subtypes 12 hours after the resections were performed. These findings support body resections as an alternative technique for cell-type specific functional studies (like optogenetics) and confirm previous findings that neurons are not regenerated within 12 hours of their removal.</p><p>We describe this new experiment with new text in methods:</p><p>“Neuron subtype gene expression analysis with RT-qPCR</p><p>Resected Hydra were prepared as described above, with 12 polyps per biological replicate (except 6 whole polyps for control) and a total of two biological replicates per treatment.

All qPCR primers (Table 1) were validated via a 10-fold serial dilution standard curve to have a binding efficiency over 90%.”</p><p>We have added the following new text to reflect the new findings in the main text:</p><p>“We confirmed that 6-12 hours after resection the animals indeed showed loss of specific neuronal cell types by measuring the expression levels of subtype-specific neuronal markers via qPCR (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2).”</p><p>“We identified at least two neuronal networks (MR and CB network) with distinct neuronal activities mediating the stimulated responses (Figure 4), where the CB network of neurons show fast calcium responses, and the MR neurons show slower calcium response.

By comparing the GFP intensity with GCaMP intensity from various regions of interest, we confirmed the increase in fluorescence intensity in the way we analyzed our calcium imaging (using large ROIs) was not due to motion artifacts.</p><p>We describe the new experiment with new text in the methods:</p><p>“Fluorescence intensity from GFP Hydra</p><p>To prove the fluorescence intensity changes we observed with calcium imaging are due to calcium activity and not motion artifacts from body contractions, we compared the average fluorescence intensities from three different transgenic Hydra lines: (1) expressing GFP pan-neuronally (nGreen line), (2) expressing GCaMP6s pan-neuronally and 3) expressing GCaMP7b in endodermal epitheliomuscular cells (Figure 2 —figure supplement (3). […] The average fluorescence intensity and body length traces were time-aligned to the onset of mechanical stimulation to show (1) changes in average fluorescence intensity in peduncle ROI and the whole frame ROI are due to calcium activity (increase in fluorescence from in GCaMP lines) and not motion artifact (no change in fluorescence from GFP line) and (2) increase or decrease in body length or average fluorescence from valve ROI are affected by stimulation artifacts.”</p><p>We have added new text to the main text:</p><p>“We further confirmed that this signal is not the result of motion artifacts by measuring fluorescence from Hydra (nGreen) that express GFP pan-neuronally using a similar ROI.

When we compared these experiments to experiments in GCaMP animals, we found that the Ca++ activity cannot be explained by movement or labeling artifacts. These data are also consistent with previous experiments that imaged calcium activity in <italic>Hydra</italic> (Dupre et al., 2017 and Badhiwala et al., 2018):</p><p>[see Experiment E5 above for more details]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. While I appreciate the resection studies to get at &quot;loss-of-function&quot; experiments, this is a somewhat blunt hammer approach, and potentially confounds clear interpretation. It is important to establish which neurons are killed and to what extent, and how many, if any began to regenerate throughout this process. The concern is that residual activity from neurons not ablated may be driving this response, especially in light of the authors surprising finding that &quot;footless&quot; animals show that the aboral nerve ring is not required for spontaneous or mechanosensory responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to establish which neurons and to what extent they are removed with our resections. To address this point, we performed qPCR on different resectioned <italic>Hydra</italic> (Experiment E3, see above) to identify which neuron subtypes are removed and to quantify to what extent, and how many, might regenerate. Based on the time to experiment post-resections, we expect little neuronal regenerative activity to have occurred and we confirmed this by measuring expression of neuron subtype biomarkers at 12 hours post-resections (our experiments were performed between 6-12 hours post resection).</p><p>Our findings from the expression analysis indicate complete removal of specific subtypes with our resections. For example, in “footless” animals, we find complete loss of ec5 subtypes even at 12 hours post-resections. In “headless” animals, we find near complete loss of ec2, ec1B, ec3C and ec4 subtypes. In “body column’ resections, we find the near complete loss of neuron subtypes removed in “footless” and “headless” resections.</p><p>[see Experiment E3 above for more details]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The Hydra, in the phylum cnidaria, is a near microscopic freshwater animal that has recently resurfaced as an attractive model organism in neuroscience due to its optically accessible transparent body, sparsely distributed neural network, and simple behaviors. In this manuscript, Badhiwala and colleagues use calcium imaging of the Hydra neural network, combined with surgical resection and microfluidics pressure stimulation to identify body regions indispensable for mechanosensory activity. They report that while resection of the aboral region did not abolish the mechanical response, resection of the oral region attenuated this response, while combined resection of oral and aboral regions showed the greatest effect. They also find a correlation between reduced stimulated activity and spontaneous activity, suggesting a common mechanism that gives rise to both activities. While this study takes on an innovative approach by using a microfluidics device to mechanically stimulate the hydra under optical recording there are a number of conceptual and technical limitations. Perhaps my biggest concern is that despite the potential, the data are rather low resolution (body transections and bulk calcium responses) and as such the conclusions supported by the provided data do not significantly extend our current knowledge.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing our innovative methodology to work around technical hurdles. We thought carefully about how to make additional use of our data and thank the reviewer for suggesting individual cell analysis. While it is not feasible to track every cell because they lack a nuclear RFP to automate tracking, we were able to manually track several neurons in the oral and aboral ends. By analyzing these data, we have made two new findings that we found surprising:</p><p>1. There are a group of neurons whose pattern of activity is qualitatively different from neurons that belong to contraction burst or rhythmic potential networks. We refer to these neurons as ‘mechanically responsive’ (MR) neurons because these neurons showed a clear response following mechanical stimulus but not spontaneous contractions. The CB network showed very similar activity for both stimulated and spontaneous contractions. Together, these data show a unique neural program for simulated vs spontaneous contractions.</p><p>2. The MR neurons showed a significantly delayed response to mechanical stimulation responding approximately 10 seconds after a stimulus evoked contraction. These data suggest that these MR neurons (found primarily in the oral network) may have a separate activation pathway that parallels the activation of the CB neurons and plays a unique role in stimulated contractions compared to spontaneous contractions. This is the first evidence of parallel sensory processing in <italic>Hydra</italic> and was not expected from our initial data.</p><p>We have included these new results and a discussion of how they advance our knowledge on pgs. 15-17. We thank the reviewers for suggesting we take this closer look – we were surprised by what we found!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors have designed a microfluidic device that allows them to simultaneously mechanically stimulate, monitor movement and functionally image a hydra. The highly quantifiable nature of the microfluidic device a great asset, although this potential is not deeply explored. While I can see how the microfluidic stimulation could offer benefits over fluid jet or blunt probe, more in-depth characterization is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have performed new experiments and analysis (Analysis A1, see above) to further characterize this mechanical stimulation technique as described in the response to point 2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What is the spatial distribution of the pressure pulse stimulus on the Hydra body? How far does the mechanical force spread from the region directly touching the pressure valve?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional experiments and analysis (Analysis A1, see above) to map the distribution of mechanical forces from the microfluidic valves. We found the majority of the force is localized to cells and tissue bordering the valve (~ 250 μm around the valve).</p><p>The microfluidic valves are 400um in diameter and thus pressure is directly applied in that region. However, the perceived stimulus is likely a combination of stress and strain. As the tissue directly under the valve is compressed, the gelatinous <italic>Hydra</italic> tissue along the bordering the value is pushed/stretched away from the valve center. This indirect force applied on surrounding tissue from elastic deformation of ~400 μm diameter patch of tissue may be non-trivial to quantify. We used displacement of individual neurons throughout the body to indirectly quantify the effects of the mechanical stimulation.</p><p>[see Analysis A1 above for more details.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The use of the microfluidic device was limited. Have the authors attempted to map mechanical sensitivity across the Hydra body by stimulating different sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to test multiple areas across the <italic>Hydra</italic> body to characterize mechanical sensitivity and thank the reviewer for the suggested experiment. We found the aboral region of the <italic>Hydra</italic> is less sensitive to mechanical stimulation than the center of the body (Experiment E1, see above).</p><p>[see Experiment E1 above for more details]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors spatially average a population response from a large region of interest as compared to recording calcium responses from single neurons. This should be specifically stated in the Results section. More importantly, to provide insight into network function much smaller ROIs over multiple sites are needed instead of the bulk activity of the entire peduncle. This analysis would allow the authors to significantly extend the findings from this work, as the lure of the optically clear and small hydra is that neural representation and coding can be tracked over large portions of the network at cellular resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that to provide insights into the network function we need small ROIs/ individual cell tracking. Although there are technical limitations to this for our organisms (highly deformable body makes it difficult to track individual neurons using calcium fluorescence), we manually tracked several neurons in the oral and aboral regions (Experiment E2, see above) and found at least two networks of neurons that differently coordinate the spontaneous and stimulated behaviors.</p><p>[See Experiment E2 above for more details]</p><p>We added this new text to the main text to explain the use of large region of interest:</p><p>“We also found that the calcium-sensitive fluorescence averaged over a region of interest (ROI) surrounding the peduncle faithfully represented the contraction pulses and bursts measured from individual neurons (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2).

It is unclear where the recorded signals are coming from and if movement is creating artifacts. Have authors corrected for movement? The supplemental movies show a stationary region of interest and moving animal, in some cases parts of animal moving in and out. Furthermore, please explain how the background is subtracted. There is a large fluorescent signal coming from of the entire body/ middle columnar part of the body and spontaneous firing that makes interpretation of the data difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>To further validate that the signal captured from our ROIs represent neuronal calcium activity and not motion artifacts, we compared measurements from pan-neuronal GCaMP expressing animals to pan-neuronal GFP expressing animals (Experiment E5, see above).</p><p>(see Experiment E5 above for more details)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Contraction is a behavioral response of the animal; however, the authors use 'contraction' do describe calcium imaging responses throughout the figures and text.

The authors may wish to rephrase the wording of the paper title.

Furthermore, the claim that the observed &quot;linear relationship&quot; between the spontaneous contraction probability and resection type is evidence for shared neural pathways is not strongly supported by the provided data.

Taken together, the work advances our understanding of the Hydra nervous system and is a needed step towards developing Hydra as a powerful model for systems neuroscience.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for recognizing the significance of our methodological advancement and the significance of our key findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) One issue is that different measures of &quot;mechanosensory response&quot; are used at different places in the manuscript. In some contexts, a response is defined as calcium activity in neurons (Figure 2), and elsewhere as calcium activity in muscles (Figure 3 and 4). And in Figure 2 SuppFig2 muscle contractions are also measured using MeKs. The relation between neural activity, muscle activity and body movement is of course of high interest, and the paper explores this. But, if technically possible, it would be helpful to report a single metric of behavior that could be used in all experiments. For example, it might be possible to use video of the animal's pose or body length to measure contractions in all experiments. At a minimum the reasoning behind choice of measurement of response for each experiment could be discussed explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>Body length proved to not be a reliable method for measuring the behavioral response in <italic>Hydra</italic> due to the technical limitations of working with calcium fluorescence images (Analysis A3, see above).</p><p>[see Analysis A3 above for more details]</p><p>As alternatively suggested, we discuss the reasoning behind our choice of measurement of response on pg. 7 (line 160-167).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related: Without a consistent measure of behavior, it will be important to further clarify figures so that a reader can tell at-a-glance how contraction probability is being measured.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the legends of each figure (Figure 2-4; Figure 2 —figure supplement 5-7 and 9; Figure 3 —figure supplement 3 and 4) to indicate the measure of response.</p></body></sub-article></article>
