facilitates processing of dead cell-derived antigens for cross-presentation and the induction of effective CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses. Here, we show that this process is regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 and define a new ubiquitin-mediated mechanism for regulation of Clec9A, reflecting the unique properties of Clec9A as a receptor specialized for delivery of antigens for cross-presentation. We reveal RNF41 is a negative regulator of Clec9A and the cross-presentation of dead cell-derived antigens by mouse dendritic cells. Intriguingly, RNF41 regulates the downstream fate of Clec9A by directly binding and ubiquitinating the extracellular domains of Clec9A. At steady-state, RNF41 ubiquitination of Clec9A facilitates interactions with ER-associated proteins and degradation machinery to control Clec9A levels. However, Clec9A interactions are altered following dead cell uptake to favor antigen presentation. These findings provide important insights into antigen cross-presentation and have implications for development of approaches to modulate immune responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>DAMP recognition</kwd><kwd>E3 ubiquitin ligase</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Czabotar</surname><given-names>Peter E</given-names></name><name><surname>Wakim</surname><given-names>Linda M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mintern</surname><given-names>Justine D</given-names></name><name><surname>Radford</surname><given-names>Kristen</given-names></name><name><surname>Caminschi</surname><given-names>Irina</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Keeffe</surname><given-names>Meredith</given-names></name><name><surname>Villadangos</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Blewitt</surname><given-names>Marnie E</given-names></name><name><surname>Heath</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name><name><surname>Shortman</surname><given-names>Ken</given-names></name><name><surname>Purcell</surname><given-names>Anthony W</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicola</surname><given-names>Nicos A</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jian-Guo</given-names></name><name><surname>Lahoud</surname><given-names>Mireille H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000951</institution-id><institution>Cancer Council Victoria</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tullett</surname><given-names>Kirsteen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dendritic cell recognition and processing of antigens from dead cells, utilising the Clec9A-damage recognition receptor, is controlled by a novel RNF41-ubiquitin-mediated regulatory pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are endogenous molecules that are normally sequestered in healthy cells, but are released or exposed upon injury or infection and thereby signal ‘danger’ to the immune system. DAMPs include a wide variety of molecules including nucleic acids, heat shock proteins, HMGB1, ATP, and mediators produced during death receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vénéreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yatim et al., 2015</xref>). The recognition of DAMPs by pattern recognition receptors on dendritic cells (DC) shapes immune responses by influencing their capacity to take up, process and present antigen (Ag) to T cells for induction of immunity or tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alloatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Individual DC subsets have unique expression patterns of receptors that enable them to identify particular DAMPs. The CD8α<sup>+</sup> DC lineage in mice and the equivalent CD141<sup>+</sup> DC lineage in humans, now both termed cDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guilliams et al., 2014</xref>), are particularly adept at cross-presentation: the uptake and processing of antigenic material from dead cells for presentation on MHC class I molecules, a process critical for immunity to intracellular pathogens and cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Radford et al., 2014</xref>). The C-type lectin-like receptor Clec9A (also known as DNGR1) is critical for recognition and processing of dead cells, and is a key defining marker of the cDC1 subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caminschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huysamen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sancho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Clec9A recognizes dead cells once their cell membrane is disrupted, exposing internal cellular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sancho et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). The Clec9A ligand exposed upon cell death is the filamentous form of actin (F-actin), which is normally associated with actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and potentially with Ag from within the dead cell. Although Clec9A engagement can facilitate signaling via the tyrosine kinase Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zelenay et al., 2012</xref>), Clec9A engagement by dead cell ligands does not appear to directly activate the DC; rather, its role appears to be in regulating the trafficking and processing of the dead cell-derived material once it enters the DC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zelenay et al., 2012</xref>). Clec9A directs material to early and recycling endosomes, favoring Ag processing and presentation, rather than to phagolysosomes for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zelenay et al., 2012</xref>). cDC1 from Clec9A knockout mice have a reduced capacity for cross-presentation of dead cell-derived Ag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sancho et al., 2009</xref>) and are more susceptible to viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zelenay et al., 2012</xref>). Clec9A therefore appears to direct Ag to the MHC class I presentation pathway to initiate anti-viral CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune responses.</p><p>Consistent with the role of Clec9A in enhancing immunity, delivering Ag to cDC1 using monoclonal antibodies against Clec9A, has proved very effective in enhancing immune responses and improving vaccine efficacies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caminschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lahoud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tullett et al., 2016</xref>). Targeting Clec9A not only enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses and cytotoxic T cell generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caminschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sancho et al., 2008</xref>), but surprisingly also promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, as supported by the role of cDC1 in promoting both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferris et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, targeting Clec9A primes follicular helper T cells and induces potent humoral responses even in the absence of adjuvants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caminschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lahoud et al., 2011</xref>). The capacity of Clec9A to promote both MHC class I and MHC class II presentation prompted a closer examination of the mechanisms underpinning Clec9A handling of Ag, and a search for intracellular interacting proteins that may play a role in the regulation of Clec9A function.</p><p>In this study, we identified a novel interaction between Clec9A and the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 (also known as Nrdp1/FLRF). RNF41, a member of the RING family widely expressed in immune cells, directly binds and ubiquitinates target proteins, targeting them for downstream fates such as proteasomal degradation (e.g. ErbB3, MyD88, USP8) or to regulate protein trafficking (VPS52) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouyain and Leahy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Ceuninck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masschaele et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). RNF41 also modulates immune responses through Toll-like receptor pathways by ubiquitinating MyD88 and the kinase TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, RNF41 regulates the sorting of endosomal proteins by ubiquitinating Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 8 (USP8), which in turn regulates the stability of the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT)−0 protein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Ceuninck et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, we investigated the molecular basis and the intracellular consequences of the Clec9A-RNF41 interaction. Here we report that RNF41 regulates Clec9A via a novel mechanism. E3 ubiquitin ligases usually regulate the quantity and quality of cell surface receptors via an interaction with the cytosolic, transmembrane or membrane proximal regions of the target receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamonti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, we show that RNF41 interacts with and ubiquitinates the extracellular domains of Clec9A within the cell, to regulate Clec9A expression and function. We demonstrate that RNF41 colocalizes with the extracellular domain of Clec9A within cross-presenting DC, and acts as a negative regulator of Clec9A and hence cross-presentation by cDC1. Our results highlight a novel pathway for the regulation of Clec9A receptor fate, revealing further novel Clec9A interactions and providing insights into the mechanisms underpinning DAMP recognition and Ag cross-presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clec9A binds directly and specifically to RNF41</title><p>To identify novel conserved Clec9A interactions, we generated ectodomains of mouse and human Clec9A (mClec9A, hCLEC9A), which encompassed their full extracellular regions (ecto) including the C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) and stalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).

As expected, most Clec9A-interacting proteins were identified at comparable levels in the presence or absence of RNF41.

Comparison of Clec9A-interacting proteins in the presence of RNF41 versus RNF41-Δ RING indicated that most of these Clec9A-interactions, including Erlin2 and Calreticulin, may be enhanced by ubiquitination mediated by the RING domain, rather than RNF41 binding per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We demonstrated Clec9A interaction with Erlin2, by PLA, in steady-state cDC1, validating the biological relevance of this interaction in DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Following dead cell uptake, we observed a decrease in total levels of Clec9A-Erlin2 interaction, which were not rescued by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Furthermore, most Clec9A-Erlin2 PLA signals did not appear associated with dead cell material taken up by the DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, our data indicates that in steady-state DC, Clec9A and Erlin2 interact, potentially within the ER. However, following dead cell uptake, Clec9A-Erlin2 interactions are reduced, which likely reflects altered Clec9A trafficking events and reduced RNF41-mediated regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of RNF41 as a negative regulator of Clec9A and cross-presentation.</title><p>We propose that at steady state, Clec9A interacts with RNF41, Erlin1/2 and Calreticulin.

At later stages following dead cell uptake, RNF41 interacts with Clec9A at endosomes to regulate Clec9A following presentation of dead cell Ag.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63452-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We next investigated Clec9A-interactions with the ER chaperones Calreticulin and Calnexin as they play a role in MHC-I processing and cross-presentation.

As both Calreticulin and Calnexin can be recruited to Ag-containing endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croce et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guermonprez et al., 2003</xref>), we examined Clec9A-Calreticulin and Clec9A-Calnexin interactions following dead cell uptake. We observed an increase in Clec9A-Calreticulin interactions by PLA following dead cell uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Furthermore, the Clec9A-Calreticulin PLA signals appeared to be associated with dead cell material taken up by the DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). By contrast, Clec9A-Calnexin PLA signals did not associate with internalized dead cells within DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Together, this data suggests a role for both Calreticulin and Calnexin in chaperoning Clec9A in the ER, but suggests that it is primarily Calreticulin that chaperones Clec9A or its dead cell cargo to endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Altogether our studies have revealed that RNF41 is a novel regulator of Clec9A and thereby processing and presentation of dead cell-associated Ag.

We revealed that RNF41 regulates Clec9A levels, and thereby DAMP recognition and Ag-processing for presentation. We demonstrated that RNF41 directly binds to extracellular domains of Clec9A, and mediates Clec9A ubiquitination at membrane-associated cellular compartments, such as the ER and endosomal vesicles. This process is dependent on the RING domain function, and results in ubiquitination of several lysine residues in the stalk and CTLD domains of Clec9A; notably, the cytoplasmic regions of Clec9A are not ubiquitinated. Ubiquitination can then target Clec9A for degradation. This is consistent with the role of RNF41 in regulating the steady-state levels of other receptors, including ErbB3, IL3R and EPOR, in a ligand-independent manner, by direct binding, ubiquitination and targeting of these receptors for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jing et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu and Goldberg, 2002</xref>). However, this is the first description, to our knowledge, that the extracellular domain of a membrane receptor can interact with an E3 ubiquitin ligase within the cell, and be modified by ubiquitination for the regulation of receptor levels. This likely reflects the unique properties of Clec9A as a receptor specialized for the delivery of dead cell Ag to the endosomal compartments for cross-presentation.</p><p>We propose that at steady state, RNF41 acts to regulate Clec9A levels thereby limiting the Clec9A receptors available for dead cell Ag processing and presentation. We and others have found RNF41 to be associated with the ER and endosomes, as well as the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamonti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masschaele et al., 2017</xref>). We demonstrated that Clec9A and RNF41 interact within steady- state DC, and that ubiquitinated Clec9A is present in membrane-associated cellular fractions that include the ER and recycling endosomes.</p><p>We propose that RNF41 can regulate Clec9A at two intracellular locations, at the ER and at endosomes. Our data indicates that RNF41 can interact with, and degrade newly synthesized Clec9A molecules at the ER as a means of controlling the abundance of Clec9A receptors. The increased association of Clec9A with ER molecules Erlin1/2 (SPFH1/2) in the presence of RNF41 supports this model. The ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD) pathway plays an important role in maintaining abundance of membrane receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Printsev et al., 2017</xref>), and both RNF41 and Erlin1/2 have been implicated in this process: RNF41 can interact with newly synthesized ErbB3 and target it for degradation via ERAD as a means of controlling ErbB3 receptor levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry et al., 2011</xref>); Erlin1/2 can recruit RNF170 to activated IP<sub>3</sub> receptors facilitating receptor ubiquitination and degradation via ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2011</xref>). Erlin1/2 have also been implicated in viral egress from the ER to cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inoue and Tsai, 2017</xref>). However, the topology of this interaction at the ER remains to be determined. While Clec9A and the Erlin1/2 extracellular domains are localized within the lumen of the ER, and RNF41 is associated with the ER membrane, further studies are required to determine whether RNF41 localises and interacts with Clec9A at the luminal or the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. We propose that the Clec9A-RNF41-Erlin interaction may facilitate translocation of Clec9A ectodomains or RNF41 across the ER membranes, thereby regulating access to ubiquitination and ERAD machinery. Further studies will be required to determine the molecular mechanisms that underpin these processes and the contribution of this pathway to the regulation of Clec9A fate.</p><p>Our data indicates that RNF41 also interacts with Clec9A at endosomes, and that this interaction is potentiated at lower pH as typically observed in late endosomes and lysosomes, rather than early endosomes. However, further experimental studies are required to identify the specific endosomal compartments at which the Clec9A-RNF41 interaction occurs. We demonstrated that Clec9A interactions with RNF41 and Erlin2, and Clec9A ubiquitination, were decreased at early stages following DC uptake of dead cells. This suggests that Clec9A interaction with dead cells may transiently divert Clec9A and its cargo away from RNF41-mediated degradation, to prolong Clec9A and cargo survival and thereby potentiate Ag presentation. How Clec9A on cDC1 delivers dead cell Ag for cross-presentation to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells remains topical. Two major pathways have been proposed for cross-presentation: (i) a vacuolar pathway where Ag are processed by lysosomal proteases in the endosomes and loaded onto MHCI, and (ii) a cytosolic pathway, in which Ag are translocated to the cytosol for processing then back to the ER/endosomes for MHCI loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gros and Amigorena, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grotzke and Cresswell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grotzke et al., 2017b</xref>). cDC1 cross-presentation of cell-associated Ag has been shown to occur through a Transporter-associated with Ag Processing (TAP)−1 dependent pathway for peptide translocation, implicating the cytosolic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Theisen et al., 2018</xref>), although the relative contributions of the different proposed pathways for cross-presentation of dead cell Ag remains topical. Some ER proteins, and particular components of ERAD machinery, have also been implicated in cross-presentation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gros and Amigorena, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grotzke and Cresswell, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grotzke et al., 2017b</xref>). ER chaperones Calreticulin, Calnexin and translocon component Sec61 have been shown to be recruited to Ag-containing endosomes in bone marrow-derived DC for cross-presentation, although the direct contribution of Sec61 to cross-presentation has been challenging to assess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croce et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grotzke et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guermonprez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zehner et al., 2015</xref>). The increased Clec9A-Calreticulin interaction following dead cell uptake, and the Clec9A-Calreticulin interaction with internalized dead cells supports a role for Calreticulin in chaperoning Clec9A or its cargo to facilitate cross-presentation; whether this requires translocation of Clec9A-Ag complexes across endosomal membranes for cytosolic processing or whether it occurs within the endosomes remains to be determined. However, the recent identification of active ubiquitination and proteasomes in endocytic compartments of DC and their contribution to Ag cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>) provides an attractive model by which Clec9A and its dead cell cargo may access RNF41, ubiquitination and Ag-processing pathways within endosomes, potentially bypassing the need for translocation mediators. Determining the mechanism that enables RNF41 interaction with Clec9A at the endosomes, and the role of translocation mediators, remains an important issue for future studies.</p><p>The nature of the ubiquitin linkages on Clec9A could provide some clues to the control of Clec9A fate. RNF41-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination has been associated with proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fry et al., 2011</xref>), and K63-linked ubiquitination with non-proteasomal functions such as trafficking and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). Our proteomic analysis of RNF41-mediated Clec9A ubiquitination identified usage of K11-, K48- and K63- linked ubiquitin. The identification of all three linkages may point to several processes occurring to Clec9A receptors at different subcellular locations such as ER versus endosomes, or may reflect heterotypic or branched ubiquitination. The role of such chains is still poorly understood, but it is clear that they act as a unique coding signal affecting recognition by reader proteins and altering the fate of the ubiquitinated target; heterotypic K11/K48-linked ubiquitination can promote rapid proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yau et al., 2017</xref>) whereas K48/K63 branched ubiquitin chains can amplify NF-kB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ohtake et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The anti-Clec9A mAb that we previously generated (24/04-10B4) is particularly good at delivering Ag to cDC1 for cross-presentation. Given that it can limit access of RNF41 to Clec9A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), our data offer an explanation for its superior effects for vaccine delivery. We postulate that 24/04-10B4 retards the ubiquitination and degradation of Clec9A, thus enhancing cross-presentation of its cargo, similar to dead cells. With this in mind, an even more effective cross-priming Ag delivery vehicle may be designed, one that potentially completely prevents RNF41 binding to Clec9A.</p><p>While the major known pathways for ubiquitination-mediated regulation of cell surface receptor fate occur by ubiquitination of cytoplasmic receptor domains, there are precedents that ubiquitination can also occur in non-cytosolic compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sengupta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Siegelman et al., 1986</xref>). However, the contribution and underlying mechanisms of such pathways to receptor regulation remain unknown. Our results demonstrate that RNF41 regulates the DAMP receptor Clec9A by ubiquitination of its extracellular domains, to regulate receptor fate and dead cell handling for cross-presentation. We further reveal novel Clec9A associations with ER proteins previously identified to play a role in cross-presentation, revealing insights into the differential handling of Clec9A at steady state and following uptake of dead cell cargo. Further studies on Clec9A interactions, their specific intracellular localization, and the precise form of the Clec9A ubiquitination under different conditions of DC activation and Ag handling are required to obtain a complete picture of the role of RNF41 in the regulation of Clec9A fate and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Is the Ub machinery present in the lumen? Both seem unlikely, with the former perhaps more so. Note that cell surface Ub was first reported by Irv Weissman's lab long ago (1986, in Science no less PMID:3003913). I don't think that this has ever been explained. I agreed to review the paper based on the Abstract describing cell surface Ub. Granted, there are plenty of other interesting findings in this paper. But, still, I am disappointed by the absence of addressing this intriguing finding, which could have enormous implications for cell biology.</p><p>2) Please explain the detergent extract experiment with more detail (Figure 2). How can GAPDH not be in either IGEPAL soluble or insoluble fractions? Where else can it be?</p><p>3) Figure 3. Clec9A associated proteins? Meaning what? I could not find the details of this experiment anywhere (perhaps my fault); in any event, an outline should be in the Results. How can PSMB1 show up here? Does this mean that Clec9A is exposed to the cytosol? Or is the proteasome in the lumen (a la Cresswell's last paper on proteasomes in class II compartments?). How can just one proteasome component show up? It isn't assembled (but aren't unassembled proteasome components degraded rapidly? The pathway analysis is uninformative/misleading, and should perhaps be in the supplemental data, if shown at all. Shouldn't this experiment be done as well in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor to detect interactions of Clec9A destined for degradation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The C-type lectin like receptor Clec9A (or DNGR1) is known to play a key role in the presentation by MHC I and II of dead cell derived antigens. The present study of Tullet et al., aimed at deciphering how Clec9A is regulated in dendritic cells. The authors found that Clec9A is regulated by an E3 ligase named RNF41, a previously described member of the RING family known to induce the degradation of several proteins via their ubiquitination. Levels of Clec9A are regulated via their association with RNF4 which takes place in steady state in DC, reducing the levels of Clec9A available. Importantly, exposure of DC to dead cells induces a transient dissociation of RNF41 leading to increased levels of Clec9A and in fine better cross presentation of antigens associated with dead cells.</p><p>The study represents a large body of experiments carefully controlled and achieved. Some of them are elegant. The manuscript is clearly written. The work presented deserves publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in principle because it brings several important new findings regarding a new level of regulation of the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells. I have however two main concerns that should be addressable and several minor comments to improve the study.</p><p>1) Among the several important findings reported in the study, the fact that the ectodomain of Clec9A is the substrate of RNF41 is well demonstrated but highly surprising. Like the authors, as far as I know this is the first example of Ubiquitination taking place on the intralumenal domain of a transmembrane protein. The lysines of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of Clec9A were not modified by RNF41 while the ectodomain appears to be ubiquitinated at multiple sites. Since RNF41 is in all likelihood a cytosolic protein, how can it access the multiple lysines of the ectodomain of Clec9A? Where does the ubiquitination of Clec9A by RNF41 take place in the cell? The authors propose that it could take place at two locations either (i) in the ER or (ii) in the endosomes.</p><p>i) Regarding the first possibility, the authors propose that the association of Erlin1/2 with Clec9A they document by mass spec, reflects the involvement of the ERAD pathway, (Erlin1/2 have been indeed associated with the ERAD pathway in the literature). Thus, I guess they mean that Clec9A could be first retro-translocated, then ubiquitinated by RNF41 in the cytosol and targeted to the proteasome for degradation. This sounds an attractive explanation but it should be supported by additional data establishing a direct link with the ERAD pathway.</p><p>Moreover, the text should be clearer regarding the localization of RNF41 (Discussion). Do they authors consider that RNF41 could access to the lumen of the ER and how? In this matter, the ultra-structural analysis of RNF41 localization in DC presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 should be improved. The single immunogold RNF41 staining appears present at low density on multiple membranes which precise identity cannot be deduced only from the morphology of the membranes. Co-localization with ER markers (calnexin and calreticulin that seems to chaperone Clec9A) and endosomal markers would be required.</p><p>ii) Regarding the second hypothesis, the authors observe that association between Clec9A and RNF41 is favored at acidic pH. They suggest therefore that both proteins may interact in the lysosomes. Again, this should be directly supported by additional data either by EM as explained above, or by other means. And here also, the question of the access of RNF41 to the lumen of the endosome should be discussed, at least.</p><p>2) The authors use all along their study the cell line named MUTU DC but refer to it as cDC1, which might be misleading. It is important to extend a couple of the key findings to primary cDC1. I suggest 2 relatively simple experiments: The authors could measure the impact of primary cDC1 exposure to dead cells on the levels of expression of Clec9A at different time. They also can use their nice PLA assay to follow in cDC1, the association between the two proteins (Clec9A and RNF41) in the absence or presence of dead cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63452.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor and their views concur.

We would like to share new data with the reviewers, although we would prefer not to include this preliminary data in the manuscript at this time.</p><p>We hypothesised that transport of the Clec9A ectodomain to the cytosol would involve translocation of the Clec9A ectodomain through intracellular membranes, and that translocon component Sec61, or the AAA+ ATPase-VCP/p97, were likely to be involved in such translocation. We found that inhibition of Sec61 and VCP/p97, using the inhibitors ExoA and Eeyarestatin I (ES1) respectively, did not inhibit RNF41-mediated regulation of Clec9A levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of Sec61 did not appear to affect RNF41-mediated ubiquitination of Clec9A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Thus, our data suggests that Sec61-mediated translocation is not necessary for RNF41-mediated ubiquitination of Clec9A, or its downstream processing for proteasomal degradation. Thus, while we cannot rule out translocation of the Clec9A ectodomain to the cytosol through alternative translocation mediators, this does not appear to be mediated via Sec61 or VCP/P97.</p><p>Alternatively, Professor Peter Cresswell and colleagues have recently demonstrated both ubiquitination and proteasomal machinery within endo-lysosomal compartments of the cell (Sengupta et al., 2019). We propose that this is a likely mechanism for RNF41-mediated regulation of internalised Clec9A receptors. Further research is required to determine the specific location of this interactions and whether it occurs on the cytoplasmic side of membranes or within endosomes. The Discussion has been expanded to address this issue in more detail.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>RNF41-mediated regulation is not dependent on Sec61 or VCP/p97.</title><p>(A) RNF41 mediated regulation of Clec9A levels is not dependent on Sec61 or VCP/p97. 293F cells were co-transfected with constructs encoding FLAG-tagged full-length mClec9A in the absence and presence of RNF41.

I could not find the details of this experiment anywhere (perhaps my fault); in any event, an outline should be in the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. To identify novel Clec9A interactions that may facilitate Clec9A ectodomain access to ubiquitination and degradation machinery, we utilised cells transfected with Clec9A +/- RNF41. We performed Clec9A immunoprecipitations under higher stringency lysis conditions, and identified proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with Clec9A using LC/MS/MS. For clarity, we have replaced the phrase “Clec9A-associated proteins” with “Clec9A-interacting proteins” and have updated the manuscript to clearly describe the details of this experiment and include the outline in the Results and in the Figure legend.</p><p>The Results section now reads: “To elucidate the molecular machinery that facilitates access of Clec9A ectodomains to degradation machinery, we performed a proteomic analysis of Clec9A-interacting proteins in transfected cells.

This likely reflects the presence of K48-ubiquitinated Clec9A that is targeted for proteasomal degradation. At this stage, we cannot determine whether (1) Clec9A is exposed or translocated to the cytosol for degradation, or (2) Clec9A is exposed to ubiquitination and proteasomal machinery within endosomal compartments as proposed by Cresswell and colleagues (Sengupta et al., 2019). As outlined in the response to reviewer #1, point 1, we propose that ubiquitination of Clec9A in the endosome lumen is a likely mechanism for RNF41-mediated regulation of internalised Clec9A receptors but further studies will be required to determine the mechanism. This will be the subject of future studies, and the Discussion has been expanded to address this issue in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How can just one proteasome component show up?

The present study of Tullet et al., aimed at deciphering how Clec9A is regulated in dendritic cells. The authors found that Clec9A is regulated by an E3 ligase named RNF41, a previously described member of the RING family known to induce the degradation of several proteins via their ubiquitination. Levels of Clec9A are regulated via their association with RNF4 which takes place in steady state in DC, reducing the levels of Clec9A available. Importantly, exposure of DC to dead cells induces a transient dissociation of RNF41 leading to increased levels of Clec9A and in fine better cross presentation of antigens associated with dead cells.</p><p>The study represents a large body of experiments carefully controlled and achieved. Some of them are elegant. The manuscript is clearly written. The work presented deserves publication in eLife in principle because it brings several important new findings regarding a new level of regulation of the antigen presentation capacity of dendritic cells. I have however two main concerns that should be addressable and several minor comments to improve the study.</p><p>1) Among the several important findings reported in the study, the fact that the ectodomain of Clec9A is the substrate of RNF41 is well demonstrated but highly surprising. Like the authors, as far as I know this is the first example of Ubiquitination taking place on the intralumenal domain of a transmembrane protein. The lysines of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of Clec9A were not modified by RNF41 while the ectodomain appears to be ubiquitinated at multiple sites. Since RNF41 is in all likelihood a cytosolic protein, how can it access the multiple lysines of the ectodomain of Clec9A? Where does the ubiquitination of Clec9A by RNF41 take place in the cell? The authors propose that it could take place at two locations either (i) in the ER or (ii) in the endosomes.</p><p>i) Regarding the first possibility, the authors propose that the association of Erlin1/2 with Clec9A they document by mass spec, reflects the involvement of the ERAD pathway, (Erlin1/2 have been indeed associated with the ERAD pathway in the literature). Thus, I guess they mean that Clec9A could be first retro-translocated, then ubiquitinated by RNF41 in the cytosol and targeted to the proteasome for degradation. This sounds an attractive explanation but it should be supported by additional data establishing a direct link with the ERAD pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data revealed that RNF41 can regulate newly synthesized Clec9A, as identified by less complex, high mannose glycosylation of Clec9A (Figure 3E, F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E), indicative of regulation occurring at the ER. Furthermore, treatment with Brefeldin A, which inhibits transport of proteins from the ER/Golgi to the cell surface, did not inhibit RNF41 mediated degradation of newly synthesized Clec9A (Figure 3E,F). We propose that the Erlin 1/2 interaction lends further support to an ER-associated degradation pathway, and may play a role in facilitating access or retro-translocation of Clec9A to the cytosol where it can be ubiquitinated by RNF41. We agree that further additional data will be required to establish the direct link and have modified our Discussion to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the text should be clearer regarding the localization of RNF41 (lines 415-421). Do they authors consider that RNF41 could access to the lumen of the ER and how? In this matter, the ultra-structural analysis of RNF41 localization in DC presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2 should be improved. The single immunogold RNF41 staining appears present at low density on multiple membranes which precise identity cannot be deduced only from the morphology of the membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>Our single RNF41 staining by immuno-EM indicates that RNF41 can associate with multiple intracellular membranes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), consistent with the putative myristoylation sequence at position 2 of RNF41. We have used the morphology of the membranes as a guide to identification of the types of intracellular membranes (Zeuschner at al., 2006). We have updated the results to make this clearer. Furthermore, as the size of the Ab-protein A complex exceeds the thickness of the intracellular membrane, it is difficult at this stage to differentiate between whether the RNF41 detected is in the lumen or on the cytoplasmic side of the intracellular membranes. Further experimental approaches will be required to determine whether RNF41 can access the lumen of the ER or endosomal compartments. We have updated the Discussion to make this clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Co-localization with ER markers (calnexin and calreticulin that seems to chaperone Clec9A) and endosomal markers would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>The association of RNF41 with endosomal membranes is further supported by our initial confocal microscopy co-localisation studies in DC of RNF41 with EEA1 and Rab11 using Flt3L-derived DC (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). Previous studies have already described the association of RNF41 (Nrdp1) with ER markers including Calnexin, KDEL and PDI in alternative cell types using microscopy and fractionation studies (eg. Fry et al., 2011). Our biochemical fractionation studies (Figure 5—figure supplement 1G, H) support this data. However, we agree that further colocalization studies of endogenous RNF41 with ER and specific endosomal markers in cDC would further strengthen the understanding of RNF41 in the regulation of Clec9A and DC function. Unfortunately, we do not currently have a panel of markers and detection conditions that are compatible with our RNF41 Ab and PLA conditions to address this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Regarding the second hypothesis, the authors observe that association between Clec9A and RNF41 is favored at acidic pH. They suggest therefore that both proteins may interact in the lysosomes. Again, this should be directly supported by additional data either by EM as explained above, or by other means. And here also, the question of the access of RNF41 to the lumen of the endosome should be discussed, at least.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We agree that additional data on colocalization would further our understanding of RNF41 regulation; Unfortunately, we do not currently have a compatible panel of markers and detection conditions to investigate this. We have expanded the Discussion to address the question of RNF41 access to the endosomal lumen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors use all along their study the cell line named MUTU DC but refer to it as cDC1, which might be misleading. It is important to extend a couple of the key findings to primary cDC1. I suggest 2 relatively simple experiments: The authors could measure the impact of primary cDC1 exposure to dead cells on the levels of expression of Clec9A at different time. They also can use their nice PLA assay to follow in cDC1, the association between the two proteins (Clec9A and RNF41) in the absence or presence of dead cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion. We have extended the Clec9A-RNF41 interaction studies to primary cDC1 in the presence and absence of dead cells, and demonstrate that the Clec9A-RNF41 interaction is decreased in the presence of dead cells at 4 hours, consistent with our findings using the cDC1 line MutuDC1940.</p><p>This data has been included in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, and the Results updated as follows: “The degree of Clec9A-RNF41 interaction was significantly reduced in the presence of dead cells at 4 hours both in the cDC1 cell line MutuDC 1940 and in primary splenic cDC1 (Figure 5A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1C), although neither Clec9A nor RNF41 levels were reduced (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D).”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
