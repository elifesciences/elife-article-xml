Recently, several variants such as B.1.1.7 (alpha), B.1.351 (beta), and P.1 (gamma), which share a key mutation N501Y on the receptor-binding domain (RBD), appear to be more infectious to humans. To understand the underlying mechanism, we used a cell surface-binding assay, a kinetics study, a single-molecule technique, and a computational method to investigate the interaction between these RBD (mutations) and ACE2. Remarkably, RBD with the N501Y mutation exhibited a considerably stronger interaction, with a faster association rate and a slower dissociation rate. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based single-molecule force microscopy (SMFS) consistently quantified the interaction strength of RBD with the mutation as having increased binding probability and requiring increased unbinding force. Molecular dynamics simulations of RBD–ACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y mutation introduced additional π-π and π-cation interactions that could explain the changes observed by force microscopy. Taken together, these results suggest that the reinforced RBD–ACE2 interaction that results from the N501Y mutation in the RBD should play an essential role in the higher rate of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variants, and that future mutations in the RBD of the virus should be under surveillance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2 spike

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past 20 years, coronaviruses have posed severe threats to public health. In 2003, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) emerged in humans after being transferred from an animal reservoir and infected over 8000 people with a fatality rate of ~10% fatality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ksiazek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Florindo et al., 2020</xref>). Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected over 1700 people with a fatality rate of ~36% since 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zaki et al., 2012</xref>). In late December 2019, a novel coronavirus, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of an outbreak of a new respiratory illness named COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than 4 million deaths to date. Considerable efforts have been made to understand its molecule mechanism.</p><p>Coronaviruses are large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the coronaviridae family, which comprises four genera: alpha-coronaviruses, beta-coronaviruses, gamma-coronaviruses, and delta-coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>). SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and MERS-CoV, which infect mammalians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), are beta-coronaviruses. Envelope-anchored spike proteins are capable of mediating coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a specific host receptor and then fusing the viral and host membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>). The coronavirus spike protein, a class I fusion protein, is synthesized as a precursor single polypeptide chain consisting of three segments: a large ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane anchor, and a short intracellular tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After interacting with the host receptor, the spike protein is cleaved into an amino-terminal subunit (S1) and a carboxyl-terminal subunit (S2) by host furin-like proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lan et al., 2020</xref>). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) located in the C-terminal region of the S1 subunit (S1 CTD) is responsible for recognizing and binding the host receptor and is critical in determining the cell tropism, host range, and zoonotic transmission of coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li, 2016</xref>). The S2 subunit contains a hydrophobic fusion loop for membrane fusion. Cryo-EM studies have illuminated the prefusion and postfusion structures of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, implying that coronaviruses undergo conformational changes during infection. The spike protein forms a clove-shaped homotrimer with three S1 heads and a trimeric S2 stalk. Structural comparisons indicated that spike protein utilizes the CTD1 (N-terminal domain in CTD) as the RBD, which changes from the ‘down’ conformation to the ‘up’ conformation and then converts from the inactivated state to the activated state to allow for receptor binding, and possibly also to initiate subsequent conformational changes of the S2 subunits to mediate membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirchdoerfer et al., 2018</xref>). The binding of spike RBD to SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 is the first step in viral entry into the host cell. Thus, the majority of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies that are under development target this region.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two SARS-CoV-2 variants bind to ACE2 with higher affinity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain architecture of the SARS-CoV-2 spike monomer.

The alpha variant (B.1.1.7 lineage) was first detected in the United Kingdom in September 2020, and another variant (B.1.351 lineage, beta) was first detected in October 2020 in the Republic of South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rahimi and Talebi Bezmin Abadi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greaney et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">CNBC, 2021</xref>). Both of these mutants carry an N501Y mutation, and the B.1.351 lineage has two additional mutations (K417N and E484K) within the RBD region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tu et al., 2021</xref>). Recent data suggest that the FDA-authorized mRNA vaccines continued to induce a high level of neutralization against the B.1.1.7 variant, but a lower level against B.1.351 variants. Several researchers have assessed the neutralization potency of numerous antibodies against the two new variants. Their data suggest that some neutralizing antibodies in phase II/III clinical trials were not able to retain their neutralizing capability against the B.1.351 variant. As these mutations are within the RBD region, an understanding of the mechanism that allows the new variants to bind to the ACE2 receptor is of great value.</p><p>The structure of the RBD–ACE2 complex showed that extensive interactions are formed between RBD and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2020</xref>). To understand the potential role of the RBD mutations in binding to ACE2, we combined a cell-surface-binding assay, a kinetics study, a single-molecule biophysical method, and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations to study the interaction of RBD mutants and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Our results reveal the molecular mechanism that underlies the increased transmissibility of two SARS-CoV-2 variants by identifying the key mutation N501Y. This information could be valuable for the development of further vaccines and neutralizing antibodies against mutant forms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell-surface binding of RBD to ACE2</title><p>To elucidate the interaction between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 variants and ACE2, we performed a cell-surface-binding assay. ACE2 with a mCherry fused at the C-terminus was transfected into HEK293 cells. Confocal microscopic images subsequently showed that ACE2 was located mainly in the cell membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). ACE2–mCherry-positive cells were stained with AlexaFluor488 labeled-RBD, and the overlay images showed the co-localization of RBD and ACE2 on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), validating their interaction.</p><p>To measure the binding affinity of RBD from SARS-CoV-2 for ACE2 on the surface of cells, saturation binding was performed using fluorescence flow cytometry by titration of Alexa488-RBD without washing the cells, which yielded a K<sub>d</sub> of about 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We also performed a competition-binding assay by titrating unlabeled RBD to compete with 100 nM Alexa488-RBD, which showed a similar affinity of 50 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>N501Y mutation slowed the dissociation of the RBD from the ACE2 receptor</title><p>To determine the role of the receptor mutations, we first compared the ability of all of the RBD mutants to bind to the cell surface with that of wild-type RBD using a competition binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). The N501Y mutation from the B.1.1.7 variant showed a fourfold greater affinity than wild-type RBD for the cell surface. The mutation resulted in a slightly weaker or similar affinity to cell-surface ACE2, whereas the N501Y, K417N, E484K triple mutation resulted in an affinity similar to that of the wild type RBD. These results demonstrated that N501Y is the key residue change that increases binding affinity.</p><p>To further understand the changes in kinetics that result from the RBD mutations, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) on the immobilized RBD or RBD mutants with ACE2 as an analyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, thin black lines). Compared to RBD, both RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> and RBD<sup>Triple</sup> showed a 10-fold increase in affinity, which resulted from a significantly lower off-rate and a slightly higher on-rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Two other amino acid mutations (K417N and E484K) had less impact on ACE2 binding, as verified by two single-point mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result again emphasized the role of N501Y, rather than the other two mutations, in increasing binding affinity by slowing the rate of dissociation from the ACE2 receptor.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of the binding of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and of RBD mutants to the ACE2 protein.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensorgrams (thin black lines) with fits (thick gray lines).

For example, 2815 data points on force-extension curves (using a pulling speed of 5 µm/s) have been obtained by probing ACE2-transfected cells with a RBD<sup>N501Y</sup>-functionalized AFM tip. As indicated by an unbinding force of &gt;20 pN, 14% of the events involved a specific interaction between RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> curve 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The interaction between RBD and untransfected normal HEK293 cells (1.7%) was also measured as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). The mean unbinding forces for RBD, RBD<sup>N501Y</sup>, and RBD<sup>Triple</sup> were 49 ± 11 pN (n = 349), 57 ± 18 pN (n = 394), and 56 ± 12 pN (n = 312), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The absolute difference in force value between the two mutations and the wild type is small (~10 pN), but this is still a difference of ~15% difference due to their low unbinding force (~50 pN).

Thus, the binding strength of the ligand–receptor bond (i.e. interaction) is proportional to the logarithm of the loading rate, which describes the effect of the force applied on the bond over time. Thus, we pulled the RBD–ACE2 complexes apart at different velocities, and plotted the relationship between the unbinding forces and loading rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).

The rupture of these additional interactions as well as the interactions that are also present in the wild-type complex (snapshot 1) led to the highest rupture force during the simulation. An elevated unbinding force of 499 ± 67 pN (n = 20) was obtained for the complex between RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> and ACE2 compared to that for the complex between wild-type RBD and ACE2 (p=8.29 e<sup>–4</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In this study, we combined cell-surface-binding assays, mechanical manipulation by AFM-SMFS, and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the behavior of key mutations recently detected in B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants that affect RBD binding. All of these methodologies suggested that, of the three mutations examined in this work, the N501Y mutation in the RBD has the most significant role in binding and dissociation from the ACE2 receptor . The cell surface-binding assay showed that, when compared wild-type RBD, RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> had greater binding affinity for ACE2. SPR and AFM-SMFS measurements consistently showed that RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> had increased <italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub> and binding probability and decreased <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>. It is noted that SPR was performed on the complex between RBD and isolated ACE2 protein, whereas the other two measurements were performed on the complex between RBD and ACE2 on living cells. The more complex cell surface of living cells, where other proteins or receptors may interact with RBD in a non-specific and weaker way, may account for the relatively weak results observed at the cellular level. Indeed, the AFM unbinding results indicated a fraction of non-specific interactions between RBDs and the surface of untransfected normal cells (~5% for a RBD monomer on HEK293 cells studied here, ~10% for a S1/RBD homotrimer on A549 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsteens et al., 2017a</xref>). Previous AFM results on wild-type RBD showed a higher specific binding probability than that observed in this study (~20% vs. ~15%), possibly resulting from different RBD construct and immobilization methods and the use of different host (A549) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the specific unbinding forces detected for the RBD–ACE2 complex (~50 pN) in the two experiments are similar. Moreover, the two mutants showed higher binding probability and unbinding force, as well as lower off-rate, under the same conditions in our studies.</p><p>One concern was whether ACE2 was pulled out of the cell membrane during our AFM experiments. First, the unbinding force that was measured (~50 pN) is much smaller than the typical force needed to pull a membrane-bound protein out of a cell membrane (~100 pN). Also, if this had happened, the isolated ACE2 would stick to the RBD-functionalized coverslip and would block further measurement. In our AFM experiment, the pick-up ratio was mostly consistent with the measurements. Finally, previous work on purified ACE2 protein and wild-type RBD showed a rupture force of ~50 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we believe that the ACE2 was not pulled out of the cell membrane during our experiments.</p><p>There was only a small difference in complex stability between RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> and RBD<sup>Triple</sup>, where two more mutations are present in RBD<sup>Triple</sup>. Indeed, the results from flow cytometry showed that E484K contributed less to the interaction increment than N501Y, whereas K417N even decreased the interaction. The effects of the E484K and K417N mutations may cancel each other out, and N501Y is the dominant site in affecting the interaction. Thus, the combination of all three of these mutations in RBD<sup>Triple</sup> lead to an effect that was similar to that of RBD<sup>N501Y</sup>. Indeed, a similar <italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> value is obtained for RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> and RBD<sup>Triple</sup> from AFM-SMFS measurement.</p><p>Finally, the SMD simulations provide valuable information on the enhanced interaction between the RBD mutants and ACE2. It is noted that only a modest effect from the N501Y mutation was detected in the experimental data, such as the 10 pN difference in complex dissociation force between the wild-type and variants detected by AFM measurement. Consequently, we performed a range of different experimental biophysical methods to measure the kinetics and confirm these differences. Thus, the results of SMD simulations are essential parts of our work, revealing that additional interactions are present for the N501Y mutant RBD and are responsible for the increased rupture force. Owing to computational limitations, we chose 0.5 m/s as the pulling speed for the SMD simulations, which is a normal speed for simulations. Nevertheless, this speed is much higher than the experimental speed (5 µm/s), although it does not affect the molecular insights provided by the simulations. As confirmed by other simulation studies performed at various speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pavlova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Han et al., 2021</xref>), our simulations revealed that additional π-π and cation-π interactions resulting from the N501Y mutation lead to the higher rupture force. In addition, a higher pulling speed typically leads to a higher rupture or dissociation force. Thus, the simulation also confirmed rupture force trend for the three complexes. Nevertheless, all of these methods have their own advantages and limitations. The experiment provides quantitative results under physiological conditions, whereas the simulations provide an underlying molecular mechanism that rarely obtained by experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we believe that the combination of experimental and simulation techniques used here is necessary and provides a complete picture of this important problem.</p><p>Another SARS-CoV-2 variant, P.1 lineage (gamma), was identified in January 2021 in Brazil. Studies found that, like the two variants studied in this work, it may also affect the ability of antibodies to recognize and neutralize the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hodcroft et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, three key mutations (N501Y, E484K, and K417T) are found in the RBD of the P.1 variant. Consequently, we believe that N501Y is a critical mutation that affects the transmission of COVID-19 by strengthening the interaction between RBD and ACE2. The strong interaction of the N501Y mutant RBD leads to the tighter binding of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell, allowing complete membrane fusion or the internalization of the receptor with the virus. Thus, we speculate that the enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants for host cells may contribute to the observed increase in infectivity by lowering the effective virion concentration required for cell entry. A modest change in affinity could cause a significant increase in the infection rate. Indeed, the alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2, which contains the N501Y mutation, had become the most common lineage in the United States by June 2020. It is noted that several other SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as delta, epsilon, and kappa, have been found very recently during the revision of our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). Some of these variants have very high transmission rates and have been proposed to be more dangerous. Although they do not contain the N501Y mutation, other mutations in the RBD might increase the binding of the virus to the human receptor ACE2, leading to a similar effect. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving rapidly. Hundreds of millions of human beings have been affected, and the virus is still spreading rapidly, so future dangerous mutations causing even higher transmission to humans or other creatures are very possible. Thus, further surveillance, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of mutated SARS-CoV-2 strains are necessary.</p><p>Nowadays, most vaccines are designed on the basis of the RBD or spike protein. Neutralizing antibodies from these vaccines mainly target the RBD to weaken its binding to ACE2. Here, we found that a RBD with the N501Y mutation has a 5–10 times higher affinity than wild-type RBD for ACE2. Additional mutations within the receptor-binding site (K417N and E484K) changed the amino acid sequence of the epitope and may contribute to the escape from antibody binding. Thus, a higher vaccine-induced antibody titer or neutralizing antibodies of higher affinity are needed to compete for the RBD<sup>N501Y</sup>–ACE2 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Focosi and Maggi, 2021</xref>). This will make the current vaccine less effective against SARS-CoV-2 variants that contain the N501Y mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>The genes were ordered from GenScript Inc The RBD construct contains the SAS-COV-2 spike protein (residues 319–591), followed by a GGGGS linker and an 8XHis tag in a pcDNA3.4 modified vector (SI).

Then, the peptide GL-ELP<sub>20</sub>-C was added to the maleimide. The long ELP<sub>20</sub> serves as a spacer that prevents non-specific interactions between the tip and the cell surface, and is a signature for the single-molecule event.

Typically, the tip contacted the cell surface for 400 ms under an indentation force of 450 pN, thereby ensuring a site-specific interaction between the RBD on the tip and ACE2 on a cell while minimizing the non-specific interaction. The sample was scanned using 32 × 32 pixels per line (1024 lines) and a sample number of 10,500. Then, moving the tip up vertically at a constant velocity (5 µm/s, if not specified), the complex ruptured. Then, the tip was moved to another location to repeat this cycle several thousands of times. As a result, a force-extension curve, possibly including the complex unbinding event, was obtained.

While follow-up studies will be undoubtedly required to more thoroughly establish this hypothesis, we believe that this manuscript, which has shown vast improvements during this peer-review process, will be broad of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;COVID-19 N501Y Mutation of Spike Protein Strengthens the binding to its Receptor ACE2&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and with the Editors. Based on this discussion, we would like to invite you to submit a revised version of your manuscript. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this letter to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. A concern is regarding the AFM measurement is how do the authors know that the AFM pulling procedure is not pulling ACE2 out of the cell membrane?</p><p>2. The authors provide estimates of error in the off-rates measured using SPR (Figure 2d). However, they do not for the k<sub>off</sub> measured using AFM-SM. Why is the error estimates neglected in the latter case? As presented, the differences in k<sub>off</sub> derived from AFM-SM seem small. Without knowing the errors in the estimates, it isn't easy to gauge whether the observed differences are meaningful. The authors should therefore address this.</p><p>3. Can the authors please comment on why they did not carry out AFM-SM experiments on the K417N and E484K mutants?</p><p>4. The B.1.351 variant exhibits higher transmission and is less sensitive to existing vaccines than wild-type. The N501Y mutation might explain the increased transmission rate. The authors should comment on whether the additional mutations render the vaccines less neutralizing to B.1.351 variant in the Discussion section.</p><p>5. Moreover, the effects they have identified might be statistically significant, but they are modest. The authors must put forward an argument to explain why this difference is enough to drive the known differences in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p><p>6. In the abstract, the authors stated that &quot;Molecular dynamics simulations of RBD-ACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y introduced additional π-π and π-cation interaction for the higher 11 force/interaction.&quot; Unfortunately, though the authors observed higher maximum forces during the simulated unfolding of the Triple mutant, they did not perform a detailed contact analysis that links it to the additional π-π and π-cation interaction. Without such analysis, one cannot know why they observed higher forces for the mutant. The simulations have not yielded any more information beyond what is already evident from the AFM-SM experiments. Put differently, the current simulations and analyses have added little biophysical insights.</p><p>7. In the caption of Figure 4, the authors state that &quot;Arrows indicate the key step during the dissociation of these complexes, of which structures are shown in (b-d), respectively.&quot; What do they mean by key step, how was it determined, and is it consistent over many independent trajectories? Related to the latter, the authors appear only to carry out three independent simulations per system. They should repeat the simulations at least 20 times and show that their observations are converged or consistent across the 20 trajectories.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;N501Y Mutation of Spike Protein in SARS-CoV-2 Strengthens its Binding to Receptor ACE2&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Aaron Frank as Reviewing Editor and José Faraldo-Gómez as Senior Editor.</p><p>While we recognize the manuscript has improved, there remain substantial issues that must be resolved prior to publication – as outlined below. We urge you to address all of these issues as thoroughly and convincingly as possible before submitting the next revision of the manuscript.</p><p>In the abstract reference is made to &quot;COVID-19 variants&quot;. The variants are of the virus, and so should be &quot;SARS-CoV-2 variants&quot;.</p><p>Regarding Response 1: The transition to the added paragraph (Page 12; Line 305) is abrupt. The authors might consider something like:</p><p>&quot;One concern was whether ACE2 was pulled out of the cell membrane during our AFM experiments. First, the unbinding force measured (~50 pN) is much smaller than the typical force needed to pull a membrane-bound protein out of the cell membrane….&quot;</p><p>Regarding Response 2: It is stated that &quot;In addition, as this reviewer pointed out later, it is a modest effect with a relatively small difference. That's another reason we performed a range of different methods to measure the kinetics and confirm this difference.&quot; This rationale should be explicitly articulated in the discussion of the manuscript. It will have the reader understand why multiple biophysical approaches were employed and the value-added by combining these methods.</p><p>Regarding Response 5: It is stated that &quot;Enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants contribute to the increased infectivity by lowering the effective virion concentration required for cell entry. Thus, a modest change in affinity will cause a significant arising in the infection rate.&quot; However, no direct or supporting evidence is present that supports this statement. Thus, it would be more appropriate if the authors should state this as an untested hypothesis. For example, &quot;We speculate that enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants may contribute to the increased infectivity by lowering the effective virion concentration required for cell entry. Thus, a modest change in affinity could cause a significant increase in the infection rate.&quot;</p><p>Regarding Response 6:</p><p>– Are the traces (4A-4E) from one simulation or an aggregate of 20 simulations?

A concern is regarding the AFM measurement is how do the authors know that the AFM pulling procedure is not pulling ACE2 out of the cell membrane?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this will be a problem if it happened. Fortunately, we are confident that our measurements did not contain such events.</p><p>First, the rupture force between ACE2 and RBD (mutants) we measured is ~50 pN, which is smaller than a typical force (&gt;100 pN) needed to pull a membrane-bound protein out of the membrane. Thus, ACE2, a three-time transmembrane protein measured here, is most likely not pulled out.</p><p>Also, if this happened, the isolated ACE2 will stick to the RBD-functionalized coverslip and block further measurement. In our AFM experiment, the pick-up ratio is consistent along with the measurement.</p><p>Finally, previous work on purified ACE2 protein and WT-RBD showed a rupture force of ~50 pN. Thus, we believe that the ACE2 was not pulled out of the cell membrane during our measurement. We have added this discussion in our revised manuscript. Please see Page 12, the last paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors provide estimates of error in the off-rates measured using SPR (Figure 2d). However, they do not for the k<sub>off</sub> measured using AFM-SM. Why is the error estimates neglected in the latter case? As presented, the differences in k<sub>off</sub> derived from AFM-SM seem small. Without knowing the errors in the estimates, it isn't easy to gauge whether the observed differences are meaningful. The authors should therefore address this.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added the fitting error for the k<sub>off</sub> obtained by our dynamic AFM-SMFS experiment: RBD (0.075±0.048 s<sup>−1</sup>), RBD<sup>N501Y</sup> (0.035±0.024 s<sup>−1</sup>) and RBD<sup>Triple</sup> (0.030±0.017 s<sup>−1</sup>). We have updated our results in the manuscript. Please see Page 8, from lines 26-27. This fitting error is also present in Figure 3—figure supplement 4.</p><p>In addition, as this reviewer pointed out later, it is a modest effect with a relatively small difference. That’s another reason we performed a range of different methods to measure the kinetics and confirm this difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Can the authors please comment on why they did not carry out AFM-SM experiments on the K417N and E484K mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>From the SPR and cell binding assay, we found that the N501Y and the triple mutant showed the most significant change while the effect of K417N and E484K mutant are weaker. To understand why and which mutation in RBD increases its binding to ACE2, we focused on the characterization of N501Y and the triple mutant by AFM-SMFS.</p><p>Thanks to the comment, we have now performed similar AFM experiments for K417N and E484K RBD mutations. As expected, they both showed a weaker unbinding force, which agrees with the previous SPR. It verifies our previous conclusion and completes our work.</p><p>We have added the explanation and these results on Page 8, from lines 16 to 18, in the main text and a new Figure 3—figure supplement 3 in SI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The B.1.351 variant exhibits higher transmission and is less sensitive to existing vaccines than wild-type. The N501Y mutation might explain the increased transmission rate. The authors should comment on whether the additional mutations render the vaccines less neutralizing to B.1.351 variant in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>The neutralizing antibody induced by the vaccines will bind only to the original epitope. The additional mutations (K417N and E484K) within the receptor-binding site lead to the change in the amino acid sequence of the epitope, and may contribute to the escape from antibody binding. Thus, the vaccines are less efficient at neutralizing B.1.351 variant.</p><p>We have added this comment on Page 13, from lines 29 to 31.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Moreover, the effects they have identified might be statistically significant, but they are modest. The authors must put forward an argument to explain why this difference is enough to drive the known differences in the SARS-CoV-2 variants.</p></disp-quote><p>Enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants contribute to the increased infectivity by lowering the effective virion concentration required for cell entry. Thus, a modest change in affinity will cause a significant arising in the infection rate.</p><p>We have added this comment on Page 13, from line 24 to line 26.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the abstract, the authors stated that &quot;Molecular dynamics simulations of RBD-ACE2 complexes indicated that the N501Y introduced additional π-π and π-cation interaction for the higher 11 force/interaction.&quot; Unfortunately, though the authors observed higher maximum forces during the simulated unfolding of the Triple mutant, they did not perform a detailed contact analysis that links it to the additional π-π and π-cation interaction. Without such analysis, one cannot know why they observed higher forces for the mutant. The simulations have not yielded any more information beyond what is already evident from the AFM-SM experiments. Put differently, the current simulations and analyses have added little biophysical insights.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed a detailed analysis of our SMD simulations results, focusing on the additional π-π and π-cation interaction from the N501Y mutation. The relationship of the distance between these key residues (Y(N)501-Y41 and Y(N)501-K353) vs. extension (simulation time) during the simulations was analyzed (Figure 4).</p><p>For the WT RBD-ACE2 complex, the distances between residue N501 from the RBD and residues Y41 and K353 from the ACE2 increased significantly at a shorter extension/earlier time along the pulling/unbinding pathway (purple line) at the distance of 2.2±0.7 nm (<italic>n</italic>=20), indicating no interaction between these residues in the WT RBD-ACE2 complex.</p><p>In the RBD<sup>N501Y</sup>-ACE2 complex, the distances between Y501-Y41 and Y501-K353 showed a relatively modest increase at a longer extension/later time (orange line), at an extension of 2.9±0.8 nm (<italic>n</italic>=20), compared to results of WT RBD-ACE2 complex. Similarly, the distances showed a smaller increase at an extension of 3.3±0.8 nm (green line, n=20). Consequently, it proves that the asparagine to tyrosine mutation (Y501) may form a π-π interaction with Y41 and a π-cation interaction with K353 on ACE2, leading to the stronger interaction for the two mutations. We have added these results on Page 11, the first paragraph of the main text and as two graphs as Figure 4D and Figure 4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In the caption of Figure 4, the authors state that &quot;Arrows indicate the key step during the dissociation of these complexes, of which structures are shown in (b-d), respectively.&quot; What do they mean by key step, how was it determined, and is it consistent over many independent trajectories? Related to the latter, the authors appear only to carry out three independent simulations per system. They should repeat the simulations at least 20 times and show that their observations are converged or consistent across the 20 trajectories.</p></disp-quote><p>To highlight the key step as pointed out by this reviewer, we redesigned Figure 4 and added three sequential snapshot graphs for each simulation curve. Snapshot (1) is the previously stated “key step”, which is the rupture of the complex. And snapshot (2) is the complete dissociation state. For the two mutants, the arrow corresponds to the rupture of the additional π-π interaction between Y501 and Y41, and the rupture of the π-cation interaction between Y501 and K353. For the WT, the key step corresponds to the rupture of the two hydrogen bonds (T500-Y41, T500-D355) and the salt bridge (K417-D30)(Snapshot 2).</p><p>Moreover, we repeated the SMD simulations 20 times per system as suggested. The simulated rupture force of the complex is 427±58 pN for RBD, 499±67 pN for RBDN501Y and 521±65 for RBD<sup>Triple</sup> (<italic>n</italic>=20). Representative simulated force-extension curves were shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. These results agree well with our previous results. Together with our previous contact analysis (response to comment 6), the simulations are consistent and further support our previous conclusion. And we appreciate these comments from this reviewer.</p><p>We have added/modified the discussion from line 25 to 36 on Page 10. The previous figure 4 has been redesigned with this new information. And new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Supplement table S1 are added.[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the abstract reference is made to &quot;COVID-19 variants&quot;.

The authors might consider something like:</p><p>&quot;One concern was whether ACE2 was pulled out of the cell membrane during our AFM experiments. First, the unbinding force measured (~50 pN) is much smaller than the typical force needed to pull a membrane-bound protein out of the cell membrane….&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this suggestion and have modified the text as suggested.

That's another reason we performed a range of different methods to measure the kinetics and confirm this difference.&quot; This rationale should be explicitly articulated in the discussion of the manuscript. It will have the reader understand why multiple biophysical approaches were employed and the value-added by combining these methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have modified the text and explicitly state it in the discussion. Please see page 13, line 20.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding Response 5: It is stated that &quot;Enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants contribute to the increased infectivity by lowering the effective virion concentration required for cell entry. Thus, a modest change in affinity will cause a significant arising in the infection rate.&quot; However, no direct or supporting evidence is present that supports this statement. Thus, it would be more appropriate if the authors should state this as an untested hypothesis. For example, &quot;We speculate that enhanced affinity of SARS-CoV-2 variants may contribute to the increased infectivity by lowering the effective virion concentration required for cell entry. Thus, a modest change in affinity could cause a significant increase in the infection rate.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and modified our description. Please see page 14, from line 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding Response 6:</p><p>– Are the traces (4A-4E) from one simulation or an aggregate of 20 simulations?

Thanks to the comment, we have now replaced them with curves drawn from the average result of the 20 times simulations, showing the standard deviation. And the caption in Figure 4 and the text have been changed accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Also, the statement that &quot;SMD simulations revealed a higher unbinding force due to additional interactions for the complex with RBD mutant&quot; needs to be revised to enhance clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text as “SMD simulations revealed a higher unbinding force for the complex due to additional π-π and cation-π interactions from the N501Y mutation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Also, on Pg. 10, Line 247, it is written that &quot;In the wild-type RBD-ACE2 interaction, T500 forms two hydrogen bonds with Y41 and D355 from ACE2.

There are two major rupture steps of the interactions during SMD simulation. The first step involves the rupture of most interactions (except the Y83-N487 interaction) and leads to the highest rupture force during SMD simulations, which is the key/critical step upon the complex dissociation. Then, only the Y83-N487 interaction remains, which is broke at the second step, leading to the complete dissociation of the complex.
