However, to date, no clinically relevant inhibitor of this cascade has been tested in experimental models of addiction, a necessary step toward clinical trials. We designed two new cell-penetrating peptides - RB1 and RB3 - that penetrate the brain and, in the micromolar range, inhibit phosphorylation of ERK, histone H3 and S6 ribosomal protein in striatal slices. Furthermore, a screening of small therapeutics currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy revealed PD325901 as a brain-penetrating drug that blocks ERK signalling in the nanomolar range. All three compounds have an inhibitory effect on cocaine-induced ERK activation and reward in mice. In particular, PD325901 persistently blocks cocaine-induced place preference and accelerates extinction following cocaine self-administration. Thus, clinically relevant, systemically administered drugs that attenuate Ras-ERK signalling in the brain may be valuable tools for the treatment of cocaine addiction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17111.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17111.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Ras-ERK signalling</kwd><kwd>MEK inhibitor</kwd><kwd>cell-penetrating peptide</kwd><kwd>cocaine place preference</kwd><kwd>cocaine self-administration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>383/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spanagel</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ERANET</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COCADDICT</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spanagel</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondazione Cariplo</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brambilla</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000864</institution-id><institution>Michael J.

Several lines of evidence have demonstrated that the experience of drugs of abuse depends on learned associations between drug-paired cues and the rewarding effects of these drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sanchis-Segura and Spanagel, 2006</xref>). Thus, preventing relapse following drug abstinence is impeded by the ability of drug-associated cues to persistently elicit drug-seeking behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belin et al., 2013</xref>). As a consequence, conditioned drug cues may induce drug seeking and relapse behaviour. In the brain, cellular mechanisms and signalling pathways involved in normal learning and memory processes are usurped by addictive drugs; hence, memories encoding drug-paired cues resist extinction and contribute to high rates of relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nestler, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Marshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torregrossa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Itzhak et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In particular, Ras-ERK signalling has been implicated in both the acute and long-term effects of cocaine using different experimental paradigms that mimic drug addiction in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valjent et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valjent et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferguson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girault et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fasano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fasano and Brambilla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pascoli et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia-Pardo et al., 2016</xref>). The use of pharmacological inhibitors of MEK1/2, the kinases upstream of ERK1/2, has been essential in defining the role of ERK cascade in lasting experience- and drug-dependent alterations in behavioural plasticity. Until recently, the only available blood-brain barrier penetrating MEK inhibitor was SL327, but this drug has never been used in humans, most likely due to toxicity issues and to the relatively low IC50 (0.18/0.22 <italic>μ</italic>M toward MEK1 and MEK2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scherle et al., 2000</xref>). Another MEK inhibitor unable to pass the blood-brain barrier but still widely used via direct injection in the brain is U0126 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Favata et al., 1998</xref>). Regardless, it has been shown that MEK inhibition prevents conditioned place preference (CPP) to cocaine and amphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valjent et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gerdjikov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Marshall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valjent et al., 2006a</xref>). Other studies have identified a key role for ERK in drug reinforcement using the self-administration paradigm. Cocaine self-administration has been demonstrated to increase ERK phosphorylation relative to saline controls in striatal regions that mediate reinforcement, including the nucleus accumbens shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miszkiel et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, drug-seeking during exposure to cocaine-associated cues/contexts following the acquisition of self-administration has also been demonstrated to be ERK-dependent, although its role during cue and/or context exposure depends on a number of different factors, including the extent of cocaine training, brain region, and withdrawal duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edwards et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whitfield et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyle et al., 2014</xref>). One finding of particular interest showed that following cocaine self-administration, bilateral infusion of U0126 into the basolateral amygdala immediately after a short memory retrieval session, attenuated subsequent cocaine seeking. This treatment was associated with a transient decrease in phospho-ERK, suggesting an important role for ERK during memory retrieval in maintaining drug-associated memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wells et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To date, the knowledge implicating ERK signalling in drug addiction has not been translated into clinically relevant applications due to the lack of drugs with low toxicity and an ability to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier. Here, we report on two new cell-penetrating peptides able to attenuate the activation of this signalling cascade in response to cocaine. We further demonstrate that these two peptides prevent the formation of drug-associated memories in the CPP. We also demonstrate that PD325901, a potent MEK inhibitor already in clinical trials for cancer, was able to penetrate the brain and efficiently block Ras-ERK activation. Furthermore, a single in vivo administration of PD325901 persistently blocked a CPP response and significantly accelerated the extinction of cue-induced responding following cocaine self-administration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two novel cell-penetrating peptides inhibit the ERK signalling pathway</title><p>Cell-penetrating peptides have been shown to hold good promise for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular for their generally low toxicity and tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramsey and Flynn, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raucher and Ryu, 2015</xref>). Despite their potency is typically in the micromolar range, their ability to partially disrupt protein–protein interactions instead of blocking the enzymatic activity is also a potential advantage. In addition, cell-penetrating peptides dissolve easily in water solutions and do not require organic solvents, a major complication in the formulation of many small therapeutic molecules, including the more potent PD325901.</p><p>Bearing in mind these observations, we have designed and generated two active cell-penetrating peptides, based on protein-protein interaction sequences found in Ras-ERK components, able to attenuate the activation of this signalling cascade in vivo. The first peptide, hereafter referred to as RB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), was designed around the 59–73 portion, the KIM sequence, of the ERK1/2 specific phosphatase MKP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). The KIM sequence is responsible for the interaction with the common docking (CD) domain of ERK1/2. The second peptide, hereafter referred to as RB3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), was designed with the support of molecular graphics tools, taking advantage of the published crystal structure of a ternary Ras:SOS:Ras*GDP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sondermann et al., 2004</xref>), compared to the crystal structure of the CDC25 domain of Ras-GRF1, a neuronal specific Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Ras-GEF). The peptide sequence (1173–1203 portion of the CDC25 domain) includes an α-helix crucial for the GTP exchange activity on RAS proteins. To allow these peptides to cross cellular membranes and the blood-brain barrier, we added to their sequences a portion of the HIV TAT protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gump and Dowdy, 2007</xref>), thus generating two distinct cell-penetrating peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Papale et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17111.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular modeling of RB1 and RB3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RB1 peptide (in black) is shown bound to ERK (in red).

On the following day (day 23), both groups of mice were re-exposed to a cocaine conditioning session in the same drug-paired environment to reactivate the drug-related memory acquired during previous training. 24 hr later, another test of preference was given (test 3, day 24). Cocaine re-exposure failed to affect PD325901-treated animals, while in vehicle-treated animals, a robust behavioural response was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We ruled out any possible confounding effect on locomotor functions as a consequence of PD pre-treatment by measuring the distance travelled in the CPP apparatus on day 1 and day 8. No difference among groups was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). As additional confirmation, we monitored the horizontal activity of a different cohort of mice using locomotor activity cages equipped with an automatic infrared movement detector system. The activity was observed starting 30 min after an injection of PD325901 (10 mg/kg) and recorded every 5 min for a total of 6 trials. At the end of this session mice received a cocaine challenge (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and the effect of PD325901 pre-treatment on the hyper-locomotion induced by cocaine was evaluated for 30 min.

In this test we decided to use a mix of the two peptides, to obtain the highest inhibition possible of the Ras-ERK pathway. Mice received either a systemic injection of an RB1/RB3 mix (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or scrambled control 1 hr prior to CPP testing (test 1).

Mice underwent daily 1-hr cocaine self-administration for 7 consecutive days (days 1–7) with no prior lever training. Cocaine (0.50 mg/kg in a 14 µl infusion) delivery was contingent upon pressing on the active lever under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement and paired with the 20 s presentation of a blinking light stimulus (CS), which also served as a timeout period, during which lever presses were not reinforced. Presses on the inactive lever were recorded but had no scheduled consequence. Twenty-four hours following the last cocaine self-administration session, mice were given a single 10-minutes CS-only retrieval session (day 8), preceded 30 min by a vehicle (10 ml/kg) or PD325901 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) injection, during which presses on the active lever were not reinforced, but the CS was presented. Beginning the following day, mice were presented with 10 daily 1-hr extinction sessions (days 9–18), during which presses on the active lever were not reinforced, but the CS was presented, to determine the effect of PD325901 administered during the short retrieval trial on subsequent cue responding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows the timeline of the self-administration protocol. Prior to vehicle or MEK inhibitor treatment on day 8, both groups demonstrated similar acquisition of cocaine self-administration (days 1–7), as demonstrated by a similar number of lever presses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) and number of cocaine reinforcers achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) during 7 daily 1-hr sessions of cocaine SA (0.50 mg/kg/infusion). Furthermore, responding for the CS in the absence of cocaine during the 10-min retrieval trial preceded by vehicle or MEK inhibitor administration on day 8 also did not differ. However, mice pre-treated with PD325901 demonstrated a significant decrease in active lever responding relative to vehicle controls across 10 daily 1-hr CS-only extinction sessions (days 9–18; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>).

PD325901 had no effect on the basal preference or the motivational state of the animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B–C</xref>), and the percentage of time exploring the novel object was significantly higher than the percentage of time exploring the familiar object in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). The discrimination index (DI) of the PD325901 treated group was equivalent to that of the vehicle treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). Furthermore, we calculated also the recognition index (RI), a recently described index that takes into account possible biases due to spatial preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">d'Isa et al., 2014</xref>). While the DI measures the ability to discriminate between two objects presented at a same time point, the RI quantifies the ability to recognize an object across different time points. The RI of the PD325901 treated group was equivalent to that of the vehicle treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F</xref>).

Although knowledge of reward mechanisms has significantly increased in recent decades, there are currently no approved medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence and behavioural treatment has shown limited efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shorter et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Among the potential target candidates, the Ras-ERK signalling pathway holds a unique position. First, it is a well-characterised cascade, highly studied in the context of cancer therapy and in neuroscience. Second, it is selectively activated by cocaine in D1 expressing medium spiny neurons of the striatum, the same cells implicated in the behavioural responses to this drug. Third, its inhibition in the brain leads to blockade of cocaine-mediated responses. Fourth, its implication in both memory consolidation and reconsolidation processes predicts a relevant adjuvant role in the definition of behavioural therapies to treat addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fasano and Brambilla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cerovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pascoli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia-Pardo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To date, the major limitation to a therapeutic approach to treat cocaine dependence based on Ras-ERK inhibition has been related to the lack of suitable, safe drugs, able to efficiently pass the blood-brain barrier. Here, we show an initial characterization of three compounds, two newly designed cell permeable peptides and a small molecule, able to reach the brain, efficiently block ERK activation in response to cocaine and, most importantly, capable of attenuating both Pavlovian and operant responding in response to cocaine in mice.</p><p>PD325901 is a highly selective allosteric MEK1/2 inhibitor that does not compete with ATP or ERK1/2. It is a particularly appealing drug since it shows a high potency with a low IC50 in vivo. Moreover, compared to its predecessor CI-1040, PD325901 exhibits a greater solubility, leading to improved bioavailability and metabolic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uehling and Harris, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu and Park, 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, PD325901 has demonstrated potent anticancer activity both in vitro, by inhibiting tumour cell proliferation, and in vivo, by suppressing tumour growth in a broad spectrum of xenograft models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Solit et al., 2006</xref>). Based on these promising preclinical studies, PD325901 has been subsequently advanced into clinical trials. The effectiveness of PD325901 in patients has been evaluated in a Phase I/II trial for the treatment of colon cancer, breast cancer and melanoma (NCT00147550, Pfizer), in a Phase II study for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NCT00174369, Pfizer), and in another Phase II study in one previously-treated patient with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NCT02297802, Sharp Healthcare). In addition, several combination therapies using PD325901 have been evaluated in order to expand its clinical application (NCT01347866, Pfizer; Phase I, NCT02022982, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute; Phase I/II, NCT02039336, The Netherlands Cancer Institute; Phase I, NCT02510001, University of Oxford; NCT020096471, University of Alabama at Birmingham).</p><p>Notably, the first completed analysis of a phase II study of PD325901 for cancer therapy showed some neurological adverse effects, including most commonly visual disturbances, but also dizziness, hallucinations, and balance and gait disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">LoRusso et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we speculate that these early clinical observations indirectly confirm the ability of PD325901 to penetrate the human brain and exert its anti Ras-ERK activity. Although the toxicity issue is of unquestionable relevance, the protocol used in clinical trials for cancer therapy consisted of repeated and intermittent oral administrations of the compound. In contrast, with our protocol we demonstrated a remarkable inhibitory effect on both CPP and SA with a single administration, suggesting that such a treatment in humans should not cause major complications. Importantly, the ability of a single dose of PD325901 to accelerate the extinction of cocaine self-administration is obviously a key finding, which for the first time supports the idea that a systemic Ras-ERK inhibition may lead to a significant reduction in behaviours mediated by cocaine-cue associations. Obviously, it remains to be seen whether such an effect could be replicated in patients and whether a single dose/behavioural treatment would be sufficient to block relapse. One important concern related to future clinical developments is the potential side effects of PD325901 on memory mechanisms. Indeed, our own data indicate that this drug may cause memory dysfunctions both during the acquisition and the retrieval phases, but at doses that are significantly higher (25 mg/kg) than those used in cancer therapy and in our cocaine experiments. Importantly, the fact that we propose here to administer only one or a few doses of PD325901 at 10 mg/kg to treat cocaine addiction should be reassuring since such protocols are unlikely to cause permanent memory impairments. In addition, we would like to note that in our cocaine behavioural paradigms we used a dose which is far above the minimal (2.5 mg/kg) effective one in blocking ERK phosphorylation and thus it is likely that doses lower than 10 mg/kg could still be of therapeutic value.</p><p>A comparison with the only blood-brain barrier penetrating Ras-ERK inhibitor previously available, SL327, indicates that PD325901 may offer some significant advantages. It is a classical MEK inhibitor, and in that sense its action may be qualitatively similar to SL327, nevertheless it is much more potent (almost three orders of magnitude). Furthermore, in contrast to PD325901, SL327 at the dose necessary to completely block ERK phosphorylation (50 mg/kg) and commonly used in several behavioural paradigms, showed significant detrimental consequences on locomotion, suggesting potential off target effects that should be further evaluated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Valjent et al., 2006b</xref>). Most importantly, PD325901 has already been demonstrated to manifest an acceptable toxicity in humans and thus could be rapidly repositioned for the treatment of cocaine addiction.</p><p>Similarly, the two RB1 and RB3 peptides interfered with the expression of cocaine-induced place preference, albeit to a lesser extent. These findings suggest that these peptides are also capable of inhibiting cocaine-mediated responses. Considering that several other cell-penetrating peptides are already in clinical trials for various conditions, including neurological disorders, our peptides may be in the near future further validated for clinical purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mehta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warso et al., 2013</xref>). Also, in comparison to SL327, these peptides may offer some advantages. While RB1 and RB3 show an IC50 toward ERK comparable to SL327, they posses an excellent water solubility (SL327 is dissolved in organic solvents) and potentially lower toxicity. In addition, RB1 and RB3 act on different Ras-ERK components (ERK1/2- and Ras- interacting partners, respectively) than SL327, thus expanding the portfolio of potential targets.</p><p>Finally, beyond the field of drug addiction, these drugs may also be relevant for the experimental treatment of other brain disorders, most notably a class of neurodevelopmental disorders collectively named RASopathies, which are characterised by activating mutations in the Ras pathway. Indeed, it has been shown that the use of Ras-ERK inhibitors can reverse some of the associated symptoms in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Papale et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, further development of the tools outlined here may not only facilitate the investigation of the neurobiological bases of drug addiction, but may possibly lead to the development of pharmacotherapies for the treatment of other neuropsychiatric conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and drugs</title><p>Male C57Bl/6 mice (Charles River) were single-housed in a temperature-controlled (21°C) environment maintained on a 12-hr light-dark cycle (lights on at 7 a.m.).

Briefly, CPP was performed in a three-chamber apparatus containing two large compartments with distinct patterns on the floors and walls, separated by a central neutral area. During the pre-conditioning phase, mice were allowed 18 min free access to the apparatus. Only mice that spent less than 75% of their time in any one compartment were included in the study. During the conditioning phase (days 2–7), mice were confined to one compartment for 20 min after an injection of cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 2, 4, and 6, or to the other compartment after a saline injection on days 3, 5, and 7. Saline-treated mice received six pairings of saline. One hour prior to the conditioning test (day 8, test 1), mice were treated with vehicle or inhibitors (PD325901, 10 mg/kg, RB1/RB3 mix, 20 mg/kg or Trametinib, 10 mg/kg) and then allowed 18 min free access to the apparatus. A place preference score was calculated for each mouse as the difference between pre-conditioning and post-conditioning time spent in the drug-paired compartment. After 2 weeks (day 22, test 2), mice were retested in the CPP apparatus in a drug-free state. The day following test 2 (day 23), mice underwent one conditioning session (20 min) in the CPP apparatus immediately after cocaine or saline injection (20 mg/kg, i.p.). CPP was tested the following day (day 24, test 3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Novel object recognition (NOR)</title><p>The novel object recognition (NOR) test was performed in a square arena of 40 × 40 cm. On day 1, mice were first allowed to habituate to the testing arena in a 5 min session. Thigmotaxis (i.e. the percentage of time spent near the walls) was measured as an index of anxiety by analysing the visual recording made with a video camera. On day 2, animals underwent the training phase (10 min), in which two identical objects were introduced into the arena before allowing the mouse to explore. The amount of time that the rodents spent exploring each object was scored. Finally, on day 3, mice were tested for their 24 hr memory (10 min). The discrimination index (DI), defined as the difference between the exploration time for the novel object and the one for the familiar object, divided by total exploration time, was calculated. The recognition index (RI) measures the ability of an animal to recognise a same object at different time points and it is based on the fact that if an animal maintains the memory of the previously encountered familiar object, its percentage of exploration for that object will decrease when the animal is exposed to the same object for a second time. RI was computed as follows: [(percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the training) – (percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the test)] / percentage of exploration of the undisplaced familiar object during the training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">d'Isa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Two doses of PD325901, 10 and 25 mg/kg were given either at day 2 to interfere with the acquisition process of recognition memory or at day 3 to perturb the retrieval of that memory.</p><p>The sessions were recorded with the video tracking software SMART (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Inhibitory avoidance</title><p>The apparatus was divided into two compartments: a larger one made of white Plexiglas, kept strongly illuminated and fitted at one end with a guillotine door, and a smaller one made of black Plexiglas (Panlab, Barcelona, Spain). A floor grid placed in the dark chamber received electrical current. On the training day each mouse was placed in the lit compartment, facing away from the dark compartment. Mice show a natural tendency to leave a well-lit chamber for a darkened one, and they do so after a short latency. When a mouse entered the dark compartment with all four paws 1 footshock (0.2 mA x 2”) was delivered. The time spent in the lit side (step-through latency) 24 hr later is the measure of ‘inhibitory avoidance’. A maximum step-through latency of 360 s was allowed in the test session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambilla et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Two doses of PD325901, 10 and 25 mg/kg, were given either at day 1 after training to interfere with the consolidation of fear memory or at day 2 to perturb the retrieval of that memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Locomotor activity</title><p>Horizontal activity was recorded in locomotor activity boxes equipped with photocell beams (Ugo Basile, Comerio, Italy) during a single session starting 30 min after PD325901 injection (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and recorded every 5 min for a total of 6 trials. At the end of this session mice received a cocaine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) challenge and the effect of PD325901 pre-treatment on the hyper-locomotion induced by cocaine was evaluated for the subsequent 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fasano et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cocaine self-administration (SA)</title><p>SA was assessed in 12 operant chambers (Med Associates, USA) housed in light- and sound-attenuating cubicles.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Claes Wahlestedt (Reviewer #3), and a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study provides interesting information concerning the potential clinical use of drugs acting as inhibitors of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) cascade for brain diseases including cocaine addiction. Extensive published work already indicates the critical role played by ERK in a multitude of physio-pathological processes, including learning, memory and drug addiction. One MEK inhibitor, PD325901, is already in clinical trials for cancer, thus it has potential be used as a treatment for brain disorders in humans. The idea of utilizing systemically administrable ERK inhibitors to reverse addictive-like behaviors is intriguing, and here the authors test two brain-penetrating peptides and a small molecule compound, which they show inhibit ERK signalling in the brain and reduce cocaine conditioned place preference. Most importantly they report that a single dose of PD325901 enhances extinction of drug seeking in a self-administration procedure that is highly relevant as a clinical model.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers have two major concerns, which we consider addressable in the context of the current study.</p><p>1) It is essential to provide control experiments that test whether a single dose of PD325901 in the context of the cocaine studies is associated with a general cognitive deterioration and/or general effects on locomotor function. Such non-specific effects on learning and memory or task performance would diminish the utility of PD325901 for clinical purposes. These cognitive data could be provided using a relatively simple paradigm (e.g. novel object recognition, passive avoidance, fear conditioning, conditioned place aversion) so long as it would reveal whether the MAPK-blocking drug treatments used in this study selectively attenuate drug-related memories or generally inhibit all learning and memory once given. In addition, since the authors show that three compounds that act as MEK inhibitors – Trametinib, Selumetinib, and Dabrafenib – do not reduce ERK phosphorylation in the brain, it would be appropriate to test at least one of them as a negative control in one behavioral test (e.g. CPP).</p><p>2) The authors need to improve and expand their discussion of the comparison of the drugs developed in this study (PD325901 and RB1/3) versus SL327 in the realm of neurological disorders. The primary difference between PD325901 and SL327 is the lower IC50 of the first. Though SL327 has not been tested in clinical trials it is used in experimental models at high doses thus the main conceptual difference between PD325901 and SL327 is of quantitative, rather than qualitative in nature. Especially since this manuscript does not explore mechanisms of the behavioral actions of ERK inhibition measured in this study, this discussion should comment on the possible differences, or lack of differences, with regard to the mechanisms of action of the two drugs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17111.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>1) It is essential to provide control experiments that test whether a single dose of PD325901 in the context of the cocaine studies is associated with a general cognitive deterioration and/or general effects on locomotor function.

It is well known that inhibition of ERK signalling in a number of behavioural paradigm leads to cognitive impairments and this fact may reduce the clinical relevance of Ras-ERK inhibitors for treating addiction.</p><p>We have addressed the specific issues of the potential memory and locomotor impairments as follows:</p><p>1) We have analysed the distance travelled in the place preference apparatus during the pre-conditioning phase at day 1 and test session at day 8, i.e. 1 hour after PD injection and we have found a clear habituation effect to the apparatus with no difference in locomotion among groups (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>2) We have also included a study of locomotor function using the locomotor activity cages (equipped with infrared movement detector system), upon administration of a single dose of PD325901 (10 mg). We monitored PD325901 effects before and after a cocaine challenge for 1-hour time interval and we confirmed that at this dose no detrimental effects on locomotion can be detected (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>3) We have now provided compelling evidence that our selected dose of PD, i.e. 10 mg/kg, has no adverse consequences on memory performance in the Novel Object Recognition (NOR). Specifically, we applied two doses of PD325901 (10 and 25 mg/kg) in two distinct phases of the behavioural test, the acquisition and the retrieval processes, and we found that only the higher dose partially perturbed them. As an additional control on motor function, both doses did not influence the exploration of the objects in the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>).</p><p>4) We have added another behavioural paradigm, the inhibitory avoidance, to verify any possible confounding memory effect in response to PD injection in an aversive condition. Two doses of PD325901 (10 and 25 mg/kg) were applied during consolidation and retrieval processes, and also in this case only the higher dose did disrupt fear memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>).</p><p>5) We have tested Trametinib, a MEK inhibitor that does not pass the blood brain barrier, in the conditioned place preference, for comparison with the PD325901. As expected, Trametinib at 10 mg/kg, the same dose used for PD325901, did not reduce the rewarding properties of cocaine in CPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The new experimental evidence with NOR and Inhibitory avoidance tests strengthen our hypothesis that this potent MEK inhibitor is much more selective for the drug-related memories and does not compromise the general brain function at least at 10 mg/kg. We have obviously discussed the potential side effects at higher doses, highlighting the fact that our therapeutic approach is unlikely to cause permanent memory deficits since it only requires a single dose treatment.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors need to improve and expand their discussion of the comparison of the drugs developed in this study (PD325901 and RB1/3) versus SL327 in the realm of neurological disorders.
