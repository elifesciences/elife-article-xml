lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) deficiency. Small fiber pathology and pain are major FD symptoms of unknown pathophysiology. α-GAL deficient mice (GLA KO) age-dependently accumulate globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons paralleled by endoplasmic stress and apoptosis as contributors to skin denervation. Old GLA KO mice show increased TRPV1 protein in DRG neurons and heat hypersensitivity upon i.pl. capsaicin. In turn, GLA KO mice are protected from heat and mechanical hypersensitivity in neuropathic and inflammatory pain models based on reduced neuronal I<sub>h</sub> and Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents. We show that in vitro α-GAL silencing increases intracellular Gb3 accumulation paralleled by loss of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents, which is reversed by incubation with agalsidase-α and lucerastat. We provide first evidence of a direct Gb3 effect on neuronal integrity and ion channel function as potential mechanism underlying pain and small fiber pathology in FD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39300.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fabry disease is a life-threatening disorder that runs in families and affects many parts of the body. Symptoms begin in early childhood, often with episodes of burning pain in the hands and feet. As patients with Fabry disease grow older, sensory nerve fibers in their skin start to break down. As a result, affected individuals may often struggle to detect heat or cold against their skin.</p><p>Mutations in a gene called alpha-galactosidase A cause Fabry disease. These mutations prevent the alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-GAL) enzyme from working properly. This enzyme breaks down fatty substances in the cells, in particular a molecule named globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). In patients with Fabry disease, Gb3 accumulates inside cells and is thought to cause pain, reduced temperature sensitivity, and loss of nerve fibers in the skin. But how it does this is still unclear.</p><p>To find out more, Hofmann et al. studied mutant mice with a disrupted alpha-GAL gene, which consequently lack enzyme activity. Like patients, the mice accumulate Gb3 inside their sensory nerve cells as they age. This build-up of Gb3 damages the cells and reduces the function of ion channels (passages for charged ions to enter and leave a cell) in their membranes. This may contribute to the loss of nerve fibers and the reduced cold-warm sensitivity in Fabry patients.</p><p>However, one particular ion channel is more abundant in elderly mutant mice than in normal animals. This channel, called TRPV1, responds to high temperatures and also to capsaicin, the chemical that makes chilli peppers hot. Hofmann et al. propose that the accumulation Gb3 may be linked to the excessive activation of TRPV1 in the sensory nerve cells of patients with Fabry disease. This may in turn contribute to the heat-induced pain.</p><p>By providing insights into the mechanisms underlying some of the symptoms of Fabry disease, these findings will assist researchers to develop new treatments. They will also be useful for clinicians who manage patients with the disorder. Further studies should investigate the exact cellular mechanisms linking Gb3 accumulation with changes in cellular activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Fabry disease</kwd><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>alpha-galactosidase A</kwd><kwd>globotriaosylceramide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009379</institution-id><institution>Interdisziplinäres Zentrum für Klinische Forschung, Universitätsklinikum Würzburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N-260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wischmeyer</surname><given-names>Erhard</given-names></name><name><surname>Üçeyler</surname><given-names>Nurcan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UE 171-5/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Üçeyler</surname><given-names>Nurcan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Globotriaosylcermide directly impacts neuronal integrity and ion channel function as potential mechanism underlying small fiber pathology in Fabry disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Thermal hyposensitivity and pain based on small nerve fiber pathology are cardinal neurological symptoms of the progressive and life-threatening X-linked Fabry disease (FD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zarate and Hopkin, 2008</xref>).

We assessed Gb3 deposits in DRG of young and old GLA KO mice and show age-dependent intra- but also extra-cellular Gb3 accumulation challenging the concept of exclusive lysosomal storage. We hypothesize that exceeding compensation limits, Gb3 deposits might break loose from lysosomes getting into contact with other organelles and cellular structures. Alternatively, Gb3 may be produced and secreted by surrounding non-neuronal cells. This may underlie Gb3 associated cellular stress and apoptosis as shown for example in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chimenti et al., 2015</xref>), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Francesco et al., 2011</xref>) or endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shen et al., 2008</xref>) of patients with FD. Endoplasmic stress, as found in DRG neurons of old GLA KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is a major trigger of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), which may be the basis of Gb3-dependent skin denervation as a hallmark of FD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maag et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Üçeyler et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, DRG neurons of old GLA KO mice also displayed increased caspase three activity and decreased neurite outgrowth as markers of apoptosis. Increased caspase three activity is associated with cellular vulnerability and apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartmann et al., 2000</xref>) and is involved in DNA breakdown and morphological changes during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jänicke et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Alterations of neuronal ion channel expression and function have long been assumed to be potential contributors to sensory impairment and pain in FD. Higher nociceptor TRPV1 expression was reported in young GLA KO mice compared to WT mice with a mild and transient increase in TRPV1 currents of DRG neurons upon high-dose capsaicin treatment in vitro and heat intolerance in the hot plate test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lakomá et al., 2016</xref>). We recently showed heat hypersensitivity in naïve young GLA KO mice also in the Hargreaves test, which turned to hyposensitivity with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Üçeyler et al., 2016</xref>). Adding to this evidence, we here report on higher TRPV1 protein immunoreactivity in DRG neurons of young and old GLA KO mice compared to WT littermates without changes in gene expression and show that old GLA KO mice develop sustained heat hypersensitivity when treated with capsaicin. Thus, increased neuronal TRPV1 protein immunoreactivity may contribute to heat hypersensitivity in naïve young GLA KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lakomá et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Üçeyler et al., 2016</xref>) and may turn to heat hyposensitivity with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Üçeyler et al., 2016</xref>) due to stress-induced degeneration of peripheral afferents. However, challenging the system by capsaicin may still induce heat hypersensitivity despite skin denervation due to the high expression of neuronal TRPV1 channels as shown for old GLA KO mice here. It remains unclear though, if the increase in TRPV1 protein immunoreactivity and the capsaicin-induced heat hypersensitivity is also associated with neuronal TRPV1 channel dysfunction. It is of note that acute heat sensitivity is based on three different transient receptor potential channels indicating high redundancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vandewauw et al., 2018</xref>). A recent study investigating a rat model of FD provided evidence for TRPA1 dependent mechanical but not thermal hypersensitivity in a Fabry rat model without differences in TRPV1 currents in young rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). In line with these results, current properties of TRPV1 did not differ between young GLA KO and WT mice in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Extensive patch-clamp analysis of neurons obtained from old mice did not reveal capsaicin induced currents at all. Since TRPV1 currents upon capsaicin stimulation were also absent in old littermate WT and C57BL/6N mice, we assume this to be a physiological age-dependent finding.</p><p>All four HCN channel isoforms are expressed in DRG neurons and contribute to neuronal excitability and generation of action potential rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biel et al., 2009</xref>). Since the first description of HCN2 as a pacemaker channel under inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emery et al., 2011</xref>), several studies were performed confirming and extending these data and mainly showing heat and mechanical hypersensitivity upon HCN2 channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herrmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnorr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsantoulas et al., 2017</xref>). We confirm previous findings of an age-dependent increase of DRG neuron HCN2 protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hou et al., 2015</xref>) independent of genotypes. Despite this increase, old GLA KO mice showed a marked decrease of I<sub>h</sub> currents when compared with WT littermates. A converse relation between protein expression and I<sub>h</sub> current density was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chaplan et al., 2003</xref>). The underlying mechanism of this discrepancy remains unclear. One possibility is that despite an increase of the HCN2 isoform, other HCN channels might be downregulated resulting in low overall I<sub>h</sub> currents. Although our behavioral data mimicking findings in HCN2 conditional knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emery et al., 2011</xref>) suggest that HCN2 may be the underlying major channel, we cannot rule out the contribution of other HCN isoforms lacking an HCN2 specific blocker. Furthermore, I<sub>h</sub> currents are mixed and mainly based on sodium and potassium flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biel et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, the reduction in sodium current densities as shown in our study may also cross-contribute to the observed drop in I<sub>h</sub> current densities in old GLA KO mice.</p><p>Voltage-gated sodium channels are key contributors to small fiber associated pain syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Waxman et al., 2014</xref>), however, data on sodium channel expression and functionality in GLA KO mice are scarce. In one study, young GLA KO mice displayed increased expression of skin Na<sub>v</sub>1.8 protein, while Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 expression did not differ between genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lakomá et al., 2014</xref>). In another study not reporting the age of experimental animals, a generally decreased conductance of sodium currents was described in DRG neurons of GLA KO compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Namer et al., 2017</xref>). In a recent study investigating potential gene expression signatures in DRG of GLA KO mice a slight downregulation of sodium channel protein type seven subunit alpha was reported compared to WT mice as the only finding in sodium channel genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kummer et al., 2017</xref>). While we did not find differences in the gene and protein expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 in DRG neurons comparing GLA KO and WT mice, we provide first evidence for the age-dependent dampening of neuronal Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents in old GLA KO mice. Most intriguingly, this reduction of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents was reproducible in vitro by silencing α-GAL in HEK cells and was reversed by treatment of HEK cells with the Fabry-specific drug used as enzyme replacement therapy in Fabry patients, agalsidase-α and a new Gb3 synthase inhibitor lucerastat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), pointing to a functional effect of Gb3 on Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels.</p><p>We provide first evidence for a direct link between intracellular Gb3 deposits and neuronal ion channel dysfunction as the potential basis of Fabry associated sensory symptoms and signs. The question remains about the exact mechanism underlying Gb3 mediated channel dysfunction. One possibility is the direct interaction of extra-lysosomal Gb3 with membrane structures such as lipid rafts anchoring ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schnaar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sural-Fehr and Bongarzone, 2016</xref>). Disturbance of cell membrane homeostasis by intracellular Gb3 deposits may alter channel function independent of gene or protein expression. Another question is, if and how changes in functionality of one channel family may influence other neuronal ion channels and if cross-communication may underlie some of the effects observed here. We can also not rule out the effect of further ion channels such as potassium or calcium that have been reported to be potentially affected by Gb3 in different experimental settings. For instance, calcium dependent potassium channel type 3.1 was age-dependently reduced in aortic endothelial cells of GLA KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park et al., 2011</xref>). In turn, Gb3 enhanced voltage-gated calcium currents of sensory DRG neurons in vitro and led to mechanical allodynia after intraplantar injection in WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choi et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, intracellular Gb3 deposits may exert effects on membrane ion channels in general and disturb their functional composition leading to sensory symptoms and pain.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data give first evidence for the involvement of neuronal Gb3 deposits in the pathophysiology of skin denervation and a direct and major role in sensory impairment, and pain of patients with FD. The exact mechanisms, however, remain to be elucidated, we show that neuronal Gb3 deposits result in an overall reduction of ion channel current densities and provide a HEK cell based in vitro model as a potent tool for further pathophysiological research and pharmaceutical testing of new Fabry-specific drugs. Gb3 influences neuronal function and integrity, thus, a sustained normalization of intracellular Gb3 load by drugs providing permanently low Gb3 levels without recurrent end-of-dose peaks is crucial which may be achieved with new pharmaceutical formulations. Our study also underscores the importance of investigating further neuronal ion channels like Na<sub>v</sub> and HCN isotypes and of studies in other organ systems, such as the heart and kidneys, to better understand the effect of Gb3 on for example cardiomyocytes in the generation of lethal arrhythmias. We believe that such approaches will open new avenues for mechanism-based diagnostics and treatment options for patients suffering from the life threatening FD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and study groups</title><p>Our study was approved by the Bavarian State authorities (Regierung von Unterfranken, # 54/12).

They were fed standard chow (commercially prepared complete diet) and had food and water access ad libitum.</p><p>We used 95 GLA KO mice (45 male, 50 female) of mixed genetic background (C57BL6 and SVJ129) carrying a targeted disruption of the α-galactosidase A gene (<italic>GLA</italic>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ohshima et al., 1997</xref>). Additionally, 96 WT littermate mice (45 male, 51 female) were assessed. To ensure that our KO and WT mice have an identical genetic background, we first crossed GLA KO mice with C57BL6/N mice to generate heterozygous off-springs. These heterozygous mice were then cross-bred with each other to obtain homozygous female and male GLA KO and WT mice. In the further course of breeding, we mated these two homozygous lines only with genetically matching mice (KO x KO, WT x WT) of the respective strain. Thus, we generated two mouse strains (homozygous GLA KO and WT) with an identical genetic background. To maintain the purity of these strains, we performed genotype analysis on every single mouse born in our animal facility. For genotyping, we used the Kapa2G fast PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, USA) and the following primers: oIMR5947, AGGTCCACAGCAAAGGATTG; oIMR5948, GCAAGTTGCCCTCTGACTTC; oIMR7415, GCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAG. Since FD shows age-dependent progression, we investigated young (3 months) and old (≥12 months) mice; old mice reached an age of up to 24 months.

The Fabry mouse they used are those obtained from NIH and we know they are on a mixed background typically 75% C57BL6 and 25% SVJ129 while the WT are &quot;pure&quot; C57BL6 they generated from female KO something that is very unclear. We are not told that they backcrossed the KO mouse for 10-11 generations into C57BL6 mice to obtain a pure strain. One cannot over-emphasize the critical importance of having identical genetic background in WT and controls. We know that there is a difference in the severity of &quot;disease expression&quot; between the two. Therefore, the authors have to prove to us that this is identical genetic background and if it is not, the results in this paper are not valid. There are numerous examples of papers with false conclusions including in the Fabry field Rozenfeld et al., 2011 that wrongly concluded that cardiac mass in Fabry mouse is significantly lower than wild type mouse. For an overview of this problem see: https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2006/june/the-importance-of-genetic-background-in-mouse-based-biomedical-research</p><p>2) A second major and basic methodological problem is that we are not told what sex of mouse they use in any of the experiments/figures. They seem to lump together males (presumed hemizygous) and females of unknown genotype – heterozygous or homozygous. The difference would be absolute huge between the heterozygous or homozygous females. The former are not likely to show any abnormality. In general they don't pay attention to the sex of the mouse either WT or KO, which is a big problem.</p><p>3) It is important to demonstrate that males and homozygote females are indeed the same. They need to clearly emphasize that these are homozygote females.</p><p>4) Use the term 'sex' not 'gender'</p><p>5) Figure 6 experiment is not convincing. shRNA Gb3 staining looks not materially different from shRNA. So it is not demonstrated that Gb3 elevation is responsible for the decrease in current. There should be a more direct demonstration that reduction in Gb3, for example using GZ-161 (inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase) reverses these current abnormalities.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Fabry is a rare serious X-linked lysosomal storage disorder in which loss or reduction of activity of by α-22 galactosidase A deficiency damages the central and peripheral nervous systems, heart, and kidneys associated with accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in lysosomes. Genetic testing, animal models, and enzyme replacement therapy are available.</p><p>The small-fiber peripheral neurons are among the first cells affected in Fabry, particularly the Aδ thinly myelinated nociceptive fibers, and the first symptoms of Fabry, even in childhood, with widespread neuropathic pain and hypohydrosis. Pain can flare when patients become hot.</p><p>It has been previously established that α-GAL knock-out mice (GLA-KO) accumulate globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Here the authors compared young and old WT and KO mice to test whether and how Gb3 accumulation might cause neuropathic pain symptoms and signs by studying 3 of the major ion channels that contribute to action potentials in nociceptive neurons, the TRPV1, HCN2, and Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels.</p><p>This manuscript documents elegant and exhaustive pathological, electrophysiological and behavioral studies that were well controlled and with appropriate data analysis and interpretation. They showed pathologically that in KO mice, Gb3 accumulates within and around the cell bodies of sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia in an age-dependent manner and that distal axons of these neurons become progressively depleted in the skin they innervate. The function of TRPV1 did not appear affected, as recordings from cultured DRG neurons from old and young KO and WT mice did not show changes in TRPV1 currents. In contrast, studying the HCN2 pacemaker ion channel, showed behavioral and patch-clamp evidence of loss of HCN2 function in older KO mice and investigating Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 showed reduced Na current densities only in older KO mice with associated changes in pain behaviors, including in standard experimental models of neuropathic pain. Lastly the author used RNA interference to silence α-GAL in HEK cells expressing Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 and showed that this reduced sodium currents, and that enzyme replacement alleviated this decrease.</p><p>Although these studies don't clarify the exact mechanisms of how Gb3 affects Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels, nor do they clarify if other not-studied ion channels are affected, they highlight the importance of Gb3 and how it damages sensory neurons and their functions. In addition to learning more about these channels, their work raises the question of whether Fabry symptoms and damage might also be improved by pharmacological efforts to reduce Gb3. Enzyme replacement therapy is not universally available, nor continuously active with periodic dosing. Expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 is largely restricted to sensory and sympathetic neurons, but studying other ion channels, particularly other more widely expressed Na<sub>V</sub> isoforms should be conducted in the other Fabry-affected organs. Both the kidney and heart rely extensively on ion channels as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript contains novel and interesting data. At present, the data does not unequivocally support the conclusions and additional data are required.</p><p>Methods</p><p>The authors should provide details of DRG culture medium composition, particularly glucose content, given that excess glucose can modify TRPV1 expression and function in vitro and in vivo. It is important to appreciate whether these studies were performed at glucose levels consistent with prior in vivo environment or during a period of acute hyperglycemic exposure.</p><p>Data</p><p>Figure 1: It is important to know location of Gb3 in cross sections of nerve trunk and in skin, not just DRG, particularly given reports of extracellular Gb3 in skin of patients with Fabry disease. The present focus on the DRG alone distorts interpretation of the data. Tissue appears to be available (see Figure 2).</p><p>Figure 3: The authors should determine whether the increase in TRPV1 +ve cell bodies occur across all sizes – image 3E appears to illustrate novel expression in relatively large cell bodies. This is important to the authors attempts to directly associate DRG TRPV1 expression with specific pain modalities and can be accomplished on the same tissue sections used to generate the images presented in Figure 3B-E.</p><p>Figure 3G-H: The authors attempts to causally link accumulation of Gb3 in sensory neuron cell bodies with apoptosis and loss of axonal projections can be addressed in these DRG neuron cultures by reporting total cell survival rates, apoptotic markers and neurite outgrowth between cultures from WT and GLA-KO mice.</p><p>Figure 4J: This graph is interpreted in text as showing post-CCI hyperalgesia in WT mice that is absent in GLA-KO mice, but could equally be interpreted as showing post-CCI loss of sensation in GLA-KO mice vs baseline. The statistical analysis is by Mann-Whitney U test, which only provides an unpaired comparison between the groups at each time point. I am not sure this is valid per se and it also prevents comparison vs baseline within each group. It would be more informative to see a repeat measures analysis vs baseline across time within each group as this would describe whether hyper or hypoalgesia occurred.</p><p>Figure 5G: The curve of old GLA-KO mice looks displaced from the WT curve rather than different, because the baseline was higher for the GLA-KO mice. Calculated as% change from baseline within each group, there may be little difference between groups. More caution may be needed in interpretation of this data set.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39300.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, in the course of your revision, please consider a suggestion that been made to revise the title, which is somewhat trivial.

We paid particular attention and worked very carefully on generating littermate wildtype (WT) mice for our experiments and confirm that we exclusively used mice of identical genetic background. We did not perform our experiments comparing α-galactosidase A knockout (GLA KO) mice with “&quot;pure&quot; C57BL6” mice as assumed by the reviewer. We started our mouse colony with GLA KO mice, as stated and referenced (Ohshima, 1997) in our manuscript. We are aware of the mixed background with C57BL6 and SVJ129 and did not intend to generate GLA KO mice with pure C57BL6 background by multiple back-crossing. To ensure that our KO and WT mice have an identical genetic background, we crossed these GLA KO mice with C57BL6/N mice to first generate heterozygous offspring. These heterozygous mice were then cross-bred with each other to obtain homozygous female and male GLA KO and WT mice. In the further course of breeding, we mated these two homozygous lines only with genetically matching mice (KO x KO, WT x WT) of the respective strain. Thus, we generated two mouse strains (homozygous GLA KO and WT) with an identical genetic background. To maintain the purity of these strains, we performed genotype analysis on every single mouse born in our animal facility. We have included this detailed information in the Materials and methods section of our revised manuscript:</p><p>“We used 95 GLA KO mice (45 male, 50 female) of mixed genetic background (C57BL6 and SVJ129) carrying a targeted disruption of the α-GAL gene as previously described (Ohshima et al., 1997). Additionally, 96 WT littermate mice (45 male, 51 female) were assessed. To ensure that our KO and WT mice have an identical genetic background, we first crossed GLA KO mice with C57BL6/N mice to generate heterozygous off-springs. These heterozygous mice were then cross-bred with each other to obtain homozygous female and male GLA KO and WT mice. In the further course of breeding, we mated these two homozygous lines only with genetically matching mice (KO x KO, WT x WT) of the respective strain. Thus, we generated two mouse strains (homozygous GLA KO and WT) with an identical genetic background. To maintain the purity of these strains, we performed genotype analysis on every single mouse born in our animal facility. For genotyping, we used the Kapa2G fast PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, USA) and the following primers: oIMR5947, AGGTCCACAGCAAAGGATTG; oIMR5948, GCAAGTTGCCCTCTGACTTC; oIMR7415, GCCAGAGGCCACTTGTGTAG.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second major and basic methodological problem is that we are not told what sex of mouse they use in any of the experiments/figures.

The difference would be absolute huge between the heterozygous or homozygous females. The former are not likely to show any abnormality. In general they don't pay attention to the sex of the mouse either WT or KO, which is a big problem.</p></disp-quote><p>Sex differences are indeed crucial and we have paid particular attention to this issue in our GLA KO mouse colony. For this reason, we first performed a separate extensive three-year study assessing young and old (3 to &gt;24 months) male and female GLA KO (89 male, 126 female) and WT littermate mice (80 male, 46 female) of identical genetic background for their age and gender specific development using a broad array of behavioral tests (Üçeyler et al., 2016). We showed that while pain behavior changed with age, there was no difference between male and female mice at any age. This result is not surprising though, since the GLA KO mice used were generated by targeted disruption of the α-galactosidase A (α-GAL) gene, thus both male and female GLA KO mice are complete knockouts with no α-GAL enzyme activity: male mice as hemizygotes and female mice always as homozygotes. The human situation with heterozygote female individuals is thus different to the female GLA KO mouse. This information was already given in our revised manuscript, please see subsection “Mice and study groups”:</p><p>“Animals were not stratified for gender, since in GLA KO mice α-GAL knockout results in a complete loss of enzyme activity in both sexes (i.e. homozygous female mice, hemizygous male mice) with similar pain behavior in contrast to human patients (Lakoma et al., 2014; Lakoma et al., 2016; Rodrigues et al., 2009; Üçeyler et al., 2016).”</p><p>Based on these extensive data (Üçeyler et al. 2016), we here studied both male and female GLA KO and WT mice. The numbers of male and female mice used were already given in the Methods section of our manuscript, please see subsection “Mice and study groups”:</p><p>“We used 95 GLA KO mice (45 male, 50 female) of mixed genetic background (C57BL6 and SVJ129) carrying a targeted disruption of the α-GAL gene as previously described (Ohshima et al., 1997). Additionally, 96 WT mice (45 male, 51 female) were assessed.”</p><p>The respective information was also given in the figure legends of the behavioral</p><p>experiments. We have now also included the sex distribution of all other experimental mice in the respective Figure legends in the revised version of our manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is important to demonstrate that males and homozygote females are indeed the same.

While Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents were normal at baseline, enzyme inhibition led to an increase in cellular Gb3 which we demonstrate immunocytochemically. This increase was paralleled by a drop in Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents. Using agalsidase-α as a specific compound, cellular Gb3 load was decreased and Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents were restored. We believe that this experiment does demonstrate the causal link between cellular Gb3 load and Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents, even though not clarifying the exact mechanism of interaction. We have repeated our experiment and have updated former Figure 6 (now Figure 7) accordingly. We also followed the Reviewer`s suggestion and have performed an additional experiment in our human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cell system using an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase (N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin, i.e. lucerastat, Biomol, cat# Cay19520-1, Hamburg, Germany). In analogy to our results after incubation with agalsidase-α (Figure 7G-I, N), incubation of shRNA treated cells with lucerastat for 24 hours resulted in a marked reduction of intracellular Gb3 paralleled by recovery of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents. We have included this information in the Materials and methods section, Results section and Discussion section of our revised manuscript data are illustrated in the updated Figure 7 (former Figure 6):</p><p>“Gb3 accumulation and reversible reduction of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents in HEK cells after shRNA treatment</p><p>Finally, we investigated if cellular Gb3 accumulation interferes with Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents. […] Electrophysiological analysis of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents in Gb3-positive HEK cells revealed a marked decrease of sodium currents after shRNA treatment compared to control HEK cells (p&lt;0.01, Figure 7J, K), which recovered after agalsidase-α and lucerastat incubation (agalsidase-α: p&lt;0.05; lucerastat: p&lt;0.01, Figure 7N).”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Most intriguingly, this reduction of Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 currents was reproducible in vitro by silencing α-GAL in HEK cells and was reversed by treatment of HEK cells with the Fabry-specific drug used as enzyme replacement therapy in Fabry patients, agalsidase-α and a new Gb3 synthase inhibitor lucerastat (Figure 7), pointing to a functional effect of Gb3 on Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 channels.”</p><p>Materials and methods section:</p><p>“We then treated transfected HEK cells with 1.32 µl (1mg/ml) agalsidase-α (Shire, Saint Helier, UK) and 250 µM lucerastat (N-butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin, Biomol, cat# Cay19520-1, Hamburg, Germany) to investigate, if functional ion channel alteration by Gb3 is reversible. Agalsidase-α is used as biweekly intravenous enzyme replacement therapy to treat patients with FD (Eng et al., 2001). Lucerastat is an inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase and provides a new therapeutic approach for Fabry disease patients (Guerard et al., 2018; Welford et al., 2018). Transfected HEK cells were incubated for 24 hours before patch-clamp analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>[…] Although these studies don't clarify the exact mechanisms of how Gb3 affects</italic> Na<sub>v</sub>1.7 <italic>channels, nor do they clarify if other not-studied ion channels are affected, they highlight the importance of Gb3 and how it damages sensory neurons and their functions.

Murine blood glucose levels are about 8 mM (Klueh et al., 2006). TNB-100 medium is widely used as a standard medium for cultivation of primary neuronal cells (for references see e.g. (de la Roche et al., 2016; Eberhardt et al., 2017a; Obreja et al., 2005; Vetter et al., 2012)) and is not different compared to e.g. Neurobasal Medium (Thermo Fisher, cat# 21103049, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). It is indeed known that hyperglycemia can lead to increased TRPV1 currents (Lam et al., 2018), however, we did not detect any inter-genotype differences (Figure 4K). Furthermore, DRG neurons of both genotypes and age-groups were cultured with the same amount of TNB-100 medium without adding further glucose. For patch clamp analysis, a bath solution with 10 mM glucose was used, which is suitable to measure TRPV1 currents (Eberhardt et al., 2017b). Following the reviewer`s suggestion we have extended the information on DRG culture medium and bath solution composition in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Mouse DRG neurons were dissected and cultivated in culture medium (100 ml TNB-100, Biochrom, cat# F8023; Berlin, Germany, 25 mM glucose; 2 ml PenStrep, Life Technologies, cat# 15140-122; Carlsbad, CA, USA; 100 µl L-glutamine, Life Technologies, cat# 25030-032; Carlsbad, CA, USA; 2 ml protein-lipid-complex, Biochrom, cat# F8820; Berlin, Germany) containing 25 ng/ml nerve growth factor (2.5S, Alomone Labs, cat# N-240; Jerusalem, Israel) according to a previously published protocol (Langeslag et al., 2014).”</p><p>&quot;135 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM glucose, and 5 mM HEPES (Eberhardt et al., 2017b; Hamill et al., 1981).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data</p><p>Figure 1: It is important to know location of Gb3 in cross sections of nerve trunk and in skin, not just DRG, particularly given reports of extracellular Gb3 in skin of patients with Fabry disease.

As in WT mice, we did not find Gb3 deposits in sciatic nerve preparations of old GLA KO mice. Hence, extraneuronal Gb3 deposits seem to be restricted to the very proximal parts of the axons still within the DRG, as we demonstrated in our supplementary Video in the original version of our manuscript. Gb3 was also absent in skin samples of GLA KO and WT mice. We have included these additional experiments in the Materials and methods section and Results section of our revised manuscript and also provide the respective Results in Figure 2F-Q and its legend:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“Furthermore, we assessed whether Gb3 also accumulates in axons of the sciatic nerve and in skin.

We used goat anti-rabbit IgG, and rabbit anti-goat IgG and goat anti-chicken IgG labelled with cyanine 3.18 fluorescent probe (1:50, Amersham; Piscataway, New Jersey, USA) and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rat IgM (1:300; Jackson Laboratory; Bar Habor, Maine, USA) as secondary antibodies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: The authors should determine whether the increase in TRPV1 +ve cell bodies occur across all sizes – image 3E appears to illustrate novel expression in relatively large cell bodies.

We have included this information in the Materials and methods section and Results section of the revised manuscript and also in the revised version of former Figure 3 (now Figure 4) and its legend:</p><p>“We also analyzed the distribution of TRPV1 immunoreactivity across different neuronal sizes and quantified TRPV1 positive neuron diameters; neuron populations were stratified as small (&lt;25 µm in diameter) and large (≥25 µm in diameter) neurons (Figure 4G) (Cesare and McNaughton, 1996; Hoheisel et al., 1994; Lawson et al., 1993). TRPV1 immunoreactivity was mainly observed in small diameter neurons independent of genotype and age.”</p><p>Gb3 deposition leads to an increase in neuronal size, which we had already shown for cultivated neurons of old GLA KO mice in former Figure 4 (now Figure 5) of the original manuscript. For data completion we now also quantified neuronal size in DRG preparations of our mouse cohort. We confirm an increase in cell size as measured by cellular area in young GLA KO compared to young WT mice and in old GLA KO compared to young GLA KO and old WT mice. We have also included these data in the Materials and methods section and Results section of the revised manuscript and in Figure 1 and its legend:</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“First, we examined DRG neuron size by analyzing neuronal area (Figure 1A-D) and found larger DRG neurons in young GLA KO compared to young WT mice (p&lt;0.01; Figure 1E).

Afterwards, cryosections were dehydrated with an ascending ethanol row.

DRG neurons of old GLA KO mice incubated with 500 nM staurosporine as a positive control displayed a higher percentage of caspase 3 positive neurons compared to neurons in the naïve state and WT positive control neurons. Additionally, neurite outgrowth was lower in the GLA KO neurons than in neurons cultured from old WT mice. We have included this information in the Materials and methods section, Results section and Discussion section of the revised manuscript and have also created the new Figure 3 with its legend:</p><p>“Increased apoptosis and decreased neurite outgrowth in cultured DRG neurons of old GLA KO mice</p><p>To investigate the degree of apoptosis in DRG neurons in the course of Gb3 accumulation and potential endoplasmic stress, we performed a NucView 488 Caspase 3 Enzyme Substrate Assay.

I am not sure this is valid per se and it also prevents comparison vs baseline within each group.
