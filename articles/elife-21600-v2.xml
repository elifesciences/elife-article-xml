Monomeric structures of crenactin and actin are similar, although their filament architectures were suggested to be different.

With cryo-electron microscopy and helical reconstruction we solved the structure of the crenactin filament to 3.8 Å resolution. When forming double filaments, the 'hydrophobic plug' loop in crenactin rearranges. Arcadin-2, also encoded by the arcade gene cluster, binds tightly with its C-terminus to the hydrophobic groove of crenactin. Binding is reminiscent of eukaryotic actin modulators such as cofilin and thymosin β4 and arcadin-2 is a depolymeriser of crenactin filaments. Our work further supports the theory of shared ancestry of Eukaryotes and Crenarchaea.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21600.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21600.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic></kwd><kwd>F-actin</kwd><kwd>bacterial cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>Crenarchaea</kwd><kwd>MreB</kwd><kwd>arcade cluster</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105184326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kureisaite-Ciziene</surname><given-names>Danguole</given-names></name><name><surname>McLaughlin</surname><given-names>Stephen H</given-names></name><name><surname>Löwe</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>095514/Z/11/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izoré</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name><name><surname>Löwe</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1379-2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Izoré</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Close evolutionary relationship between eukaryotic F-actin and crenarchaeal crenactin protein is supported by a near-atomic cryoEM structure of double helical filaments, that are inhibited by arcadin-2 through binding to crenactin's hydrophobic groove.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic actin and non-eukaryotic actin-like proteins and their filaments fulfil diverse functions, from cellular motility and plasticity, cellular junctions, cytokinesis and phagocytosis in eukaryotic cells to cell shape maintenance, intracellular organisation and plasmid segregation in bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pilhofer and Jensen, 2013</xref>).</p><p>At the subunit level, all actins and actin-like proteins share a well-conserved three-dimensional structure as well as the longitudinal protofilament contact architecture that facilitates linear polymerisation into strands (protofilaments) and polymerisation-induced ATPase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ozyamak et al., 2013b</xref>). However, largely due to different contacts between strands, actin-like proteins evolved a wide variety of filament architectures. While actin forms right-handed, parallel and staggered filaments in all Eukaryotes (F-actin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von der Ecken et al., 2015</xref>), actin-like proteins differ in their filament architectures: MamK, required for magnetosome alignment in magnetotactic bacteria, forms right-handed filaments that have juxtaposed, non-staggered subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bergeron et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Löwe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ozyamak et al., 2013a</xref>). ParM, making mitosis-like bipolar spindles during <italic>E. coli</italic> R1 plasmid segregation, produces left-handed, staggered filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bharat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gayathri et al., 2012</xref>). MreB, essential for cell-shape maintenance in most rod-shaped bacteria, forms the most divergent filaments when compared to F-actin, as it forms apolar, non-staggered and non-helical filaments that bind directly to membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salje et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>). The selective advantages that led to this diversity are not clear and will require deciphering the precise molecular mechanisms of the processes these filaments engage in.</p><p>Attempts to trace back the origins of today's eukaryotic F-actin filaments led to the discovery of crenactin found in certain organisms of the order Thermoproteales within the phylum Crenarchaeota (Crenarchaea, part of the 'TACK' superphylum) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ettema et al., 2011</xref>). Together with other findings that report unique similarities between organisms of the TACK superphylum and Eukaryotes in cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindås et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Samson et al., 2008</xref>), membrane remodelling, cell shape determination and protein recycling, this has led to a theory of a common origin with eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guy and Ettema, 2011</xref>). Hence, it has been proposed that crenactin filaments share a common ancestor with F-actin.</p><p>In <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic>, crenactin is encoded within the arcade cluster of genes, together with four arcadins, and has been proposed to be part of a cell-shape maintenance system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ettema et al., 2011</xref>).

The similarity of the monomer to eukaryotic actin was unprecedented, with an overall RMSD of 1.6 Å, despite sequence identity of only ~20%. The structure revealed the presence of a feature that resembles the 'hydrophobic plug', which makes inter-protofilament contacts in F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von der Ecken et al., 2015</xref>). The hydrophobic plug is longer in crenactin but is inserted in the same part of the fold as in actin.</p><p>Given these striking similarities between the actin and crenactin monomers, it has been puzzling that crenactin filaments were reported by electron microscopy to form single, rather than double helical, F-actin-like filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present the near-atomic resolution structure of double-stranded crenactin filaments at 3.8 Å by cryoEM, revealing their close relationship to F-actin. In addition, we show that crenactin interacts with two of the arcadins, arcadin-1 and arcadin-2. Arcadin-2 depolymerises crenactin filaments by binding its C-terminus into crenactin's hydrophobic groove, a mode of action related to eukaryotic actin modulators, widening the potential evolutionary links (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Crenactin forms double-helical filaments</title><p>Previous studies on the architecture of crenactin filaments were performed under high salt concentrations (&gt;0.5 M KCl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>) that might not be entirely justified given <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis'</italic> environmental and laboratory growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amo et al., 2002</xref>), although the intracellular osmolarity is currently not known. To exclude the possibility that such high salt concentration might have altered filament architecture, we carried out experiments in low-salt buffer (50 mM ammonium carbonate, 20 mM KCl, see Materials and methods).</p><p>We imaged filaments by cryo-electron microscopy using a 300 kV FEG microscope coupled to a direct electron detector. A total of 1474 micrographs showing long and highly contrasted filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were collected under low-dose conditions with dose fractionation. From these we extracted 470,396 helical segments and performed reference-free 2D class averaging in RELION 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scheres, 2012</xref>). The resulting classes showed a very regular pattern that was much more similar to the calculated re-projection of double-stranded F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von der Ecken et al., 2015</xref>) than to that of single-stranded crenactin filaments from crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindås et al., 2014</xref>). To eliminate any bias from enforcing double helical symmetry during reconstruction in RELION (using an implementation of iterative helical real space reconstruction, IHRSR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egelman, 2007</xref>), we reconstructed the data into 3D using two different procedures. The first reconstruction was calculated using a double-stranded filament as the initial model and with symmetry that averages the two strands together (twist: 198.1° [equivalent to −161.9°], rise: 25.6 Å), whereas the second reconstruction was performed with a single-stranded initial model and helical parameters that symmetrise along one strand only, not averaging the two strands (twist: 36.2°, rise: 51.3 Å). This way, if the imaged filaments had been single-stranded, then the two reconstructions would have produced different results, one potentially double-stranded (and poor) and one single-stranded. We found that both reconstructions generated very similar double-helical density maps, the one with lower symmetry at slightly lower resolution, as would be expected (3.8 Å vs 4.2 Å) because of the smaller number of asymmetric units averaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), thus unequivocally demonstrating the double-stranded nature of the crenactin filaments.</p><p>We then used the 3.8 Å density map to build an atomic model of crenactin in its filament form. For this, we started by placing the previous crystal structure in the cryoEM map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>), and then manually modified and computationally refined the structure, yielding a reliable atomic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) of the crenactin double helical filament at near-atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, Table S1 and Materials and methods).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-21600-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21600.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Crenactin forms F-actin-like double filaments.</title><p>The movie shows the experimental electrostatic potential density obtained from cryoEM and helical reconstruction and a ribbon representation of the refined atomic model of the filament.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21600.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21600.004</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Crenactin double-helical filaments are exceptionally similar to F-actin</title><p>Crenactin forms right-handed, double-stranded, staggered filaments with a rise of 25.6 Å (half a subunits' length, hence staggered) between subunits and a twist of 198.1° (1-start, rotating between the two strands, equivalent to -161.9°) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In crenactin, this loop is longer and encompasses residues 292 to 326 (34 residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>). All previous crenactin structures (two crystal-structures, PDB IDs 4CJ7, 4BQL, and one cryoEM reconstruction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindås et al., 2014</xref>) showed crenactin to be single-stranded and it was proposed that the position of the hydrophobic plug was incompatible with the formation of an F-actin-like double-stranded helix because of steric hindrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our filament structure presented here, we observed a dramatic rearrangement of the hydrophobic plug, moving it upwards, towards subdomain IB, by as much as 21 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom panel). In this new position, the loop interacts extensively with subunits of the opposite strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), essentially the same function as the hydrophobic plug has in F-actin. As in F-actin, most of these lateral interactions are of hydrophilic nature in contrast to its name (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von der Ecken et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to the hydrophobic plug, a hydrophilic interaction between subdomain IIB on one strand and subdomain IA on the opposite strand helps to keep the double filament architecture stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Based on the mostly hydrophilic nature of the inter-strand interactions, we believe it is possible that the single-stranded filaments imaged in previous studies were enabled by the high-salt concentrations used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For longitudinal assembly, crenactin subunits within the same strand are held together via three main areas of interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Particularly significant is the well-conserved D-loop (DNase I binding loop) located within subdomain IB. Folded into a small alpha helix, it interacts with the previous subunit via a surface usually referred to as the 'hydrophobic groove' in actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Although the size of the hydrophobic plug is unique to crenactin, the longitudinal and lateral interactions between neighbouring subunits are similar to an unprecedented extent between crenactin and F-actin. The similarity in actin and crenactin helical parameters is striking, with only a difference of ~2 Å in rise and ~4.5° in twist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, the ATPase active site is also highly conserved with key residues, such as the nucleophilic water activator Q164 (Q137 in actin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwasa et al., 2008</xref>), in the same place in both structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Because crenactin non-polymerising mutants (V339K and E340K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>) were resistant to crystallographic studies, we compared crenactin with one intra-strand contact (hydrophobic groove interacting with subdomain IB/D-loop) impaired by the presence of the arcadin-2 C-terminal peptide (see below) with a crenactin subunit from the double-helical filaments. As has been reported for many actins and actin-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gayathri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>), ATP binding, and more importantly polymerisation, induce inter-domain angle conformational changes, closing the groove between domains IB and IIB and removing a propeller twist of domains I and II against each other upon polymerisation. We also observed this change for crenactin. The rotation flattens the molecule in the polymer, removing the propeller twist between domains I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This motion is conserved in both eukaryotic actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujii et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">von der Ecken et al., 2015</xref>) and its prokaryotic homologues MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van den Ent et al., 2014</xref>) and ParM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gayathri et al., 2012</xref>) and is most likely a pre-requisite of ATPase switching upon longitudinal polymerisation for the entire actin-like protein family.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Crenactin interacts with arcadin-1 and -2 and arcadin-2 sequesters crenactin monomers</title><p>Since eukaryotic actin and its polymerisation are regulated through the action of a multitude of modulator proteins, we hypothesised that crenactin might interact with arcadins as they are encoded within the same arcade cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ettema et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>A sequence alignment of several arcadin-2s revealed that a small conserved C-terminal domain is separated from the core of the protein by a non-conserved, presumably unstructured linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We investigated the effects of arcadin-2 on crenactin filament assembly by using 90° light scattering. Addition of ATP to crenactin resulted in an increase of scattering, most likely because of the formation of filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Subsequent addition of arcadin-2 resulted in rapid depolymerisation of the polymers as scattering diminished. Addition of a C-terminally truncated version of arcadin-2 had no effect, suggesting that the conserved C-terminal α-helix of arcadin-2 was responsible for the depolymerisation of crenactin filaments. To test this, we performed the same experiment using a peptide spanning the last 17 amino acids of arcadin-2 (187–203). Indeed, the peptide triggered depolymerisation of the filaments at a similar rate as full-length arcadin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This effect was confirmed by analytical ultra centrifugation, showing that crenactin becomes monomeric upon addition of the C-terminal arcadin-2 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We conclude that crenactin polymerisation is controlled by arcadin-2 and that arcadin-2's C-terminal helix is essential for this activity.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21600.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Crenactin interacts with arcadin-2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 90° light scattering assay of crenactin polymerisation.

To gain a better understanding of this interaction, how it triggers depolymerisation and how this might be related to F-actin depolymerisation, we solved the crystal structure of crenactin in complex with arcadin-2 C-terminal peptide. The structure was solved to 1.6 Å by X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) providing detailed insights into crenactin, binding to ATP and, more importantly, showing how arcadin-2 induced depolymerisation of the filaments. The arcadin-2 peptide was located in the hydrophobic groove on crenactin, a cavity formed between subdomains IA and IIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dominguez, 2004</xref>). In the filament, this hydrophobic groove is occupied by the D-loop of the following subunit in a strand, forming one half of the longitudinal contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The nanomolar interaction between arcadin-2 peptide and the hydrophobic pocket is likely due to a tryptophan and other hydrophobic residues, making strong contacts as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>. Additional SPR experiments showed that arcadin-2 C-terminal residues formed the only interacting domain with crenactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>).

The arcadin-2 expressing pHis17 plasmid was used as a template to add a stop codon after residue E167 using Q5 site directed mutagenesis (New England Biolabs, Ipswich - Massachusetts). This led to a C-terminally truncated version of arcadin-2 spanning residues 1–167, only (arcadin-2ΔC).

The Vitrobot chamber temperature was set to 4°C and humidity to 100%. Micrographs of crenactin filaments were collected with an FEI Tecnai G2 Polara microscope operating at 300 kV. Data were acquired on a Falcon III direct electron detector protoype at a calibrated pixel size of 1.34 Å and a total dose of 40 e-/Å<sup>2</sup> using the automated acquisition software EPU (FEI). Images were collected at 0.8 to 3.0 µm underfocus and dose-fractionated into 46 movie frames (30 fps). All image processing and helical reconstructions were done using RELION 2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Scheres, 2012</xref>) that implements single particle real-space helical reconstruction IHRSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egelman, 2007</xref>). Briefly, this implementation performs single-particle-like processing of helical assemblies in an empirical Bayesian framework, where a marginalised likelihood function is complemented with a prior on the reconstruction that effectively dampens high spatial-frequency terms in the absence of experimental data. A total of 1474 micrographs were collected and drift-corrected using MOTIONCORR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The contrast transfer function (CTF) was estimated by GCTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang, 2016</xref>). Filament segments were first manually picked on several micrographs, extracted as square boxes of 280 pixels and classified using reference free 2D classification. A subset of six 2D class averages representative of the different filament orientations were low-pass filtered to 20 Å and used as references to automatically pick the entire dataset with overlapping helical segments 25 Å apart in 280 pixel boxes. Autopicking accuracy was increased by identifying filaments and their directions and also their bending in RELION. Helical segments were split into two half datasets for gold standard FSC determination by keeping segments from each filament in one of the two half sets, avoiding over-fitting through comparing the same parts of images because of the picking of overlapping segments. After removing bad segments, 470,396 segments remained and were entered into 3D auto-refinement using 30 Å low-pass filtered initial models, generated from the approximated symmetry of crenactin double filaments or single filaments and crenactin's monomer structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>). Beam-induced drift was subsequently corrected for per particle and frame-based dose weighting was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheres, 2014</xref>), leading to particles with increased signal to noise ratio since the final reconstruction and postprocessing produced the highest resolution map at 3.8 Å, as assessed by the gold standard FSC procedure implemented in RELION (0.143 FSC criterion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>). Postprocessing used a mask covering the central 30% of the map, surrounded with an eight-pixel wide soft raised cosine edge. The FSC procedure was modified such that the two half sets contained particles from complete filaments, each, avoiding over-fitting through the use of very similar particles in the two half sets generated from overlapping filament segments. The electrostatic potential density map was visualised in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goddard et al., 2007</xref>) and a model for the double filament consisting of six monomers in two strands (three each) was built by placing crenactin monomers (PDB ID 4CJ7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Izoré et al., 2014</xref>) in the density map by molecular replacement with PHASER using phased translation functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) and the model was manually adjusted and corrected with MAIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turk, 2013</xref>). Refinement of the model was carried out against density cut out around 6 central monomers as implemented in REFMAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2015</xref>). REFMAC, PHENIX.refine in real-space mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) and manual building in MAIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turk, 2013</xref>) were cycled until the best fit of the model into the original density map was achieved.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Werner Kühlbrandt as the Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Robert Robinson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this is important work, that the paper is well-written and illustrated and suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, they raise a number of concerns, which need to be addressed in a revised manuscript, as detailed below.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes the cryoEM structure of a filament formed from crenactin, its regulation by arcadin-2, the co-crystal structure of crenactin/arcadin-2, and the crystal structure of arcadin-1. Together these data provide a fascinating insight into the structure and regulation of this filament system from Crenarchaea, which closely resembles F-actin. The structure is remarkable, and has increased interest due to a previous report that detailed a single-stranded architecture for the crenactin filament. The manuscript will find wide interest in the fields of evolution and filament architectures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since crenactin is as much of a modern protein as actin, the term &quot;living fossil&quot; should be used with caution. It is possible, but not certain, that crenactin has stayed closer to the common ancestor than actin itself. Indeed, the opposite could be argued from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in Molecular Microbiology (2011) 80: 1052-1061.</p><p>2) The authors demonstrate that arcadin-2 controls the polymerization of crenactin by binding with its C-terminal end of to a hydrophobic groove of crenactin with nanomolar affinity. Given that several actin de-polymerization agents target this groove, they conclude that this protein could be a &quot;functional homolog&quot; to the eukaryotic proteins. They further propose that this is in line with the idea of the evolutionary links. Since they do not show that arcadin-2 has a similar fold to any actin regulator nor find any sequence similarity, arcadin-2 is not a sequence homologue of any actin-binding protein, and therefore does not have a common origin. The lack of sequence homology actually does not support the crenarcheal origin theory or parallel evolution. On the contrary, it could be seen as a case of convergent evolution.</p><p>3) The difference between the double-stranded helix and the single stranded helix shown by others is attributed to differences in salt conditions. However, very high salt conditions (close to 1M) are routinely used as a step in actin purification to remove binding proteins from F-actin while the filament stays intact. Since the intra- and interfilament interactions are similar in crenactin and actin, high salt concentrations should not affect the filament structure. If the salt concentration does have such a strong effect on the crenactin filaments, this is an important finding that should be buttressed, e.g. by a structure of the high-salt filaments in negative stain.</p><p>4) The method used for helical reconstruction is not entirely clear. In the absence of a paper describing helical refinement in Relion, the protocol should be explained at least briefly in the Methods. In particular, the authors segmented their filaments with a distance of 25 Å. Normally, this distance is chosen to be longer that the helix rise. However, the helix rise in this case is 25.8 Å, which raises the question of how the alignment of segments is handled by Relion. This is even more surprising for the reconstruction of a single strand, since the rise in this case is more than twice the distance that was used to segment the filaments. It is also unusual that the helical rotation is ~198˚, but by definition it has to be between 180˚ and -180˚. Are the numbers wrong or does the definition of helical rotation in Relion differ from the usual convention, and if so, why? Similarly, the actin twist is given as 193.6º, different from the commonly used ~167º. This may be due to a different definition of the coordinate system, in which case it should be explained.</p><p>5) Although the interactions are hydrophilic, it is not a good idea to rename the hydrophobic plug into F-loop. The actin field is quite mature and the term hydrophobic plug has been used for 20 years or more.</p><p>6) Subsection “Crenactin forms double-helical filaments”, first paragraph: The authors seem to suggest that the growth conditions for this organism control the salt/buffer conditions within the cell. Do they have a reference for this? Alternatively, a reference for the physiological salt concentrations within the organism should be given. Otherwise, the claim that 20 mM KCl is more physiological than 500 mM KCl appears to be speculation. Most organisms have KCl levels in the 100-350 mM range.</p><p>7) Irrespective of the KCl concentration within the organism, there is no doubt that the filament structure presented in this manuscript is a physiological filament. However, there are no data in the manuscript that address whether the previously published single-stranded filament is, or is not, a physiological filament. Do the authors rule out that there could be two physiological architectures? The authors should include some analysis to compare the protofilaments. Given the very different twists, it is not obvious how single-stranded filaments (published before) would form from the salt-induced dissociation of this double-stranded filament – although this is difficult to judge without the coordinates.</p><p>8) Introduction, second paragraph: The statement that the MreB structure is the most divergent from F-actin structure is incorrect. There is plenty of evidence that ParMs have the most varied architectures.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, G</xref> – These two figure panels are very important. They should be moved into the main paper. The direction of the sequestering helices in each case should be noted – they appear to vary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21600.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Since crenactin is as much of a modern protein as actin, the term &quot;living fossil&quot; should be used with caution.

We used the term too loosely and agree it should not be used here as it implies that crenactin is closer to the common ancestor than F-actin. Modified the text to: &quot;Hence, it has been proposed that crenactin filaments share a common ancestor with F-actin.&quot;</p><p><italic>2) The authors demonstrate that arcadin-2 controls the polymerization of crenactin by binding with its C-terminal end of to a hydrophobic groove of crenactin with nanomolar affinity.

The lack of sequence homology actually does not support the crenarcheal origin theory or parallel evolution. On the contrary, it could be seen as a case of convergent evolution.</italic> </p><p>Correct – we did not identify any significant sequence homology between arcadin-2 and any other proteins. We were not trying to demonstrate that arcadin-2 is a sequence homologue of a eukaryotic actin-binding protein. We found that the mechanism of action of G-actin sequesters is similar to the mechanism we deciphered. Even if the sequence of arcadin-2 is divergent from known actin-binding proteins, it seems that the mechanism itself (crenactin filament inhibition) is homologous to the one used in eukaryotes and this is what we believe does support the theory of crenarchaeal origin as it makes actin and crenactin more related. It does seem more like convergent evolution on arcadin-2's side and we agree that this point was not made. The Discussion has been modified to include both points: &quot;Our finding that arcadin-2 shares functional and structural similarities with actin sequesters provides further evidence for the parallel evolution of the crenarchaeal and eukaryotic cytoskeletons (Bernander et al., 2011; Guy and Ettema, 2011).&quot; has been changed to: &quot;Our finding that arcadin-2 inhibits crenactin polymerisation in a manner similar to known actin sequesters provides further evidence for the parallel evolution of crenactin and eukaryotic actin since they have both maintained the function of the hydrophobic groove (Bernander et al., 2011; Guy and Ettema, 2011). Because of a lack of any detectable sequence similarity between arcadin-2 and actin sequesters, arcadin-2's mode of action might have arisen by convergent evolution.&quot;</p><p><italic>3) The difference between the double-stranded helix and the single stranded helix shown by others is attributed to differences in salt conditions. However, very high salt conditions (close to 1M) are routinely used as a step in actin purification to remove binding proteins from F-actin while the filament stays intact. Since the intra- and interfilament interactions are similar in crenactin and actin, high salt concentrations should not affect the filament structure. If the salt concentration does have such a strong effect on the crenactin filaments, this is an important finding that should be buttressed, e.g. by a structure of the high-salt filaments in negative stain.</italic> </p><p>Every actin-like protein is different and even single amino acid changes can have drastic effects on polymerisation conditions. Actin and crenactin share similar architectures at the filament level. However, many chemical differences exist at the monomer level. One of the most prominent differences is the hydrophobic plug as mentioned in the text and shown in figures, a feature that dominates inter-strand binding in crenactin and that is much smaller in actin. Even if the interactions are of similar nature, we suggest it is probably inappropriate to compare the polymerisation conditions of these two different proteins since their primary sequences differ significantly (only about 20% identity!). As an example, MreB, an endogenous bacterial actin-like protein, requires very different polymerisation conditions depending on the source organism, despite an extremely conserved 3D structure. MreB from <italic>C. crescentus</italic> does not polymerise at all if salt concentrations above 50 mM are used, whereas other MreB proteins show a different behaviour (Van den Ent 2014 <italic>eLife</italic>, Salje 2011 MolCELL, Van den Ent 2001 Nature). We cannot be sure entirely that it is the high salt condition that causes the different filament architectures, but the salt is the most striking difference between the conditions used.</p><p>Finally, it is suggested to provide a negative stain structure of the high-salt filaments. This has partially been done in our previous paper (Izoré 2014, FEBS Lett) where it is shown that under high salt conditions that crenactin most probably forms single stranded filaments (2D averaging). This has later been confirmed by a 18 Å cryoEM structure of the single-stranded filament (Braun 2015 PNAS) using the same conditions so we would like to suggest it is not needed here as it would be a duplication.</p><p><italic>4) The method used for helical reconstruction is not entirely clear. In the absence of a paper describing helical refinement in Relion, the protocol should be explained at least briefly in the Methods. In particular, the authors segmented their filaments with a distance of 25 Å. Normally, this distance is chosen to be longer that the helix rise. However, the helix rise in this case is 25.8 Å, which raises the question of how the alignment of segments is handled by Relion. This is even more surprising for the reconstruction of a single strand, since the rise in this case is more than twice the distance that was used to segment the filaments. It is also unusual that the helical rotation is ~198˚, but by definition it has to be between 180˚ and -180˚. Are the numbers wrong or does the definition of helical rotation in Relion differ from the usual convention, and if so, why? Similarly, the actin twist is given as 193.6º, different from the commonly used ~167º. This may be due to a different definition of the coordinate system, in which case it should be explained.</italic> </p><p>Apologies, the manuscript describing helical reconstruction in Relion 2.0 is only now being readied for publication (Shaoda He &amp; Sjors Scheres, in preparation). The Relion modifications essentially add a symmetry optimisation step (in real space) and a symmetrisation step (in reciprocal and/or real space) to the Refine3D procedure that has been described by Sjors previously (Scheres SHW, JSB 2012). Additionally, the procedure keeps segments from individual filaments in the two half datasets for FSC calculations separate, not to introduce bias and adds a powerful automatic picking procedure that tracks along filaments. The Methods section has been slightly amended to explain a bit more but the quality of the map and the agreement with the crenactin crystal structure (and the visible differences such as the hydrophobic plug conformation) speak for themselves we believe. The Relion additions will be published properly and it is not uncommon to publish structures with unpublished procedures (for example Phenix and CCP4 are updated/amended much more often than the literature).</p><p>The segments were picked 25 Å / 50 Å apart but are 375 Å (280 pixels x 1.34 Å) long. So they overlap a lot, one of the principles that makes IHRSR work despite the monomers being very small for cryoEM.</p><p>Relion does not impose any restrictions on the range of possible twist angles. Hence, we prefer to provide positive values for the twists when the resulting structures are right-handed. A twist of +198° is of course equivalent to -162°. Same for F-actin: +193 is equivalent to -167. To avoid confusion, both numbers are now listed everywhere. Most (all?) programs use the same direction of the rotation (but often the sign is omitted from tables and manuscripts).</p><p><italic>5) Although the interactions are hydrophilic, it is not a good idea to rename the hydrophobic plug into F-loop. The actin field is quite mature and the term hydrophobic plug has been used for 20 years or more.</italic> </p><p>'F-loop' removed everywhere.</p><p><italic>6) Subsection “Crenactin forms double-helical filaments”, first paragraph: The authors seem to suggest that the growth conditions for this organism control the salt/buffer conditions within the cell. Do they have a reference for this? Alternatively, a reference for the physiological salt concentrations within the organism should be given. Otherwise, the claim that 20 mM KCl is more physiological than 500 mM KCl appears to be speculation. Most organisms have KCl levels in the 100-350 mM range.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately, we are not aware of any data indicating the intracellular salt concentration within the organism. The only available indication is the media the organism likes to grow in that is very dilute: tryptone 10 g/L, yeast extract 1 g/l, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> x 5H<sub>2</sub>O 3 g/L. Although the organism will maintain different conditions on the inside, we believe it is unlikely to be in the range of more than 250-350 mM KCl as indicated. We have weakened this argument in the text accordingly: &quot;Previous studies on the architecture of crenactin filaments were performed under high salt concentrations (&gt; 0.5 M KCl) (Braun et al., 2015; Izoré et al., 2014) that might not be entirely justified given <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis'</italic> environmental and laboratory growth conditions (Amo et al., 2002), although the intracellular osmolarity is currently not known. To exclude the possibility that such high salt concentration might have altered filament architecture, we carried out experiments in low-salt buffer (50 mM ammonium carbonate, 20 mM KCl, see Materials and methods).&quot;</p><p><italic>7) Irrespective of the KCl concentration within the organism, there is no doubt that the filament structure presented in this manuscript is a physiological filament. However, there are no data in the manuscript that address whether the previously published single-stranded filament is, or is not, a physiological filament. Do the authors rule out that there could be two physiological architectures? The authors should include some analysis to compare the protofilaments. Given the very different twists, it is not obvious how single-stranded filaments (published before) would form from the salt-induced dissociation of this double-stranded filament – although this is difficult to judge without the coordinates.</italic> </p><p>In order to address the first point we have tried to image crenactin filaments through electron tomography of <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic> cells. No filaments were discernable. This might be because they are too close to the membrane where there are many other proteins (same situation as for MreB filaments) or filaments might be cell cycle or otherwise dependent on growth conditions. Overexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells enabled us to visualise the filament in cells by tomography but that's not the real thing. Further investigations will be required. <italic>Pyrobaculum calidifontis</italic> is not genetically tractable right now, although it is very easy to grow.</p><p>The twist in the single protofilaments (cryoEM Braun et al., X-ray structures of single protofilament: Izoré et al. and Lindås et al) is reported to be around 45° from subunit to subunit. In the protofilament/single strand of double helical crenactin it is ~36°. While this is a big change, we concluded that because of the unclear relevance of the single protofilaments that this might not add much and potentially confuse. To make this more relevant, one might want to try to investigate if single filaments become double when conditions are changed from high-salt to low-salt, for example. We have not investigated this or if, as mentioned, double filaments become single when raising the salt concentration. It is just not clear if single filaments play any roles in cells and we suggest this is unlikely.</p><p><italic>8) Introduction, second paragraph: The statement that the MreB structure is the most divergent from F-actin structure is incorrect. There is plenty of evidence that ParMs have the most varied architectures.</italic> </p><p>Many thanks for highlighting this issue. Two findings need to be separated: monomer structure and filament architecture (which itself can be split into longitudinal and lateral). Our statement meant to say that MreB filaments are the most unusual since they are non-helical, antiparallel and membrane-attached, unlike any other actin or actin-like filament. ParM's subunit structure is most diverged but the filaments are still double helical, polar and staggered. Text changed: &quot;MreB, essential for cell-shape maintenance in most rod-shaped bacteria, forms the most divergent filaments when compared to F-actin, as it forms apolar, non-staggered and non-helical filaments that bind directly to membranes (Salje et al., 2011; van den Ent et al., 2014).&quot;</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, G</xref> – These two figure panels are very important. They should be moved into the main paper. The direction of the sequestering helices in each case should be noted – they appear to vary.</italic> </p><p>That's a good suggestion, changed the figure. There were actually other problems with the figure panels that have been rectified (ParM:ParR showed the wrong structure and tb4 used the wrong structure and reference). The termini pointing away from the viewer have been labelled on the proteins binding to the hydrophobic groove, highlighting the reversed orientation in the thymosin structure, which now comes from PDB 2PL8. Also, the reversed direction is now mentioned in the figure legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
