rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) and contributes to the block of differentiation. Epigenetic mechanisms leading to its suppression are unknown and could pave the way toward novel therapeutic modalities. We demonstrate that EHMT2 suppresses canonical Wnt signaling by activating expression of the Wnt antagonist <italic>DKK1</italic>. Inhibition of EHMT2 expression or activity in human ERMS cell lines reduced <italic>DKK1</italic> expression and elevated canonical Wnt signaling resulting in myogenic differentiation in vitro and in mouse xenograft models in vivo. Mechanistically, EHMT2 impacted Sp1 and p300 enrichment at the <italic>DKK1</italic> promoter. The reduced tumor growth upon EHMT2 deficiency was reversed by recombinant DKK1 or LGK974, which also inhibits Wnt signaling. Consistently, among 13 drugs targeting chromatin modifiers, EHMT2 inhibitors were highly effective in reducing ERMS cell viability. Our study demonstrates that ERMS cells are vulnerable to EHMT2 inhibitors and suggest that targeting the EHMT2-DKK1-β-catenin node holds promise for differentiation therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>methylation</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001349</institution-id><institution>National Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NMRC/OFIRG/0073/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taneja</surname><given-names>Reshma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>President’s Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pal</surname><given-names>Ananya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of the lysine methyltransferase G9a blocks oncogenic phenotypes in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common malignant soft tissue sarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Keller and Guttridge, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hettmer et al., 2014</xref>) that arises due to a block in myogenic differentiation. Children with high risk disease have poor prognosis with only 30% showing 5-year event-free survival. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) accounts for the majority (~60%) of all RMS cases. No single genetic lesion is linked to ERMS but chromosome gains (chr 2, 8, 12, and 13) and loss of heterozygosity at 11p15.5 are characteristically seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shern et al., 2014</xref>). A few recurrent mutations occur in ERMS that include mutations in p53 (TP53), amplification of <italic>CDK4</italic>, upregulation of <italic>MYCN</italic>, and point mutations in RAS leading to its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Shern et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu and Davie, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Skapek et al., 2019</xref>). Recent studies have investigated whether improper epigenetic imprinting underlies the myogenic differentiation defect in RMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cieśla et al., 2014</xref>). This includes altered expression of histone deacetylases, methyltransferases as well as lncRNAs and microRNAs that inhibit differentiation. Among these, EZH2 that mediates repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is upregulated and binds to muscle specific genes in ERMS. Its silencing increases both MyoD binding and transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciarapica et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, HDAC inhibitors have been found to induce differentiation and reduce self-renewal and migratory capacity of ERMS by regulating Notch-1 and EphrinB1-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vleeshouwer-Neumann et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of the lysine methyltransferase SUV39H1 suppresses tumor formation <italic>in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup></italic>-driven zebrafish model of ERMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albacker et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Genetic mouse models that develop ERMS-like tumors due to deregulation of key signaling pathways such as Hedgehog, Wnt, Notch, and Yap signaling have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pal et al., 2019</xref>). Double mutants lacking p53 and c-fos (Trp53<sup>-/-</sup>/Fos<sup>-/-</sup>) develop ERMS. Elevated expression of Wnt antagonists dickkopf-related protein 1 (<italic>DKK1</italic>) and secreted frizzled-related proteins (<italic>sFRPs</italic>), as well as downregulation of Wnt agonists such as Wnt ligands Wnt 7b, Wnt 5a, Wnt four, and Wnt 11 were reported in these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Singh et al., 2010</xref>). Mice expressing activated smoothened under the <italic>Fabp4</italic> promoter leading to activation of Hedgehog signaling also develop ERMS. The tumors also show upregulation of <italic>Dkk3</italic> which, similar to <italic>Dkk1</italic>, inhibits canonical Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hatley et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these findings, GSK3β inhibitors that activate Wnt signaling were most effective inducers of differentiation in a zebrafish model of ERMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly downregulation of Wnt signaling was found to be relevant only in ERMS.</p><p>There are 19 Wnt ligands, which function either through the canonical or non-canonical pathways in a highly context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Masuda and Ishitani, 2017</xref>). Canonical signaling is activated when Wnt ligands bind to a receptor from the Frizzled (Fzd) family. The co-receptors LRP5/6 facilitate Wnt signaling. Activation of Wnt signaling leads to disruption of the destruction complex (APC, Axin, GSK3β, and CK1α) which phosphorylates and degrades β-catenin. Induction of Wnt signaling results in accumulation of non-phosphorylated β-catenin (active β-catenin). β-catenin then translocates to the nucleus where it activates genes in cooperation with TCF/LEF1, but also other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Masuda and Ishitani, 2017</xref>). Neither of the two non-canonical pathways (Planar Cell Polarity pathway [PCP] and the Wnt/calcium signaling pathway) involve β-catenin. Dkk1, a secreted protein, interacts with Lrp5/6 and antagonizes Wnt signaling by preventing Lrp5/6 association with Wnt/Fzd complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Niehrs, 2006</xref>). Despite the relevance of Wnt signaling in ERMS, epigenetic mechanisms leading to its suppression have not been described and could pave the way to development of targeted therapies.</p><p>EHMT2, a lysine methyltransferase that is encoded by the <italic>EHTM2</italic> gene, mediates mono and di-methylation of H3K9 (H3K9me1/2), which is primarily involved in transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shinkai and Tachibana, 2011</xref>). Recent studies however have shown that EHMT2 can also function as an activator in methylation-independent and -dependent ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shankar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casciello et al., 2015</xref>). EHMT2 has been proposed to have oncogenic functions and its overexpression in leukemia, gastric, lung, prostate cancer, and alveolar RMS causes silencing of tumor suppressor genes through its H3K9me2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shankar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Casciello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we found that canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling is epigenetically suppressed in ERMS. EHMT2 activates expression of <italic>DKK1</italic> in a methylation-dependent manner through an impact on Sp1 and p300 recruitment. Our data indicate the potential of targeting the EHMT2-DKK1 axis to activate Wnt signaling for the development of novel ERMS therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EHMT2 inhibitors reduce ERMS cell viability</title><p>We recently reported that <italic>EHMT2</italic> is overexpressed in ARMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2019</xref>). To examine whether EHMT2 expression is de-regulated in ERMS, and if it is functionally relevant in these tumor subtype, we first examined its expression in 16 ERMS patient tumor sections. High nuclear expression relative to normal muscle was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, compared to primary human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSMMs), EHMT2 overexpression at both mRNA and protein levels was apparent in three ERMS patient-derived cell lines RD18, JR1, and RD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To examine if the EHMT2 pathway is functionally relevant, we treated JR1 and RD cell lines with 13 methyltransferase inhibitors at three different concentrations. Viability was measured 8 days later using MTS assay. Drugs targeting BRD4, PRMT5, and EHMT2 showed a strong effect on viability of both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Strikingly, UNC0642 showed significantly higher efficacy against RD cells when compared to HSMM in cell viability assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with our drug screening assay, treatment of both JR1 and RD cells with UNC0642, a small molecule inhibitor of EHMT2 led to a striking reduction in colony formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that EHMT2 is overexpressed and functionally relevant in ERMS.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EHMT2 is overexpressed in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 16 archival ERMS patient tumor specimens and four normal muscle samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-EHMT2 antibody.

We then examined the impact on differentiation and proliferation of tumor cells. EHMT2 knockdown (siEHMT2 cells) as well as UNC0642 treatment resulted in increased myogenic differentiation relative to their respective controls as evidenced from the increased MHC expression, a terminal differentiation marker, as well as <italic>MYOG</italic>, an early differentiation marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

The shRNA control group was also injected with the vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

These genes, independent of Wnt signaling, may contribute to oncogenic effects of EHMT2 in ERMS cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we uncovered an EHMT2-dependent epigenetic node that results in repression of Wnt signaling in ERMS. We propose that by activating <italic>DKK1</italic> expression, EHMT2 maintains Wnt signaling in a repressed state, and thus prevents the transition of myoblasts to a differentiated state. These findings underscore specific epigenetic mechanisms to reactivate Wnt signaling and induce differentiation in ERMS.</p><p>There has been a resurgence of interest in differentiation therapy as a viable treatment option for solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruz and Matushansky, 2012</xref>). The Wnt, Notch, and Hedgehog pathways play a pivotal role in balancing proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation during embryonic myogenesis. Not surprisingly, deregulation of these developmental pathways has been reported in ERMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hatley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Satheesha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ignatius et al., 2017</xref>) and consequently, drugs targeting each of these pathways are being tested. However, current inhibitors do not selectively target specific pathways and have either unacceptable toxicity, or do not show marked clinical improvement. Several studies have demonstrated suppression of Wnt signaling in RMS cells, which mostly do not stain positively for nuclear β-catenin. Also, no mutations in the β catenin gene have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouron-Dal Soglio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annavarapu et al., 2013</xref>). The suppression of Wnt signaling is a critical contributor to the differentiation block in ERMS, and induction of the pathway leads to cell cycle exit and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Singh et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). GSK3ß inhibitors are the most prominent Wnt signaling activators and showed promising effects in inducing differentiation in a zebrafish model of ERMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). GSK3ß is a constitutive serine/threonine protein kinase that inhibits canonical Wnt signaling by phosphorylating ß-catenin and triggering its degradation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wu and Pan, 2010</xref>). However, GSK3ß is involved in many pathways with more predicted substrates than any known kinase. Thus, its inhibition is not a specific strategy to induce Wnt signaling. This is also emphasized by slow progress of existing GSK3ß inhibitors toward clinical translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pandey and DeGrado, 2016</xref>). Tideglusib, an irreversible GSK3ß inhibitor, was recently tested against RMS PDX models, where the highest safe dosage failed to both induce myogenic differentiation and affect cancer progression in PDX models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bharathy et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, development of alternative molecularly targeted therapies that induce Wnt signaling is a critical goal in this disease.</p><p>Our data demonstrates an epigenetic mechanism to activate Wnt signaling and overcome the differentiation block in ERMS. Interestingly EHMT2 activates <italic>DKK1</italic> in a methylation-dependent manner resulting in the suppression of Wnt signaling in ERMS. While methylation-dependent silencing or repression by EHMT2 has been described, only a few studies have demonstrated methylation-dependent activation of gene expression. EHMT2 occupancy at its promoter demonstrates that it directly regulates <italic>DKK1</italic> expression. Consistent with previous studies, we found Sp1 binding at the <italic>DKK1</italic> promoter and inhibition of EHMT2 led to its decreased occupancy along with the coactivator p300. The hypothesis that G9a activation of <italic>DKK1</italic> is mediated by H3K9me2 loss needs to be tested further and the mechanisms by which G9a activity regulates Sp1–p300 occupancy at the promoter need further investigation. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis revealed de-regulation of several Sp1 target genes such as <italic>IGBP2</italic>, <italic>IGBP3</italic>, <italic>HB-EGF</italic>, <italic>FGFR1</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>VEGFA</italic>, and <italic>VEGFC</italic> suggesting that the effect of EHMT2 inhibition on Sp1 transcriptional activity might not be limited to <italic>DKK1</italic>.</p><p>Pan-HDAC and pan-DNMT inhibitors have been explored in ERMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vleeshouwer-Neumann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gnyszka et al., 2013</xref>). HDAC inhibitors often exert effects independent of their epigenetic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vleeshouwer-Neumann et al., 2015</xref>) and application of DNMT inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gnyszka et al., 2013</xref>) is restricted due to their toxicity in healthy cells. EZH2 inhibitors are the only other specific epigenetic inhibitors that demonstrate a strong phenotype in ERMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciarapica et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, a drug screen of 15 methyltransferase inhibitors in two different ERMS cell lines showed that small molecule inhibitors targeting EHMT2 activity are very effective. Thus, our data support targeting EHMT2 as a therapeutic approach in ERMS, particularly since its deletion does not impact development of muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). We have recently shown that EHMT2 is deregulated in ARMS as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2019</xref>). Together with the herein described role of EHMT2 in ERMS, these observations clearly suggest the importance of differentiation in these therapies and imply common features between these two subtypes of RMS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> female)</td><td>Nude mice</td><td>In Vivos</td><td><italic>C.Cg/AnNTac-Foxn1<sup>nu</sup>NE9 BALB/c</italic> RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_TAC:balbnu">IMSR_TAC:balbnu</ext-link></td><td>BALB/c inbred model</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HSMM</td><td>Lonza Inc</td><td>#: CC-2580</td><td>Isolated from upper arm or leg muscle tissue <break/>of normal donors and sold at second passage</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>RD18</td><td>Peter Houghton and Rosella Rota</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_IU87">CVCL_IU87</ext-link></td><td>Clone cells derived from RD cells</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>RD</td><td>Peter Houghton and Rosella Rota</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1649">CVCL_1649</ext-link></td><td>Patient-derived cell line from pelvic mass of 7-year-old female</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>JR1</td><td>Peter Houghton and Rosella Rota</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_J063">CVCL_J063</ext-link></td><td>Patient-derived cell line from lung metastasis of 7-year-old female</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>RD shscm</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Transfected with shRNA control lentivirus particles</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>RD shEHMT2</td><td>This study</td><td/><td>Transfected with shEHMT2 lentivirus particles</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>SmartPool non-targeting siRNA</td><td>Dharmacon</td><td>D-001810-10-20</td><td>Negative control of four siRNAs designed for minimal targeting</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>SmartPool siRNA against EHMT2</td><td>Dharmacon</td><td>L-006937-00-0010</td><td>A mixture of four siRNA provided as a single reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>SmartPool siRNA against DKK1</td><td>Dharmacon</td><td>L-003843-01-0010</td><td>A mixture of four siRNA provided as a single reagent</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>shRNA control lentivirus particles</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc</td><td>sc-108080</td><td>Negative control. 200 μl viral stock containing 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>IFU.

All cell lines were routinely tested and were negative for mycoplasma. RD18 and JR1 were cultured in RPMI 1640 with L-Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan UT, USA), whereas RD cells were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) with 10% FBS (Hyclone, Logan UT, USA).

For transient knockdown, cells were transfected with 50 nM of human EHMT2-specific siRNA or human DKK1-specific siRNA (ON-TARGETplus siRNA SMARTpool, Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA) containing a pool of three to five 19–25 nucleotide siRNAs. Control cells were transfected with 50 nM scrambled siRNA (ON-TARGETplus, non-targeting pool, Dharmacon) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Thermo Fisher scientific). Cells were analyzed 48 hr post-transfection for all assays. Knockdown efficiency was monitored by western blot. For generating stable knockdown cell lines, RD cells at 40–50% confluency were transduced with shRNA control lentivirus particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc), or shEHMT2 lentivirus particles (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc) and 2 µl polybrene (8 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM basal medium. Six hours post-transduction, cell supernatants were replaced with DMEM medium (10% FBS) for 24 hr. Transduced cells were selected with 1 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 days. For rescue experiments, siEHMT2 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of rDKK1 (R and D Systems) or 200 nM of porcupine inhibitor LGK974 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, USA). Both rDKK1 and LGK974 were added to the media 24 hr after transfection.

PLA signals as dots per nuclei were calculated for at least three microscopic fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Transcriptome analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)</title><p>For RNA sequencing analysis, RNA was isolated from control and siEHMT2 cells in triplicate using Trizol. RNA was sequenced using Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. CASAVA base recognition was used to convert raw data file to Sequence Reads and stored in FASTQ(fq) format. Raw reads were then further filtered in order to achieve clean reads using the following filtering conditions: reads without adaptors, reads containing number of base that cannot be determined below 10%, and at least 50% bases of the reads having Qscore denoting Quality value ≤ 5. For mapping of the reads STAR software was used to align the reads against hg19 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> reference genome. 1M base was used as the sliding window for distribution of the mapped reads. For differential expression gene (DEG) analysis Readcount obtained from gene expression analysis was used. Differential expression significance analysis of two experimental groups was done by Novogene using the DESeq2 R package and an adjusted p-value of 0.05 was applied (padj &lt;0.05). For analysis of the differentially expressed genes, Gene Ontology analysis was done using cluster Profiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) software for GO terms with corrected p-value less than 0.05.</p><p>For qPCR analysis, total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and quantified using Nanodrop. Messenger RNA (mRNA) was converted to a single-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA) using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed using Lightcycler 480 SYBR Green 1 Master Kit (Roche). PCR amplification was performed as follows: 95°C for 5 min, followed by 95°C for 10 s, annealing at 60°C for 10 s, followed by 45 cycles at 72°C for 10 s. Light Cycler 480 software (version 1.3.0.0705) was used for analysis. CT values of samples were normalized to internal control GAPDH to obtain delta CT (ΔCT). Relative expression was calculated by 2−ΔCT equation. qPCR was done using reaction triplicate and at least two independent biological replicates were done for each analysis.

Sequencing reads were mapped against human reference genome hg19. High quality mapped reads (MAPQ ≥ 10) were retained and potential duplicates were removed using SAMtools. EHMT2 binding sites were predicted from the libraries using MACS2. Read density was computed in the format of bigwig using MEDIPS with 50 bp window width. The prediction revealed 48,999 binding sites overlapping with promoters, gene body, and intergenic regions. We used GENCODE v19 to define promoters (±2.5 kb from TSS) and gene body. Mid-point predicted binding sites were used in this analysis. Of the 48,999 binding sites 49% (n = 24,176) localized at promoters, 29% (n = 14,252) at gene bodies, and 21% (n = 10,571) at inter-genic regions. To demonstrate the read density around annotated TSS, we identified the promoters of the TSS overlapping with predicted EHMT2 binding sites. The TSS were then extended ±20 kb and the binding signal was computed in each window of size 100 bp. Average read density for each window was computed using bigWigAverageOverBed. GENECODEv19 was used to classify promoter-bound EHMT2 binding. Peaks were annotated using ChIPseeker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2015</xref>) and ChIPpeakAnno (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>) against genes model of UCSC, hg19, knownGene (TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene). Differential expression count matrix was analyzed using R. Genes with an adjusted p-value less than 0.05 were labeled as significantly differentially expressed. From that list, genes with an absolute fold change ≥ 1.2 were selected for further analysis. GO analysis of gene subsets was performed using Metascape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). The ChIP-Seq data are compliant with MIAME guidelines and have been deposited in the NCBI GEO database.</p><p>ChIP-PCR was done as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhat et al., 2019</xref>).

for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation was overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Pal et al. report on G9a inhibition as a potential therapeutic vulnerability in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma through an indirect suppression of DKK1 via CDK1 mediated phosphorylation of SP1, releasing canonical Wnt signaling and myogenic differentiation. In patient derived cell lines and mouse xenografts, knock down of G9a, through chemical inhibition or siRNA, reduces tumor cell viability. Molecular studies confirm an association of SP1 and P300 on the DKK1(a Wnt signaling antagonist) promoter, and suggest that G9a inhibition is associated with CDK1 activation and phosphorylation of SP1. Phospho-SP1 demonstrates reduced DNA binding affinity and thus the authors suggest that this drives transcriptional down-regulation of DKK1.</p><p>The manuscript describes a comprehensive analysis, presented in step-wise and logical fashion. However the main conclusions presented are not as well supported as they could be, and in some instances the results are difficult to follow. Of critical concern is the authors repeated mention, including in the title, that the methyltransferase activity of G9a is directly implicated in the down-regulation of CDK1 – however data in support of this claim are not provided (e.g. H3K9me2 occupancy at CDK1). Additional details are needed to replicate the methods and the experiments appear to be inconsistently performed among the cell lines studied, further weakening the conclusions presented.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Experiments are applied inconsistently among the 3 ERMS cell lines studied across different stages of the analysis. For example, the initial drug screen, where G9a is identified as a target, is performed in JR1 and RD. Colony formation is done in JR1, only whereas shG9a experiments are performed in RD. Finally, DKK1 knockdown and G9a ChIP-seq is performed in RD18. This, in combination with sparse information in parts of the methods, hinders the ability to evaluate findings and thus conclusions drawn.</p><p>2) The major finding that G9a inhibition could be an effective treatment option for ERMS, needs to be strengthened. In the drug screen control cell lines are not used, whereas they are used in other aspects of study, for example the HSMM cell is used as normal comparator in the qPCR experiments. Control lines are required to demonstrate specificity of G9a inhibition at concentrations used. This is essential to conclude that G9a activation is of particular relevance to ERMS.</p><p>3) Can the authors address: Is loss of Dkk1 expression a direct effect of loss of G9a function at its promoter? Does G9a directly occupy the <italic>Dkk1</italic> promoter?</p><p>4) The mechanism for the effect of G9a silencing/inhibition with regard to Sp1 binding to p300 is the weakest part of the manuscript. It appears to be shown in one cell line, using one technique (PLA), for one gene (DKK1). As this is the truly important piece of data (particularly given the extremely modest effect of G9a inhibitors on ERMS xenografts), this mechanistic aspect would need to be significantly improved in a revised version. Specifically: can the authors show this effect by IP-western, with data that include steady state levels of Sp1 and p300? Can they address: does this impact on other Sp1-regulated genes? (If so, why didn't Sp1 come out in the Go analysis of the RNA Seq data?). Also this needs to be repeated in another ERMS cell line. With regard to their PLA data, the authors need the required controls for their PLA, such as the use of only one antibody. Finally, the authors should perform PLA on their “normal control” cells used in Figure 1, to indicate whether this effect is tumor cell specific or not.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57683.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript describes a comprehensive analysis, presented in step-wise and logical fashion.

Most in vivo studies in ERMS have primarily used this cell line. However, we would like to highlight that we have validated the phenotypic effects of G9a knockdown through siRNA based approach in all three ERMS cell lines (RD, RD18 and JR1); with use of UNC0642 in all cell lines as well as using stable lentiviral mediated knockdown in one cell line demonstrating robustness of the data.</p><p>Since we saw nearly identical results in all cell lines, we used RD18 for ChIP-seq analysis. As such, DKK1 knockdown experiments were also done in RD18 cells. We will be able to validate the findings in another ERMS cell line to prove robustness. In response to the reviewers, we will move the CDK1 data to the supplementary section and do ChIP-PCR for CDK1 in another ERMS cell line. In the revised version we will also provide detailed methodology for all experiments.</p><p>We have done phenotypic analysis of DKK1 knockdown in RD cell line with similar results (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B).

Steady state levels of Sp1 and p300 are also shown in the same figure.</p><p>We show PLA for Sp1-p300 interaction in RD and HSMM as well in Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E along with controls for single antibody (Figure 4—figure supplement 1H).</p><p>RNA-seq analysis of differentially expressed genes upon G9a knockdown revealed some canonical cancer related SP1 target genes like IGBP2, IGBP3, HB-EGF, <italic>FGFR1</italic>, CCND1, VEGFA and VEGFC. Further Homer analysis of the ChIP seq data for DNA motif enrichment at predicted G9a binding sites revealed KLF7 as one of the top DNA motifs associated with G9a predicted binding sites. SP1 is a member of the Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) all of which share a highly conserved DNA binding domain with high sequence similarity. Thus, SP1 and other KLF family members might play an important role in regulating G9a target genes in ERMS. Since SP1 mRNA levels are not changed (based on G9a RNA-Seq analysis) we believe that reduced SP1/p300 association in presence of G9a inhibitors may lead to reduced SP1 activity and consequently expression of its downstream targets such as DKK1 as well as those listed above. This is in line with reduced SP1 and p300 occupancy at the DKK1 promoter. We have included this in the Discussion and included Homer analysis showing DNA motif enrichment at predicted G9a binding sites (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).</p></body></sub-article></article>
