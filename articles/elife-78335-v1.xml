Studies of metabolic scaling have largely been restricted to mathematical modeling of caloric intake and oxygen consumption, and mostly rely on computational modeling. The possibility that other metabolic processes scale with body size has not been comprehensively studied. To address this gap in knowledge, we employed a systems approach including transcriptomics, proteomics, and measurement of in vitro and in vivo metabolic fluxes. Gene expression in livers of five species spanning a 30,000-fold range in mass revealed differential expression according to body mass of genes related to cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic processes, and to detoxication of oxidative damage. To determine whether flux through key metabolic pathways is ordered inversely to body size, we applied stable isotope tracer methodology to study multiple cellular compartments, tissues, and species. Comparing C57BL/6 J mice with Sprague-Dawley rats, we demonstrate that while ordering of metabolic fluxes is not observed in in vitro cell-autonomous settings, it is present in liver slices and in vivo. Together, these data reveal that metabolic scaling extends beyond oxygen consumption to other aspects of metabolism, and is regulated at the level of gene and protein expression, enzyme activity, and substrate supply.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolic scaling</kwd><kwd>liver metabolism</kwd><kwd>metabolic flux</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00CA215315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>Rachel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcriptomic, enzyme activity, and flux data demonstrate that metabolic scaling, the inverse correlation between body size and metabolic rate per gram of tissue, is a conserved phenomenon that occurs at multiple physiological levels and in multiple tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 1932, Max Kleiber published a seminal study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleiber, 1932</xref>), integrating prior reports demonstrating a phenomenon that came to be termed ‘Kleiber’s law,’ or the principle of metabolic scaling. Metabolic scaling refers to the phenomenon that the metabolic processes in many animals, if not all, scale inversely to three-quarters of their body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">West et al., 1997</xref>). In simpler terms, there is a reduction in metabolic rate as body size increases. For example, an elephant is 25 million times larger than a fruit fly, yet its energy expenditure is only 20 thousand times higher; thus, from the fruit fly to elephant, the metabolic rate per gram of body weight scales down 1250 times. While there is experimental evidence for metabolic scaling from bacteria to large mammals, data have been generated almost exclusively from observations of caloric intake and oxygen consumption, with gene and protein expression, and substrate fluxes almost entirely unexplored.</p><p>The concept of hierarchical regulation, whereby gene expression initiates the cascade that allows for the flux of metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rossell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suarez and Moyes, 2012</xref>), provides a systems framework to begin to understand scaling. Beginning at the transcriptional level, we studied liver gene expression across five species: mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), and cattle (<italic>bos taurus</italic>), species with a 30,000-fold range of average body weight in adults (from 30 g in mice, to 900 kg in cattle). Numerous metabolic genes related to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, oxygen consumption, electron transport, and redox function, and detoxification of oxidative damage, were expressed at levels inverse to body size. Further analysis of liver proteomics revealed that approximately half of the genes in the liver that were expressed inversely proportionally to body size at the transcriptional level, were also expressed at levels inversely proportional to body size at the level of protein expression. To determine if gene and protein expression would correlate with enzyme activity and metabolic flux, we performed a comprehensive assessment of liver metabolism in vivo and in vitro using modified Positional Isotopomer NMR Tracer Analysis (PINTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perry et al., 2017b</xref>) and stable isotope-derived turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perry et al., 2015</xref>) methods. Our analysis shows that rats exhibit lower metabolic rates when compared to mice <italic>in</italic> and ex vivo; however, no significant differences were observed when we isolated hepatocytes and cultured them in vitro under identical conditions. Taken together, this study demonstrates the variation of metabolic fluxes according to body size, extending prior studies of metabolic scaling, and provides unique insight into the regulation of metabolic flux across species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genes within the liver that are expressed inversely proportional to body weight are predominantly metabolic genes</title><p>We examined gene expression in livers from mice (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), rats (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>), monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>), humans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), and cattle (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>).

After normalizing for differences in transcript length and abundance across species, we filtered out genes that followed the pattern of mouse &gt;rat &gt; monkey &gt;human &gt; cow. The genes that met these criteria were predominantly related to metabolic pathways, including pyruvate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Genes from this list were further restricted to genes involved in amino acid, carbohydrate, energy, lipid, vitamin, and TCA cycle metabolism, and demonstrated a range of degrees of inverse correlation with body mass, with only TCA cycle genes clustering together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genes that follow the pattern of allometric scaling are most strongly related to metabolism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) KEGG Pathway enrichment of all genes that are expressed with an inverse correlation to body mass, and (<bold>B</bold>) clustering heatmap of scaled genes that belong to one of six Reactome metabolic superpathways.

Furthermore, to understand whether or not certain genes that are expressed inversely proportionally to body size involved anabolic or catabolic processes, they were further classified by their properties to be energy suppliers or consumers. Eleven of sixteen critical metabolic enzymes that scaled required molecular oxygen, NAD+/NADH, or ATP/ADP for function, possibly indicating exquisite regulation of energy-consuming processes at the individual gene level. Genes involved in the detoxication of lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes (<italic>ALDH7A1</italic>), hydrogen peroxide (<italic>GPX1</italic>), and ammonia (<italic>GLUL</italic>) suggest scaling of damage control mechanisms that are associated with increased oxidative metabolism across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The inverse correlation between body size and expression of genes that are associated with interorgan crosstalk is consistent with scaling in vivo which would not be expected in plated cells.

Our proteomics data were limited to mouse, rat, and human, as all the open-source proteomic databases that we identified lacked data from monkey or cow. An important limitation for finding such data is that even with careful post-processing, we cannot combine data from different studies, because differences in methods of tissue preparation may influence results. Therefore, we were limited to a single experiment that had generated proteomics data for mouse, rat, and human using the same experimental procedures. The dataset contained protein expression corresponding to eight of the twenty genes identified to scale in our transcriptomics data analysis. Of these, three (GLUL, GPX1, and MDH1) were found to follow a reverse correlation with body size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Interestingly, one of these proteins (GLUL) was also found to be expressed inversely proportionally to body size in the left ventricle of the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Additionally, we measured liver transaminase concentrations and observed that both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) exhibited lower concentrations in humans as compared to rats and rats as compared to mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>), consistent with scaling at the level of protein expression as well as mRNA expression.

However, a major limitation of prior studies in this field has been that observations have been largely limited to oxygen consumption and caloric intake, leaving other metabolic processes unexplored. This study sought to address this issue by examining the generalizability of the inverse relationship between body mass and metabolic rates, using both experimental measurements and previously assembled databases that have not previously been employed in this context.</p><p>It is important to note that the metabolic processes which we observed to be higher in mice as compared to rats did not necessarily adhere quantitatively to the classic metabolic scaling relationship, with metabolic rates proportional to three-quarters of body mass. This speaks to the idea that the scaling relationship is multidimensional: it is entirely conceivable that whole-body oxygen consumption could be proportional to three-quarters of body mass, while other metabolic processes may exhibit a different scaling relationship. Further studies across species beyond rodents will be required to address this question.</p><p>The possibility that gene expression, as reflected by mRNA abundance, may also scale with body mass has not been previously addressed. We observed that the expression of key genes in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, fatty acid metabolism, NAD synthesis and transport, mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and protection from oxidative damage scale with body mass. More compelling, however, is the observation that those genes for which an inverse relationship of expression with body mass is observed, are not randomly distributed across the genome. Rather, the collection of genes whose expression is inversely correlated with body mass is enriched for genes related to metabolic processes, and whose corresponding proteins’ enzymatic action are constrained by the supply of substrate, NAD, ATP, or oxygen.</p><p>The notion that body mass is a variable related to the level of expression of certain genes has not previously been considered as an aspect of metabolic scaling. However, it should be noted that metabolic scaling cannot fully be explained at the transcriptional level, because many rate-limiting enzymes in the metabolic processes measured in vivo did not scale at the transcriptional level, and only approximately half of genes that scaled at the level of mRNA scaled at the level of protein. Thus, it is likely that both transcriptional and other mechanisms – such as enzyme activity – are responsible for variations in metabolic flux per unit mass, inversely proportionally to body size. Additionally, the currently available data do not allow us to assess whether the expression of certain isoforms of key metabolic enzymes scales differentially across species.</p><p>It is also informative to contrast the lack of an inverse relationship between body size and metabolic fluxes per tissue weight (oxygen consumption, mitochondrial oxidation, lipolysis, and glucose production in hepatocytes) measured in the in vitro setting, to our findings in vivo (where all fluxes proceeded faster in mice than in rats). This emphasizes the need to employ tracer methods in vivo to generate a comprehensive picture of differences in metabolic fluxes between species.</p><p>Our findings emphasize that measurement of oxygen consumption in vitro may fail to detect any influence of scaling processes present in vivo. Glucose production was threefold higher in mouse liver slices relative to rat liver slices, but did not significantly differ between plated hepatocytes from mice and rats. Future studies using metabolic flux analysis may have the further capacity to generate new insights as to the scope and mechanism of metabolic scaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wiechert, 2001</xref>). For example, our data do not allow us to ascertain whether differences in oxygen consumption orchestrate metabolic alterations, as has been suggested in the setting of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakazawa et al., 2016</xref>), or metabolic alterations require changes in oxygen consumption. Additionally, there are limitations to the fact that metabolic flux studies were performed only in the two arguably most related species included in the transcriptomics analysis (with monkey and human perhaps being similarly related). Our laboratory does not have the capacity to perform flux analysis in larger or smaller species, but we fully recognize that widening our scope beyond the 10-fold range in body size between mice and rats may yield different results. For example, it is possible that the mathematical relationship between body size and metabolic flux may reach a threshold of body size, after which this relationship may change. However, experimental and computational data suggest that the metabolic scaling relationship with regard to oxygen consumption holds at least from birds to cattle, and that a similar – but not identical – scaling relationship exists in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niklas and Kutschera, 2015</xref>), so we posit that it is likely that if such a threshold exists, it occurs at a body size orders of magnitude larger than the rodents included in our study.</p><p>Taken together, the findings of this study show that the phenomenon of metabolic scaling extends to processes beyond oxygen consumption and caloric intake, and is bookended by scaling not only of gene and protein expression, but also of enzyme activity and cytosolic and mitochondrial fluxes in vivo. It may be that if one were to alter the activity of an enzyme in a larger species using a mutation to increase it to the level of activity of the same enzyme in a smaller species, that the phenomenon of metabolic scaling might disappear. Future work will be required to examine this possibility. The mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of metabolic scaling remain obscure, and deserve investigation as a fundamental question in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolokotrones et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">White and Seymour, 2003</xref>).

Metabolic scaling phenomena may also have medical relevance. Recent reports provide data consistent with ‘Peto’s paradox’ by showing that cancer is not more prevalent in larger, long-lived organisms than smaller ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makarieva et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vincze et al., 2022</xref>), despite the fact that more cells are at risk for transformation, and over longer periods of time. Metabolic scaling provides a potential explanation: the slower rates of metabolic processes (including oxygen consumption) and reduced oxidative damage in larger animals imply lower rates of proliferation and carcinogenic DNA damage, so that while more cells are at risk in large animals, carcinogenesis proceeds more rapidly in smaller ones.</p><p>Metabolic scaling phenomena that lead to different rates of metabolic fluxes according to organism size deserve consideration in the context of murine models of human diseases. These differences may contribute to the faster rate of aging and shorter life expectancy of rodents as compared to humans. A separate example concerns cancer models, where species-specific different rates of in vivo metabolic fluxes might be relevant to carcinogenesis or efficacy of treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal studies were approved by the Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol 2019–20290).

To assess for differences in gene expression in genes displayed on the metabolic map, a one-way ANOVA with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (thus we used an adjusted p-value threshold for this test of 0.01, corresponding to an alpha level of 0.05, for significance) using the Python Scipy package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Targeted gene expression analysis was performed by qPCR in our laboratory. mRNA was prepared using TRIzol (Life Technologies), purified using RNeasy mini-columns (Qiagen), and used to prepare cDNA.

Mouse liver S9 fraction (PXD000733), rat liver S9 fraction (PXD000717), and human liver S9 fraction (PXD00734) raw data from a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golizeh et al., 2015</xref>) were processed using MaxQuant software (version 2.1.4.0, Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Munich, Germany), and proteins were identified with built-in Andromeda search engine based on Uniprot canonical protein collections for each species. The false discovery rate cut-offs were set to 1% on peptide, protein, and site decoy levels (default), thereby only allowing the high-quality identifications to pass. Raw intensities of all species showed similar distributions; therefore, data were normalized across species by median centering, and we used the EggNOG database to match orthologous proteins between species. Perseus was used to perform data analysis. We looked exclusively at the twenty genes that were identified with the pattern mouse &gt; rat &gt; human in our transcriptomics data analysis. We used iBAQ intensity (intensity Based Absolute Quantification) as a proxy for protein expression because iBAQ intensities are the raw intensities divided by the number of theoretical peptides. Therefore, iBAQ values are proportional to the molar quantities of the proteins. Additionally, the iBAQ algorithm can roughly estimate the relative abundance of proteins within a sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krey et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Because the primary goal of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Golizeh et al., 2015</xref> , was to evaluate protein/peptide-level ion exchange fractionation and proteome coverage in liver microsomes versus S9 fractions, the protein data did not include protein abundance. Consequently, the dataset did not have replicates as two livers from each species were digested differently (one with trypsin and the second with pepsin). Since the different digestion methods could alter both protein identification and abundance, we evaluated only the data from the liver S9 fraction digested with trypsin. Since we had no replicates, statistical analysis could not be carried out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vitro tracer analysis</title><p>Primary hepatocytes were isolated by the Yale Liver Center’s Cell Isolation Core, plated in a six-well plate (4.0 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well), and allowed to recover for 6 hr at 37 °C in substrate replete media (DMEM high glucose containing 10% FBS, 2% penicillin–streptomycin, 100 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM HEPES, and 1 nM insulin). The attached cells were then washed once in PBS and incubated overnight in low-glucose culture media (DMEM low glucose containing 10% FBS, 2% penicillin–streptomycin and 10 mM HEPES) for glucose production assays, or serum-free low-glucose culture medium (DMEM low glucose supplemented with 0.5% fatty acid free BSA, 2% penicillin–streptomycin, and 10 mM HEPES) for lipolysis assays. Following the overnight incubation, for glucose production assays, cells were washed twice with PBS and the media was replaced with 2 ml of substrate-replete glucose production medium (DMEM no-glucose base media containing 0.5% fatty acid-free BSA, 20 mM sodium lactate (50% 3-<sup>13</sup>C), 2 mM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM GlutaMAX, MEM non-essential amino acids, and 10 mM HEPES). After a s6 hr incubation at 37 °C, the media was collected.

Rodent livers were cored into smaller bits using the Alabama R&amp;D tissue coring press. Cored livers were sliced to the thickness of 230 microns, the lowest setting on the Alabama R&amp;D tissue slicer. Liver slices were transferred to 24-well plates containing gluconeogenesis media (DMEM without glucose but with 20 mM lactate, 2 mM pyruvate, 10 mM HEPES, and 44 mM sodium bicarbonate) (400 ul for mouse livers and 500 ul for rat livers). The 24-well plates were placed in a tissue culture incubator (5% CO<sub>2</sub>) and shaken at 80 RPM for 6 hr. At the end of the 6 hr incubation, liver slices and media were collected.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Malcolm J McConville as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by David James as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the new insights that the study provides into metabolic scaling with body mass and the use of different approaches to understand the mechanistic basis for scaling. However, a number of key issues were identified which need to be addressed.</p><p>1. All of the reviewers noted the need for further experimental data to support the conclusion that the species-specific differences in transcription of identified metabolic genes are reflected at the level of protein expression or enzyme activity. This could be addressed by reference to the author's own data, or to existing proteomics data-sets on the liver of different species and/or mRNA and proteome data within a single species.</p><p>2. Are there orthologues of the different liver enzymes that were found to scale with body size and are they also transcriptionally down-regulated as body size increases?</p><p>3. Do you see a similar transcriptional signature for other metabolic pathways that are known to inversely scale with body size (e.g. glycogen metabolism).</p><p>4. Specific sections in the manuscript (introduction, ideas/speculations) and some of the conclusions need to be changed/toned down in light of the reviewers' comments. Issues with the description of the flux analysis (reviewer 2) also need to be addressed to allow full assessment of the findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The title should be changed to reflect the lack of metabolic scaling in vitro assays.</p><p>Can the authors comment on the overall transcriptional activity of liver cells in different animals? Is it possible that global rates of transcription decrease in liver tissues of large animals and that the selective down-regulation of specific mRNA reflects differences in the rate of mRNA degradation?</p><p>Can the authors comment on levels of transcription or fluxes for other interconnected pathways of central carbon metabolism, such as the pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen turnover, (sugar) nucleotide biosynthesis? In particular, glycogen turnover has been shown to be much faster in mice than in humans (with cellular stores being exhausted during diurnal fasting in mice, but not in human tissues). It would be of interest to confirm that key enzymes in glycogen turnover exhibit scaling (at the level of transcription or activity) in the different animals and/or reference this example.</p><p>Can the authors comment on whether there are isoforms of the different enzymes that were found to scale with body size and whether the transcription of all isoforms was similarly related to body size?</p><p>It is proposed that enzymes involved in lipid peroxidation, and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide also inversely scale with body size. Is there any evidence for higher levels of oxidized lipids or hydrogen peroxide in mouse versus rat tissues (or tissues from other animals)?</p><p>The introduction is overly long and focused on summarizing the results of the current study.</p><p>The full names for all of the enzymes listed in Figure 1B (and the text) should be provided in the figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The title does not convey the findings well, since scaling was not observed in vitro.</p><p>2. To detect scaling, one needs to establish a linear relationship (in log-transformed variables). What is done in the current manuscript is that the ordering of trait values in terms of mass is identified; these are necessary but not sufficient for scaling. Specifications and clarifications are needed in multiple places in the manuscript.</p><p>3. The repetitive statements about correlation between mRNA expression and protein abundance are misleading and must be corroborated by data. The authors of the cited paper concluded &quot;our data indicates that mRNA and protein levels correlate better than previously thought.&quot; This does not imply a strong correlation.</p><p>4. There is no support for allometric scaling (allometric would require substantially more data, see my point 2, above) claimed in Figure 1. Figure 1 can be supplemented with GO enrichment analysis to inspect how pervasive is the ordering pattern.</p><p>5. Broad spectrum of fluxes in line 160 is an overstatement. Identification of fluxes by MFA ala Wichert et al. would allow for estimation of fluxes on the level of a metabolic network. This is not addressed in the current work and should be discussed.</p><p>6. The section starting with line 226 is obsolete. Machine learning here refers to classical clustering and should have been named as such.</p><p>7. The section on ideas and speculations is far-fetched.</p><p>8. The analysis of gene expression should detail the one-way ANOVA, given that only two replicates were used. In addition, the statement about p-value adjustment on line 352 is not understandable as currently written.</p><p>9. The statement on line 78 is difficult to follow, some words are out of place.</p><p>10. Metabolic flux analysis is by definition tracer-based, so the adjective is not needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work explores new parameters to characterize metabolic scaling. Instead of analyzing oxygen consumption, as has been used before, the authors focus on gene expression and metabolic fluxes. Gene expression data sets were analyzed for 5 species with widely varied body masses, whereas the metabolic studies were performed for mouse and rat, the closest phylogenetic species studied and the closest in body mass. A subset including an unspecified number of genes, predominantly related to metabolic pathways, followed the pattern of metabolic scaling across the 5 species. When the authors analyzed metabolic fluxes in vitro using primary hepatocytes, there was an absence of scaling, confirming similar reports. Studies ex vivo using liver slices (with limited replicates) and in vivo showed increased metabolic fluxes in mice compared with rats. Most of the measurements are focused on the liver, with one measurement of fatty acid turnover reflecting adipose tissue. This is at odds with the authors' apparent claim that there were differences in multiple tissues. Additionally, 11 of 16 metabolic enzymes that scaled also required molecular oxygen. Consequently, is not clear whether the gene expression scaling just reflects the differences in oxygen consumption, as has been reported.</p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>– The title implies that multiple tissues were analyzed, when in fact liver was the focus.</p><p>– How many genes from the total number of genes analyzed followed the pattern of metabolic scaling? Is this a pattern or particular for a set of the 20 genes shown in the manuscript? Are those genes expected to change scaling when mutated?</p><p>– Are the genes in Figure 1B. related to TCA cycle or electron transport chain?</p><p>– The authors should discuss the limitations of having performed metabolic flux studies only in the two most closely related species. Can we assume that scaling of metabolic fluxes continues over the very large range of body masses of the species that were not analyzed? Or is it possible that scaling only occurs up to a threshold value of body mass?</p><p>– The ex vivo studies appear to have been conducted using n = 2 for rats. Numbers of animals should be explicitly stated, as well as biological and technical replicates for in vitro and ex vivo experiments.</p><p>– Male animals were used.

However, a number of key issues were identified which need to be addressed.</p><p>1. All of the reviewers noted the need for further experimental data to support the conclusion that the species-specific differences in transcription of identified metabolic genes are reflected at the level of protein expression or enzyme activity. This could be addressed by reference to the author's own data, or to existing proteomics data-sets on the liver of different species and/or mRNA and proteome data within a single species.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point, we have analyzed proteomics data from liver in mice, rats, and humans (unfortunately, all of the open-source data available lacked monkey and cow, so we were not able to extend the analyses to these species). Of the 20 genes that were found to correlate inversely with body mass in the transcriptomics analysis, eight translated proteins were found in the proteomics analysis. Of these eight, three exhibited an inverse correlation between body mass and protein expression.</p><p>Additionally, to begin to ascertain the generalizability of metabolic scaling at the protein level to tissues beyond liver, we also analyzed available proteomics in the left ventricle of the heart. One of the three proteins observed to correlate negatively with body mass in the proteomics analysis of liver, GLUL, was also shown to correlate negatively with body mass when its expression was assessed in the heart.</p><p>However, we recognize that we need to interpret these data carefully, because of the limited samples available: n=1 for each of these proteomics analyses, so statistical analysis was not possible. The sample size is limited because, unlike transcriptomics, it is not possible to combine proteomics data obtained from different instruments at different times under different processing conditions. We did not measure protein expression by Western blot because these results would require us to use antibodies with equal ability to bind to mouse and rat protein, which in most cases is infeasible. However, we have now measured activity of pyruvate carboxylase and of peroxidase in mouse and rat liver enzymatically. These data show lower activity of both enzymes in rats as compared to mice, suggesting that differences in enzyme activity as well as gene/protein transcription could underlie the metabolic scaling phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Are there orthologues of the different liver enzymes that were found to scale with body size and are they also transcriptionally down-regulated as body size increases?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point, we measured concentrations of the canonical liver enzymes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in mice, rats, and humans. We do, indeed, observe scaling: both ALT and AST concentrations were lowest in humans, followed by rats, and highest in mice.</p><p>The transcriptional data reveal a reverse correlation with body mass in ALT (human gene name: <italic>GPT</italic>), but not AST, while the proteomic data did not demonstrate an inverse correlation with body mass in either enzyme. These data, as well as the lack of a reverse correlation between body mass and metabolic fluxes in hepatocytes, suggest that transcription/translation is one mechanism by which metabolic scaling may be accomplished in vivo, and that there are likely others as well (such as enzyme activity: data on pyruvate carboxylase and peroxidase activity have now been added in response to point #1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Do you see a similar transcriptional signature for other metabolic pathways that are known to inversely scale with body size (e.g. glycogen metabolism).</p></disp-quote><p>The genes shown in Figure 2 are the only genes that exhibit a reverse correlation with body mass. We believe that while some of the phenomenon of metabolic scaling is directed by gene expression, some is not; this explains the dissociation between the lack of scaling of enzymes in the glycogen synthetic or glycogenolytic pathways, and the observed differences in rates of glycogenolysis. We have now added a direct assessment of the rate of net hepatic glycogenolysis between 0 and 4 hours of fasting, and confirm, in our hands, that glycogenolysis rates are lower in rats than mice, albeit with a smaller difference than other metabolic processes we measured in vivo.</p><p>We are not aware of other organ-specific metabolic processes that are well-established to scale with body size, after searching both prior to the initial submission, and upon preparing the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Specific sections in the manuscript (introduction, ideas/speculations) and some of the conclusions need to be changed/toned down in light of the reviewers' comments. Issues with the description of the flux analysis (reviewer 2) also need to be addressed to allow full assessment of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially revised the introduction, including, but not limited to:</p><p>– Editing “Since at basal levels, gene expression of metabolic genes closely approximates protein levels (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011), we hypothesized that genes related to the regulation of oxygen consumption and substrate metabolism may scale, and thus provide a mechanistic basis for metabolic scaling” to “Beginning at the transcriptional level, we studied…”.</p><p>– Substantially reducing the description of both the transcriptomics and fluxomics studies.</p><p>– Editing the final sentence of the introduction to “Taken together, this study demonstrates variation of metabolic fluxes according to body size, extending prior studies of metabolic scaling, and provides unique insight into the regulation of metabolic flux across species.”</p><p>– Adding the words in red to “The concept of hierarchical regulation, whereby gene expression initiates the cascade that allows for flux through metabolic pathways (Rossell et al., 2005; Suarez and Moyes, 2012), provides a systems framework to begin to understand scaling.”</p><p>With regard to the ideas/speculations, we respectfully respond that we agree to an extent, but this section was written in response to an announcement from <italic>eLife</italic> on 11/9/2021 (<italic>eLife</italic> Latest: Including “Ideas and Speculation” in <italic>eLife</italic> papers | Inside <italic>eLife</italic> | <italic>eLife</italic> (elifesciences.org)), which appears to imply that this is the section in which such ideas are welcomed at <italic>eLife</italic> (emphasis added by our group):</p><p>“…As a result, the “Discussion” section of papers, which was once the home to much speculation, has over the years become a repository of only the most obvious and strongest conclusions, along with any accompanying caveats. And when authors try to include ideas that arise from, but which are not yet well supported by, the data, it is common for reviewers to demand that such speculation be removed.</p><p>While we agree that it makes sense to differentiate conclusions, we also feel something important is lost for both readers and authors by denying the people most familiar with the data the chance to freely speculate about its meaning and implications. Indeed it is one of the more common complaints of authors that current norms in peer review largely deny them this opportunity.</p><p>This section will be reviewed, but only for factual inaccuracies, clarity and speculation not germane to the paper. Some types of speculation – especially things that could be interpreted as suggestions for clinical practice – will not be allowed. But overall, this will be a place for authors to share their ideas about their work.”</p><p>As such, we believe that this section is written in accordance with the description of the section, in order to discuss “ideas that arise from, but which are not yet well supported by, the data.” We are completely open to editing if we misunderstood the purpose of this section, but we do respectfully believe that it is written consistently with the description of this section published in 2021.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The title should be changed to reflect the lack of metabolic scaling in vitro assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have changed the title to “Gene and Protein Expression and Metabolic Flux Analysis Reveals Metabolic Scaling in Liver ex vivo and in vivo”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors comment on the overall transcriptional activity of liver cells in different animals? Is it possible that global rates of transcription decrease in liver tissues of large animals and that the selective down-regulation of specific mRNA reflects differences in the rate of mRNA degradation?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that differences in the global rate of mRNA degradation between species contributes to differences in enzyme expression; however, our data showing that enzyme activity is different in mice versus rats would indirectly argue against that hypothesis.</p><p>However, to more directly address this point, we have now measured mRNA expression of three enzymes in different pathways that inversely correlate with body mass at the transcriptional level (<italic>Glul, Lipe,</italic> and <italic>Dlst</italic>) in livers from our own mice and rats relative to <italic>Actb,</italic> the gene that codes for b-actin. We find that expression of all three enzymes relative to <italic>Actb</italic> is lower in rats as compared to mice.</p><p>These data suggest that metabolic scaling on the transcriptional level is not a consequence of global alterations in mRNA turnover, because if, for instance, increased mRNA turnover were the cause of differential gene expression, we would expect no difference in the ratios of metabolic enzyme expression to b-actin expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors comment on levels of transcription or fluxes for other interconnected pathways of central carbon metabolism, such as the pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen turnover, (sugar) nucleotide biosynthesis? In particular, glycogen turnover has been shown to be much faster in mice than in humans (with cellular stores being exhausted during diurnal fasting in mice, but not in human tissues). It would be of interest to confirm that key enzymes in glycogen turnover exhibit scaling (at the level of transcription or activity) in the different animals and/or reference this example.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not observe scaling of enzymes in the glycogen synthesis or glycogenolysis pathways at the transcriptional or protein level (the enzymes shown in the transcriptomics analysis were the only metabolic enzymes that scaled). However, in this revision, we have now measured rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis. We do observe lower rates of net hepatic glycogenolysis in rats versus mice, albeit with a smaller difference than was observed in other fluxes measured in this manuscript.</p><p>Taken together, we believe that while some of the phenomenon of metabolic scaling is directed by gene expression, some is not; this explains the dissociation between the lack of an inverse relationship between body size and expression of enzymes in the glycogen synthetic or glycogenolytic pathways, and the observed differences in rates of glycogenolysis. We have added a comment in the Discussion clarifying that not all scaling can be explained at the transcriptional level:</p><p>“[I]t should be noted that metabolic scaling cannot fully be explained at the transcriptional level, because many rate-limiting enzymes in the metabolic processes measured in vivo did not scale at the transcriptional level, and only approximately half of genes that scaled at the level of mRNA scaled at the level of protein. Thus, it is likely that both transcriptional and other mechanisms – such as enzyme activity – are responsible for variations in metabolic flux per unit mass, inversely proportionally to body size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors comment on whether there are isoforms of the different enzymes that were found to scale with body size and whether the transcription of all isoforms was similarly related to body size?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, to our knowledge after an extensive search, the available liver transcriptomics and proteomics data do not allow us to assess potential scaling of different isoforms of key enzymes across species. However, this is an important possibility, and we have added a comment in the Discussion acknowledging this limitation:</p><p>“Additionally, the currently available data do not allow us to assess whether expression of certain isoforms of key metabolic enzymes scale differentially across species.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is proposed that enzymes involved in lipid peroxidation, and detoxification of hydrogen peroxide also inversely scale with body size. Is there any evidence for higher levels of oxidized lipids or hydrogen peroxide in mouse versus rat tissues (or tissues from other animals)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion, and have now measured hepatic peroxidase activity in mouse and rat samples. We observe a 30% reduction in peroxidase activity in rats as compared to mice.</p><p>These data provide evidence for scaling in the peroxidation pathway, and have been added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction is overly long and focused on summarizing the results of the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this issue and thank the reviewer for their feedback. In response, we have removed the following sections from the Introduction:</p><p>– …”substrate fluxes including lipolysis, gluconeogenesis, and substrate contributions to mitochondrial oxidation”.</p><p>– “Due to the relatively recent advances in high throughput mRNA sequencing and bioinformatics tools that allow for intra-specific data preprocessing (Bray et al., 2016; Conesa et al., 2016; Ritchie et al., 2015), we searched for a set of genes whose expression follows the pattern of metabolic scaling in the liver, the metabolic hub of mammals. Since at basal levels, gene expression of metabolic genes closely approximates protein levels (Schwanhäusser et al., 2011), we hypothesized that genes related to the regulation of oxygen consumption and substrate metabolism may scale, and thus provide a mechanistic basis for metabolic scaling.”</p><p>– “[Transcriptomics]…informed our isotope-tracer based in vitro and in vivo metabolic flux studies.”</p><p>– “[To determine if gene expression would reveal] a mechanistic read out of metabolic enzyme function,…”.</p><p>– [We utilized methods] to measure mitochondrial oxidation of glucose and fatty acids, gluconeogenesis from pyruvate and glycerol, and white adipose tissue lipolysis in rats and mice at multiple nodes of complexity: in vitro in hepatocytes; ex vivo in liver slices comprised of hepatocytes plus the surrounding stellate, Kupffer, and sinusoidal endothelial cells; and in vivo in conscious mice.”</p><p>– “gene expression in livers showed that scaling occurs to regulate oxygen consumption and substrate supply, isotope-based tracer studies in mice and rats demonstrated the mechanistic function of these enzymes in vivo which was only apparent in the living organism rather than plated cells.”</p><p>With these changes, the word count in the Introduction is reduced by 40% (from 704 to 422 words) and the section is substantially less focused on the results of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The full names for all of the enzymes listed in Figure 1B (and the text) should be provided in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion and have now included the full names for all of the enzymes in Figure 1B (all of which are also contained in the text), as well as in Figure 2, in the respective figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The title does not convey the findings well, since scaling was not observed in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have changed the title to “Gene and Protein Expression and Metabolic Flux Analysis Reveals Metabolic Scaling in Liver ex vivo and in vivo”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To detect scaling, one needs to establish a linear relationship (in log-transformed variables). What is done in the current manuscript is that the ordering of trait values in terms of mass is identified; these are necessary but not sufficient for scaling. Specifications and clarifications are needed in multiple places in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In several places in the current manuscript, we have replaced the term “metabolic scaling” with “metabolic trait ordering” or an equivalent term, including:</p><p>– In the Introduction, replacing “To determine whether flux through key implicated metabolic pathways scaled…” with “To determine whether flux through key metabolic pathways was ordered inversely to body size…”.</p><p>– Editing the phrase “while scaling of metabolic fluxes is not observed in the cell-autonomous setting, it is present in liver slices and in vivo” to replace “scaling” with “ordering”.</p><p>– Editing “Beginning at the transcriptional basis for metabolic scaling…” to “Beginning at the transcriptional level…” in the Introduction.</p><p>– Editing the comment in the Introduction that numerous genes “followed the pattern of metabolic scaling” to “were expressed at levels inverse to body size”.</p><p>– Reporting proteomics results in the Introduction: “Further analysis of liver proteomics revealed that approximately half of the genes in liver that were expressed inversely proportionally to body size at the transcriptional level, were also expressed at levels inversely proportional to body size at the level of protein expression”.</p><p>– Editing “Taken together, this study demonstrates systems regulation of metabolic scaling: gene expression in livers showed that scaling occurs to regulate oxygen consumption and substrate supply, isotope-based tracer studies in mice and rats demonstrated the mechanistic function of these enzymes in vivo which was only apparent in the living organism rather than plated cells.

of the Introduction or Discussion in which we discussed prior literature in which the term “metabolic scaling” was used, generally referring to data demonstrating that metabolic rates (i.e. oxygen consumption) scale to ¾ of an organism’s body mass.</p><p>In addition, we would like to respectfully suggest that the definition of metabolic scaling defined as the relationship of metabolic flux to ¾ of body mass is defined because of the input data, while our work is asking a different question: we are not suggesting that oxygen consumption per whole organism does not scale inversely to ¾ of body mass; however, the fact that organ-specific metabolism may scale differently does not mean that the observed phenotype is not metabolic scaling. It is possible that different metabolic processes and/or metabolism in different organs scale differently, and in fact, this is what our data suggest. To address this important point, we have added a comment in the Discussion:</p><p>“It is important to note that the metabolic processes which we observed to be higher in mice as compared to rats did not necessarily adhere quantitatively to the classic metabolic scaling relationship, with metabolic rates proportional to three-quarters of body mass. This speaks to the fact that the scaling relationship is multidimensional: it is entirely conceivable that whole-body oxygen consumption could be proportional to three-quarters of body mass, while other metabolic processes may exhibit a different scaling relationship. Further studies across species beyond rodents will be required to address this question.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The repetitive statements about correlation between mRNA expression and protein abundance are misleading and must be corroborated by data. The authors of the cited paper concluded &quot;our data indicates that mRNA and protein levels correlate better than previously thought.&quot; This does not imply a strong correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point, and have now added proteomics data, as described in our response to Reviewer 2’s Public Evaluation comment #1. In addition, in response to Reviewer 2’s point, we have softened the discussion of the implications of the transcriptomics data as described in our response to Reviewer #2’s point 1 (our response begins “Additionally, we have substantially softened the description of the implications of the transcriptomics data in the Introduction and Discussion…”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. There is no support for allometric scaling (allometric would require substantially more data, see my point 2, above) claimed in Figure 1. Figure 1 can be supplemented with GO enrichment analysis to inspect how pervasive is the ordering pattern.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, we reiterate our response to the previous comment to emphasize that it is our view that scaling may occur across different scales when examining different metabolic processes, and while oxygen consumption has been the setting of metabolic scaling that has been most studied, this does not mean that the concept of metabolic scaling must be defined exclusively as the relationship between body mass and oxygen consumption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Broad spectrum of fluxes in line 160 is an overstatement. Identification of fluxes by MFA ala Wichert et al. would allow for estimation of fluxes on the level of a metabolic network. This is not addressed in the current work and should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the phrase “broad spectrum of fluxes”, and fully agree that the metabolic flux analysis discussed conceptually by Wiechert (Metabolic Engineering 2001) represents a means of utilizing stable isotope tracer analysis to generate a comprehensive picture of metabolic fluxes. We fully agree that the conceptual framework laid forth by Dr. Wiechert presents a means of comprehensively assessing substrate metabolism. However, we would respectfully submit that this is a theoretical paper presenting no data in live animals. We completely agree that such an analysis would be of great interest in further widening the scope of our understanding of metabolic scaling and have added a comment to this effect in the Discussion; however, we believe that this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript: “Future studies using metabolic flux analysis may have further capacity to generate new insights as to the scope and mechanism of metabolic scaling (Wiechert, 2001).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The section starting with line 226 is obsolete.

Metabolic flux analysis is by definition tracer-based, so the adjective is not needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, although there have been many unfortunate examples of metabolomics data being improperly interpreted as equivalent to flux, and we aimed to make clear that this was not such a case. Nevertheless, the reviewer is without question correct, and we have removed “tracer-based” from the title and the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This work explores new parameters to characterize metabolic scaling. Instead of analyzing oxygen consumption, as has been used before, the authors focus on gene expression and metabolic fluxes. Gene expression data sets were analyzed for 5 species with widely varied body masses, whereas the metabolic studies were performed for mouse and rat, the closest phylogenetic species studied and the closest in body mass. A subset including an unspecified number of genes, predominantly related to metabolic pathways, followed the pattern of metabolic scaling across the 5 species. When the authors analyzed metabolic fluxes in vitro using primary hepatocytes, there was an absence of scaling, confirming similar reports. Studies ex vivo using liver slices (with limited replicates) and in vivo showed increased metabolic fluxes in mice compared with rats. Most of the measurements are focused on the liver, with one measurement of fatty acid turnover reflecting adipose tissue. This is at odds with the authors' apparent claim that there were differences in multiple tissues. Additionally, 11 of 16 metabolic enzymes that scaled also required molecular oxygen. Consequently, is not clear whether the gene expression scaling just reflects the differences in oxygen consumption, as has been reported.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point, as it is possible: as the reviewer as mentioned, oxygen consumption has been shown to exert numerous metabolic alterations on cells. We have now added a comment acknowledging this point in the Discussion:</p><p>“[O]ur data do not allow us to ascertain whether differences in oxygen consumption orchestrate metabolic alterations, as has been suggested in the setting of cancer cells (Nakazawa et al., 2016), or metabolic alterations require changes in oxygen consumption.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific issues:</p><p>– The title implies that multiple tissues were analyzed, when in fact liver was the focus.</p></disp-quote><p>Liver was the focus, as the reviewer says, but white adipose tissue was also assessed in vivo with the inclusion of whole-body lipolysis. We have now added transcriptomic data from heart as well. However, we completely agree with the reviewer’s point that the primary focus of this manuscript was and is liver metabolism. As such we have edited the title to “Gene and Protein Expression and Tracer-Based Metabolic Flux Analysis Reveals Metabolic Scaling in Liver ex vivo and in vivo”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How many genes from the total number of genes analyzed followed the pattern of metabolic scaling? Is this a pattern or particular for a set of the 20 genes shown in the manuscript? Are those genes expected to change scaling when mutated?</p></disp-quote><p>The genes shown were the only ones to show an inverse correlation between gene expression and body mass. We interpret this as indicating that some of the inverse correlation between body mass and metabolic rate might be explained by variations in gene transcription (and even less by protein translation, as evidenced by the fact that only three of eight genes that scaled at the level of transcription and were contained in the proteomics dataset showed an inverse correlation with body size, although we must be clear that the proteomics analysis contained a limited n of 1). However, there must also be mechanistic underpinnings of the metabolic scaling phenotype that are outside of gene/protein expression, such as enzyme activity, as evidenced by our liver pyruvate carboxylase and peroxidase activity data.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are no data to suggest whether or not flux through the metabolic enzymes identified through the transcriptomics analysis would change when mutated. However, one would fully expect that, for instance, rendering these enzymes constitutively active would increase flux through those pathways, and might contribute to an overall increase in oxygen consumption. We would anticipate that if, for example, an enzyme in a rat were activated by a mutation to increase its activity to that observed in a mouse, that the metabolic scaling phenomenon would disappear. Future studies will be necessary to dissect this possibility. We have added a comment to this effect in the final paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“It may be that if one were to alter the activity of an enzyme in a larger species using a mutation to increase it to the level of activity of the same enzyme in a smaller species, that the phenomenon of metabolic scaling might disappear. Future work will be required to examine this possibility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are the genes in Figure 1B. related to TCA cycle or electron transport chain?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #3 for raising this point, and fully agree that a more accurate term is “electron transport.&quot; Thus, we have edited Figure 1B accordingly:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should discuss the limitations of having performed metabolic flux studies only in the two most closely related species. Can we assume that scaling of metabolic fluxes continues over the very large range of body masses of the species that were not analyzed? Or is it possible that scaling only occurs up to a threshold value of body mass?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the existing data and computational modeling, it is likely that there is not such a threshold, at least in mammals, although our study cannot answer that question. We have, as suggested, added a section to address this important point:</p><p>“Additionally, there are limitations to the fact that metabolic flux studies were performed only in the two arguably most related species included in the transcriptomics analysis (with monkey and human perhaps being similarly related). Our laboratory does not have the capacity to perform flux analysis in larger or smaller species, but we fully recognize that widening our scope beyond the 10-fold range in body size between mice and rats may yield different results. For example, it is possible that the mathematical relationship between body size and metabolic flux may reach a threshold of body size, after which this relationship may change. However, experimental and computational data suggest that the metabolic scaling relationship with regard to oxygen consumption holds at least from birds to cattle, and that a similar – but not identical – scaling relationship exists in plants (Niklas and Kutschera, 2015), so we posit that it is likely that if such a threshold exists, it occurs at a body size orders of magnitude larger than the rodents included in our study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The ex vivo studies appear to have been conducted using n = 2 for rats. Numbers of animals should be explicitly stated, as well as biological and technical replicates for in vitro and ex vivo experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the numbers for each experiment (biological and, if applicable, technical replicates) to the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Male animals were used. Is there a basis for not also studying female mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that potential sex differences in metabolic scaling are an important point, and as such have added analyses of metabolic fluxes in male (duplicated from an earlier figure, as noted in the figure legend) and female rats and mice. We did not observe any differences in glucose production, pyruvate carboxylase flux, citrate synthase flux, the contribution of glucose or fatty acids to total mitochondrial oxidation, or whole-body lipolysis (fatty acid turnover) between male and female mice or male and female rats: all fluxes were similarly lower in rats as compared to mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The writing throughout the manuscript is laden with jargon and difficult to follow. There are sentences that are convoluted and do not make sense. Some of the jargon is not defined. The manuscript should be carefully edited throughout, including figure labeling and legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited extensively in response to this important comment, and hope the reviewer will agree that the manuscript is much clearer after revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
