Brain and muscle activity naturally correlate via the output of motor neurons, but apart from simple movements it has been difficult to define behavior in terms of muscle contractions. By mapping the musculature of the pupal fruit fly and comprehensively imaging muscle activation at single-cell resolution, we here describe a multiphasic behavioral sequence in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our characterization identifies a previously undescribed behavioral phase and permits extraction of major movements by a convolutional neural network. We deconstruct movements into a syllabary of co-active muscles and identify specific syllables that are sensitive to neuromodulatory manipulations. We find that muscle activity shows considerable variability, with sequential increases in stereotypy dependent upon neuromodulation. Our work provides a platform for studying whole-animal behavior, quantifying its variability across multiple spatiotemporal scales, and analyzing its neuromodulatory regulation at cellular resolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>How do we find out how the brain works? One way is to use imaging techniques to visualise an animal’s brain in action as it performs simple behaviours: as the animal moves, parts of its brain light up under the microscope. For laboratory animals like fruit flies, which have relatively small brains, this lets us observe their brain activity right down to the level of individual brain cells.</p><p>The brain directs movements via collective activity of the body’s muscles. Our ability to track the activity of individual muscles is, however, more limited than our ability to observe single brain cells: even modern imaging technology still cannot monitor the activity of all the muscle cells in an animal’s body as it moves about. Yet this is precisely the information that scientists need to fully understand how the brain generates behaviour.</p><p>Fruit flies perform specific behaviours at certain stages of their life cycle. When the fly pupa begins to metamorphose into an adult insect, it performs a fixed sequence of movements involving a set number of muscles, which is called the pupal ecdysis sequence. This initial movement sequence and the rest of metamorphosis both occur within the confines of the pupal case, which is a small, hardened shell surrounding the whole animal. Elliott et al. set out to determine if the fruit fly pupa’s ecdysis sequence could be used as a kind of model, to describe a simple behaviour at the level of individual muscles.</p><p>Imaging experiments used fly pupae that were genetically engineered to produce an activity-dependent fluorescent protein in their muscle cells. Pupal cases were treated with a chemical to make them transparent, allowing easy observation of their visually ‘labelled’ muscles. This yielded a near-complete record of muscle activity during metamorphosis.</p><p>Initially, individual muscles became active in small groups. The groups then synchronised with each other over the different regions of the pupa’s body to form distinct movements, much as syllables join to form words. This synchronisation was key to progression through metamorphosis and was co-ordinated at each step by specialised nerve cells that produce or respond to specific hormones.</p><p>These results reveal how the brain might direct muscle activity to produce movement patterns. In the future, Elliott et al. hope to compare data on muscle activity with comprehensive records of brain cell activity, to shed new light on how the brain, muscles, and other factors work together to control behaviour.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>computational ethology</kwd><kwd>bursicon</kwd><kwd>CCAP</kwd><kwd>ecdysis</kwd><kwd>ecdysis triggering hormone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F12-GM117582</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elliott</surname><given-names>Amicia D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIA-MH002800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Benjamin H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>NIDDK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chow</surname><given-names>Carson C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000070</institution-id><institution>NIBIB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shroff</surname><given-names>Hari</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The elementary units of a fruit fly behavioral sequence are described at single-muscle resolution and shown to exhibit variability that is subject to neuromodulatory regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A major goal of neuroscience is explaining how nervous systems generate and organize behavior. This requires describing behavior in terms that can be correlated with neural activity. The dynamics of brain activity can be observed in whole brains at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardiel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nguyen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>), but behavioral dynamics has not been captured at a similar level of detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Datta et al., 2019</xref>). While progress in fine-mapping natural behavior, or ‘computational ethology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Perona, 2014</xref>), has benefited from recent advances in visual tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>), 3D imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2015</xref>), machine vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dankert et al., 2009</xref>), machine learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kabra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Machado et al., 2015</xref>), and image feature extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wiltschko et al., 2015</xref>), the primary focus of these efforts has been kinematic, seeking to define anatomical movements at higher resolution. While movements are the essential components of behavior, they are complex products of motor neuron activity, which must balance the contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles and must also promote anatomical rigidity that supports movement. Here, we bridge the gap between motor neuron activity and movement by describing muscle activity at the single-cell level.</p><p>Comprehensively monitoring muscle activity in behaving animals is achievable with genetically encoded Ca<sup>++</sup> indicators and has been demonstrated at single-cell resolution in hydra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Szymanski and Yuste, 2019</xref>), roundworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardiel et al., 2017</xref>), and larval fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>). However, the application of muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> imaging to characterize more complex sequences has been constrained by the challenge of tracking behavior in freely moving animals. This problem is resolved in pupal fruit flies where behavior is restricted to the puparium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>), which can be clarified for optical access to the confined animal. The pupa maintains a fixed position and orientation during movement, and all behavior is executed within a delimited field of view. Pupal Ca<sup>++</sup> activity imaging of muscles has been previously demonstrated using GCaMP6s by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref>, who showed that the bulk Ca<sup>++</sup> signal collected over ventral muscles exhibits temporal patterns that conform well to known body wall movements.</p><p>The behavioral hallmark of pupal development is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal ecdysis sequence, which is one of a general class of behavioral sequences used by insects to molt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Truman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zitnan and Adams, 2012</xref>). These sequences typically divide into three principal phases during which the animal first loosens and then sheds its old exoskeleton before expanding its newly secreted one. Ecdysis sequences are strongly dependent on the action of hormones for their initiation and progression, and together with vertebrate reproductive behaviors, they have long served as a useful model of hormone-behavior interactions. Neural control of ecdysis behaviors is typically exercised by a conserved complement of hormones including eclosion hormone, ecdysis triggering hormone (ETH), crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), and Bursicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ewer and Reynolds, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White and Ewer, 2014</xref>). The sites of action of these hormones within the nervous system have been principally studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but detailed neuroethological studies have been undertaken in larger insects, such as the locust, <italic>Schistocerca gregaria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes, 1980a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hughes, 1980b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hughes, 1980c</xref>), and cricket, <italic>Teleogryllus oceanicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlson and Bentley, 1977</xref>). Motor program organization of the adult ecdysis sequences in these insects is quite stereotyped, suggesting central control of motor execution, but sensory feedback can also modulate behavioral performance. While characterization of central nervous system (CNS) activity underlying ecdysis sequences has remained limited in larger insects, progress has been made in <italic>Drosophila</italic> where a fictive ecdysis sequence can be elicited in an excised pupal brain by exposure to ETH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mena et al., 2016</xref>). Fictive activity imaged using Ca<sup>++</sup> indicators grossly correlates with the motor patterns executed during pupal ecdysis, but comprehensively interpreting CNS activity remains a challenge.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal ecdysis sequence occurs at the onset of metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and has been adapted to initiate transformation of the body plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Although it occurs in the context of the pupal molt and has three principal phases characterized by distinct motor programs, its function in molting is limited to casting off the cuticular linings of the gut and trachea. Its primary function is, instead, to create internal pressure at points along the body to evert adult parts such as the head, legs, and wings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denlinger and Zdarek, 1994</xref>). ETH initiates the pupal ecdysis sequence after a long period of behavioral quiescence and targets neurons that express its two receptor isoforms, ETHRA and ETHRB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Neurons expressing ETHRB are largely dispensable during larval life, but are essential for pupal ecdysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diao et al., 2016</xref>). Neurons expressing ETHRA include the neuroendocrine cells that secrete CCAP and Bursicon. These cells are likewise essential at pupal, but not larval, ecdysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2003</xref>). They become active approximately 10 min after the onset of pupal ecdysis, and their activation mediates the transition to the next behavioral phase. Understanding how the nervous system transforms such hormonal signals into temporally ordered behavioral sequences will require a more complete description of the motor neuron activity that dictates the behavioral sequences themselves.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pupal ecdysis behavior and muscle anatomy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of metamorphosis from puparium formation (PF at 0 hr) to eclosion (~100 hr) with the time of pupal ecdysis (arrow) indicated. Other significant events in pupal development include two major periods of tissue histolysis prior to and following pupal ecdysis as well as the times of larval-to-pupal and pupal-to-adult apolysis when separation from the cuticle of the previous developmental stage occurs.

Using improved imaging methods—including a new pan-muscle LexA driver that permits dual imaging of muscle and neuron activity—we identify novel elements of the pupal ecdysis sequence, including previously undescribed movements and a phase of stochastic muscle activity preceding ecdysis. We find that muscle activity exhibits a high degree of variability, with individual muscles recruited stochastically into repeating small ensembles, which we call syllables. Syllable activity is synchronized over anatomical compartments to form movements, which are sufficiently stereotyped to be learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN; for code see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BenjaminHWhite/muscle_activity">https://github.com/BenjaminHWhite/muscle_activity</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:9a7d52ab5549b6361bb5184fc725ec40f4026206;origin=https://github.com/BenjaminHWhite/muscle_activity;visit=swh:1:snp:9df78616a50987bf1038d5dcc9782ff964a9ca6b;anchor=swh:1:rev:66456f6ff61e8faa9fe4b442b91ef3fce3b178f9">swh:1:rev:66456f6ff61e8faa9fe4b442b91ef3fce3b178f9</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">White, 2021</xref>). We can prevent synchronization at specific motor program transitions by suppressing neuromodulatory neurons, which is lethal. The suppression of proprioceptive neurons, which blocks initiation of pupal ecdysis, is also unexpectedly lethal. Overall, our analysis at single-cell resolution reveals a dynamical system in which movements are not rigidly specified but form from variable components subject to neuromodulatory reorganization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pupal behavior described at cellular resolution</title><p>Previous characterization of pupal ecdysis has distinguished three principal phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The first phase (P1) consists of sustained longitudinal compression (‘lifting’) of posterior abdominal segments accompanied by unilateral, anteriorly propagating, ‘rolling contractions’ of the dorsal body wall that alternate left-to-right. The second (P2) features left-to-right alternating lateral ‘swinging’ movements formed by unilateral, anteriorly directed contractions, while the third (P3) consists of alternating left-right posteriorly directed contractions that change into bilaterally symmetric, backward peristaltic contractions. These phases always proceed in the same order. The movements increase internal pressure to evert the head (i.e., force it out of the body cavity) and push the developing legs and wings to the body surface and elongate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zdarek and Friedman, 1986</xref>). Phalloidin labeling demonstrates that approximately half of larval muscles persist until pupal ecdysis, and all retain innervation by Ib synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prokop, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The most prominent loss of muscles occurs in the ventral and posterior compartments. Only 5 of 13 larval ventral muscles survive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F vs. G</xref>), and one of these (M12) is absent in posterior segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Also missing from posterior segments are muscles M4 and M5. All five dorsal longitudinal muscles, except M4, are present in all segments, as are five of the six lateral transverse muscles. This was consistent across 17 animals, indicating that pupal ecdysis is executed by a standard set of persistent larval muscles.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-68656-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Pupal ecdysis behavior (lateral view).</title><p>Bright-field video taken from the lateral side showing a pupa performing the pupal ecdysis sequence. Phases 1–3 are labeled.

It begins approximately 3 hr before P1 and divides into distinct bouts of muscle activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Individual muscle length changes during P0 are small (≤25%) compared to P1–P3 (25–40%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and coincide with small body wall twitches rather than coherent movements. Such twitches are also observed during embryonic motor development and are initially myogenic, but later become neurogenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crisp et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crisp et al., 2011</xref>). To determine if random P0 muscle activation is myogenic or neurogenic, we created a dual-reporter fly line with <italic>hlk-LexA</italic> driving expression of the red fluorescent Ca<sup>++</sup> biosensor jRGECO in the muscle and VGlut-Gal4 driving a Synaptotagmin-GCaMP6s fusion protein (Syt-GCaMP6s) in motor neurons, where it localizes to the neuromuscular junction (NMJ, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In vivo imaging revealed synaptic Ca<sup>++</sup> activity at the NMJ 30–40 min prior to the first muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As P0 progresses, coincident synaptic and muscle activity increases until the onset of P1, when nearly all muscles and their synaptic inputs are synchronously active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) except M12, which remains unresponsive to input until P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Near-complete muscle responsiveness may serve as a checkpoint for starting the ecdysis sequence and is possibly implemented by proprioceptive feedback.

The order in which muscles were activated in bouts of P1 yielded an SS of 0.44 ± 0.17, indicating low similarity. However, this SS differed significantly from that of shuffled sequences (0.32 ± 0.12, p&lt;0.001). The sequences are thus not entirely random. Variability was evident between animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and for individual P1 movements across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, blue plots). The low similarity of muscle activity patterns suggested that movements may be generated by muscles that are consistently active together even when their individual activation times vary between bouts. Co-active muscle groups have been shown to be important for larval locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>); we thus identified groups of muscles for which (1) all muscles were co-active in three or more consecutive frames, (2) the group was identified in at least 80% of the movements in a given animal, and (3) the group was identified in at least 80% of animals. We found eight co-active muscle groups, which we call ‘pupal muscle ensembles’ (PMEs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Muscles forming a PME are not recruited in a consistent order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In addition, we found several muscles that individually satisfied criteria (b) and (c), but not as part of a group. Collectively with the PMEs, we call these movement-associated muscles ‘syllables,’ and those active in the eight pupal ecdysis movements are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Co-active muscles define movement syllables.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Distribution of similarity scores (SS) for single-muscle (M) activation sequences or syllable sequences in four manually annotated <italic>hlk</italic>&gt;GCaMP6s animals, named 917, 115, 821, 925.

Surprisingly, the order in which syllables were recruited was quite variable, with SSs below 0.5. However, those of P2 and P3 movements were significantly more consistent than the sequence of recruited individual muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Syllables associated with P1 movements showed SSs similar to those obtained using the muscle sequences (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, orange plots). This suggests that random muscle activations outside of syllables may contribute to the P1 movements, and such idiosyncratic activations were common in movements of all phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Because syllables are often confined to particular anatomical compartments, we also compared the activity sequences in the D-V and A-P compartments across P1–P3. P1 bouts exhibit only modest similarity but the bouts of P2 and P3 are intermediate in similarity to those of movements and syllables (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). Thus, the observed stereotypy for ordered motor execution in pupal ecdysis is highest for phases, and incrementally decreases with spatiotemporal scale. The least stereotypy (SSs &lt;40%, CVs &gt;40%) is seen in the recruitment order of individual muscles, which is less consistent than the activation of syllables.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Movements are composed by phasic activation of syllables</title><p>The SequenceMatcher results indicate variability in the recruitment of syllables into movements. To more comprehensively examine their contribution to movement, we sought to examine the phasic relationships between syllables that participate in the movements of P1 and early P2 (i.e., prior to the brace). These syllables are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref> for the lateral, dorsal, and ventral views. The phasic activation of the syllables that can conveniently be monitored from the lateral view during P1 bouts is represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. As expected, these bouts initiate in the posterior compartment (see key, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>, right) with the activation of syllables in A6 driving the Lift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, bottom). This activity precedes the activity of the syllables driving the RollCon in A4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, top). The syllables initially activated in A6 are predominantly located in the ventral compartment and their activity is followed by prolonged activity in the dorsal compartment by PME4, which comprises dorsal longitudinal muscles M1–3. Together, the ventral and dorsal contractions span the P1 bout and serve to compress posterior segments. In anterior segments, compression is transient, with roughly coincident activity of syllables M2 and PME6 in the dorsal and ventral compartments, respectively. This activity overlaps with and is outlasted by contractions of the strictly lateral transverse muscles of PME2 and M8. Contraction of the latter muscles constricts the body wall, effectively pulling the dorsal surface away from the puparium. Separation of the dorsal body wall may be facilitated by reduced surface tension as the RollCons push air anteriorly between the puparium and dorsal body wall. In contrast to P1, syllable activation in P2 bouts is considerably more uniform across hemisegments, body axes, and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Syllables representing all dorsoventral compartments activate together in each hemisegment, compressing the animal longitudinally and along the D-V axis, with a wave of such compressions traversing the body wall in the P-to-A direction as can be seen by the delayed activation of syllables in A4 relative to A6 (compare dotted lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> top vs. bottom). Full details of the compression wave constituting the Swing can be achieved by integration of information about muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> activity from the dorsal and ventral views, which permits the reconstruction of the movement from the posterior to anterior end of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This is because the pliable cuticle of the pupa provides little rigidity. Like other animals reliant on a hydroskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kristan et al., 2000</xref>), the pupa uses muscle contractions not only to produce local movement in the body wall, but also to increase hydrostatic pressure of the internal fluid to produce movement in distant parts of the body wall. Isometric contractions of antagonistic muscles also create body wall rigidity to resist body wall distortion so that pressure is appropriately directed. Directing pressure to particular parts of the body is, in fact, a central function of pupal movements, which thus rely on two types of muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> activity: activity that results in muscle shortening to deflect the body wall and generate local movement and pressure changes, and isometric activity that does not result in length changes and promotes body wall rigidity to direct pressure.</p><p>To better characterize how Ca<sup>++</sup> activity in muscles of the pupal syllabary generates movement and facilitates and responds to pressure changes, we measured the normalized maximum shortening (ΔL/L) and peak fluorescence intensity (ΔF/F) for each muscle contraction in segments A3–A5 for each ecdysis phase. Increases in fluorescence only moderately correlated with muscle shortening (r = –0.54; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine which muscles shorten the body wall, we calculated the average ΔL/L for each muscle over each phase, focusing first on P2 because of its role in promoting morphological change. For P2, M12 and the muscles comprising PMEs 1 (M26, M13, M8), 2 (M21–23), 3 (M2, M3), and 4 (M1–M3) shorten the most (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As noted above, these contractions create a wave of hemisegmental compressions in the P-to-A direction during the Swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). The greatest constriction across the D-V axis occurs in posterior segments, consistent with pronounced shortening in PME2 muscles (M21–23) in A5. Progressively decreased shortening of PME2 muscles is observed in A4 and A3. Shortening of the ventral and dorsal longitudinal muscles (M12, M13, M1–3) is more uniform across hemisegments, but the absence of M12 in posterior hemisegments and somewhat greater shortening of the dorsal longitudinal muscles anteriorly is consistent with the greater longitudinal compression of anterior hemisegments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Muscle mechanics during P2 and P3 behaviors.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Changes in muscle properties during contraction of indicated muscles in hemisegments (HS) A3–A5 during P2.

This trend runs opposite to muscle shortening, which means that in successive anterior hemisegments, the PME2 muscles work harder to generate a smaller length change. This suggests counterforces on the anterior body wall, consistent with increased pressure to evert the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) as has been measured in blowflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zdarek and Friedman, 1986</xref>). Each Swing is initiated posteriorly when the hemolymph is uniformly distributed throughout the body cavity and internal pressure is low. Ascending compression of the body wall on one side pushes the opposite side of the body against the static puparium. This prevents further body wall distension on that side and the compression wave drives hemolymph forward, like squeezing a tube of toothpaste from the bottom up. This creates pressure anteriorly, which is maintained by isometric contractions so that the head is pushed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). While a bilaterally coordinated compression might evert the head more efficiently, the unilateral Swing has a second function: it extrudes the larval tracheal linings on each side of the body. These are deposited in ascending segments on the puparium with each Swing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><p>The two movements of P1 share features of the Swing and likely prepare the animal for P2. The Lifts draw out the dorsal tracheal trunks, which remain attached to the posterior spiracles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robertson, 1936</xref>); the RollCons may help fragment the linings of the stretched trunks in anterior segments so that they are efficiently extruded at P2. Essential to the Lift is compaction of the posterior hemisegments, which is accomplished by bilateral contraction of almost the same syllables as the Swing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The RollCon, like the Swing, is performed unilaterally in a P-to-A direction. However, it fails to compact hemisegments as it traverses them and only deflects the dorsal body wall. Single-muscle changes in ΔL/L and ΔF/F underlying RollCons are much smaller than those for the Swing (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B, C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). In addition, RollCons engage only a subset of the syllables comprising the Swing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Rare Ca<sup>++</sup> activity of M12 is idiosyncratic in P1 and does not contribute to ΔL/L. The coordinated contractions of M12 with other muscles during the Swing, together with the recruitment of additional syllables and higher Ca<sup>++</sup> activities, explain why RollCons result only in deflections of the dorsal body wall while Swings cause hemisegmental compaction to bend the entire animal (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Overall, the active elements of P1 appear to merge in P2, combining into one robust concerted P-to-A movement.</p><p>In P3, coordinated movement across anatomical compartments separates into the multiple compartmentalized movements introduced in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and elaborated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>. These movements form activity patterns without strictly repeating units. Bulk Ca<sup>++</sup> activity imaged from the lateral side shows an initial oscillatory pattern of variable frequency and amplitude that evolves into a more fixed pattern of alternating wide peaks and slim double peaks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, arrows). The initial variable period of activity is heralded by the Crunch, which is generated by the contralateral activation of PME1 in ventral hemisegments posterior to segment 4 and M2 in anterior dorsal segments. These contractions slightly lift the posterior segments and compact the anterior segments. The Crunch is typically followed by a Brace or an AntComp. The latter movement compacts the dorsal and anterior compartments via contractions of PME7, PME3, and M1 and with ventral activity in PME6. Realignment of the body is achieved by the execution of a PostCon followed by a PostSwing, each composed of syllables in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>The block of movements containing sequentially a Crunch, Brace, AntComp, PostCon, and PostSwing yield an A-to-P flow of activity. They constitute a fairly regular repeating unit with some variation in the order. This block forms the wide peak leading the double peaks seen in the bulk Ca<sup>++</sup> trace (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, arrows), and as P3 evolves it increasingly alternates with a modified block that lacks the PostSwing and is followed by long interbout intervals. The double peaks typically consist of a Brace-AntComp-PostCon block followed quickly by a Crunch-Brace combination. In addition, later P3 blocks also include M12 contractions in PostSwings and sometimes Crunches, which visibly increase the compaction of the anterior segments. The increased compaction may increase pressure posteriorly, driving hemolymph into the appendages to lengthen them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Neuromodulators increase behavioral stereotypy</title><p>We used the inwardly rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel, Kir2.1, to selectively silence neurons that critically regulate entry into P1 and P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>).

We conclude that N<sub>CCAP</sub> modulates several aspects of the transition to P2, including (1) generalized increase in muscle activity during P2; (2) coordination of syllables along the A-P axis that facilitates full body swings; and (3) coordination of activity across the D-V axis, as indicated by the desynchronization of PME2 activity.</p><media id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-68656-video6.mp4"><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Partial swing and subsequent activity bouts in an N<sub>CCAP</sub>-suppressed pupa (lateral view, top), with wildtype P2 bouts for comparison (bottom); data were sampled at 2 Hz and sped up to 5 fps.</title><p>Scale bars, 250 μm.

Intersectional labeling of CCAP-R-expressing motor neurons using the Split Gal4 system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luan et al., 2006</xref>) showed that these neurons innervate approximately half of the pupal muscles via Ib synapses, including all dorsal and three of the six ventral muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A, C</xref>). Although none of the motor neurons innervating the lateral transverse muscles express CCAP-R, the transverse muscles M21–23 of PME2 are labeled by the CCAP-R-Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that CCAP centrally modulates motor neuron output to dorsal and ventral muscles, while directly modulating lateral transverse muscles. At the larval stage, CCAP is co-released with Bursicon from type III terminals on muscles M12 and M13, which straddle the muscles of PME2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veverytsa and Allan, 2011</xref>). Anti-Bursicon staining established the persistence of type III terminals on M12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, magenta, arrow).

Consistent with Bursicon’s colocalization with CCAP in central neurons, we find that suppressing the subset of Bursicon-expressing neurons (N<sub>Burs</sub>) has effects similar to N<sub>CCAP</sub> suppression: P1 activity is normal, but P2 and P3 are not correctly executed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) and the animals die without everting their heads. Animals also execute a single swing-like movement after numerous bouts of P1, but in this case it consists of an entire anteriorly directed wave and some subsequent patterned activity is observed that resembles AntComp, Crunch, Brace, and PostSwing movements, which can be identified by our CNN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). This activity lacks organization and remains desynchronized during the swing-like movement activity in the D-V compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Additional swing-like movements also occur, but always separated by other types of movement. We conclude that D-V synchronization for abdominal swinging requires N<sub>Burs</sub>, as does sustained execution of swinging behavior, and that full coordination of activity across the A-P axis additionally requires non-Bursicon-expressing neurons in N<sub>CCAP</sub>. The results of suppressing neuromodulatory signaling support both central and peripheral roles for the ecdysis hormones in promoting syllable coordination across the A-P and D-V axes. This coordination promotes the observed coherence of behavioral execution despite the variable timing of activation of individual muscles.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Compartmental muscle synchrony for swing requires Bursicon neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bulk Ca<sup>++</sup> activity trace (lateral view) for animals in which the Bursicon-expressing neurons (N<sub>Burs</sub>) are suppressed.

To gain insight into how nervous systems specify behavior, we examined muscle activity during the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal ecdysis sequence at single-cell resolution using genetic Ca<sup>++</sup> indicators. The pupal ecdysis sequence consists of multiple motor programs, dependent for their execution on hormonal cues. We find that hormonal signaling coordinates muscle activity across individual muscle ensembles and anatomical compartments to ensure stereotypy of behavioral execution. Although stereotypy is evident at the level of phases, the recruitment of muscles into movements is not stereotyped and some muscle activity is not correlated with movement. Importantly, a phase of stochastic muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> activity precedes the onset of behavior, indicating that prior to the action of ETH, nervous system activity exhibits intrinsic variability. This variability is reduced, but not eliminated, by the action of neuromodulators, which incrementally increase behavioral coherence.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The emergence of stereotypy from variable muscle activity</title><p>Our results significantly extend previous descriptions of pupal ecdysis and illustrate the power of pan-muscle Ca<sup>++</sup> imaging. Behavioral fine-mapping at single-cell resolution permits the definition and automated detection of elemental movements, the identification of a syllabary of movement-associated muscles and muscle ensembles, and the analysis of their sensitivity to neuronal manipulations. Importantly, single-cell analysis permits the identification of muscle activity that is not consistently associated with movements. The most salient example of such idiosyncratic activity occurs in P0, a previously undescribed phase of muscle activity lacking coordinated movement. Variability persists in phases P1–P3, which exhibit idiosyncratic muscle activation comingled with stereotyped movement syllables. Furthermore, muscle recruitment into syllables, and recruitment of syllables into movements, exhibits considerable variability both within and across animals. All observations suggest that variability in the order of recruitment of behavioral elements is a pervasive feature of the pupal ecdysis sequence with stereotypy emerging only at higher levels of behavioral description.</p><p>Variability in pupal ecdysis behavior may arise from the need to adjust movement to changing forces on the body wall, both from inside and outside. Inside the animal, hydrostatic pressure varies globally in response to local contractions of the body wall. This pressure may need to be countered to maintain control of movement. Outside the animal, the wall of the puparium may form an inhomogeneous substrate as the distribution of molting fluid and air at different places varies. A notable feature of pupal ecdysis is that it is heralded by the appearance of a large air bubble in the abdomen, which is expelled into the puparium by the movements executed during P1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bainbridge and Bownes, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chadfield and Sparrow, 1984</xref>). After expulsion from the body, air is displaced by the animal’s movements, first posteriorly and then anteriorly. In the presence of residual molting fluid, pockets of air likely cause fluctuations in surface tension between the body wall and puparium. Forces exerted both by internal pressure and by substrate interactions within the puparium may thus require that motor output be dynamically adjusted, presumably by sensory cues.</p><p>The importance of sensory cues to pupal ecdysis is evident from our finding that animals lacking proprioceptive input die at P0 without initiating the behavioral sequence. The cause of death remains to be determined, but its timing suggests that proprioceptive feedback may signal muscle responsiveness to neural input during the period of muscle reactivation and thus provide a readiness signal for ecdysis initiation. Alternatively, pressure on the body wall due to air bubble growth may trigger pupal ecdysis. Sensory cues have been shown to gate behavioral transitions in the adult ecdysis sequences of crickets and also to adjust motor program execution when extrication from parts of the old cuticle fails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson, 1977</xref>).</p><p>For the pupal ecdysis sequence, more work will be required to determine the sources of the observed variability. Notably, sources that arise frequently in the context of other behaviors, such as external environmental stimuli (i.e., stimuli outside the puparium) and competing physiological needs, are absent for pupal ecdysis. In addition, proprioceptive cues, while they may tune ecdysis behavior, are not essential for generating it in that a fictive sequence is generated by an excised pupal brain treated with ETH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mena et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, our evidence suggests that at least some behavioral variability derives from the operation of the ecdysis neural network itself since stochasticity is clearly evident at P0 and then appears to extend to other phases.</p><p>The variability of P0 muscle bouts is reminiscent in some ways of the neurogenic bursts of muscle activity observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos prior to hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crisp et al., 2008</xref>). Initial embryonic bursts consist of uncoordinated muscle activity that becomes increasingly organized over several hours as the locomotor networks mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crisp et al., 2011</xref>). By the time of hatching, complete peristaltic motor sequences are regularly performed. Similar precocious network activity is also found in a variety of other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Donovan, 1999</xref>), including pupal moths where the developing circuitry for flight drives low-threshold neuromuscular responses in muscles that fail to elicit contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kammer and Kinnamon, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kammer and Rheuben, 1976</xref>). Such activity has also been proposed to support network maturation. P0 motor activity may share this function as patterns of muscle activity become increasingly complex during P0 and recognizable syllables emerge (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). However, in contrast to other systems, fully coordinated activity does not appear until the phase ends with the first P1 Lift and even after this muscle and syllable recruitment remain irregular, suggesting continued network variability.</p><p>This apparently intrinsic variability may relate to the tradeoffs required of any multifunctional system. Pupal ecdysis, like most behaviors, depends on the integration of signals from CPGs, proprioceptors, neuromodulators, and possibly higher-order command systems—all of which are likely used in the context of larval behavior. For example, circuits that generate waves of activity along the anteroposterior axis are required for both larval locomotion and pupal ecdysis, but while they generate coordinated bilateral activity in locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heckscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>), they generate mostly alternating activity during ecdysis. This degree of flexibility may be bought at the cost of reproducibility of execution. Indeed, precise reproducibility may not be prioritized by nervous systems, which may instead favor solutions that are ‘good enough’ as has been generally proposed for biological control systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Partridge, 1982</xref>). According to this view, further optimization of pupal ecdysis—in the form of behavioral stereotypy—may incur costs on performance in the execution of other behaviors that rely on the same circuit elements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neuromodulatory regulation of behavioral transitions and variability</title><p>Variability in pupal motor output is substantially altered by the neuromodulatory action of the ecdysis hormones ETH, CCAP, and Bursicon. Previous evidence indicates that these hormones induce the motor activity characteristic of P1 and P2, even in an isolated pupal nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the ability of neuromodulators to reconfigure motor networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marder, 2012</xref>), this induction likely represents reorganization and possibly stabilization of network activity, and also increased network coherence. P1 is distinguished from P0 by the presence of coherent movements and P2 is more coherent than P1 in recruitment of muscles, syllables, and compartmental activity. The reduced stereotypy in P3 may result from waning neuromodulatory action. The ecdysis hormones thus reorganize motor output and increase the stereotypy of its execution. This conclusion is supported by suppression of neuromodulatory signaling, which disrupts muscle activity at multiple levels, as expected from the broad distribution of ecdysis hormone receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>What causes the release of Bursicon, CCAP, and ETH at pupal ecdysis is unknown, but our results suggest that ecdysis activity itself may be a factor. Release of ETH occurs only after muscle responsiveness to neural stimulation is ensured, suggesting that the latter may represent a checkpoint for release. Similarly, the aborted swing-like activity occurring in the absence of N<sub>CCAP</sub> and N<sub>Burs</sub> activity indicates that entry into P2 has a hormone-independent component that may act as a checkpoint for hormone release, which then sustains P2 network activity. One possible mechanism might be that as the animal pulls back during P1 and creates an anterior space, sensory feedback from the head signals the readiness for P2. Similar checkpoint control mechanisms have been proposed to operate in the adult ecdysis sequence of locusts and crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hughes, 1980b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neuromodulation and compartmentalization of movement</title><p>The granular analysis of muscle activity presented here also reveals how neuromodulators may serve to coordinate action across anatomically and functionally distinct compartmental boundaries. ETHRB neuron suppression blocks the Lift, a movement of the posterior compartment, while suppressing CCAP neurons prematurely terminates the first (and only) swing-like movement by blocking its progression into the anterior compartment. Additionally, the distribution of CCAP-R appears to reflect mechanisms for selectively regulating distinct compartments across the D-V axis. CCAP-R is expressed selectively in motor neurons that innervate dorsal and ventral muscles. These motor neurons have dendrites that occupy similar positions on the myotopic map and share similar synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Landgraf et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>). This distinguishes them from motor neurons that innervate the lateral transverse muscles, which do not express CCAP-R. However, a subset of lateral transverse muscles (i.e., M21–23) themselves express CCAP-R, and the pattern of CCAP-R expression may thus represent a mechanism for synchronizing activity across the D-V axis during the swing movements of P2 when CCAP is released. Notably, muscle synchrony across compartments in posterior segments is lost in the one, partially executed Swing when CCAP-expressing neurons are suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) and no further Swings are executed.</p><p>The putative source of CCAP for the muscles of PME2 are the type III terminals on muscle M12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Veverytsa and Allan, 2011</xref>), which is selectively retained in the anterior compartment (i.e., segments 1–4). CCAP-R-expressing muscles in the anterior compartment may thus receive CCAP modulation prior to those in the posterior compartment. This may facilitate the delayed appearance of the contralateral brace, which is formed principally by segmental PME2s and which changes the character of the Swing after head eversion. Interestingly, the anatomical asymmetry in the distribution of M12 is one of several we observed in pupal muscles across the D-V and A-P body axes. These have only been partially described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) and result from the selective degradation of larval muscles in the ventral and posterior compartments. The asymmetries in muscle distribution correlate with several pupal movements that are physically partitioned across the A-P axis, including the Lift, which occurs only in the posterior compartment during P1, and the AntComp, which is restricted to the anterior compartment during P3. Synaptic mechanisms for controlling movements across the A-P boundary in the larva have been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tastekin et al., 2018</xref>, and similar mechanisms may synergize with anatomical asymmetries and neuromodulatory mechanisms in the pupa to spatially and temporally constrain muscle activity to specific compartments.</p><p>It is worth noting that the expression of CCAP-R by the lateral transverse muscles indicates the potential importance of muscle modulation in shaping behavior. Whether modulation of muscle properties also underlies the generalized failure of muscles to respond to synaptic input at the onset of P0 is unclear. Animals stop moving shortly after pupariation and do not resume until pupal ecdysis, but neuromuscular activity may be maintained throughout this period. We observed neuromuscular activity without muscle responses at the earliest pre-pupal stages we examined (approximately stage P2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bainbridge and Bownes, 1981</xref>; data not shown). However, more detailed imaging would be required to determine the extent, continuity, and pattern of the input. <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscles are targets of a variety of neuropeptides including myoinhibitory peptides, which have also been implicated in pupal ecdysis behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2015</xref>), and it is possible that these play a role in suppressing muscle responses to neural input. Alternatively, neuromuscular signaling may be progressively potentiated during P0. Such a mechanism has been proposed to operate in pupal moth flight muscles, which respond electrically—but fail to contract—to synaptic input corresponding to flight motor patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitch and Kammer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klaassen and Kammer, 1985</xref>). As animals approach eclosion, rising octopamine levels upregulate neuromuscular efficacy so that flight muscles activate in response to input.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Identifying neural determinants of behavior</title><p>A goal of computational neuroethology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Datta et al., 2019</xref>) is to describe behavior at a level of resolution that permits the identification of its neural determinants. The muscle-level description provided here lends itself naturally to this purpose. For example, the activity patterns of the muscles comprising PME2 have likely neural correlates within the synaptic and neuromodulatory networks that govern pupal ecdysis behavior. At the neuromodulatory level, the N<sub>CCAP</sub> cells that terminate on M12 are likely sources of CCAP modulation of PME2 muscles, perhaps to help reverse their P-to-A activation at P2. At the synaptic level, the regular, intersegmental pattern of activation of PME2 muscles in nearly all pupal movements and behavioral bouts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) suggests that PME2 motor neurons are driven by CPG neurons that generate anteroposterior rhythms. Our results thus provide testable predictions about the patterns of neuromodulatory and synaptic connectivity between muscles, motor neurons, and premotor interneurons of various types.</p><p>Testing these predictions will be facilitated by data emerging from reconstruction of the larval CNS at synaptic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kohsaka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>). Although pupal behaviors differ from those of the larva, broad similarities suggest that at least some neural substrates are shared. The initial P-to-A activity flow of the pupal ecdysis sequence is reminiscent of larval forward peristalsis, and its reversal after alternating bilateral Swing movements resembles the switch to backward peristalsis following sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tastekin et al., 2018</xref>). An important difference, however, is that the basic features of larval locomotion are identifiable in the default activity of the excised larval brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pulver et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the pupal nervous system produces patterned activity resembling pupal ecdysis only in response to ETH. Pupal ecdysis will thus permit investigation of the mechanisms by which intrinsic neuronal activity is organized by neuromodulatory control. Analyzing behavior at single-muscle resolution, as demonstrated here, will facilitate this investigation and should be applicable to other translucent preparations of neuroscientific interest, such as larval fruit flies, roundworms, and larval zebrafish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-pBurs</td><td valign="top">Aaron Hsueh/ <break/>Willi Honegger</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">(1:250)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 555 Phalloidin</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher/ <break/>Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A34055</td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher/ <break/>Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A11122; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221569">AB_221569</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:250)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-DLG</td><td valign="top">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td valign="top">4F3; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_528203">AB_528203</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Mouse IgG Alexa Fluor 647</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher/ <break/>Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A21236; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535805">AB_2535805</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat anti-Rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher/ <break/>Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">A11008 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_143165">AB_143165</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">CCAP</td><td valign="top">BACHEM</td><td valign="top">4015114</td><td valign="top">(1 µM)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Schneider’s insect medium</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">S0416</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Schneider’s insect medium w/o calcium</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">s9895</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">2,2-Thiodiethanol</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">166782</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher/ <break/>Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">P36961</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic>: ETHRB-Gal4 (ETHRB<sup>MI00949</sup>-Gal4)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diao et al., 2016</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic>: CCAP-R-Gal4 (CCAP-R<sup>MI05804</sup>-GAL4)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic>: CCAPR-p65AD (CCAP-R<sup>MI05804</sup>-p65AD)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>D. melanogaster</italic>: w; CCAP-Gal4; +</td><td valign="top">Gift of J.

Fluorescence from muscles opposite the imaging field is effectively excluded because the pupal musculature lies superficially along the body wall and light is scattered by internal tissues.

Where values of length and fluorescence are indicated, the line tool (width, 3 px) was used to manually measure intensity and length for muscles 1, 2, 3, 5, 12, 13, 15, 22, 26, and 28 in hemisegments 3, 4, and 5 for each of the ecdysis sequence phases at the onset of muscle activity (visible fluorescence), the peak of the muscle activity (brightest fluorescence), and the offset of muscle activity (fluorescence returns to baseline). Single-muscle identification was facilitated by the histolysis of half of the larval musculature and the occlusion of opposing side muscles by thick and highly scattering internal tissue. Data were collected sub-saturation but most videos and figures presented are contrast-enhanced to aid the eye. Bulk Ca<sup>++</sup> traces were extracted from ROIs defined as the entire animal excluding the puparium, or as single muscles/neurons where indicated, and normalized to F0, defined here as the average fluorescence intensity over the first 50 frames in the image series. Raster plots were generated from activity peaks identified from Ca<sup>++</sup> traces using a peak finding algorithm in Python with manually determined thresholds for GCaMP6s and jRGECOa1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavior annotation</title><p>A subset of four animals from the total <italic>hlk</italic>&gt;GCaMP6s experimental dataset (N = 16) were annotated frame-by-frame by expert raters to identify the muscles newly activated in each frame. These data were used to determine the frequency and order of activation for each muscle. Movements were annotated manually for these four animals plus one more by visual inspection of muscle activity pattern and deflections of the body wall with respect to the puparium from raw image series (before background subtraction) that were contrast-enhanced to allow visualization of autofluorescence from the body wall. Bouts were identified manually from a subset of 10 <italic>hlk</italic>&gt;GCaMP6s animals as the start of a sequence of muscle activations flanked on either side by ≥ 2 frames of no new activations, which were defined as inter-bout intervals. The criteria for defining PMEs were determined empirically based on frame-by-frame analysis of 10 complete image series of the pupal ecdysis sequence. Groups of muscles that were repeatedly observed (≥80% of bouts in ≥8 animals) to be co-active in a regular pattern were subsequently analyzed for the duration of co-activity. A group in which the activity of all muscles overlapped for three or more frames was defined as a PME. Post-hoc analysis revealed that three frames on average represent approximately 15% of the total period of co-active duration for PMEs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Sample calculations and general statistics</title><p>Sample sizes were predetermined using power calculations with 85% power from ecdysis phase 2 behavior duration data presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diao et al., 2017</xref>.

For every frame, the MIP was a 1D vector of length H for an HxW image. Then we computed the location of the mode of the MIP vector on the y axis. An intensity mode indicates the location of the most dominant muscle activation. Therefore, the locations of the modes give an estimate of the direction of motion during the muscle activity period. Note that we are interested in finding the location of maximum motion, which is efficiently captured by the mode of the intensities, not by the mean. Once the intensity modes were identified for every frame using MIPs, we computed the number of modes above and below a threshold, indicating P-&gt;A and A-&gt;P motion, respectively. The threshold is automatically computed as the median of all modes. We then calculated the ratio of the number of modes below the median line to the number of modes above the median line and used this ratio to determine if the direction of activation is posteriorly or anteriorly directed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Automated movement analysis</title><p>We used a CNN to automatically estimate the type of motion in each <italic>hlk</italic>&gt;GCaMP6s image frame. The network model is a modified version of Inception-v3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szegedy et al., 2015</xref>). To fit the model in available GPU memory based on the image size, we removed the final Dense layer and replaced it with a GlobalAveragePooling2D layer. In addition, a dropout layer was also added to introduce stochasticity into the model to avoid overfitting. There were totally 21.8M parameters in the model. The detailed network is described in the train.py provided as supplementary material. The model was trained to predict nine motions (Anterior Compression, Posterior Swing, Brace, Crunch, Rolling Contraction, Lift, Posterior Contraction, Rest, Swing) from the <italic>hlk</italic>&gt;GCaMP6s images of five animals. For each animal, the images were resized to 403 × 129 × N, where N is the variable number of frames based on the duration of the phases. Each frame was obtained at 2 Hz. Every frame, starting from phase 1, was assigned to one of the above-mentioned motions and was derived by consensus of three expert raters. Since the motion cannot possibly be derived by looking at a single frame, we used windows of 25 frames (12 previous and 12 following) to estimate the motion at one frame. Therefore, the training data for each frame consisted of a 403 × 129 × 25 matrix. The CNN model was then trained by predicting the motion of the center (13th) frame.</p><p>Since there were only five animals available for training, we used all possible overlapping frames to augment the training data. Categorical cross-entropy with the Adam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kingma and Ba, 2015</xref>) optimizer was used with learning rate of 0.0001 to obtain a probabilistic estimation of motion for each frame. An early termination criterion was used to prevent the model from overfitting, where the training was stopped if the categorical cross-entropy did not increase for 10 consecutive training epochs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref> shows the accuracy of motion prediction averaged over all available frames for each of the five training animals in a leave-one-out cross-validation. The final (magenta) curve shows the training accuracy where frames from all five animals were aggregated and then the model was trained on the aggregated frames. Similar accuracy between cross-validation and aggregated training shows that the CNN model did not overfit the data. However, to use information from all training animals, we applied the aggregated trained model (i.e., magenta) on the remaining 11 animals. For every frame of a test animal image, the motion with maximum probability was used as the final motion. For better accuracy, the predicted motions of the 11 animals were corrected by an expert rater.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Muscle activation order analysis</title><p>The annotated muscle datasets were sorted by onset frame number and then by muscle.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The insect ecdysis sequence is a long-standing model for understanding the role of neuromodulators in organizing complex goal-directed blocks of behavior; here it is elegantly explored in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Pupal ecdysis has benefits in that it occurs in the confines of the puparium and muscle activity of the entire animal can be followed through the entire behavioral sequence. The authors have developed tools to monitor both the responses of individual muscle fibers and the activity in the endplates of the motoneurons that innervate them during the course of the behavioral sequence. They have identified a discrete set of motor &quot;syllables&quot; that underlie the various movements and then begin to dissect how removal of different components of the peptide cascade results in the recruitment of these syllables and, hence, the behaviors.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pupal behavior emerges from unstructured muscle activity in response to neuromodulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, including Chris Q Doe as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1 and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: James W Truman (Reviewer #2); Paul Taghert (Reviewer #3); Aref Zarin (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) In figures 4, S4, and 5 you show GCaMP activity patterns, but it does not appear to be ratiometric with a muscle marker. How can you be sure the changes in GCaMP you are seeing are not due to muscle movement? I understand that the pupa is not translocating, but every muscle contraction will generate some movement in surrounding muscles. It is unrealistic to redo the experiments for ratiometric imaging, but you should explain how you minimize artifactual muscle activity (or loss of activity) due to local body wall movements.</p><p>2) The background for the paper could be improved for a general journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>. Pupal ecdysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is quite specialized and it would help to place it in context of other insect ecdyses. The complexity and temporal ordering of the &quot;ecdysis sequence&quot; have been nowhere better described than in the paper by Joe Carlson on cricket ecdysis (J.R.Carlson, (1977) J. Comp. Physiol. 115:299): it illustrates the three major phases (a preparatory, an ecdysis and an expansional phase [which Carlson breaks into two]) and how each phase involves the recruitment of diverse motor elements in a characteristic order but with scope for variability. These three phases occur in all ecdysis sequences that have been studied and correspond to the P1, P2 and P3 phases of pupal &quot;ecdysis&quot; in higher flies.</p><p>3) I found it very difficult to relate their findings back to the behaviors that they are trying to explain. The paper does a good job of describing the &quot;trees&quot; but it does not then pull back to place the trees in the context of the &quot;forest&quot;. I found it very exciting that they could deconstruct the complex movements shown through the three major phases of the pupal ecdysis sequence into a small number of elemental components (their PMEs and individual muscle contractions that constitute their &quot;syllables&quot;). However, it was not obvious as to how these syllables were then combined to generate the 8 basic behaviors they illustrate in Figure 2A. Table S2 is critical because it summarizes the syllables that are involved in building these 8 basic movements. (Indeed, this table is so key that they may want to move it to the main text, rather than supplemental information!). What I find lacking, though, is clear description the phase relationships of the various syllables during each of these basic behaviors. An attempt to reassemble the behaviors is presented in Figure 7 for two of the behaviors. We are shown the order of appearance of the PMEs, but not their phase (and overlap?) relative to each other during a typical bout. As described below for the figures, I do not think that their color coding works very well, even if the images were large enough to resolve the detail. The authors might consider using a more traditional representation, such as seen in papers defining phases of muscle contraction during a locomotor cycles. This would be a phase diagram using blocks to show the phase and duration of each muscle contraction [in this case the authors would have syllables {individual muscles or PMEs}] during a cycle [variance could also be indicated at the ends of each block]. Although there may be unique events at the two ends of the body [which cannot be resolved in the figures], the authors still focus on a segmental unit in their representations. They could anchor their descriptions on a typical mid-body segment (e.g., A4) and show the timing of syllable recruitment during a behavioral bout.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The technical values of this work are very high and the argument that stereotyped sequences of muscle activation arise from smaller stochastically-produced elements (termed syllables) is novel and most interesting. Likewise, the manuscript effectively presents interesting observations on release activity of neuromodulatory inputs and relates these to long-standing ideas about checkpoint controls in ecdysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) In the &quot;Automated movement analysis&quot; section in Methods, the last sentence in the first paragraph is missing a &quot;was&quot; (&quot;The CNN model was then trained by …&quot;).</p><p>2) The keyword &quot;neural circuits&quot; might not be a good match to the purpose of this paper. The study examined thoroughly on muscle activity and the role of neuromodulation; however, it did not investigate multiple layers of neural circuits.</p><p>3) The authors could, in the introduction, briefly describe the role of ETHR and CCAP in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, especially them having only minor role in larval ecdysis but critical role in pupal ecdysis.</p><p>4) In Figure S4A, plotting both ΔF/F and ΔL/L over time might result in a better visual effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68656.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) In figures 4, S4, and 5 you show GCaMP activity patterns, but it does not appear to be ratiometric with a muscle marker.

Although technical constraints prevented us from routinely collecting simultaneous images in two channels, we took several steps to insure that the Ca<sup>++</sup> signals we measured were correctly associated with the muscles in which they were generated and that changes in signal were not artifacts of muscle displacement due to generalized movements of the body wall. First, because the pupa has half the muscles of the larva, it was possible to measure the GCaMP signals in ROIs that included only the muscle of interest, and not neighboring muscles. Such ROIs were manually identified and the signal quantified for all of the single muscle data reported in the figures referred to. We are thus confident that there is no cross-contamination of signal from adjacent muscles during movement. Second, artifacts due to shifts in image plane during movement were avoided by using low magnification (4x) and widefield illumination. This insured that light was collected not from a single image plane, but from a large volume that included the side of the body wall facing the objective and all of its muscles. Ca<sup>++</sup> signals from muscles in the body wall on the opposite side of the animal were excluded from the volume due to scattering and occlusion by internal tissues, which we confirmed by imaging z stacks. We have updated the Methods to clarify our methodology (ll. 980-989 [1056-1065]).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The background for the paper could be improved for a general journal such as eLife.

We have expanded the Introduction (ll. 51-89 [51-93]) to describe the broader research on insect ecdysis, including the paradigmatic and detailed descriptions provided by Carlson for crickets and Hughes for locusts. Incorporating the suggestion of Reviewer 3 below, we also take the opportunity to place the work on ecdysis in the context of behavioral endocrinology. We note the long history of work on the hormonal control of behavior in both invertebrate and vertebrate preparations of which ecdysis research is a part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I found it very difficult to relate their findings back to the behaviors that they are trying to explain.

This would be a phase diagram using blocks to show the phase and duration of each muscle contraction [in this case the authors would have syllables {individual muscles or PMEs}] during a cycle [variance could also be indicated at the ends of each block]. Although there may be unique events at the two ends of the body [which cannot be resolved in the figures], the authors still focus on a segmental unit in their representations. They could anchor their descriptions on a typical mid-body segment (e.g., A4) and show the timing of syllable recruitment during a behavioral bout.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s detailed comments on this important point and are grateful for the suggestion that we represent the phases of syllable activity during movement generation. Based on this and other reviewers’ comments, we recognize that our attempt to bridge the gap between syllables and movements in the summary figure (i.e. Figure 7) of our original manuscript was unsatisfying. In the revised manuscript, we present results from the kind of phase analysis suggested by the reviewer and think that these results both strengthen the link between the syllables (“trees”) and the movements (“forest”) and illustrate this link in a relatively straight-forward way.</p><p>As the reviewer alludes to in his comments, analyzing syllable phases is subject to several constraints. In the absence of an automated method for syllable detection, the required measurements of onset and offset times for each syllable need to be made manually—a daunting task for all syllables in the entire pupal ecdysis sequence! In addition, many pupal movements, particularly those of P3, involve distinct activity in different segments—or even in different halves of the same segment. There is thus no single, “representative” hemisegment on which to conduct the analysis. This is quite different from the peristaltic contractions of larval locomotion, which can be conveniently captured by analyzing muscle contractions in a single hemisegment. To accommodate these constraints, we performed a restricted analysis that focused on the relatively simple movements of P1 and P2. These movements involve muscle activity that is similar across hemisegments (as for the RollCon and Swing) or similar within the segments of the posterior compartment (as for the Lift). By confining the analysis to two hemisegments, one (A6) in the posterior compartment and one (A4) in the anterior compartment, we could thus resolve syllable dynamics for both movements of P1 and could monitor the progression of the P2 Swing as it traverses both the posterior and anterior compartments. To do so, we measured the phasic activity of all syllables visible from the lateral view for A6 and A4 in a set of representative bouts of P1 and P2. These analyses are now presented as phase diagrams in Figure 7D and E of the revised manuscript. As suggested by the Reviewer, we used blocks to show the phase and duration of each syllable during a bout and indicated the standard deviations at the ends of each block. In the accompanying text (ll. 246-274 [273-301]), we describe how the phasic activity of the syllables gives rise to the movements executed. We also now provide a supplemental figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 1) that illustrates the syllable dynamics of a Swing movement for muscles of all hemisegments of the pupa. In addition, we have taken the reviewer’s suggestion to elevate the former Table S2, describing the syllable composition of all movements, to Table 1 in the main text. We have also tried to improve the color-coding in figures throughout the manuscript to resolve potential ambiguities. In an effort to rationalize the use of color, we chose from the palette of colors recommended for the color-blind.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) In the &quot;Automated movement analysis&quot; section in Methods, the last sentence in the first paragraph is missing a &quot;was&quot; (&quot;The CNN model was then trained by …&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks very much for catching this detail.

Motor neurons represent the final common path for all circuit activity and our goal was to define activity in this path as an entry point for understanding activity at higher levels in the pupal ecdysis circuit. We hope that others will see the merits of using muscle activity as a proxy for motor neuron activity to gain traction on how circuit-level activity generates behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors could, in the introduction, briefly describe the role of ETHR and CCAP in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, especially them having only minor role in larval ecdysis but critical role in pupal ecdysis.</p></disp-quote><p>In the expanded description of ecdysis requested by several reviewers, we now outline the roles in ecdysis played by neurons targeted by ETH and CCAP in the Introduction (ll. 79-86 [80-90]).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure S4A, plotting both ΔF/F and ΔL/L over time might result in a better visual effect.</p></disp-quote><p>To show how these values change over time, we have now separated them out by phase (Figure 8—Figure supplement 1A in the revised draft).</p></body></sub-article></article>
