This oxygen gluttony is due to the tremendous appetite of brain cells for energy, which neurons satisfy through oxygen-dependent (aerobic) metabolism. As a result, the loss of oxygen to the brain during a stroke, heart attack, or due to another medical condition can be very damaging to cells in the brain.</p><p>Human and other animal cells use a communication system called the hypoxia response pathway to sense oxygen and trigger a protective response when oxygen is low. This pathway includes an enzyme called prolyl hydroxylase, which senses oxygen and modifies another protein in the pathway that regulates the production of enzymes involved in metabolism. This alters the balance of enzymes involved in aerobic and oxygen-independent (anaerobic) metabolism in the cell. However, it is not clear how the activity of the prolyl hydroxylase is regulated.</p><p>Much of our knowledge about the hypoxia response pathway has been gained from studies using a small worm called <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This worm uses the pathway to cope with hypoxia in the harsh environment of the soil. Mutant worms that lack the prolyl hydroxylase have several abnormalities including higher levels of anaerobic metabolism even in the presence of oxygen, and defects in the connections between neurons.</p><p>Park and Rongo used <italic>C. elegans</italic> to study the pathway in more detail. The experiments show that another enzyme called p38 MAPK activates the prolyl hydroxylase. Mutant worms that lack this enzyme have similar abnormalities in the hypoxia response pathway as animals that lack the prolyl hydroxylase. In normal worms, decreasing levels of p38 MAPK as the animals grow older contribute to the decline in the nervous system. The p38 MAPK enzyme appears to work by regulating the activity of the prolyl hydroxylase and its location inside neurons.</p><p>These findings provide a new target for the development of drugs that may help to protect us from tissue damage caused by hypoxia. Future challenges are to find out what activates p38 MAPK, and how it influences the location of prolyl hydroxylase in neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12010.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12010.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS42023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rongo</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM101972</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rongo</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The subcellular localization of the prolyl hydroxylase oxygen sensor in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons is regulated by p38 MAP kinase signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Whereas the brain comprises about 2% of human body weight, it consumes about 20% of oxygen intake, highlighting that neurons require robust aerobic energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clarke and Sokoloff, 1999</xref>). Neurons do not have plentiful glycolytic reserves, yet must expend tremendous amounts of ATP to maintain their membrane potential. Failure to do so, as during the low oxygen conditions (hypoxia) that occur during ischemic stroke, can lead to the collapse of the membrane potential, large scale glutamate neurotransmitter release, and overactivation of glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Takahashi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lees, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xue et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Li and Buchan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gill, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sheardown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nellgard and Wieloch, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchan et al., 1991</xref>). An understanding of how neurons respond to hypoxic stress is important for the development of new therapies to prevent and treat damage caused by ischemic stroke or traumatic injury.</p><p>Multicellular organisms respond to hypoxic stress by activating a conserved hypoxia response pathway, which includes prolyl hydroxylase enzymes as oxygen sensors and hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIFα) transcription factors as effectors. When oxygen levels are sufficiently high (i.e., normoxia), the EGL-9/PHD family of prolyl hydroxylases employs molecular oxygen, 2-oxoglutarate, and iron to hydroxylate specific proline side chains on the HIFα transcription factors, resulting in the inactivation of these transcription factors by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fong and Takeda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aragones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Majmundar et al., 2010</xref>). When oxygen levels are not sufficiently high (i.e., hypoxia), the EGL-9/PHD prolyl hydroxylases become inactive, resulting in HIFα protein stabilization and thus a transcriptional change in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Semenza, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fandrey and Gassmann, 2009</xref>). Depending on the specific cells and tissues undergoing stress, HIFα can mediate adaptive responses to hypoxia that include increased erythropoiesis, increased angiogenesis, and reprogramming of metabolism away from oxidative phosphorylation and towards glycolysis and anaerobic fermentation. In addition to its role in response to acute hypoxic stress, the hypoxia response pathway also helps to maintain stem cell niches and tumor growth and metastasis in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amelio and Melino, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gupta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ito and Suda, 2014</xref>). Whereas the major target of oxygen regulation through EGL-9/PHD proteins is HIFα, several studies have shown that EGL-9/PHD oxygen sensors regulate additional proteins as part of the overall hypoxia response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Koditz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fu and Taubman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cummins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, while the core pathway of the hypoxia response is well established, it is less clear how the pathway uses alternative effectors and modulators in different tissues and contexts so as to tailor the specific physiological response to stress.</p><p>Mammalian neurons are particularly sensitive to hypoxia, making in vivo studies challenging. The genetically tractable and hypoxia tolerant model organism <italic>C. elegans</italic> has allowed investigators to study how the hypoxia response pathway functions in multiple tissue types, developmental stages, and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leiser and Kaeberlein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Powell-Coffman, 2010</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> possess a single prolyl hydroxylase, called EGL-9, and a single HIFα, called HIF-1. These two proteins are expressed in essentially all tissues in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where they mediate the primary response that allows nematodes to survive when they encounter hypoxic niches within their natural environment of the soil. HIF-1 also has a complex role in regulating aging and protein homeostasis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rodriguez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fawcett et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Hypoxia modulates a specific nematode behavior through EGL-9 but independent of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Nematodes navigate their environment using a biased random walk comprised of long runs of forward locomotion and spontaneous reversals of locomotion followed by changes in direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cohen and Sanders, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gray et al., 2005</xref>). The frequency of spontaneous reversals is determined by the activity of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) located in a small number of command interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schaefer and Rongo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mellem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoids zones of hypoxia using a combination of sensory neuron-mediated aerotaxis and command interneuron-mediated spontaneous reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>). In a normoxic environment, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a relatively high frequency of spontaneous reversals, resulting in a bias towards local foraging behaviors. When exposed to hypoxia for long periods, <italic>C. elegans</italic> exhibits a depressed frequency of spontaneous reversals, resulting in a bias towards roaming behavior that allows the animal to potentially exit the hypoxic environment. The local foraging behavior in normoxic environments requires EGL-9, as <italic>egl-9</italic> mutants exhibit decreased reversals similar to those observed under hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Surprisingly, this behavioral phenotype does not require HIF-1.</p><p>Hypoxia and EGL-9 regulate <italic>C. elegans</italic> reversal behavior by regulating the membrane trafficking of the AMPAR subunit GLR-1. GLR-1-containing AMPARs act in the command interneurons to receive synaptic input and direct overall locomotory reversal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hart et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mellem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maricq et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang and Rongo, 2005</xref>). Mutants that lack GLR-1 have a depressed frequency of spontaneous reversals. The synaptic localization of GLR-1 can be detected in vivo using a functional GLR-1::GFP chimeric protein, and mutants that fail to localize GLR-1 to synapses also have a depressed frequency of reversals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burbea et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Glodowski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schaefer and Rongo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rongo et al., 1998</xref>). Wild-type animals exposed to hypoxia (or <italic>egl-9</italic> mutants under normoxia) accumulate GLR-1 receptors in internal endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>). Under normoxia, oxygen promotes the interaction and endosomal recruitment of EGL-9 with LIN-10, an ortholog of the Mint/X11 scaffolding molecules, and LIN-10 in turn promotes GLR-1 recycling to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Whitfield et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Glodowski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">2012</xref>). Under hypoxia, EGL-9 releases LIN-10, allowing LIN-10 to be phosphorylated by the CDK-5 kinase. Phosphorylated LIN-10 is then released from endosomes, resulting in diminished GLR-1 recycling, depletion of synaptic GLR-1 by endocytosis without accompanying recycling, and decreased GLR-1-mediated reversal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Juo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>EGL-9 and oxygen regulate GLR-1 recycling through a novel HIF-1-independent mechanism, suggesting that different tissues can employ parts of the hypoxia response pathway for specialized functions, and that additional modulators and mediators of the pathway remain to be discovered. Here, we show that signaling through the kinases SEK-1 (p38 MAPKK) and PMK-1 (p38 MAPK) regulate GLR-1 recycling and GLR-1-mediated reversal behavior by modulating the hypoxia response pathway. Loss of function mutations in either <italic>pmk-1 or sek-1</italic> mimic the effects of hypoxia on GLR-1 trafficking and behavioral output. Wild-type SEK-1 and PMK-1 promote the endosomal localization of EGL-9 and LIN-10 in neurons under normoxia, and the effect of <italic>sek-1</italic> or <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutations on EGL-9/LIN-10 co-localization and GLR-1 recycling requires the activity of the CDK-5 kinase. Wild-type SEK-1 and PMK-1 also regulate HIF-1 throughout the organism. Older animals show reduced levels of activated PMK-1, GLR-1 internalization, and decreased GLR-1-mediated behaviors. The reduction of functional GLR-1 in older animals can be prevented through either the overexpression of PMK-1 or the removal of CDK-5. Our findings demonstrate that p38 MAPK is a modulator of the hypoxia response pathway through EGL-9, and that this novel mechanism helps determine how aging neurons respond to hypoxia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Signaling through p38 MAPK regulates GLR-1 AMPAR localization</title><p>We previously showed that the hypoxia response pathway regulates GLR-1 recycling and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>), and we therefore reasoned that other signaling pathways that respond to oxidative stress conditions might also contribute to GLR-1 regulation. One such signaling molecule is the p38 MAPK ortholog PMK-1, which is involved in oxidative stress response and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). To determine if this p38 MAPK regulates GLR-1 trafficking, we obtained a viable mutant strain homozygous for a complete loss of function (deletion) allele in <italic>pmk-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mizuno et al., 2004</xref>). We introduced a transgene, <italic>nuIs25</italic>, which expresses full length, functional GLR-1 receptors tagged with GFP (GLR-1::GFP), into <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants. In wild-type nematodes, GLR-1::GFP is localized to discrete puncta (mean diameter of 0.48 microns, SEM of 0.01 microns, 95% of puncta are between 0.32 and 0.73 microns in diameter) along the ventral cord dendrites of interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with 85% of such puncta colocalized with synaptic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rongo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burbea et al., 2002</xref>). We found that <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants accumulated GLR-1::GFP in elongated structures (mean length of 2.30 microns, SEM of 0.10 microns, 95% of these accumulations are between 1.32 and 3.49 microns in length) along the ventral cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), similar to the GLR-1::GFP accumulations in elongated endosomes observed in mutants for membrane recycling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glodowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kramer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Park et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rongo et al., 1998</xref>). GLR-1 puncta and GLR-1 accumulations are distinct enough in shape and size to allow easy quantification of their respective numbers along the ventral cord dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). We found a sizeable decrease in the number of GLR-1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and a five-fold increase in the number of GLR-1 elongated accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants relative to wild type. Expression of a wild-type <italic>pmk-1</italic> cDNA from the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter, which drives expression specifically in the command interneurons, was sufficient to rescue <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants, indicating a cell autonomous requirement for PMK-1 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The observed changes in GLR-1 were unlikely to be due to general defects in synapse formation or overall cell polarity, as the localization of a synaptobrevin-GFP reporter (SNB-1::GFP), which decorates synaptic vesicles at interneuron presynaptic elements when expressed from a transgene, did not change in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants relative to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). In addition, we detected similar levels of <italic>glr-1</italic> mRNA in wild-type animals and <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants, indicating that PMK-1 regulates GLR-1 in a posttranscriptional fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12010.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Signaling through PMK-1 p38 MAPK regulates GLR-1 AMPAR trafficking.</title><p>GLR-1::GFP fluorescence in (<bold>A</bold>) wild-type animals and (<bold>B</bold>) <italic>pmk-1(km25)</italic> mutants.

To determine if these signaling molecules are required to regulate GLR-1 trafficking, we examined GLR-1::GFP in loss of function mutations for both genes. A loss of function allele for <italic>sek-1</italic> resulted in a similar GLR-1 localization phenotype to that observed in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

As the p38 MAPK pathway could regulate LIN-10 either directly or indirectly by regulating EGL-9, we examined EGL-9E::GFP subcellular localization in p38 MAPK signaling mutants.

One explanation for the impaired localization of EGL-9E in p38 MAPK signaling mutants is if EGL-9E were to depend on LIN-10, the localization of which is also affected in these p38 MAPK mutants. The loss of EGL-9E would thus be a secondary consequence of impaired LIN-10 localization in these mutants.

We tested these possibilities by first generating a transgene that overexpresses a wild-type PMK-1 cDNA via the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter. Wild-type animals that overexpress PMK-1 from this transgene showed normal punctate GLR-1::GFP even in 9-day adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E–H</xref>), indicating that simply elevating PMK-1 is sufficient to suppress the defects observed during aging (when the levels of activated PMK-1 are observed to drop). Next, we examined older <italic>cdk-5</italic> mutants and found that they also failed to accumulate endosomal GLR-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,D,G,H</xref>), indicating that CDK-5 is required for the defect in GLR-1 recycling in older animals. Mutations in <italic>cdk-5</italic> also partially restored GLR-1 function in aging animals, as <italic>cdk-5</italic> adults as late as 6 days post L4 have elevated rates of spontaneous reversals relative to wild-type animals of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>).

Whereas <italic>cdk-5</italic> mutants showed more robust reversal behavior during aging relative to wild type, they nevertheless still showed a decline in reversals and GLR-1 puncta number over time, suggesting that additional factors contribute to age-associated decline in this behavioral modality. For example, muscle decline dramatically impairs locomotion in 9-day adults, making interpretation of more subtle behavioral phenotypes like reversal frequency challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herndon et al., 2002</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that AMPAR GLR-1 recycling and function decline with age, and that this decline is due, at least in part, to depressed p38 MAPK signaling, subsequent activation of the HIF-1-independent hypoxia response pathway, and CDK-5 activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have shown that p38 MAPK signaling modulates both the canonical hypoxia response pathway and a non-canonical hypoxia response pathway that regulates GLR-1 AMPAR trafficking and GLR-1-mediated behavior. The canonical hypoxia pathway senses oxygen via the prolyl hydroxylase EGL-9, which uses dioxygen to hydroxylate a proline residue on the transcription factor HIF-1, resulting in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Epstein et al., 2001</xref>). The non-canonical pathway senses oxygen via a specific isoform of EGL-9, called EGL-9E, which, when activated by oxygen, binds to the scaffolding molecule LIN-10, recruiting it to endosomes where it promotes the recycling of GLR-1 AMPARs to the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Park et al., 2012</xref>). We find that if animals are under normal oxygen conditions and are young, then the p38 MAPKK SEK-1 and the p38 MAPK PMK-1 promote EGL-9 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–D</xref>). Active EGL-9 in turn triggers HIF-1 turnover, thereby preventing a HIF-1 transcriptional response. In addition, p38 MAPK signaling also promotes the association of EGL-9E with LIN-10, in turn mediating steady GLR-1 recycling. By contrast, if animals are under conditions of hypoxia, then EGL-9 activity is depressed, resulting in HIF-1 stabilization and the activation of the HIF-1 transcriptional response. In addition, depressed EGL-9 activity exposes LIN-10 to phosphorylation by the CDK-5 kinase, resulting in LIN-10 delocalization in neurons and depressed GLR-1 recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E–H</xref>). This regulation results in long term changes in synaptic efficacy in the command circuit, which switches locomotion behavior from local foraging to long-distance roaming. This behavioral switch in locomotion allows the animal to escape the hypoxic environment. As animals grow older, p38 MAPK activity decreases despite the presence of ample oxygen, resulting in impaired GLR-1 recycling through the action of CDK-5. Our findings suggest that p38 MAPK signaling is an important part of the hypoxia response pathway.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12010.013</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical model for p38 MAPK regulation of the hypoxia response pathway.</title><p>A hypothetical, step-by-step model of hypoxia response pathway interactions in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurons is shown for conditions of either (<bold>A-D</bold>) normoxia or (<bold>E-H</bold>) hypoxia. (<bold>A</bold>) Under normoxia, oxygen binds to and activates EGL-9 (pink ovals). Oxygen also activates SEK-1 and PMK-1 (p38 MAPK, green and yellow ovals, respectively) through a mechanism that remains unknown. Activated p38 MAPK in turn phosphorylates one or more proteins (possible EGL-9 itself, as speculated in this cartoon with a ‘P’ in a yellow circle) that activate EGL-9 and trigger its recruitment to endosomes. Meanwhile, GLR-1 receptors (red channels) undergo continual endocytosis at the synapse. (<bold>B</bold>) Isoform EGL-9E, now bound to oxygen and possibly phosphorylated by p38 MAPK, becomes localized to endosomes, where it binds the PDZ-PTB domain protein LIN-10 (orange oval) and recruits it to endosomes by preventing its phosphorylation by the CDK-5 kinase (purple oval). (<bold>C</bold>) Once at endosomes, LIN-10 promotes the recycling of endocytosed GLR-1 AMPARs (red channels in the endosome) back to the synapse.

Several groups have observed changes in HIF activity triggered by ERK and p38 MAPK (possibly activated by ROS generated from mitochondria under hypoxia), yet it remains controversial whether the mechanism is direct phosphorylation of HIF-1 by p38 MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Conrad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardos and Ashcroft, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Minet et al., 2001</xref>). Our findings here would suggest a novel mechanism by which p38 MAPK signaling regulates HIF-1: the regulation of the PHD enzymes that act upstream of HIF-1. This mechanism could provide an important link between growth factor signaling and the hypoxia response pathway in maintaining stem cell populations and promoting tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>If p38 MAPK regulates HIF-1 activity, then what is the specific physiological role of this regulation? To what is p38 MAPK responding? While PHD proteins are well-established oxygen sensors in the hypoxia response pathway, there is also a likely role for the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) in sensing oxygen during hypoxia. Even under conditions of normal oxygen, the ETC produces low levels of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Turrens, 2003</xref>). Perhaps ROS activates a baseline level of p38 MAPK under normoxic conditions, acting as part of an additional oxygen sensing mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Indeed, we did observe that normal oxygen levels promoted PMK-1 nuclear localization in the command interneurons, and hypoxia resulted in PMK-1 depletion from the nucleus, suggesting that oxygen (or its byproducts) could be activating PMK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H,I</xref>).</p><p>An alternative explanation for why we observe activation of the hypoxia response pathway in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants is that the activation is due to an indirect effect of losing the baseline expression of the oxidative stress response in these mutants. In this scenario, <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants accumulate products of oxidative stress (e.g., ROS and oxidized macromolecules), which would mimic hypoxia, perhaps through the actions of ROS directly inactivating EGL-9. We feel that this scenario is unlikely because <italic>skn-1</italic> mutants, which are arguably more impaired for the oxidative stress response than are <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants, do not show induction of hypoxia response target genes like <italic>nhr-57</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oliveira et al., 2009</xref>). Nor did <italic>skn-1</italic> mutants show the same GLR-1 localization defects that we observed in <italic>pmk-1</italic> and <italic>egl-9</italic> mutants. Instead, we favor a model in which PMK-1 directly silences the hypoxia response during normoxia, and that it does so independent of its role in the oxidative stress response. It remains a possibility that the additional ROS that is generated during long-term hypoxia and/or reoxygenation might further activate PMK-1, providing a negative feedback that restores the hypoxia response back to a normoxia baseline, thereby minimizing the dangers of ROS production that occur during extended hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation. Too much PMK-1 activation (e.g., during extreme anoxia) might contribute to toxicity; indeed, mutations in <italic>pmk-1</italic> increase the survival of animals exposed to long-term anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayakawa et al., 2011</xref>)</p><p>Consistent with our model, <italic>C. elegans</italic> PMK-1 is activated by oxidative stress in addition to being activated by pathogenic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). Bacterial pathogens and anoxia exposure can both activate PMK-1 through the Toll/IL-1 resistance (TIR) domain protein TIR-1, the ASK1 ortholog MAPKKK NSY-1, and the MKK3 MAPKK SEK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liberati et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Papp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayakawa et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas SEK-1 and PMK-1 are activated by oxidative stress, NSY-1 and TIR-1 do not appear to be critical components through which <italic>C. elegans</italic> respond to oxidative stress and presumably ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>). Our results clearly show that NSY-1 is not required for oxygen levels to modulate the hypoxia response, and given that NSY-1 is the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> ASK1 ortholog, it seems likely that SEK-1 and PMK-1 are activated by a different MAPKKK under these conditions. Identifying the specific MAPKKK will be an important next step in determining how the p38 MAPK PMK-1 pathway senses hypoxia (perhaps through an alternative ROS sensor) and modulates the hypoxia response.</p><p>In addition to its acute role in promoting survival during oxygen deprivation stress, the hypoxia response pathway also has a complex role in regulating aging and lifespan beyond simply maintaining stem cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Katschinski, 2006</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, hypoxia and limited stabilization of HIF-1 promote longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leiser and Kaeberlein, 2010</xref>). However, loss of EGL-9, which results in extreme HIF-1 stabilization, does not promote longevity and can be actually detrimental to lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellier et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, loss of HIF-1 can also promote longevity under conditions of elevated temperature via a separate mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leiser et al., 2011</xref>). As nematodes grow older, the levels of active PMK-1 decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Youngman et al., 2011</xref>), which might result in elevated HIF-1 activity. Whereas mutants for <italic>pmk-1</italic> have a similar lifespan to that of wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Troemel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alper et al., 2010</xref>), it is worth noting that the observed decrease in PMK-1 levels over time could impair nervous system function in a manner that would be missed by simple life span analysis. We find that GLR-1 accumulates in endosomes as nematodes grow older, similar to what occurs in young <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants, and that either the simple overexpression of PMK-1 or the removal of CDK-5, an inhibitor of its downstream target LIN-10, restores both GLR-1 localization and function to levels observed in younger animals. Our findings highlight the idea that changes in kinase signaling could explain aspects of age-associated physiological decline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenes and Germline Transformation</title><p>Transgenes generated in this study include (1) a wild-type <italic>pmk-1</italic> cDNA fused to the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter, (2) a wild-type <italic>sek-1</italic> cDNA fused to the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter, and (3) a wild-type <italic>pmk-1</italic> cDNA fused in frame to GFP and placed behind the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter.

Fluorescent images were observed using a Zeiss Axioplan II. A 100X (N.A. = 1.4) PlanApo objective was used to detect GFP and RFP signals. Imaging was done with an ORCA charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) using IPLab software (Scanalytics, Inc, Fairfax, VA) or iVision v4.0.11 (Biovision Technologies, Exton, PA) software. Exposure times were chosen to fill the 12-bit dynamic range without saturation. Maximum intensity projections of z-series stacks were obtained and out-of-focus light was removed with a constrained iterative deconvolution algorithm (iVision). For images, we captured the anterior ventral cord dendrites in the anterior region containing the RIG and AVG cell bodies.</p><p>The quantification of ventral nerve cord fluorescent objects (i.e., puncta and elongated compartments) was done using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collins, 2007</xref>) to automatically threshold the images and then determine the outlines of fluorescent objects in ventral cord dendrites. ImageJ was used to quantify both the shape and the size of all individual fluorescent objects along the ventral cord. This allowed us to distinguish between the small GLR-1::GFP puncta in wild-type animals and the large, aberrant compartments (which have an elongated shape rarely observed in wild type) in hypoxic animals, as well as in thevariousindicated mutants. Object size was measured as the maximum diameter for each outlined puncta. Object number was calculated by counting the average number of puncta per 100 microns of dendrite length. The amount of a given fluorescent protein per puncta was calculated by summing all of the pixel values contained within each individual punctum to yield an integrated optical density (IOD) score for each punctum.</p><p>Colocalization between GLR-1::GFP and mRFP::SYX-7 was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Park et al., 2009</xref>). Single optical images for neuronal cell bodies expressing both reporters were collected using a confocal microscope equipped with the BD CARV II Confocal Imager and a Carl Zeiss 100× Plan-Apochroma objective (N.A. = 1.4). For quantitative colocalization analysis, all image manipulations were performed with iVision v4.0.11 (Biovision Technologies, Exton, PA) software using the FCV colocalization function. We applied an empirically derived threshold to all images for both the GLR-1::GFP channel and the mRFP::SYX-7 channel to eliminate background coverslip fluorescence and other noise (typically 5% of pixels for each channel). The fluorescent intensity values for both the GLR-1::GFP and mRFP::SYX-7 channels were then scatter plotted for each pixel. Pixels with similar intensity values for both channels (within an empirically-established tolerance factor) were counted as colocalized. To acquire the fraction of GLR-1::GFP colocalized with mRFP::SYX-7, the number of colocalized pixels was normalized to the number of GLR-1::GFP pixels under threshold. To maximize our resolving power while observing the relatively small <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuron cell bodies, we restricted our analysis to a single confocal optical section taken through the middle of each cell body.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p>The reversal frequency of individual animals was assayed as previously described, but with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>).

Your article has been evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jan-Marino Ramirez, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Ganesh Kumar.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Combining behavioral and various genetic (knock-ins and single/double knockouts) approaches this study implicates the p38 Map kinase pathway in the hypoxic response of young and old <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The results are timely and of general interest, because increasing evidence from various animal models suggests that the MAPK/P38 kinase pathway is associated with the hypoxic response, oxidative stress, inflammation, and aging, but the underlying mechanisms are often not fully understood. Here, the authors delineate a novel pathway involving components of p38 MAP kinase signaling that participates in the control of glutamate receptor (GLR1) trafficking and GLR-1 mediated reversal behavior. Interestingly, the identified pathway is mediated via an HIF-independent mechanism involving EGL-9, a prolyl hydroxylase isoform. A strength of the study is that authors use multiple assays to measure the interactions between p38 MAPK and hypoxia-sensing including measurements of glutamate receptor distribution within axons, surface-accessibility of glutamate receptors and a behavioral assay that reflects the function of glutamatergic synapses in motor circuits.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To highlight and contrast this pathway from other published views on oxygen sensing, please consider the following studies. There is some evidence for a role of guanylate cyclase homologue in oxygen sensation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Gray et al., Nature 430: 317-322, 2004). Also, there is a recent paper in Science Signaling elaborates a gas messenger-dependent acute oxygen sensing involving carbon monoxide-PKG-mediated phosphorylation of target enzyme as a critical step (Yuan et al., Sci. Signal 8(373): ra37, 2015). A pertinent discussion on these findings in comparison to the current work will further highlight the prevalence of context specific variations in oxygen sensing mechanisms.</p><p>2) The Discussion section needs some rearrangement. The importance of the identified O2-ROS-p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) of the LIN-1/EGL-9 is lost amongst lengthy discussion on studies showing increased ROS formation under hypoxia by other investigators. Putative role of ROS under hypoxia in the current model of the study is only speculative and therefore can be shortened considerably.</p><p>3) Two key questions are posed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. First, do PMK-1 and EGL-9 act in a common pathway? Second, is PMK-1 required for the effects of hypoxia on receptor localization? All the data needed to ask these questions are in panels E and F but the comparisons are not. The authors should indicate whether the difference between <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants, <italic>egl-9</italic> mutants and <italic>pmk-1; egl-9</italic> double mutants can be attributed to chance or not. Ditto for the differences between <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants raised in normoxic and hypoxic. To put it more simply: the asterisks in panels E and F don't help to make the comparisons.</p><p>4) Please add some clarifications to the experiments that measure glutamate receptors in endosomes using co-localization with SYX-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-Q</xref>). First, these experiments determine the distribution of glutamate receptors in compartments in the cell body unlike every other experiment in which receptor distribution is determined in neurites. Is SYX-7 marking endosomes in neurites? If not, then the SYX-7-positive endosomes in the soma differ from the endosomes in neurites and what happens in these endosomes doesn't necessarily inform us about what happens in neurites.</p><p>Also, the Methods should make clear how this colocalization was measured. It seems that the data are single optical sections through cell bodies neurons expressing both markers, but this isn't clear in the manuscript. Because the distribution of fluorescence within the cell is complicated and the colocalization between signals is not obvious it is critical that the reader understand how the data are analyzed to reach the conclusion that PMK-1 affects localization to endosomes.</p><p>5) In your model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), please indicate the phosphorylation state of LIN-1 or EGL-9 under normoxia and hypoxia.</p><p>6) One of the reviewers had comments that suggested additional experiments, &quot;low-hanging fruits&quot; that would add considerably to the paper. We are not requiring these for acceptance, but ask that you consider whether you can do some or all of these rapidly, and if so, we would welcome their addition. But, in any case please address these comments.</p><p>a) An interesting question is where PMK-1 is localized in these neurons. Is there a pool of p38 MAPK in the neurite that acts locally? The presented model suggests that this is what the authors are thinking, and this idea is readily testable.</p><p>b) The authors propose that the p38 MAPK PMK-1 acts in a novel pathway to regulate glutamate receptor localization. This claim is based on the observation that the known upstream MAPKKK for PMK-1, NSY-1, and a known target of PMK-1 signaling, SKN-1, are not required for receptor localization. This is an interesting point and would benefit from additional data. The authors could test other genes linked to PMK-1 signaling, such as TIR-1 and ATF-7.

First, do PMK-1 and EGL-9 act in a common pathway? Second, is PMK-1 required for the effects of hypoxia on receptor localization? All the data needed to ask these questions are in panels E and F but the comparisons are not.

We find that the number of GLR-1 aggregates in <italic>pmk-1 egl-9</italic> double mutants is not statistically greater than the number observed in <italic>pmk-1</italic> single mutants. We find that the number of GLR-1 synaptic puncta in <italic>pmk-1 egl-9</italic> double mutants is not statistically distinguishable from the number observed in <italic>pmk-1</italic> single mutants. We also used the same test to examine whether hypoxia can enhance the phenotype caused by <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutations. We find that the number of GLR-1 aggregates in hypoxic <italic>pmk-1</italic> animals is not statistically distinguishable from the number observed in normoxic <italic>pmk-1</italic> animals. We do find that the number of GLR-1 puncta on hypoxic <italic>pmk-1</italic> animals is statistically different from the number observed in normoxic <italic>pmk-1</italic> animals; however, the magnitude of that difference is small (a 19% decrease). This could indicate that hypoxia can alter GLR-1 puncta number by an additional mechanism other than through PMK-1 regulation; however, such an additional mechanism would be minor in comparison to the PMK-1-mediated mechanism. We have added these comparisons to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Please add some clarifications to the experiments that measure glutamate receptors in endosomes using co-localization with SYX-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-Q</xref>). First, these experiments determine the distribution of glutamate receptors in compartments in the cell body unlike every other experiment in which receptor distribution is determined in neurites. Is SYX-7 marking endosomes in neurites? If not, then the SYX-7-positive endosomes in the soma differ from the endosomes in neurites and what happens in these endosomes doesn't necessarily inform us about what happens in neurites.</italic></p><p>Visualizing endosomes in <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurites using genetically encoded fluorescent proteins has remained a challenge in the field. The number of smooth endosomal compartments detectable in the interneuron neurites is relatively small (Rolls et al., 2002). Approaches using the GFP-tagged membrane residents of endosomes have typically be confounded by such molecules also decorating the neurite plasma membrane at high enough of a level as to obscure endosomal detection in underlying neurite (Hoerndli et al., 2013). The cell body is large enough to provide structural distance between the plasma membrane and endosomes, allowing us to visualize endosomal structures. This approach has been adopted in multiple previous publications (Zhang et al., 2012, Chun et al., 2008, Monteiro et al., 2012, Kowalski et al., 2011). Formally our results do not directly demonstrate that GLR-1 is accumulating at SYX-7-decorated endosomes in the neurites of <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants, although the ability to suppress GLR-1 accumulation in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutant neurites by blocking endocytosis is functional evidence that lends itself to this conclusion. Nevertheless, we have altered the text in the Results section concerning this experiment to reflect this uncertainty.</p><p><italic>Also, the Methods should make clear how this colocalization was measured. It seems that the data are single optical sections through cell bodies neurons expressing both markers, but this isn't clear in the manuscript. Because the distribution of fluorescence within the cell is complicated and the colocalization between signals is not obvious it is critical that the reader understand how the data are analyzed to reach the conclusion that PMK-1 affects localization to endosomes.</italic></p><p>We have clarified the Results section concerning colocalization and added an extensive description to the Materials and methods section of how the colocalization results were obtained.</p><p><italic>5) In your model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), please indicate the phosphorylation state of LIN-1 or EGL-9 under normoxia and hypoxia.</italic></p><p>We have created a new figure that focuses on the pathway’s role in regulating GLR-1 recycling with the goal of making the figure simpler and easier to follow. In addition, as requested by the reviewers, we have indicated the hypothesized phosphorylation states of LIN-10 and EGL-9 in the model.</p><p><italic>6) One of the reviewers had comments that suggested additional experiments, &quot;low-hanging fruits&quot; that would add considerably to the paper. We are not requiring these for acceptance, but ask that you consider whether you can do some or all of these rapidly, and if so, we would welcome their addition. But, in any case please address these comments.</italic></p><p>We have completed the most straightforward experiments requested by the reviewer. A more extensive exploration of these questions would go beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Our conclusions from these experiments follow below.</p><p> <italic>a) An interesting question is where PMK-1 is localized in these neurons. Is there a pool of p38 MAPK in the neurite that acts locally? The presented model suggests that this is what the authors are thinking, and this idea is readily testable.</italic></p><p>We have examined this by generating a transgene that expresses a PMK-1::GFP chimeric protein under the control of the <italic>glr-1</italic> promoter (thus restricting its expression to the command interneurons in question). We find that PMK-1::GFP is enriched in the cell body nucleus, but is also clearly found in the cytosol of the cell body and the ventral cord dendrites. The simplest model is that the abundant pool of PMK-1 in the dendrites can phosphorylate EGL-9 and other relevant targets in those same dendrites. However, this experiment cannot exclude the possibility that nuclear PMK-1 has a role with respect to regulating glutamate receptor trafficking. We have added this data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p> <italic>b) The authors propose that the p38 MAPK PMK-1 acts in a novel pathway to regulate glutamate receptor localization. This claim is based on the observation that the known upstream MAPKKK for PMK-1, NSY-1, and a known target of PMK-1 signaling, SKN-1, are not required for receptor localization. This is an interesting point and would benefit from additional data. The authors could test other genes linked to PMK-1 signaling, such as TIR-1 and ATF-7. Also, there are a small number of MAPKKKs encoded by the C. elegans genome. If the canonical MAPKKK is not regulating PMK-1 in this context perhaps one of the others is. There are a small number of predicted MAPKKKs in C. elegans. Do any MAPKKK mutants have defects in glutamate receptor localization?</italic></p><p>We have examined several different alleles of <italic>tir-1</italic> but not observed a GLR-1 localization defect. We have also examined mutants for the MAPKKKK <italic>mlk-1</italic> and <italic>kin-18</italic>, but we have not observed a GLR-1 localization phenotype. Similarly, mutations in <italic>atf-7</italic> do not affect GLR-1 localization, nor do they suppress the defects observed in <italic>pmk-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>We previously showed that mutations in the MAPKKK <italic>dlk-1</italic> can suppress the accumulation of GLR-1 observed in <italic>lin-10</italic> mutants (Park et al., 2009). However, this is the opposite phenotype one would expect for the loss of function of the MAPKKK that regulates PMK-1. Indeed, we showed in the same publication that DLK-1 acts as the MAPKKK for the MAPKK MKK-4 and the p38 MAPK PMK-3. This pathway acts on GLR-1 glutamate receptor trafficking by promoting GLR-1 endocytosis: mutations in the pathway result in depressed GLR-1 endocytosis, which suppresses the accumulation of GLR-1 observed in <italic>lin-10</italic> mutants, which are blocked for recycling.</p><p>Recently a role in the nervous system for the third p38 MAPK in <italic>C. elegans, pmk-2</italic>, was reported (Pagano et al., 2015). We examined <italic>pmk-2</italic> mutants for GLR-1 localization; however, we did not observe a phenotype. Given that PMK-1 and PMK-2 could act with partial redundancy, we also examined double mutants; however, <italic>pmk-1 pmk-2</italic> double mutants had a similar GLR-1 localization defect to that observed in <italic>pmk-1</italic> single mutants.</p><p>All of the data described above has been added as panels for the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> extended figure.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>“… We generated a transgene containing the glr-1 promoter driving a full length PMK-1::GFP chimeric protein”.
