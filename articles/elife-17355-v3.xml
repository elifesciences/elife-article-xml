cells). Notch signaling is known to be essential for the maintenance of satellite cells, but its function in late-stage myogenesis, i.e. post-differentiation myocytes and post-fusion myotubes, is unknown. Using stage-specific Cre alleles, we uncovered distinct roles of Notch1 in mononucleated myocytes and multinucleated myotubes. Specifically, constitutive Notch1 activation dedifferentiates myocytes into Pax7 quiescent satellite cells, leading to severe defects in muscle growth and regeneration, and postnatal lethality. By contrast, myotube-specific Notch1 activation improves the regeneration and exercise performance of aged and dystrophic muscles. Mechanistically, Notch1 activation in myotubes upregulates the expression of Notch ligands, which modulate Notch signaling in the adjacent satellite cells to enhance their regenerative capacity. These results highlight context-dependent effects of Notch activation during myogenesis, and demonstrate that Notch1 activity improves myotube’s function as a stem cell niche.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17355.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17355.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17355.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscles do much more than enable the body to move; they are also important organs involved in the metabolism. Conditions ranging from muscular dystrophy to insulin resistance result from problems that affect muscle tissue. Hence, understanding the signaling mechanisms that regulate how muscles develop and work will be critical to improving muscle-related health conditions.</p><p>To form and repair muscles, muscle progenitor cells develop (or differentiate) into new muscle cells, which then fuse to form muscle fibers. A signaling pathway involving a protein known as Notch regulates how cells communicate during development, and has been shown to play a key role in muscle progenitor cells. However, it was not known what role Notch signaling plays in the differentiated muscle cells.</p><p>Bi, Yue et al. have now studied genetically modified mice in which Notch signaling could be manipulated in certain types of cells. In mice with increased Notch signaling in both their newly differentiated muscle cells and muscle fibers, any unfused muscle cells were forced to return to an undifferentiated state, a process called dedifferentiation. This led to the muscles wasting away and resulted in the mice dying young. By contrast, in mice that only experienced activated Notch signaling in their muscle fibers, no dedifferentiation was seen. However, aged and dystrophic muscles in these mice regained the ability to contract and regenerate.</p><p>Bi, Yue et al. hope that these findings will transform into new strategies to activate or inactivate Notch signaling at different stages of muscle development or regeneration.

Besides the motor function that is essential for life, muscle is also a key metabolic organ, responsible for 80–90% of postprandial insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, muscle intimately interplays with many other organs, and regulates their homeostasis and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baskin et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, proper muscle function is important for human health and life quality.</p><p>In adult skeletal muscles, resident stem cells called satellite cells (SCs) are indispensable for postnatal muscle growth and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Grand and Rudnicki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pawlikowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Relaix and Zammit, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sambasivan et al., 2011</xref>). SCs are wedged between the plasma membrane of muscle fiber (i.e., myofiber) and the basal lamina that surrounds the myofiber. The juxtaposition of SCs immediately identifies myofiber as an important regulator of SCs. Consistent with this notion, transplantation of myofibers carrying SCs, but not SCs alone, elicited life-long amelioration of aging-related muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). Besides myofibers, SCs also actively interact with interstitial fibroblasts, preadipocytes, endothelial cells and macrophages, which together with myofibers constitute the unique microenvironment, or niche that regulates the homeostasis of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aurora and Olson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Christov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murphy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sonnet et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Age-related muscle wasting (sarcopenia) and degenerative muscular dystrophy are linked to decline of SCs’ abundance and functionality, as a result of changes in niche function and intrinsic properties of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sacco and Puri, 2015</xref>). As such, FGF2, p38, STAT3, p16, canonical Wnt and Notch signaling, and epigenetic status are identified as aberrantly dysregulated factors in aged SCs that account for impaired self-renewal of SCs during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chakkalakal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cosgrove et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Price et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sousa-Victor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tierney et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Stepwise progression of myogenesis is tightly orchestrated by several key transcriptional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentzinger et al., 2012</xref>). Among them, Pax7 (Paired box 7) is the faithful marker for SCs, and also indispensable for proper postnatal muscle regeneration by controlling expansion and differentiation of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Seale et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">von Maltzahn et al., 2013</xref>). Activation of myogenesis relies on the expression of several members of the basic helix-loop-helix domain-containing myogenic regulatory factors: Myf5, Myod1 (also known as MyoD), Myf6 and myogenin (Myog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentzinger et al., 2012</xref>). When stimulated, SCs break quiescence and express MyoD, which promotes S-phase entry and facilitates SCs activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Halevy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Olguin and Olwin, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zammit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, MyoD and Myf5 act as upstream regulators of Myog and Myf6, which are required for terminal differentiation of myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bentzinger et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, certain microRNAs, epigenetics, serum response factor (SRF) and members of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) are also fundamentally important for proper muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheung et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haberland et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shenoy and Blelloch, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Williams et al., 2009</xref>), which eventually leads to expression of muscle tissue-specific genes such as muscle creatine kinase (MCK), myosin light chain (MLC) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) members.</p><p>The opposite process of differentiation, or dedifferentiation is a fascinating phenomenon that bears great therapeutic potentials by generating stem cell sources for tissue repair. In zebrafish and amphibians, dedifferentiation is an integral part of tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morrison et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, in the newt, fragmentation and dedifferentiation of myofibers generate a pool of proliferating mononucleated cells that give rise to the skeletal muscle of a new limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sandoval-Guzman et al., 2014</xref>). However, in mammals, there is no evidence of dedifferentiation that occurs as a natural part of tissue regeneration. The underlying mechanism that determines such dramatic inter-species difference is largely unknown. Intriguingly, recent studies reported that dedifferentiation can be induced in muscle cells of several genetically engineered mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kubin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pajcini et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, concomitant inactivation of two tumor-suppressors Arf and Rb in mononucleated mouse myocytes led to loss of differentiation properties, cell cycle reentry and generation of cells that were capable to redifferentiate into skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pajcini et al., 2010</xref>). Undoubtedly, better understanding of mechanisms underlying muscle dedifferentiation will allow the invention of future medicine to treat geriatric muscle disease, where the SC number is limited.</p><p>Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that plays crucial functions in organ development, tissue homeostasis, stem cell fate choice, metabolism and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bi and Kuang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ranganathan et al., 2011</xref>). Notch signaling transduction is initiated upon binding of a Notch receptor (Notch1-4) with a ligand (Dll1, Dll4, Jag1, Jag2) located on a neighbor cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequently, Notch receptors are cleaved by several enzymes including γ–secretase, which releases the <underline>N</underline>otch <underline>i</underline>ntra<underline>c</underline>ellular <underline>d</underline>omain (NICD). NICD then translocates to the nucleus, where it binds with Rbpj and other cofactors to activate the transcription of canonical Notch targets, including Hes and Hey family genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopan, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In postnatal myogenesis, Notch signaling is indispensable for maintaining quiescence and self-renewal of SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bjornson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fukada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mourikis et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vasyutina et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, during development SCs rely on Notch signaling to acquire 'satellite' position aside of myofiber by controlling the assembly of basal lamina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brohl et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, Notch is a potent inhibitor of muscle differentiation by inhibiting expression of MyoD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Delfini et al., 2000</xref>). As such, deletion of <italic>Rbpj</italic> or <italic>Dll1</italic> led to premature differentiation and depletion of SCs, thus a loss of muscle growth and severe muscle hypotrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schuster-Gossler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vasyutina et al., 2007</xref>). Despite of the wealth of knowledge about Notch signaling in SCs, its function in late-stage myogenesis is unknown. Here, we report that activation of Notch signaling dedifferentiates myocytes into Pax7-expressing SCs, leading to defective myogenesis. By contrast, activation of Notch signaling in post-fusion myotubes/myofibers restored the functionality and regenerative capacity of aged and dystrophic muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequential activation of <italic>Myl1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and MCK-Cre in post-differentiation stages of myogenesis</title><p><italic>Myl1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> (MLC-Cre) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bothe et al., 2000</xref>) and MCK-Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bruning et al., 1998</xref>) mouse strains are widely used tools to study gene function in post-differentiation muscle lineages, by inducing recombination that causes either overexpression or knockout of candidate genes. However, the spatiotemporal activation pattern of MLC-Cre and MCK-Cre has not been characterized. It is conceivable of an earlier expression of the MLC-Cre than MCK-Cre, based on the developmental expression of Myl1 and MCK at day-9.5 and day-13.0 post conception, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lyons et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zammit et al., 2008</xref>). In order to directly visualize and trace the activation of these Cre lines, we generated Td-tomato (red fluorescence protein) reporters for MLC-Cre and MCK-Cre, termed MLC-Td and MCK-Td mice, respectively. First, we cultured myoblasts from 1-month old MLC-Td and MCK-Td mice, and found that none of the freshly isolated SCs expressed RFP. Then we expanded the cells and induced myogenic differentiation. Under growth conditions, RFP expression was first detected in a few MLC-Td but not MCK-Td myocytes that were Pax7<sup>–</sup>, MyoD<sup>–</sup>, MyoG<sup>–</sup>, but MF20<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Later on, RFP was readily detectable in fusion-competent MLC-Td myocytes immediately after switching to the differentiation medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

By 1.5-month old, all myonuclei (100%) became nG<sup>+</sup> in both MLC-nTnG and MCK-nTnG mice (data not shown), coinciding with the completion of the myonuclei addition in growing muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">White et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>We further examined the nT and nG expression at different stages of muscle regeneration after cardiotoxin (CTX) induced muscle injury. Consistently, we detected massive nG<sup>+</sup> myonuclei 4 days post injury (dpi) in MLC-nTnG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E<italic>1</italic></xref>). By contrast, MCK-nTnG myofibers didn’t express nG at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E<italic>2</italic></xref>), but started to express nG at 6 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E<italic>3</italic></xref>), and peaked at 9 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E<italic>4</italic></xref>).

In summary, these in vitro and in vivo genetic mapping results reveal sequential activation of MLC-Cre and MCK-Cre along myogenesis, with earliest MLC-Cre activation detected in mononuclear myocytes and MCK-Cre detected only in multinucleated myotubes (myofibers).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Defective muscle growth and exercise performance in MLC-N1ICD mice</title><p>To investigate the role of Notch signaling in post-differentiation myocytes, we generated the <italic>Myl1</italic><sup>Cre</sup>/<italic>Rosa26(Gt)Sor</italic><sup>N1ICD</sup> (abbreviated as MLC-N1ICD) mouse model, in which the expression of constitutively active Notch1-ICD (N1ICD) is driven by <italic>Myl1<sup>C</sup></italic><sup>re</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Genetic mapping studies showed that the higher Jag1 expression is associated with better muscle phenotypes of dystrophic mice and dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vieira et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, Jag1 overexpression rescued the muscular dystrophy phenotype of dystrophin-deficient zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vieira et al., 2015</xref>). In skeletal muscle of N1ICD-<italic>mdx</italic> mice, we detected elevated expression of two Notch ligands, <italic>Jag2</italic> and <italic>Dll4</italic>, compared with <italic>mdx</italic> muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Consistently, immunostaining of EDL myofibers revealed stronger Dll4 immunofluorescence in MCK-N1ICD than in WT myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and H</xref>). Similar gene expression changes were detected in myofibers of MCK-N1ICD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To directly evaluate whether the increased ligand expression in myofibers subsequently activates Notch signaling in SCs, we generated MCK-N1ICD-CpGFP mice by breeding MCK-N1ICD with Notch reporter mice (CpGFP), in which expression of GFP was controlled by a promoter cassette containing the Rbpj-responsive element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mizutani et al., 2007</xref>). Immunostaining of EDL myofibers with Pax7 and GFP antibodies revealed that 41% SCs were GFP<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> in MCK-N1ICD-CpGFP mice, compared with 26% GFP<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>+</sup> SCs in control CpGFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and J</xref>). As a positive control, we observed stronger GFP fluorescence in myofibers of MCK-N1ICD-CpGFP mice, compared with those of CpGFP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I and K</xref>), confirming Notch activation by N1ICD OE. As a negative control, no GFP<sup>+</sup> SC was observed on WT myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>; first row). Therefore, we hypothesize that MCK-N1ICD upregulates Dll4/Jag2 in myofibers, which in turn activates Notch signaling in juxtaposed SCs to regulate their self-renewal in response to aging and muscular dystrophy.</p><p>To address whether Notch1 signaling components are expressed in mature myofibers under normal physiological conditions, we examined EDL myofibers free of SCs and interstitial cells after trypsin digestion and extensive PBS washing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

As myofibers are physically separated from the interstitial cells by basal lamina, Dll/Jag ligands on myofiber surface should only activate Notch receptors in juxtaposed SCs. Therefore, if the improved muscle function in MCK-N1ICD mice is mediated by elevated Notch ligand expression on myofiber, then the effect should be blocked by DBZ treatment.</p><p>We injected the mice with DBZ or vehicle control (DMSO) every two days continuously for 6 times, after which the mice were trained and tested on treadmill, and then examined for their regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Although SCs can reversibly shift between quiescent and activated states, it’s not clear whether post-differentiation myocyte or myofiber retains the potential to reverse back to the stem cell stage. Our study demonstrates that post-differentiation myocytes can dedifferentiate back into Pax7<sup>+</sup> quiescent SCs with activation of Notch1. Intriguingly, dedifferentiation was only observed in a portion of MLC-N1ICD cells, despite that N1ICD was overexpressed in both pre-fusion myocytes and post-fusion myotubes. By contrast, dedifferentiation was not observed in MCK-N1ICD mice, which specifically overexpress N1ICD in myotubes. Based on these comparisons, we concluded that Notch-induced dedifferentiation is restricted to mononucleated myocytes, which doesn’t require cytokinesis as for multinucleated myofibers. Consistently, although knockout of Rb and Arf promoted cell cycle re-entry of myonuclei in myotubes, cytokinesis was not observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pajcini et al., 2010</xref>). One important future direction is to pinpoint the downstream targets of Notch1 that mediate its dedifferentiation function in myocytes.</p><p>Activation of Notch1 in myotubes improved motor function and muscle regeneration of both aged and <italic>mdx</italic> mice. This is accompanied by upregulation of Dll/Jag ligand expression in myofibers, higher Notch activity in juxtaposed SCs, as well as greater regenerative potentials of SCs in MCK-N1ICD mice. Consistently, Notch signaling deficiency in SCs is a prominent feature of aged and dystrophic muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Conboy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). As SCs are the only cells that are directly attached to the myofibers, Dll/Jag ligands on intact myofibers should only activate Notch signaling in the SCs, but not the other cells (for example blood vessel-associated cells and interstitial cells) that are prevented from direct physical interaction with the myofiber by the basal lamina. Thus, the normalizing effects of DBZ on the improved muscle function in the MCK-N1ICD mice demonstrates that Notch-dependent enhancement of SCs’ regenerative potential is the underlying molecular and cellular mechanism mediating the effect of N1ICD overexpression in myofibers. Although we detected in MCK-N1ICD muscle a gene expression profile similar to that of healthy human muscles, we didn’t find any significant upregulation of Notch pathway genes in healthy human subjects. Considering the multiple cell types in muscle tissues, expression and function of Notch in individual cell types warrant further investigation.</p><p>In summary, our results illustrate contrasting stage-dependent effects of Notch1 activation in post-differentiation muscle cells. Most importantly, our study demonstrates that activation of Notch1 improves myotube’s function as a stem cell niche. This finding suggests that one strategy to ameliorate sarcopenia and muscle dystrophy diseases is through modulating Notch signaling in the myofiber.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures involving mice were approved by Purdue University’s Animal Care and Use Committee under protocol # 1112000440. <italic>Myl1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice were generously provided by Steven Burden (Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, NYU).

Mice were anesthetized using a ketamine-xylazine cocktail before DBZ injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Myosin heavy chain isoforms separation by SDS-PAGE</title><p>MHC isoforms were separated by modified SDS-PAGE (8% acrylamide gels containing 3.5% glycerol), which was run for 22 hr at 4°C. MHC isoforms were detected by silver stain after gel fixation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Treadmill and gripping strength measurement</title><p>A detailed protocol for treadmill and grip strength tests of mice are published elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castro and Kuang, 2017</xref>). In brief, the mouse was trained on treadmill (Eco3/6 treadmill; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) with a fixed 10% slope, at constant 10 m/minute speed for 5 min daily for consecutively 3 days before test. On the exercise testing day, the animals ran on the treadmill at 10 m/min for five minutes and the speed was increased by 2 m/min every two minutes until they were exhausted or a maximal speed of 46 m/min was achieved. The exhaustion was defined as the inability of the animal to run on the treadmill for 10 s despite mechanical prodding. Running time and maximum speed achieved was measured whereas running distance was calculated. A digital grip-strength meter (Columbus Instruments) was used to measure four-limb grip strength in mice, which were acclimatized for 10 min before the test. The mouse was allowed to grab the metal pull bar with the paws. Then the mouse tail was gently pulled backward until mice could not hold on the bar. The force at the time of release was recorded as the peak tension. Each mouse was tested three times. The average strength was defined as grip strength.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Denervation and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) staining</title><p>For sciatic nerve denervation, mice were anesthetized with ketamine. The right hind limb was prepared for surgery, a 1-cm incision was made in the skin along with the axis of the femur, and the sciatic nerve was isolated. To prevent reinnervation, 3–5 mm section of the sciatic nerve was cut and removed. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation 2 weeks after denervation. For NMJ staining, muscles were dissected and fixed by 4% PFA and incubated 30% sucrose/PBS for overnight. Muscles were frozen by cold isopentan with OCT-compound and sectioned longitudinally at 50 µm thickness. Sections were incubated with blocking buffer containing 0.1% Triton-X 100 and biotinylated α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) to detect NMJs for overnight. NMJs were visualized by FITC-conjugated streptavidin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Muscle myoblast isolation and culture</title><p>Primary myoblasts were isolated with collagenase type I and dispase B digestion. Briefly, the hind limb skeletal muscles of mice were collected, minced and digested for around 40 min. The digestions were stopped with F-10 Ham's medium containing 10% FBS and centrifuged at 450 ×g for 5 min. Then the cells were seeded on collagen-coated dishes and cultured in growth medium containing F-10 Ham's medium, with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 4 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin at 37°C with 5% CO2. The medium was changed every 2 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Single myofiber isolation and immunostaining</title><p>Single myofiber was isolated from the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle by digestion with 0.2% collagenase A (Sigma) in DMEM for around 45 min. After digestion, EDL muscle was gentally titrated by different pore-sized glass pipettes. Freshly isolated single fiber was quickly fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min, washed in 100 mM glycine three times each 10 min, followed by PBS wash for three times and blocking for 1 hr at room temperature. The primary antibody was incubated at 4°C for overnight. Fluorescence secondary antibody was diluted and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Images were taken with a Leica DM6000 microscope with a 20× objective.</p><p>To strip SCs from myofiber and get SC-free myofibers, freshly isolated EDL myofibers were first washed with PBS for three times. Myofibers were trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin for 5 mins to release SCs and other cells, and then washed with PBS for three times. Myofibers without trypsin treatment were used as a control for immunostaining or gene expression analysis. For gene expression analysis, mRNA from all myofibers liberated an EDL muscles was extracted (~100 myofibers) and reverse transcribed, and subjected to PCR analysis. PCR cycle number used for 18 s was 30, and for Notch1, Pax7, Dll4 and Jag2 was 38.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) and immunofluorescence staining</title><p>A detailed protocol for muscle histological characterization using H&amp;E staining and myofiber typing using immunofluorescence are published in Bio-Protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, fresh TA muscles were embedded in OCT compound, and frozen in isopentane chilled on dry ice. Then the tissues were cut at 10 µm thickness by Leica CM1850 cryostat. Muscles sections were fixed with fresh 4% PFA for 10 min, washed in 100 mM glycine three times each 10 min, followed by PBS wash for three times and blocking for 1 hr at room temperature. The primary antibody was incubated at 4°C for overnight. Fluorescence secondary antibody was diluted and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Images were taken with a Leica DM6000 microscope with a 20× objective. H&amp;E staining images were captured with a Nikon D90 digital camera mounted on a microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Protein extraction and Western blot analysis</title><p>Protein was isolated from cells or tissue using RIPA buffer contains 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. Protein concentrations were determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce Biotechnology), followed by measurement with NanoDrop. Proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore Corporation), blocked in 5% fat-free milk for one hour at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk overnight at 4°C. The Hes1 (sc), Hey1 (sc), Gapdh (sc-32233) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The HRP conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted at 1:5000. Immunodetection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting substrate (Pierce Biotechnology) and detected with an imaging system (FluorChem R FR0116). Alternatively, the membrane was incubated with an infrared secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 790 goat anti-mouse IgG, A11357; Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG, A21109; Life Technologies, USA) diluted 1:10,000, and the signals were detected by using the Odyssey infrared image scanning system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, real-time PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using Trizol Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purity and concentration of total RNA were determined by a spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000c, Thermo Fisher) at 260 nm and 280 nm. Ratios of absorption (260/280 nm) of all samples were between 1.8 and 2.0. Then 5 μg of total RNA were reverse transcribed using random primers with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was carried out in a Roche Light Cycler 480 PCR System with SYBR Green Master Mix (Roche) and gene-specific primers as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2012b</xref>).

author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stage-specific functions of Notch activity during skeletal myogenesis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report the authors have taken a genetic approach to analyse the impact of ectopic Notch signalling activation during muscle differentiation. In the first part of the study, MLC-Cre is used to drive the expression of constitutively activated Notch1 (N1ICD) in cells engaged to differentiation. MLC-N1ICD muscles are shown to have an impressive increase of non-cycling, Pax7 cells, as a consequence of a conversion of differentiating myoblasts to Progenitor/satellite cell-like cells. In the second part, MCK-Cre is used to induce N1ICD in the formed myofibers. Surprisingly, this results in improved muscle regeneration of normal and <italic>mdx</italic> mutant muscle, suggesting a non-cell autonomous mechanism, involving the muscle fibers and the satellite cells. Also, MCK-N1ICD-<italic>mdx</italic> mice show improved performance on a treadmill compared to <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Moreover, six injections of a Notch inhibitor DBZ to MCK-N1ICD-<italic>mdx</italic> mice are sufficient to revert the phenotypes to control levels in animals tested 20 days after the last DBZ injection. This striking result led the authors to propose that the interaction between the satellite cells and the fiber is mediated by Notch signalling, as the MCK-Nicd fibers express high levels of the Notch ligands Dll-4 and Jag2.</p><p>It is well known that the notch signaling pathway decreases during aging in muscle but the role of notch in the myofiber and its impact upon muscle regeneration has never been addressed. The authors have brought new insights regarding the molecular mechanisms leading to satellite cell self-renewal through the notch signaling pathway. They also highlight the communication inside the muscle satellite cell stem cell niche, i.e. between myofibers and satellite cells. Experiments have been well conducted and authors' conclusions are consistent with their results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>No information is provided on the endogenous activity of Notch is the systems analysed. In fact, previous work has shown that Notch activity declines as cells differentiate. The authors could measure Notch activity and the expression of its components in more detail to provide a clear interpretation of the data; Is there any endogenous Notch activity in the fiber? Does the fiber normally express Jag2 and Dll4?</p><p>All transcriptional analyses are performed with whole muscles extracts, including the microarrays. Candidate targets should at least be validated using purified cells: satellite cells, myoblasts and muscle fibers.</p><p>The authors uncover an impressive Pax7 phenotype in the MLC-Nicd mice. Moreover, these Pax7 cells are negative for Ki67 and Myogenin, suggesting that they are quiescent. It would be informative to stain these cells also for Myod and Myf5 (although Myf5 antibody is not easy to work) in order to understand if the Nicd-expressing cells are satellite cell-like, are blocked at another intermediate state.</p><p>The observation that these cells are Ki67 (or other proliferation marker) is key to conclude that these cells are quiescent. The authors should stain with Ki67 regenerating muscles of Control and MLC-Nicd mice.

In fact, previous work has shown that Notch activity declines as cells differentiate. The authors could measure Notch activity and the expression of its components in more detail to provide a clear interpretation of the data; Is there any endogenous Notch activity in the fiber? Does the fiber normally express Jag2 and Dll4?</italic> </p><p>To examine the endogenous expression of Notch pathway genes in myofibers, we attempted to isolate EDL myofibers free of any other cell contamination. EDL muscles were digested in collagenase and dispase to dissociate myofibers, single myofibers were further digested with trypsin (plus multiple rounds of PBS wash) to strip any cells that might have attached to the myofiber surface, such as satellite cells, blood capillary cells and interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). As a proof of concept, we show by direct visualization (using the Pax7<sup>nGFP</sup> reporter) and gene expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and C</xref> that the trypsin-stripped myofibers are free of satellite cells. As satellite cells are beneath the basal lamina and any other myofiber-associated cells are located outside of the basal lamina, the lack of satellite cells indicates that all myofiber-associated cells should have been removed from the trypsin-stripped myofibers.</p><p>We then compared the gene expression of EDL myofibers before and after trypsin stripping. We detected robust expression of Notch1, Dll4 and Jag2 in the trypsin-stripped myofibers, though at slightly lower levels compared to the non-trypsin-stripped myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Immunostaining and western blot also confirmed expression of Dll4, Notch1, Hes1 in the stripped myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>). The expression of Hes1, a common target of Notch signaling, further demonstrates that not only is Notch1 receptor expressed, but the Notch1 receptor is also activated in the myofiber.</p><p><italic>All transcriptional analyses are performed with whole muscles extracts, including the microarrays. Candidate targets should at least be validated using purified cells: satellite cells, myoblasts and muscle fibers.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern, we analyzed expression of Notch1, Dll4, Jag2 and Notch target genes in myofibers to verify our previous results, as they composed the most important mechanistic part of this paper. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, we consistently detected the higher expression levels of these genes in freshly isolated, stripped MCK-N1ICD myofibers, when compared with WT myofibers. We have also compared myoblasts isolated from WT and MCK-NICD mice, and detected upregulation of Hes5 and Hey2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Plus, the Cp-GFP Notch reporter showing higher abundance of Notch-on satellite cells in the MCK-NICD muscles compared to WT muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref>), we hope these results will satisfy the reviewers.</p><p><italic>The authors uncover an impressive Pax7 phenotype in the MLC-Nicd mice. Moreover, these</italic> Pax7<italic>cells are negative for Ki67 and Myogenin, suggesting that they are quiescent. It would be informative to stain these cells also for Myod and Myf5 (although Myf5 antibody is not easy to work) in order to understand if the Nicd-expressing cells are satellite cell-like, are blocked at another intermediate state.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, co-staining of Pax7 and MyoD has been widely used to report the status of satellite cells. Specifically, quiescent, activated and differentiating satellite cells can be identified as Pax7 /MyoD<sup>—</sup>, Pax7 /MyoD and Pax7<sup>—</sup>/MyoD. Consistent with our previous gene expression analysis, all the Pax7 cells in MLC-N1ICD muscles were negative for MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This result validates the quiescent state of these cells. As a positive control of staining, cultured WT myoblast were Pax7 <sup>/</sup>MyoD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p><italic>The observation that these cells are Ki67 (or other proliferation marker) is key to conclude that these cells are quiescent. The authors should stain with Ki67 regenerating muscles of Control and MLC-Nicd mice. Control muscles would serve as a control for the Ki67 staining, which is needed for the negative result of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>. In parallel, it would be interesting to assess the cycling state of the Nicd-expressing cells during regeneration. This would also be particularly relevant, as work from the Kuang lab (Wen Y. et al., MCB 2012) has previously shown that NICD overexpression inhibits S-phase entry and Ki67 expression.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we stained Ki67 for both freshly isolated myofibers and regenerating muscles (7 dpi) of MLC-N1ICD mice. Consistently, we didn’t detect any Ki67 cells on fresh isolated MLC/N1ICD myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Also, while roughly 50% of the Pax7 cells were stained as Ki67 in regenerating WT muscles, only 15% Pax7 were Ki67 in regenerating MLC-N1ICD muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
