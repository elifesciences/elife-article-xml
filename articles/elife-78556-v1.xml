As such, it has been suggested as a potential lifestyle intervention for body weight maintenance. While the metabolic consequences of thermal acclimation are not limited to the adipose tissues, the impact on the rest of the tissues in context of their gene expression profile remains unclear. Here, we provide a systematic characterization of the effects in a comparative multi-tissue RNA sequencing approach following exposure of mice to 10 °C, 22 °C, or 34 °C in a panel of organs consisting of spleen, bone marrow, spinal cord, brain, hypothalamus, ileum, liver, quadriceps, subcutaneous-, visceral- and brown adipose tissues. We highlight that transcriptional responses to temperature alterations exhibit a high degree of tissue-specificity both at the gene level and at GO enrichment gene sets, and show that the tissue-specificity is not directed by the distinct basic gene expression pattern exhibited by the various organs. Our study places the adaptation of individual tissues to different temperatures in a whole-organism framework and provides integrative transcriptional analysis necessary for understanding the temperature-mediated biological programming.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans, mice and most other mammals are constantly exposed to fluctuations in the temperature of their environment. These fluctuations cause striking metabolic effects in the body, for example, exposure to cold promotes burning of calories to generate heat, thereby reducing how much fat accumulates in the body. On the other hand, warmer temperatures strengthen the bones and protect against a bone disease known as osteoporosis. As such, it has been suggested that exposure to alternating warm or cold temperatures could be a potential lifestyle intervention that conveys various benefits to our health.</p><p>Our body stores fat in tissues known as adipose tissues, which are found all over the body including under the skin and around our major organs and muscles. Exposure to cold triggers changes in the activities of some genes in the adipose tissues to burn more calories. But it remains unclear how temperature affects the activities of other organs with respect to their expression of genes in the whole-body context.</p><p>Hadadi, Spiljar et al. used an RNA sequencing approach to study the activities of genes in various tissues of mice exposed to cold (10°C), room temperature (22°C), or mild warm (34°C). The experiments revealed numerous genes whose levels were different in the various organs and temperatures tested.</p><p>Overall, adipose tissues experienced the biggest changes in gene levels between different temperatures, followed by tissues involved in immune responses, and the brain and spinal cord tissues. Each organ changed gene expression levels in its own way. , and this was not due to the different intimate gene expression profile between the various organs.</p><p>These findings improve our understanding of how changes in temperature affect mammals by putting the responses of individual tissues into the context of the whole body. Hadadi, Spiljar et al. also generated a web-based, free-to-use application to allow others to view and further analyze the data collected in this work for gene levels in the various organs of interest.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>temperature</kwd><kwd>multi-tissue transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>cold</kwd><kwd>warm</kwd><kwd>adipose tissue</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006388</institution-id><institution>Hôpitaux Universitaires de Genève</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RC2-09</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkler</surname><given-names>Doron</given-names></name><name><surname>Trajkovski</surname><given-names>Mirko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008486</institution-id><institution>Schweizerische Multiple Sklerose Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkler</surname><given-names>Doron</given-names></name><name><surname>Trajkovski</surname><given-names>Mirko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC Consolidator grant agreement no. 815962</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trajkovski</surname><given-names>Mirko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_173010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merkler</surname><given-names>Doron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_205042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trajkovski</surname><given-names>Mirko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integrative analysis of multi-tissue transcriptomics data of mice subjected to cold, mild warm or room temperature places the thermal adaptation of individual tissues in a whole-organism perspective.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the last decade and since the discovery of active brown adipose tissue (BAT) presence in humans, cold acclimation for stimulating thermogenesis has gained great interest as an intervention leading to increased energy expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chondronikola et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nedergaard et al., 2007</xref>). The association between activating the thermogenic program of BAT and metabolic health has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waldén et al., 2012</xref>). Most of these studies are conducted on mouse models and different cold exposure interventions have been used to alter adipose tissue activity and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Peres Valgas da Silva et al., 2019</xref>). The BAT is present at distinct anatomical sites, including the interscapular (iBAT), perineal and axillary depots. The white adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy in form of triglycerides, and is found throughout the body. Its largest compartments are the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues (SAT and VAT, respectively). Following prolonged cold, brown fat-like cells also emerge in SAT (known as ‘beige’ cells) in a process referred to as white fat browning. Brown and beige fat-associated thermogenesis account for 2–17% of the total 12–20% of energy that is expanded daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tan et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that other tissues may also contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van Marken Lichtenbelt and Schrauwen, 2011</xref>), as has recently been shown for the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abumrad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Simcox et al., 2017</xref>) and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rowland et al., 2015</xref>). However, the contribution of other organs in the overall adaptation of the organism to cold exposure is less understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Omran and Christian, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The hypothalamus is the central regulating unit in the brain for maintenance of energy homeostasis, including body temperature. During cold, sympathetic signals are sensed by adipocytes via their beta-adrenergic receptors, which results in BAT activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cannon and Nedergaard, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chechi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stojanović et al., 2018</xref>). Immune cells are also implicated in the effects of cold exposure in the adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hotamisligil, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kohlgruber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Molofsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Omran and Christian, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Qiu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stojanović et al., 2018</xref>), which harbor an antiinflammatory immune profile under cold. In obesity, the fat predominantly contains inflammatory immune cells linked to systemic low-grade inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hotamisligil, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kohlgruber et al., 2016</xref>). How the systemic immune state at cold or warm temperature, however, remains largely elusive. While immune cells reside in a variety of organs, the greatest immune hubs are the primary lymphoid tissues where immune cells are generated (e.g. bone marrow), and the secondary lymphoid tissues where they are activated and expanded (e.g. spleen). Small stretches of lymphoid tissues also reside within other organs, including the intestine that contains the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chevalier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chevalier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Spiljar et al., 2021</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Simcox et al., 2017</xref>) observed that cold (4–10°C), and warm exposures close to thermoneutrality (33–34°C) also affect organs apart from the adipose tissues, including the intestine, bone, and immunologic tissues. The ambient temperatures where metabolic rate is at a minimum is the usual definition of a thermoneutral zone, and it is in the interval of 29 °C in the light phase and up to 33 °C during dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Škop et al., 2020</xref>). The typical housing of mice is at room temperature (RT) of 22 °C, which is below their thermoneutrality, and a substantial amount of their energy expenditure is devoted to maintaining core body temperature. The above data suggest that thermal variations exert a whole-body functional reprogramming; however, no systematic transcriptomics analysis has addressed to what extent organs undergo changes induced by temperatures below the thermoneutral zone. It is also not clear whether various organs display conserved, or tissue-specific transcriptional signatures.</p><p>RNA sequencing (RNASeq) is the most widely used quantitative approach to assess the global gene expression and its alterations under different conditions, since it determines subtle molecular changes that may contribute to acquisition of certain phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carninci et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grada and Weinbrecht, 2013</xref>). It has been shown that RNAseq can reflect tissue specificity; as such, highly regulated genes might represent characteristic functions of the tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Breschi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sonawane et al., 2017</xref>). However, due to a deluge of data, particularly when several transcriptomic data sets are obtained, the combined analysis of several datasets (meta-analysis) remains challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sudmant et al., 2015</xref>). This analysis becomes even more challenging if one aims to interconnect the variations in the meta-data with the complex molecular basis of phenotypic changes.</p><p>In this study, we conducted a systematic transcriptomics analysis across 11 mouse tissues at RT and cold (10 °C), and across additional 7 tissues at mild warm close to the mouse thermoneutral zone (33–34°C). We establish a common expression signature of differentially expressed genes in BAT during various cold exposure experimental setups across seven studies (six previously published RNAseq datasets and this work). Further, we provide a comprehensive resource dataset of comparative transcriptomics across 11 mouse tissues describing the transcriptional landscape at room temperature (RT) and at 10 °C, and supplement these analyses with a multi-tissue transcriptomics profiling at 34 °C. We systematically investigate how differential expression impacts specific cellular functions across the tissues and identify shared, specific, and inversely regulated gene signatures and gene set enrichments under cold exposure and at 34 °C compared to RT housing. Our work shows that adipose tissues undergo most severe transcriptome changes, followed by the immune tissues and the CNS cluster. With this resource and the applied bioinformatics methods, we characterize tissue-specific expression patterns and detect temperature-dependent gene expression profiles; provide insights into the tissue-specific adaptation mechanisms associated with temperature variations; and place the adaptive role of each tissue in a whole-organism perspective to comprehend the tissue-specific organization of the biological processes after 12 °C increase or decrease of environmental temperature compared to RT housing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effectiveness of 10°C for activation and recruitment of the thermogenic capacity of brown adipose tissue (BAT)</title><p>We first investigated the effectiveness of a mild cold intervention using 10 °C on the interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT) following a gradual decrease of the temperature, to mimic the environmental temperature decrease that typically happens in nature. We combined the iBAT thermogenic biomarkers introduced in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Perdikari et al., 2018</xref>) with those genes in the Gene Ontology (GO) database which are annotated to any GO term related to adaptive thermogenesis.

The bone marrow samples clustered relatively close to the spleen samples, which can be considered as an immune tissue cluster. The liver and quadriceps samples gathered close to the adipose tissues, while the ileum samples clustered between adipose tissue and spleen samples.

Specifically, we detected a marked separation of RT and 10 °C samples in iBAT, opposed to a milder separation in hypothalamus samples, implying that the cold exposure has varying effects depending on the tissue. Similarly, 34 °C exposure caused the most pronounced segregation in iBAT compared to RT controls, indicating that iBAT displays the highest degree of temperature-dependent alterations among the analyzed tissues.</p><p>Additionally, biological replicates across all tissues and the relationship between the tissues from 10 °C-kept mice and their RT controls were analyzed using hierarchical clustering with pairwise Pearson correlation.

We observed widespread tissue-specific cold response in the adipose tissues where ingSAT ranked highest with 883 up- and 995 and downregulated genes. We further compared the tissue-specific differentially expressed genes with the total number of differentially expressed genes for each tissue, and indicated it as a ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The highest percentage of tissue specificity in terms of differentially expressed genes was seen in pgVAT with 74%, iBAT with 74%, and spleen with 71% tissue-specific upregulated genes. Considering the total number of differentially expressed genes (sum of up and downregulated genes), ingSAT, pgVAT and spleen showed the highest specificity with an average of 65 tissue-specific gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Collectively, there was a comparable degree of tissue-specificity in upregulated versus downregulated profiles (79% compared to 76%). Similar to the GO terms results, in the 34 °C exposure experiment we observed a lower degree of tissue-specificity than in cold, with 59% of the upregulated, and 62% of downregulated genes in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Across temperatures, Ileum scored the highest with 88% tissue-specific downregulated gene expression profile (at 34 °C), followed by iBAT with 74% (at 10 °C), and liver with 73% of tissue-specific downregulated genes (at 34 °C). In contrast to the 10 °C exposure, 34 °C caused a slightly higher degree of tissue-specificity in downregulated (62%) versus upregulated genes (59%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, the downregulated genes in 34 °C exposure showed extensive overlap with the upregulated genes at the 10 °C exposure (mostly exhibited in adipose tissues and quadriceps) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>We next focused on the genes with shared differential gene expression profiles within several tissues both at 10 °C and 34 °C.

In the 10 °C exposure, the maximum tissue-shared gene signature was <italic>Atp2a1</italic>, which was decreased in 7 tissues (all adipose tissues, liver, bone marrow, hypothalamus, and spinal cord). The next top tissue-shared gene signatures were 4 genes that were commonly downregulated (<italic>Nnat</italic>, <italic>Nr1d1</italic>) and upregulated (<italic>Hspa1b</italic>, <italic>Thrsp</italic>) in 6 tissues.

Next, 199 genes at 34 °C and 61 genes at 10 °C exposure were commonly upregulated in pgVAT and ingSAT, followed by 53 genes at 34 °C and 42 genes at 10 °C exposures being upregulated in both pgVAT and iBAT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4">Supplementary files 3 and 4</xref>). Likewise, ingSAT, iBAT, and pgVAT shared 69 genes at 34 °C and 32 genes at 10 °C that were commonly upregulated in the three tissues. Apart from the adipose tissues, the top-shared pairwise connections were related to the quadriceps, ileum, and liver. Similarly, the top-shared pairwise connections for downregulated genes were found in adipose tissues, where ingSAT and iBAT shared 263 downregulated genes at 34 °C, and 177 genes at 10 °C exposures. IngSAT and pgVAT had 117 shared downregulated genes at 34 °C and 71 genes at 10 °C exposure; followed by pgVAT and iBAT with 10 at 34 °C, and 33 at 10 °C exposure. Apart from the adipose tissues, quadriceps and ileum demonstrated highest pairwise connections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Shared-tissue regulated GO terms involve tissue-specific and tissue-shared genes</title><p>We next investigated whether the tissue-shared GO terms regulation is derived from the shared or the tissue-specific differentially expressed genes. We particularly focused on ingSAT, pgVAT, and iBAT, both at 10 °C and 34 °C. The Venn diagram of the first three most commonly up- and downregulated gene sets upon 10 °C exposure showed that they are largely derived by genes that are differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). This tissue specificity is more pronounced in the downregulated gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). For example, in fatty acid biosynthesis process, only 4 genes are shared between the three tissues and the upregulation of the pathway mostly emerges from the tissue-specific genes in ingSAT (13 genes), pgVAT (9 genes) and iBAT (7 genes). This suggests that although different genes are upregulated in the three tissues, they might have a similar function that leads to a common functional response. Interestingly, the degree of tissue-specific gene upregulation is on average higher for pgVAT followed by iBAT and ingSAT. For the 34 °C exposure, we observed a similar trend of less tissue-shared genes and more tissue-specific genes which derived the regulation of tissue-shared pathways. Similar to the previous section, we observed a slightly lower tissue-specificity in response to 34 °C exposure compared to 10 °C exposure. This was more pronounced in the downregulated pathways at 34 °C exposure (lipid metabolism pathways).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Shared tissue GO term enrichments and implicated genes.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Venn diagrams (left) showing shared adipose tissue GO gene set enrichment, and dot plot of genes involved in these gene sets (right) that are significantly (p&lt;0.05) up- (<bold>A–C</bold>), or down-regulated (<bold>B–D</bold>) across adipose tissues from mice as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.

We first accounted for the genes with minimum 5 raw counts as a filtering threshold, and observed that 19,881 genes are expressed at least in one tissue, wherein 10,853 genes (54% of expressed genes) were expressed in all 11 tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>). From these, 3507 genes (32%) were differentially expressed in at least one tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Looking at these differentially expressed genes, irrespective of the consistency in the direction of change, we found that 2435 genes (over 70%) were altered in only one tissue, 755 (over 21%) in two, and 220 (over 6%) commonly differentially expressed in three tissues. The remaining 2.1% of differentially expressed genes were commonly changed in four or more tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). These data demonstrate high tissue-specificity in the transcriptional response to cold also among the commonly expressed genes. Moreover, 1508 genes (8% of expressed genes) were expressed in only one tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Spinal cord with 375 genes showed the most tissue-specificity in term of expressed genes, followed by pgVAT (328 genes), bone marrow (160 genes), ileum (139 genes), spleen (137 genes), liver (93 genes), hypothalamus (78 genes), brain (49 genes), iBAT (7 genes), and ingSAT (9 genes). Interestingly, only 66 genes of the 1623 tissue-specific expressed genes were significantly differentially expressed upon cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Members of these groups range from 1084 genes in the biggest group - Olfr (Olfactory receptors), to 2 genes in the smallest group (1273 of these groups have only two members).

Similar as before, we observed tissue-specificity on the response to cold, but not on the gene expression patterns. As an example, we describe the elongation of very long chain fatty acids (ELOVL) protein family, which plays an important role in fatty acid metabolism in adipose tissues. The ELOVL family includes seven genes named <italic>Elovl1</italic> to <italic>Elovl7</italic>, and catalyzes the first and rate-limiting reaction of the very long-chain fatty acid elongation cycle in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jump, 2009</xref>).

Despite the potential therapeutic relevance of this environmental trigger in increasing the energy expenditure, the impact of temperature on the transcriptomic landscape of other tissues and their physiological response has received little attention so far. Moreover, different temperatures have been interchangeably used in cold exposure studies. In this study, we first gathered all publicly available RNASeq profiles of C57BL/6J mouse iBATs obtained under different cold exposures ranging from 4°C to 8°C. This comparative analysis revealed that biomarker response to our milder (10 °C) cold setup was effectively in the 50th percentile range with the exception of a few genes. Our results indicate that the variance in magnitude of the transcriptional upregulation across the different studies can be explained by the duration of the cold exposure rather than the extent of the temperature decrease per se as evidenced by the expression of the thermogenic and fatty acid metabolism biomarkers. Interestingly, while the regulation of the gene expression was largely proportional to the temperature gradient, we found that temperature close to thermoneutrality (34 °C) caused more pronounced changes than 10 °C, albeit having same 12 °C deviation from the RT (22 °C) in both cases.</p><p>When analyzing the comparative RNAseq data across the tissues we observed that as expected, similar tissues effectively clustered together in terms of their overall transcriptomic profile, regardless of the imposed condition: exposure to 10 °C, or 34 °C and compared to 22 °C. The extent of the sample separation following temperature variation was different for different tissues, suggesting variable and tissue-specific responses. These conclusions were further supported by the number and the magnitude of differentially expressed genes and the enriched gene sets. Upregulated GO terms, which were mostly related to thermogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid biosynthesis, elongation and catabolic processes, and mitochondrial ATP synthesis scored the highest in the adipose tissues during cold. This was followed by the hypothalamus and the ileum where some of the upregulated pathways related to lipid metabolism went in the same direction as the adipose tissues, however to a lower extent. Strikingly, the tissue specificity in the response to 10 °C, or 34 °C and compared to 22 °C was not dictated by the gene expression differences between the various tissues, since we found the same levels of alterations even within the commonly expressed genes (55%).</p><p>The multi tissue data in this study opens possibilities for integrative analyses of the adaptation to environmental temperatures, and it allows investigating how organs compensate for the increased activity of the above-mentioned biological process. As expected, in the adipose tissues, which during cold showed the highest number of upregulated gene sets particularly related to thermogenesis, we also identified a considerable number of downregulated gene sets. This may suggest that on a tissue level the energy expenditure is balanced by a tendency for lowering a range of biological processes to maximize the necessary biological response to a given trigger. Conversely to 10 °C exposure, the majority of tissues showed higher positive than negative regulation of gene expression and GO terms at 34 °C.</p><p>On the other hand, such balance between up- and downregulated biological processes was not seen in the spleen, where we observed primarily downregulated gene sets, which included processes such as innate immune response in mucosa, neutrophil-mediated killing of symbiont cell, inflammatory response, and many other responsive systems, for example response to bacteria. This could be explained by its mainly immunologic functions, a biological process that might be blunted during cold, in line with the concept that maintenance of immune functions is energy costly and thus in competition with other energy demanding programs, including thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Spiljar et al., 2021</xref>). Metabolic and immunologic regulation are tightly interwoven, particularly in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Spiljar et al., 2017</xref>), and our data suggests that temperature modulation mainly provokes immunologic changes in the intestine. Intriguingly, our results further indicate that certain pathways are inversely regulated across tissues. For example, the triglyceride catabolic process was upregulated in ingSAT, brain, and hypothalamus, but downregulated in spleen during cold. In part, this may indicate an overall redistribution of the metabolic energy toward the tissues necessary for acute response to an environmental trigger such as cold, on account of the other maintenance biological programs.</p><p>Examining tissue-specific and tissue-shared genes and gene set signatures revealed that tissue-specificity both at level of genes and gene sets dominate over tissue-shared patterns. Even within the adipose tissues, we observed preferential tissue-specific response over shared characteristics. Interestingly, the shared-tissue gene sets, for example upregulation of fatty acid biosynthetic process, do not necessarily require upregulation of the same genes between organs. This highlights the tissue specificity also on a gene level, where regulation of different genes contributes to emergence of the same biological process. This is further supported by analysis of the Elovl gene family during cold in context of the different tissues, suggesting that different members of a given gene family evolve and are regulated in a tissue-specific manner. Such inter-tissue specificity of genes from the same family may guide discovery of tissue-specific regulators upon cold adaptation and contribute to a better understanding of the underlying molecular basis of cold adaptation of each tissue. Surprisingly, while cold exposure profoundly altered <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in the adipose tissues, and also showed increased levels in the quadriceps, which could be due to contaminating or interspersed muscle-resident adipocytes. Follow-up experiments will address the cause of these changes.</p><p>Our work provides a full spectrum of thermal adaptation-induced transcriptional reprogramming of multiple mouse tissues, coupled to computational analysis of these changes on a gene and functional level. This resource is made available through a web-based application and database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metlabomics.unige.ch/Search">https://metlabomics.unige.ch/Search</ext-link>), equipped with tools that allow users to navigate, explore, retrieve and compare gene expression regulations across gender, temperature and tissue.

Genes were considered significant if they passed a fold change (FC) cutoff of |FC|&gt;1.5 and a p-value ≤0.05, and were further subjected to gene ontology analysis, using R/Bioconductor package topGO (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/topGO/inst/doc/topGO.pdf">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/topGO/inst/doc/topGO.pdf</ext-link>), together with Rgraphviz, Pearson correlation similarity analysis, and heatmap visualization.

In the revised version we fully addressed the critical recommendations and included numerous additional data. We are particularly excited with the new data relating to i) thermoneutrality, ii) muscle, and iii) an App that allows in-depth interrogation of the results, as specified below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>i) thermoneutrality</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the typical housing of mice at room temperature (RT) of 22°C, is below their thermoneutrality, and a substantial amount of their energy expenditure is devoted to maintaining core body temperature. The ambient temperatures where metabolic rate is at a minimum is the usual definition of a thermoneutral zone, and it is in the interval of 29°C in the light phase and up to 33°C during dark (Škopet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Therefore, we conducted new systematic transcriptomics analysis in liver, quadriceps, ileum, brain, BAT, SAT and VAT at temperature close to the mouse thermoneutral zone (33-34°C), chosen to match the difference of 12°C between RT (22°C) and cold (10°C). In the revised study we repeated the analysis using both 10°C and 34°C compared to RT, and established how differential expression impacts specific cellular functions across the tissues and identify shared, specific, and inversely regulated gene signatures and gene set enrichments temperature variation. Interestingly, while the regulation of the gene expression was largely proportional to the temperature gradient, we found that temperature close to thermoneutrality (34°C) caused more pronounced changes than 10°C, albeit having same 12°C deviation from the RT (22°C) in both cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) muscle</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that muscle was unfairly excluded from the initial analysis, as it is necessary to gain more comprehensive overview on the temperature-driven transcriptomics changes across the tissues. We therefore added quadriceps in both 10°, 34°, and the respective RT controls, and repeated all the analysis with this tissue included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) a Shiny App</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion – we agree that it’s the best if a resource manuscript is coupled to an application that allows user to explore the generated data. As there are some issues associated to free version of some apps, such as a limitation of up to 25 active hours per month, number of concurrent users, etc. we decided to take a step further and developed a sustainable web-based application (https://metlabomics.unige.ch/Search) that can be updated with new datasets in the coming years, and that is easier for the users to interact with. The online database is equipped with an interface that allows the users to retrieve all the data reported in the paper by applying several filters on variables such as gender, tissue, temperature gradient, etc. Additionally, users can download partial, or complete information provided on the website as a.csv file to further use for visualization or other intended analyses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
