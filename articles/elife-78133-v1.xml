All major branches of the eukaryotic tree of life contain flagellated representatives, strongly suggesting the presence of one or more cilia or flagella in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavalier-Smith, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mitchell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mitchell, 2007</xref>). The vast majority of eukaryotic life consists of unicellular organisms with flagella, which perform a variety of functions necessary for their survival, for example, aiding motility, feeding, avoiding predators, and sensing the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mitchell, 2007</xref>). Multicellular eukaryotes, including animals (metazoans), also rely on cilia and flagella for locomotion, developmental signaling, mucosal clearance, feeding, and reproduction. The structure of motile cilia and flagella is quite complex and contains several hundred different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pazour et al., 2005</xref>). Yet the mutation of a single flagellar protein can result in severe flagellar assembly or motility defects, which can lead to death or disease, including human ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Reiter and Leroux, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although the overall architecture of motile cilia and flagella is conserved, their protein structures, accessory features, and regulatory complexes also show some divergence throughout evolution. Most motile cilia and flagella contain a ring of nine outer doublet microtubules (DMTs) with a pair of central singlet microtubules, often referred to as the ‘9+2’ arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fawcett, 1954</xref>), although exceptions exist, such as the vertebrate nodal cilia (9+0), eel sperm flagella (9+0) and rabbit posterior notochord cilia (9+4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Takeda and Narita, 2012</xref>). The axonemal core in motile cilia and flagella contains 96 nm repeat units with two rows of dyneins, the outer and inner dynein arms (ODAs, IDAs), regulatory complexes like the nexin-dynein regulatory complex (N-DRC) and radial spokes (RSs), and the central pair complex (CPC), again with some exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grossman-Haham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Porter and Sale, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith and Yang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Walton et al., 2021</xref>). Despite these broad commonalities, ultrastructural studies have shown differences in the morphology of flagellar protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). Motile cilia and flagella also exhibit a variety of beating patterns including helical, planar, base to tip, tip to base, or reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blake and Sleigh, 1974</xref>), and can be outfitted with an assortment of accessory structures, including mastigoneme hairs, paraflagellar rods, fibrous sheaths, outer dense fibers, and accessory microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Souza and Souto-Padrón, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyams, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Irons and Clermont, 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Irons and Clermont, 1982b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mencarelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nakamura et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Portman and Gull, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yubuki et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our understanding of flagellar ultrastructure and evolution is continually expanding through application of new technologies. Historically, much of our knowledge of flagellar architecture from diverse species has been based on conventional light and electron microscopy studies, which are inherently limited by detection limits and preservation artifacts. Protein sequence comparisons have also yielded important insights, particularly into dynein evolution in eukaryotic flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kollmar, 2016</xref>), although this required manual annotation of thousands of genes from hundreds of species, not particularly sustainable for examining hundreds of flagellar proteins. Similarly, comparative proteomic studies have also largely contributed to our understanding of flagella composition and evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pazour et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sigg et al., 2017</xref>), although both sequence comparisons and proteomics are limited in their ability to predict protein localization and interactions. As a result, our knowledge of detailed flagellar morphology, function, and evolution has remained restricted. Advances in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) have enabled visualization of native flagellar structures with unparalleled resolution, enhancing our ability to compare flagellar morphology across species and make inferences about their evolution and function, although cilia and flagella from less than a dozen species have currently been examined using cryo-ET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carbajal-González et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lin et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lin et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin and Nicastro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nicastro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pigino et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The molecular structures of motile cilia and flagella from several multicellular animals (metazoans) have been studied using cryo-ET, but similar high-resolution structural information is lacking for unicellular organisms in the same Opisthokonta clade, preventing structural comparison between metazoans and their close unicellular relatives. Cryo-ET studies of unicellular species from other suprakingdoms, such as the Archaeplastida (e.g. <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>), Alveolata (e.g. <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>), and Excavata (e.g. <italic>Trypanosoma</italic>), have revealed significant morphological differences between unicellular and multicellular motile cilia and flagella, including dynein number and arrangement, CPC shape, microtubule inner proteins, and radial spoke head morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carbajal-González et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Imhof et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pigino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pigino et al., 2012</xref>). However, these clades are phylogenetically quite distant from metazoans, raising questions about when and how these differences arose throughout the evolutionary timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogeny and flagellar features of the choanoflagellate <italic>S.</italic><italic>rosetta</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree showing major eukaryotic suprakingdoms (colored blocks) stemming from the last common eukaryotic ancestor (LECA).

Because of their unique phylogenetic position, choanoflagellates provide important information on the origin and evolution of multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">King, 2004</xref>). Though low-resolution features of choanoflagellate flagella have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hibberd, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karpov, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leadbeater, 2014</xref>), detailed molecular structures remain unexamined.</p><p>Here, we use cryo-focused ion beam milling (cryo-FIB) and cryo-ET to investigate the flagellum and other structures in the flagellar region of the marine choanoflagellate species <italic>Salpingoeca rosetta</italic>. Our tomographic reconstructions and 3D averages suggest that choanoflagellates and their metazoan relatives share similar morphology and arrangement of flagellar dyneins and their regulators, suggesting that these features were already present in the two groups’ last common ancestor. Similarly, the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> CPC strongly resembles that of sea urchin (<italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>) sperm flagella. In contrast, however, we also observed flagellar features that appear to be unique to Choanoflagellates, such as previously unseen gaps and microtubule inner proteins (MIPs) in the DMTs, the flagellar vane, which is a fine mesh of intertwined filaments extending bilaterally from the flagellar membrane, and barb-like structures, which protrude from the extracellular surface of the flagellar membrane. These findings expand our understanding of choanoflagellate biology and provide insights into the evolution of flagellar structures within the Opisthokonta branch.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><italic>S. rosetta</italic> cells contain a single flagellum, which extends from the cell body and is surrounded by a ring of 25–36 actin-based microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>).

The overall structure of the choanoflagellate flagellum has been previously studied using light and conventional electron microscopy techniques, revealing a 9+2 axonemal microtubule arrangement and a basal body that is surrounded by a microtubule rootlet structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karpov, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karpov and Leadbeater, 1998</xref>).

We rapidly froze starved choanoflagellate singlet cells in their slow- and fast-swimming morphological states. During plunge-freezing, areas close to the cell body were embedded in relatively thick ice (&gt;500 nm); therefore, we used cryo-FIB milling to generate ~150–200 nm thin lamellae (sections) of the plunge-frozen cells before cryo-ET imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>). In one cryo-FIB lamella, we captured part of the cell body with actin-filled collar microvilli extending outward and the proximal region of the flagellum from which we were able to record sequential cryo-tomograms along the flagellar length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D-F</xref>).

Based on their locations and periodicities along the 96 nm repeat, we identified many conserved MIP structures within the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> flagellar doublet microtubules, including MIPs 1 a, 1b, 2 a, 2b, 2 c, 3 a, 3b, and 6a-d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, A-F). MIP1a is typically longer than MIP1b in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Song et al., 2020</xref>), but in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>, MIP1a is shorter than MIP1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, A-B, D-E). Furthermore, we identified a previously unobserved ~3.5 nm wide filamentous MIP, here named rail-MIP, which runs along the length of the A-tubule near protofilament A13 and seems to connect to MIP 6ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and G</xref>, class 2). The electron density of this rail-MIP was reduced in the average of all axonemal repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>), suggesting its presence on only a subset of repeat units. To further explore this heterogeneity, we performed automated classification analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heumann et al., 2011</xref>) focused on the rail-MIP by applying a mask around the region of interest and using principle component analyses to sort the results into identifiable features. Indeed, these analyses revealed that the rail-MIP was not ubiquitously present: only 39% of all averaged axonemal repeat units contained the rail-MIP, and its presence was enriched in DMTs 5–7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, class 2 and table), as compared to doublets 1–4 and 8–9, which mostly lacked the rail-MIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, class 1 and table). The rail-MIP distribution varied between tomograms: about half of the tomograms contained prevalent rails concentrated in the microtubules stated above, whereas the other half of flagellar reconstructions contained fewer, scattered rail-MIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This asymmetric distribution does not appear to correlate with any other observed features (such as presence of vane, barbs, microvilli, or IFT particles), but the rail-MIP is present in a cryo-FIB-milled lamella containing the proximal region of the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that its distribution could be related to the location of the tomogram along the length of the flagellum (proximal vs. distal).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><italic>S. rosetta</italic> microtubule doublets contain unique holes and MIPs.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>).

Our classification analyses revealed that the A2-hole is present in ~39% of repeats, including over 50% of repeats from DMTs 1, 5, and 6 and with lower frequencies in the other DMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref> table: class 2). Unlike the rail-MIP, the distribution of the A2-hole across tomograms did not cluster, instead appearing relatively evenly scattered throughout different tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the DMT-specificity between the rail-MIP and A2-hole somewhat overlapped (presence in DMTs 5 and 6), there was only a mild correlation between these two unique DMT features within repeat units, as evidenced by the hole appearing mildly stronger in class 2 containing the rail-MIP, but still somewhat present in class 1 without the rail-MIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). An additional DMT-specific density corresponds to a protruding structure near the A2 hole, which is present or partially present on DMTs 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7, but only weakly visible on or absent from DMTs 3, 4, 8, and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, navy blue arrowheads).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The <italic>S. rosetta</italic> central pair complex shows overall conserved features with some reductions</title><p>The CPC forms the central core of the axoneme in most flagella and consists of two singlet microtubules (C1 and C2) that are surrounded by a specific set of projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carbajal-González et al., 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, how flagellar ultrastructure may have changed from unicellular to multicellular animals remains unexplored. Within the Opisthokonta clade, high-resolution structures of motile cilia and flagella have been published for several multicellular metazoans, including sea urchins, zebrafish, mouse, pig, horse, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yamaguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). However, no unicellular opisthokonts have been studied at similar resolution.

In addition, unicellular organisms like <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> have broad RS head structures and connections between all three radial spoke heads, whereas metazoan RS head structures are narrow, RS1 and RS2 are reduced to a pair of thin blades, and RS1 and RS2 are clearly separated from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grossman-Haham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, the CPC orientation is fixed in metazoans, with stable connections between C1a and C2a and a reduced C1e projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carbajal-González et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we find that the structure and organization of the dyneins, radial spokes, and the CPC observed for metazoan flagella are consistent with those of the unicellular choanoflagellate <italic>S. rosetta</italic>. This suggests that these changes were likely present in the urchoanozoan (the phylogenetic group containing all Choanoflagellates and metazoans), pre-dating the transition to multicellularity.</p><p>Why might these ultrastructural changes have occurred? We can speculate that loss of bulkier flagellar structures like the third outer dynein head, broad radial spoke heads, and larger CPC projections may have generated space to accommodate additional molecular components in the common ancestor of choanoflagellates and animals. Although free-swimming unicellular eukaryotes like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> also signal through their flagella (sensing light, chemical environmental cues, and mechanosensory stimuli), cilia and flagella in animals have adapted many additional signaling functions and molecules, including T2R, progesterone receptors, estrogen receptor-ß, interleukin-6 receptor, and Hedgehog (HH) pathway components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloodgood, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mitchell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sigg et al., 2017</xref>). Many choanoflagellate species spend part or all of their life cycles attached to substrates using carbohydrate-based theca structures or attached to one another in sheets or colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dayel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leadbeater, 2014</xref>). Could the reduced RS head structures, CPC projections, and dynein motors in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> be related to a shift away from predator avoidance toward increased signaling functions in a more stable and protected environment? For example, the additional force provided by three outer dynein arm motors could help counteract the hydrodynamic effects of multiple cilia and flagella in organisms like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, whereas the evolutionary selection pressure to retain the third outer dynein head may be lost in organisms with only one flagellum. Another possibility could be that genes encoding the additional outer dynein heavy chain, subunits in the bulkier radial spokes, and/or CPC proteins were linked to genes that were lost for other evolutionarily advantageous reasons. Future studies might examine flagellar structures and beat strength in species from earlier-branching opisthokonts or amoebozoans as well as other sessile filter feeders to expand on these comparisons.</p><p>On the other hand, choanoflagellates can exist in free-swimming, single-cell states, and they must find food, avoid predators, and survive harsh aquatic environments like other unicellular organisms. How might they compensate for the decreased flagellar stability that may have resulted from the reduction of flagellar structures (i.e. RS heads, dynein motors, CPC)? We report a unique rail-MIP in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> flagella that runs the length of the A-tubule lumen. MIPs are thought to reinforce structural integrity of doublet microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Owa et al., 2019</xref>), therefore a combination of the rail-MIP and A2-hole identified here may provide the strength and flexibility necessary to compensate for the loss of bulkier flagellar structures. The rail-MIP is found preferentially in specific doublets with a distribution that resembles the also asymmetric distribution of the beak-MIPs in the B-tubule of DMTs 1,5,6 of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nicastro et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is also possible that both the rail-MIP and beak-MIP provide mechanical support to compensate for external forces, such as the extra drag generated by the motion of the flagellar vane (choanoflagellates) or mastigoneme filaments (<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>) through the aqueous environment, given both structures’ wing-like positioning perpendicular to the beating direction of the flagella. Likely, a combination of these factors has enabled choanoflagellates to reduce their dynein and radial spoke structures without losing their cell-propulsion function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Enhanced flagellar vane preservation reveals its detailed and unique morphology</title><p>The choanoflagellate flagellar vane has remained understudied due to technical challenges with fixation and visualization of this filigree structure. Plunge-freezing and cryo-ET overcome these challenges, allowing us to study the vane in unprecedented detail, both confirming and extending previous observations and interspecies comparisons. The choanoflagellate flagellar vane has only been observed in a few of the &gt;125 known choanoflagellate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hibberd, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leadbeater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mah et al., 2014</xref>). These reports describe the vane as a bilateral fringe composed of delicate perpendicular fibers of glycocalyx, occasionally with diagonal or longitudinal fibers, which extend approximately two-thirds of the flagellar length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hibberd, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leadbeater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mah et al., 2014</xref>). Our data are consistent with these reports and further resolve two layers of vane filaments on each side of the flagellum, which split and connect with neighboring filaments and are offset to form a mesh-like appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D, I</xref>). The wispy hairs we observe appear similar to the ‘partially disintegrated’ vanes observed in <italic>Monosiga</italic> sp. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hibberd, 1975</xref>), suggesting that they are perhaps not disintegrated but rather a common variation on vane structure. We do not know what the wispy vanes represent in relation to the mesh-like vane, but different interpretations are possible: they could be areas of the vane that are broken, areas that are being newly generated or repaired, or perhaps there is some advantage to having meshed vane on one side and wispy vanes on the other.</p><p>As has been previously discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hibberd, 1975</xref>), the structure of the choanoflagellate vane differs significantly from other flagellar appendages, including the hair-like mastigonemes from green algae like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2020</xref>) or the tripartite hairs from golden algae like <italic>Ochromonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouck, 1971</xref>). Both the size and arrangement of filaments is distinct, with algal mastigonemes comprised of two intertwined filaments with an overall diameter of ~10 nm and organized as single or tripartite hairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), vs choanoflagellate filament diameters of ~3.5 nm arranged as wispy hairs or meshed networks. In addition, we do not detect connections between the membrane anchor of the choanoflagellate vane filaments and the axonemal microtubules, in contrast to observations for <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Euglena</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these morphological differences, we also did not detect homologues of the mastigoneme protein MST1 and membrane anchor PKD2 in the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> genome via BLAST search, suggesting that the vane differs from these flagellar appendages. Instead, it was proposed that the morphology of the choanoflagellate vane is similar to the bilateral, wing-like vane of sponge choanocyte flagella, which is anchored in the flagellar membrane without connections to the axonemal microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mehl and Reiswig, 1991</xref>). However, sponge choanocyte vanes appear to be narrower, denser, and more massive than choanoflagellate vanes, and they often connect laterally to the collar microvilli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunet and King, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hibberd, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leadbeater, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mehl and Reiswig, 1991</xref>). The choanoflagellate vane has previously been reported to span the width of the collar in <italic>Monosiga brevicolis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mah et al., 2014</xref>), however, the field of view in our tomograms does note capture the ends of the vane to assess any potential connections to the microvilli. Future studies on the ultrastructure of the sponge choanocyte flagellar vane, as well as the composition of both choanocyte and choanoflagellate vane filaments and their lateral connections will further elucidate the extent of their similarity and provide insight as to their evolutionary relationship.</p><p>How do these delicate and intricate vane structures form, and what are they made of? Though our data do not directly address these questions, we do observe fibers that originate within the flagellar pocket, suggesting the possibility that the vane could be secreted from the cell membrane before being transported into the flagellar compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Though not present in our cryo-ET data of fast and slow swimmers, large, fiber-filled vesicles have been observed near the apical part of choanoflagellate cells following division, presumably when the flagellum and vane would be regenerating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leadbeater, 2014</xref>). Intriguingly, glycosyltransferases such as those encoded by <italic>jumble</italic> and <italic>couscous</italic> localize to both the basal pole and the flagellar/collar base, and the collar base also stains positively for jacalin, <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic> (tomato) lectin (LEL), and <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> (potato) lectin (STL), indicating the presence of carbohydrate chains made of Galß3GalNAc and GlcNAc<sub>2-4</sub> near the choanoflagellate flagellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wetzel et al., 2018</xref>). We performed an external digest with proteinase K, which failed to remove the flagellar vane (data not shown), supporting the hypothesis that the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> flagellar vane is carbohydrate or glycoprotein-based rather than proteinaceous, though additional study is necessary to further characterize the specific vane component(s).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Barb structures and their possible functions</title><p>In addition to the mysterious composition and function of the flagellar vane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leadbeater, 2006</xref>), we have identified previously undescribed barb structures attached to the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> flagellar membrane. At about 50 nm in height and with four ‘arms’ and a central rod connecting to the flagellar membrane, the barbs’ function and composition present yet additional mysteries. Like the vane filaments, we find barb structures in both the flagellar membrane and the plasma membrane of the flagellar pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Despite of their resemblance to headless bacteriophages or bacterial secretion needles, the barbs’ semi-regular distribution in two loose rows around the vane filaments makes it unlikely that the barb structures originate from an external source – for instance the co-cultured <italic>E. pacifica</italic> bacterial prey. Consistently, we do not observe barb structures on the surface or inside of <italic>E. pacifica</italic> cells or floating in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). However, the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> genome has undergone extensive horizontal gene transfer from bacteria and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matriano et al., 2021</xref>), so it is possible that the barbs could have an ancient bacterial origin. Indeed, the barb structures most closely resemble the size, shape, and general distribution of an uncharacterized bacterial complex in <italic>Prosthecobacter debontii</italic>, although the bacterial structures exhibit a fivefold rather than fourfold symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dobro et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The barbs’ location alongside the flagellar vane suggests that they could play a role in vane generation or maintenance. Indeed, the top knobs at the barbs’ distal ends resemble the size and shape of the nodes within the proximal vane, though the distance to the flagellar membrane in the vane base is roughly twice that of the barb height. Although beyond the scope of this study, finding cellular contexts in which barbs are increased or decreased, for example during states in which the flagellum and vane are regenerating following cell division or artificially induction could provide additional insight into the barb function(s).</p><p>With continually improving cryo-ET workflows and new techniques for genetic modification in choanoflagellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Booth and King, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth et al., 2018</xref>), there has never been a more exciting time for detailed ultrastructural and functional analyses in our closest unicellular relatives. This work raises many important questions, particularly regarding the role of flagellar structural changes and extracellular matrix components in choanoflagellate biology. Combining recent advances in Opisthokonta phylogeny with morphological and ultrastructural traits, we can better predict the nature of the last common ancestor of choanoflagellates and animals. Furthermore, because choanoflagellate flagella more closely resemble human flagella, they may represent an attractive alternative to other protist model systems like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> for the study of human ciliopathies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Choanoflagellate culture and cryo-preparation</title><p><italic>S. rosetta</italic> co-cultured with <italic>E. pacifica</italic> was obtained from ATCC (PRA-390) and was cultured as previously described (King lab choanoflagellate handbook: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://kinglab.berkeley.edu/resources/">https://kinglab.berkeley.edu/resources/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levin and King, 2013</xref>).

Samples were back-blotted for 1–3 s with Whatman filter paper (grade 1) to remove excess buffer and immediately plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a homemade plunge freezing device. Vitrified samples were mounted into either Autogrids with notched ring for FIB-milling or regular Autogrids for direct cryo-ET (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored in liquid nitrogen until used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cryo-FIB milling</title><p>Autogrids with vitrified <italic>S. rosetta</italic> were cryogenically transferred into an Aquilos dual-beam FIB/SEM instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a cryo-stage that was precooled to –185 °C.

Cryo-FIB milling was performed using a 30 keV gallium ion beam with currents of 30 pA for initial bulk milling and thinning, and 10 pA for final polishing, resulting in ~150-nm-thick, self-supporting lamella.

K3 frames were dose-weighted and motion-corrected using Motioncorr2. The tilt series images for whole cell reconstructions were aligned using the 10 nm gold nanoparticles as fiducials. Images for lamella reconstructions were aligned either fiducial-less using patch-tracking in IMOD or using dark features (e.g. from the sputter coat or embedded Gallium) as fiducials. 3D reconstructions were calculated using weighted back-projection. Tomograms were excluded from further analysis if they contained compressed flagella or were damaged by non-vitreous ice. Subtomogram averaging was performed as previously described using the PEET program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nicastro et al., 2006</xref>). Initial averages of the barb structures suggested symmetry, thus four-fold symmetry was applied during the final steps of subtomogram averaging. To sort particles (i.e. axonemal repeats) with and without rail-MIP and/or A2 hole, soft-edged masks were applied around those features and unsupervised classification analyses built into the PEET program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heumann et al., 2011</xref>) was performed to calculate class averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G-H</xref>). For clearer views of the radial spoke heads, local alignment refinement was performed focused on each individual RS heads. Isosurface renderings were generated using the UCSF Chimera package software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> contains a compiled isosurface rendering, which uses a single tomogram to indicate the position of the structures so that they are biologically accurate, while substituting the raw data of repetitive structures, such as the barbs and the axonemal and CPC repeat units, with the corresponding higher resolution subtomogram averages using the Chimera software. For the visualization of the vane, the selected raw tomogram was first denoised using Cryo-CARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchholz et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, odd and even frames were separately reconstructed and 1200 extracted subvolumes (64 voxels each) were used to train the neuronal network (batch size 16, learning rate 0.0004, 200 epochs, 75 training steps per epoch) with the axoneme masked out to feature the vanes in the cryo-CARE model. The trained network was applied to the full reconstruction to generate a denoised tomogram, which was then used to generate the vane isosurface rendering in Chimera.</p><p>Resolution of the 96 nm repeat, CPC, and barb particle were estimated at the base of RS1, C1a projection, and particle center, respectively, using the Fourier shell correlation method with a criterion of 0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Thibaut Brunet (Reviewer #2); Brooke Morriswood (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed this was a beautiful study that does not require any new data. They suggest a number of suggestions for improvements in presentation and analysis listed below.</p><p>The reviewers agree that it would be useful if use the term flagellum rather than cilium (please see Reviewer #2 for details).</p><p>They also encourage you to address other possible explanations for the lack of the third dynein arm (also see reviewer #2). On this point it's worth noting that the trypanosome 96 nm repeat (Imhof et al., 2019) shows they also lack a 3rd arm, and yet are highly motile and also use their flagella for sensing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is well written and falls within the scope of <italic>eLife</italic>. I appreciated the inclusion of both maps and validation reports with submission, thank you. Before fully recommending this for publication, I feel some additional analysis and quantification is required to improve the impact of the study.</p><p>1. Though not the fault of the authors, I find the use of MIPX nomenclature (e.g. Line 200) a little confusing, given that proteins that make up these MIPs are in some cases becoming clear. Can the authors, where possible, include protein names in parentheses for the MIPs? Would this be possible for the CPC proteins as well?</p><p>2. Do differences in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> Rib72 (which I believe is MIP1?) explain why MIP1a is shorter than MIP1b in their cilia (Line 201-203)?</p><p>3. The authors mention &quot;some differences&quot; between <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and other cilia, then only mention one (MIP1a/b lengths, see point 2). What are the other differences between <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and other cilia? If these other differences are minor, could the authors clarify that the MIP1a/b is the major difference, other than the novel proteins then described?</p><p>4. Could the authors quantify the vane orientation with respect to the central pair in Figure 5 —figure supplement 1? This would better support their conclusions regarding the vane orientation with respect to the CPC (line 294).</p><p>5. Could the authors clarify in the text whether the wispy vanes (Line 311) were interspersed with organised vanes on the same cilium, or vanes on different cilia were either wispy or organised? What do these wispy vanes represent?</p><p>6. Could the authors analyse the proximity or colocalisation of the barb structures with the vane filament bases to support their assertion that they are found in rows near the vanes themselves (Line 331)?</p><p>7. The authors are missing some important references. Could the authors include the following radial spoke structure references in the results (Line 172) and discussion (lines 368-369)? Grossman-Haham et al. 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-00519-9), Zheng et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021180118), and Gui et al. 2021 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41594-020-00530-0).</p><p>8. The authors' introduction seems to completely omit the high resolution structures of axoneme components, namely the microtubule doublet (Ma et al. 2019), the radial spoke structures (see point 7), the axonemal dynein structures (Walton et al. 2021, Rao et al. 2021) and central pair apparatus structures (Han et al. 2022) that have been recently released. These structures provide important insights into protein placement within the cilia that are complementary to the excellent cryo-ET and bioinformatics studies the authors mention. As such, they should be mentioned in the paragraph talking about ciliary ultrastructure (lines 74-88).</p><p>9. The legend for Figure 4 is very long, containing results that should be in the text rather than the legend (e.g. &quot;Overall both features show some doublet-specific distribution…&quot;). Could the authors remove these results from the legend, and work to shorten it?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As I have no expertise in cryo-EM, I must defer to the other referee(s) to evaluate those specific aspects of the work. As far as I can assess it, the paper comes across as very solid, and I only have minor points (albeit maybe many of them):</p><p>Technical points:</p><p>– l. 292-294: &quot;The plane containing the vane varies somewhat in relation to the CPC/sub-5-6 planes, but in most tomograms, it appears to be oriented roughly parallel to the CPC within an angle of up to ~30 degrees between the planes&quot; The vane/CPC angle has not been quantified (although it could have been), and the statement would be stronger with a quantification.</p><p>Terminology:</p><p>– Throughout the paper, the authors refer to the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> flagellum as a &quot;cilium&quot;. This word is not commonly used to refer to this structure – although it is homologous to the cilia of ciliates and metazoans. It is of course unfortunate that two different words are in use (with somewhat inconsistent usage between taxonomic groups), but attempts at a single term (&quot;undulipodia&quot; or &quot;cilia&quot; for everything) have regrettably not achieved general use, and the least confusing option remains to refer to the structure under study as a &quot;flagellum&quot; together with an explanation of current usage.</p><p>– Similarly, the microvilli as often erroneously referred to as &quot;collars&quot; (the collar is the set of all microvilli) or as &quot;collar tentacles&quot; (which is outdated terminology).</p><p>– l. 149, the base of the flagellum is referred to as &quot;the basal pole&quot; – but it is actually the apical pole of the cell</p><p>Interpretations</p><p>– l. 376-394, the authors speculate that the lack of a 3rd outer dynein arm and the reduced radial spoke of choano/animal flagella (compared to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and Tetrahymena) might reflect a weaker flagellar beat, and a switch (for choanoflagellates) to a sessile lifestyle. This is not convincing, since the authors have imaged free-swimming choanos, not sessile ones, so no adaptation to a sessile lifestyle is expected in this dataset. Moreover, there is (to my knowledge) no direct evidence that the flagellar beat of choanos is actually weaker than the one of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>: this is a speculation based on the structure (a reasonable one, but which should be presented as such).</p><p>Presentation</p><p>– The text only ever refers to figure supplements as a whole, but never to specific panels. This can make it hard to find what the authors are referring to. Two examples: l. 314 should refer to &quot;Figure 6-Figure S1A&quot; and l. 315 to &quot;Figure 6-Figure S1B-C&quot;.</p><p>– Figure 7 is hard to interpret for non-experts. Only radial spokes are labelled (&quot;RS&quot;), but inner dyneim arms and outer dynein arms are left for the reader to guess. They should be labelled as well (IDA, ODA). Similarly, it is really not obvious to an untrained eye that choanozoans have only 2 ODAs while other eukaryotes have 3. Maybe the distinct dynein arms (per axonemal repeat) should be labelled somehow (different colors?) to clarify that point?</p><p>General knowledge points</p><p>– In the intro, the authors state that animals &quot;rely on cilia for developmental signaling, mucosal clearance, feeding, and reproduction&quot;, by contrast to protists who generally use them for locomotion. This is not quite valid since many metazoans also use cilia for locomotion (ctenophores, gastrotrichs, planarians, placozoans, planktonic larvae of many marine invertebrates (eg annelids, mollusks, echinoderms, hemichordates, sponges, cnidarians)…)</p><p>– Also in the intro (l. 74-88), the authors say that previous comparative studies of cilia/flagella have been limited to microscopy and to sequence comparison between a handful of selected proteins. This ignores the several comparative proteomic studies of flagella that have been performed over the years (for example Pazour et al., JCB 2005; Abedin Sigg et al., Dev Cell 2017).</p><p>– l. 281-282: &quot;the presence of a vane structure itself has only been shown for a few freshwater species&quot;. This is not true, since the list includes Monosiga brevicollis, which is a sea water species.</p><p>– l. 386-387: the authors say that choanoflagellate flagella might be intermediate in signalling protein content between other protists and metazoans, since they contain TRP-associated proteins (though they lack Hedgehog and GPCR components). This is not very convincing since <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagella also have quite some TRP channels.</p><p>– l. 443: the authors state that the vane filaments &quot;do not connect laterally to collar filaments&quot; in choanos. This is not true in Monosiga, as Mah et al. (2014) reported direct contact between the vane and the base of the microvilli (Figure 3B; though this contact is lost in more distal parts, since the microvilli are not parallel and eventually &quot;fan out&quot;). Similarly, Figure 2G in the present paper shows potential contact points between vane filaments and microvilli (though I'm not sure whether a preparation artifact can be excluded).</p><p>– I strongly recommend switching to the word &quot;flagellum&quot; throughout the paper, with an explanation of the contrasted usage of the words &quot;cilium&quot; and &quot;flagellum&quot; in the introduction.</p><p>– I suggest adding a quantification of the vane/CPC angle throughout the dataset and plotting it as a histogram or a scatter plot.</p><p>– l. 201-203: &quot;However, we also observed some differences, e.g. MIP1a is typically longer than MIP1b in other species (Song et al., 2020), but in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> MIP1a is shorter than MIP1b (Figure 4, A-B, D-E).&quot; Could this be tested/validated by comparison of the relevant protein sequences?</p><p>– Regarding the lack of a 3rd outer dynein arm and the reduced radial spokes in choanozoans: if it indeed reflects a weaker flagellar beat (which remains to be tested!), I don't think a switch to a sessile lifestyle or a pivot toward signaling functions are very plausible explanations (for the reasons given above). An alternative I submit to the author's considerations: choanozoans (like all opisthokonts) have a single flagellum per cell, unlike other studied eukaryotes which have 2 (<italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>) or many (ciliates). Could it be that a stronger flagellar beat is needed to counteract the hydrodynamic effect of the neighboring flagellum, but unnecessary when there is only one?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no pressing recommendations. I really enjoyed the paper both in terms of quality and interest. I've provided a few suggestions below that the authors may wish to implement in order to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>1. Figure 1A should be altered I think, as it could more accurately show the phylogenetic relationships between the selected organisms. Both the alveolates and the Archaeplastida belong to the same SAR (stramenopiles, alveolates, rhizaria) supergroup, so they are more closely related to each other. The excavates are (probably) as distantly related to SAR organisms as they are to opisthokonts. To keep the alterations simple, I would recommend moving grouping the alveolates and Archaeplastida together in a single clade on the left-hand side of the panel, and also moving the excavates to the left-hand side. That will better represent the evolutionary distances involved. The unannotated branches (purple, magenta, brown, grey) could simply be removed. Kops et al., 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.021) has an excellent figure that could be used as a template, if the authors wish to make more extensive alterations.</p><p>2. I found the figure legends quite difficult to read, because the panel references (A/B/C etc) are jumping around so much. These could perhaps be restructured a bit for improved clarity?</p><p>3. Similarly, it's harder for the reader to follow the flow of the data when figure panels are not cited in order. From the Introduction to the first couple of Results sections, the figure/panel citations go; Figure 1, Figure 1D, Figure 1A, Figure 1, Figure 2A-F, Figure 2D. Please ensure that the flow of the manuscript matches the flow of the figures.</p><p>4. Figure 6I – I would consider removing the vane from the compiled rendering – there is actually more information available on these filaments in panels A/C/D and the compiled rendering of the vane looks a bit messy and suggests that there is less structure than there actually is.</p><p>5. L359-375/Figure 7 – In general, I don't like new information being introduced in the Discussion. Could this section be moved so that it comes between the existing Figures 3 and 4? Given that the authors highlighted the <italic>T. brucei</italic> axoneme in Figure 1A, is there any reason why it was excluded from the analysis here? They would be sampling more eukaryotic biodiversity if it was included, given that Tetrahymena and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> both belong to the SAR supergroup.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78133.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed this was a beautiful study that does not require any new data.

Theoretically, the term “cilia” includes “eukaryotic flagella”, and we typically use the former term to avoid confusion with “bacterial flagella”, which are of course very different, non-homologous structures. We do, however, understand the historical preference to refer to longer cilia (often) with symmetric waveforms (e.g. sperm flagella, etc.) as “flagella”. Therefore, we have changed all references of choanoflagellate ‘cilia’ to ‘flagella’ in the manuscript, adding the following text at line 55 to address the first instance:</p><p>Line 55-56 “Eukaryotic cilia and flagella (terms often used interchangeably) are long, microtubule-based structures that protrude from the cell surface.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They also encourage you to address other possible explanations for the lack of the third dynein arm (also see reviewer #2).

For example, the additional force provided by three outer dynein arm motors could help counteract the hydrodynamic effects of multiple cilia and flagella in organisms like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and Tetrahymena, whereas the evolutionary selection pressure to retain the third outer dynein head may be lost in organisms with only one flagellum. Another possibility could be that genes encoding the additional outer dynein heavy chain, subunits in the bulkier radial spokes, and/or CPC proteins were linked to genes that were lost for other evolutionarily advantageous reasons. Future studies might examine flagellar structures and beat strength in species from earlier-branching opisthokonts or amoebozoans as well as other sessile filter feeders to expand on these comparisons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript is well written and falls within the scope of eLife.

Can the authors, where possible, include protein names in parentheses for the MIPs? Would this be possible for the CPC proteins as well?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Though we have carefully considered this option, the authors feel that including protein names would be an overinterpretation of our data, and potentially more confusing to readers than it would be helpful. Though it is true that, in some cases, the proteins that make up individual MIPs and CPC proteins have recently been published in other species such as <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, how these proteins relate to <italic>S. rosetta</italic> proteins remains unclear (see example below in response to review 1’s point 2). Our level of resolution does not allow us to fit individual protein structures into the MIP densities or even see some of the smaller structures reported in other papers using different methods, thus we hesitate to make unfounded claims about which proteins are present. In addition, the FAP nomenclature is not used in Choanoflagellates, therefore we would have to list both the <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> protein names as well as the potential <italic>S. rosetta</italic> homologous protein names, which would be lengthy and confusing to most readers. Similar to other organisms (e.g. <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>) with multiple orthologues of ciliary proteins, blast searches of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> flagellar proteins against the <italic>S. rosetta</italic> genome often result in multiple significant hits, therefore it would be both difficult and inaccurate to compile a 1:1 list for protein equivalents between species without further experiments (like candidate protein tagging or knockout). Providing a full list of significant blast results for each <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> protein in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> does not seem generally useful, as readers can blast the individual proteins they are interested in and get the same information themselves. We therefore kept the standard MIP nomenclature based on position rather than speculating about potential protein homologs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Do differences in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> Rib72 (which I believe is MIP1?) explain why MIP1a is shorter than MIP1b in their cilia (Line 201-203)?</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, RIB72 or RIB72A/B, respectively, are elongated, multi-domain proteins that span from protofilaments A13-A1-A5 of the A-tubule. In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, Rib72 A/B KOs affect the MIP structures historically termed MIP1, 6 and 4, because Rib72 interacts with other MIP proteins such as FAP252, FAP115, and more (Ma et al. 2019; Li et al. 2022). A BLAST search of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> RIB72 (GenBank Accession: AAM44303.1) identifies two potential homologues in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>: EFHC1 protein (XP_004991408.1) and uncharacterized protein PTSG_01492 (XP_004997468.1). At 627 and 609 amino acids, respectively, both are slightly shorter but still similar in length to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> RIB72, which has 635 amino acids. Unfortunately, without significant additional genetic knockout and imaging experiments, we have no way of knowing if one of these or both homologues are expressed or localized to the Choanoflagellate flagellum. In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, both orthologues localize to cilia and alternate along the doublet microtubule; the RIB72A/B domains that are part of MIP1a and b respectively, seem to have asymmetric interactions with an unidentified density bridging between them (Li et al. 2022). This all said, based on our resolution and the uncertainties about homologs and other interacting subunits, we cannot make conclusions about individual protein components of the MIP structures. So while this is a great question and a great point to raise, we do not have a clear answer based on sequence comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors mention &quot;some differences&quot; between <italic>S. rosetta</italic> and other cilia, then only mention one (MIP1a/b lengths, see point 2).

If these other differences are minor, could the authors clarify that the MIP1a/b is the major difference, other than the novel proteins then described?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this confusing language, which we have now removed. The major differences that we wanted to highlight were as listed – the difference in MIP1a/b lengths, and the rail-MIP, which we have only observed in Choanoflagellates.

We have now quantified the vane orientation with respect to the central pair complex, not only for the datasets shown in former Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 (now Figure 6 —figure supplement 1), but for all tomographic reconstructions included in this study. We find that the CPC orientation varies in relation to the ice layer, however, the vane shows a strong orientation preference to be flat within the thin layer of ice that is generated during blotting and plunge freezing of the EM grids (revised Figure 6 —figure supplement 1, panel J-K).

This orientation is consistent with the vane’s predicted physiological function in the pumping mechanism of these filter feeders (Nielsen et al., 2017), as the vane would be naturally positioned to experience hydrodynamic drag, pushing liquid and prey close to the collar (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, L).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Tomograms often contained areas with wispy hairs and areas with structured vanes, typically on opposite sides of the flagellum (as in Figure 7A). Vane filaments were apparent in all but one of the 54 tomograms we analyzed, with most tomograms exhibiting at least partial organized, mesh-like structures (Figure 7 B-D).”</p><p>Line 847-859: “We do not know what the wispy vanes represent in relation to the mesh-like vane, but different interpretations are possible: they could be areas of the vane that are broken, areas that are being newly generated or repaired, or perhaps there is some advantage to having meshed vane on one side and wispy vanes on the other.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Could the authors analyse the proximity or colocalisation of the barb structures with the vane filament bases to support their assertion that they are found in rows near the vanes themselves (Line 331)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We have now incorporated a quantification of the distance from the barb particles to the plane of the vane filament bases (Figure 7J-K). Though the examples with the most barbs (e.g. Figure 7I) appear to have loosely organized rows of barbs, it is difficult to make that assertion for most of the tomograms with barbs, so we have removed the language around being in “rows”. However, our data do support that the barbs are near where the vane filaments are anchored in the ciliary membrane with a median distance of 50 nm. The relevant text now reads:</p><p>Lines 632-689: “Although the top knob of the barb resembles the size of the nodes of the flagellar vane (~7 nm diameter), barbs were not observed at the base of each vane filament. The number of barbs varied greatly between tomograms (which show ~2 µm flagellar length), ranging from 0-22 barbs, but their location was consistently near the base of the vane filaments, with a median distance of 50 nm from the barb structures to the vane plane (Figure 7I-K, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-I).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

This is not convincing, since the authors have imaged free-swimming choanos, not sessile ones, so no adaptation to a sessile lifestyle is expected in this dataset. Moreover, there is (to my knowledge) no direct evidence that the flagellar beat of choanos is actually weaker than the one of Chlamydomonas: this is a speculation based on the structure (a reasonable one, but which should be presented as such).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct to point out that this statement is speculatory, and that we do not address beat strength directly (nor is this information available in the literature to our knowledge). We have therefore revised the text to encompass this and Reviewer 2’s last point. It now reads:</p><p>Line 779-790: “Could the reduced RS head structures, CPC projections, and dynein motors in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> be related to a shift away from predator avoidance toward increased signaling functions in a more stable and protected environment? For example, the additional force provided by three outer dynein arm motors could help counteract the hydrodynamic effects of multiple cilia and flagella in organisms like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and Tetrahymena, whereas the evolutionary selection pressure to retain the third outer dynein head may be lost in organisms with only one flagellum. Another possibility could be that genes encoding the additional outer dynein heavy chain, subunits in the bulkier radial spokes, and/or CPC proteins were linked to genes that were lost for other evolutionarily advantageous reasons. Future studies might examine flagellar structures and beat strength in species from earlier-branching opisthokonts or amoebozoans as well as other sessile filter feeders to expand on these comparisons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Presentation</p><p>– The text only ever refers to figure supplements as a whole, but never to specific panels.

Only radial spokes are labelled (&quot;RS&quot;), but inner dyneim arms and outer dynein arms are left for the reader to guess. They should be labelled as well (IDA, ODA). Similarly, it is really not obvious to an untrained eye that choanozoans have only 2 ODAs while other eukaryotes have 3. Maybe the distinct dynein arms (per axonemal repeat) should be labelled somehow (different colors?) to clarify that point?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these excellent critiques.

This is not quite valid since many metazoans also use cilia for locomotion (ctenophores, gastrotrichs, planarians, placozoans, planktonic larvae of many marine invertebrates (eg annelids, mollusks, echinoderms, hemichordates, sponges, cnidarians)…)</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to address this valid criticism:</p><p>Line 59-63: “The vast majority of eukaryotic life consists of unicellular organisms with flagella, which perform a variety of functions necessary for their survival, e.g., aid in motility, feeding, avoiding predators, and sensing the environment (Burki, 2014; Mitchell, 2007). Multicellular eukaryotes, including animals (metazoans), also rely on cilia and flagella for locomotion, developmental signaling, mucosal clearance, feeding, and reproduction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Also in the intro (l. 74-88), the authors say that previous comparative studies of cilia/flagella have been limited to microscopy and to sequence comparison between a handful of selected proteins.

Historically, much of our knowledge of flagellar architecture from diverse species has been based on conventional light and electron microscopy studies, which are inherently limited by detection limits and preservation artifacts. Protein sequence comparisons have also yielded important insights, particularly into dynein evolution in eukaryotic flagella (Kollmar, 2016), although this required manual annotation of thousands of genes from hundreds of species, not particularly sustainable for examining hundreds of flagellar proteins. Similarly, comparative proteomic studies have also largely contributed to our understanding of flagella composition and evolution (Pazour et al., 2005; Sigg et al., 2017), though both sequence comparisons and proteomics are limited in their ability to predict protein localization and interactions. As a result, our knowledge of detailed flagellar morphology, function, and evolution has remained restricted..”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– l. 281-282: &quot;the presence of a vane structure itself has only been shown for a few freshwater species&quot;.

(2014) reported direct contact between the vane and the base of the microvilli (Figure 3B; though this contact is lost in more distal parts, since the microvilli are not parallel and eventually &quot;fan out&quot;). Similarly, Figure 2G in the present paper shows potential contact points between vane filaments and microvilli (though I'm not sure whether a preparation artifact can be excluded).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. We have reviewed our tomograms and we do not see any examples of vane filaments directly connecting to collar microvilli. That said, the collar microvilli of unperturbed cells would form a cone/ring around the flagellum. Our tomograms are centered on the flagella, and as mentioned in lines 451-454, the vane extends beyond the boundaries of the tomograms (&gt;3 µm). Presumably, any lateral connections from vane to microvilli would occur at the outermost ends of the vane filaments, which are not captured within our datasets. The widest example we have is the image in Figure 2D, but the vane extends even beyond the edge of that image (and 3D data is only available in the areas marked with green rectangles where tilt series were recorded). In addition, the collar microvilli that we observe in our data are typically not too far above or below the vane, often irregularly spaced and positioned at different angles, indicating that the microvillar organization maybe disrupted (i.e. the cone arrangement flattened) during blotting and freezing. Therefore, delicate connections between vane and collar could be broken as well during sample preparation. As a result, we have removed the statement from line 773 that vane filaments do not connect laterally to collar microvilli and revised the text as follows:</p><p>Line 861-873: “However, sponge choanocyte vanes appear to be narrower, denser, and more massive than choanoflagellate vanes, and they often connect laterally to the collar microvilli (Brunet and King, 2017; Hibberd, 1975; Leadbeater, 2006; Mah et al., 2014; Mehl and Reiswig, 1991). The choanoflagellate vane has previously been reported to span the width of the collar in Monosiga brevicolis (Mah et al., 2014), however, the field of view in our tomograms does note capture the ends of the vane to assess any potential connections to the microvilli. Future studies on the ultrastructure of the sponge choanocyte flagellar vane, as well as the composition of both choanocyte and choanoflagellate vane filaments and their lateral connections will further elucidate the extent of their similarity and provide insight as to their evolutionary relationship.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I strongly recommend switching to the word &quot;flagellum&quot; throughout the paper, with an explanation of the contrasted usage of the words &quot;cilium&quot; and &quot;flagellum&quot; in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggested change in terminology.

This orientation is consistent with the vane’s predicted physiological function in the pumping mechanism of these filter feeders (Nielsen et al., 2017), as the vane would be naturally positioned to experience hydrodynamic drag, pushing liquid and prey close to the collar (Figure 6—figure supplement 1, L).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– l. 201-203: &quot;However, we also observed some differences, e.g. MIP1a is typically longer than MIP1b in other species (Song et al., 2020), but in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> MIP1a is shorter than MIP1b (Figure 4, A-B, D-E).&quot; Could this be tested/validated by comparison of the relevant protein sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, RIB72 or RIB72A/B, respectively, are elongated, multi-domain proteins that span from protofilaments A13-A1-A5 of the A-tubule. In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, Rib72 A/B KOs affect the MIP structures historically termed MIP1, 6 and 4, because Rib72 interacts with other MIP proteins such as FAP252, FAP115, and more (Ma et al. 2019; Li et al. 2022). A BLAST search of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> RIB72 (GenBank Accession: AAM44303.1) identifies two potential homologues in <italic>S. rosetta</italic>: EFHC1 protein (XP_004991408.1) and uncharacterized protein PTSG_01492 (XP_004997468.1). At 627 and 609 amino acids, respectively, both are slightly shorter but still similar in length to <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> RIB72, which has 635 amino acids. Unfortunately, without significant additional genetic knockout and imaging experiments, we have no way of knowing if one of these or both homologues are expressed or localized to the Choanoflagellate flagellum. In <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, both orthologues localize to cilia and alternate along the doublet microtubule; the RIB72A/B domains that are part of MIP1a and b respectively, seem to have asymmetric interactions with an unidentified density bridging between them (Li et al. 2022). This all said, based on our resolution and the uncertainties about homologs and other interacting subunits, we cannot make conclusions about individual protein components of the MIP structures. So while this is a great question and a great point to raise, we do not have a clear answer based on sequence comparison.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Regarding the lack of a 3rd outer dynein arm and the reduced radial spokes in choanozoans: if it indeed reflects a weaker flagellar beat (which remains to be tested!), I don't think a switch to a sessile lifestyle or a pivot toward signaling functions are very plausible explanations (for the reasons given above). An alternative I submit to the author's considerations: choanozoans (like all opisthokonts) have a single flagellum per cell, unlike other studied eukaryotes which have 2 (Chlamydomonas) or many (ciliates). Could it be that a stronger flagellar beat is needed to counteract the hydrodynamic effect of the neighboring flagellum, but unnecessary when there is only one?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for sharing this idea, and we have added this point as well as another possibility as follows:</p><p>Line 779-790: “Could the reduced RS head structures, CPC projections, and dynein motors in <italic>S. rosetta</italic> be related to a shift away from predator avoidance toward increased signaling functions in a more stable and protected environment? For example, the additional force provided by three outer dynein arm motors could help counteract the hydrodynamic effects of multiple cilia and flagella in organisms like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and Tetrahymena, whereas the evolutionary selection pressure to retain the third outer dynein head may be lost in organisms with only one flagellum. Another possibility could be that genes encoding the additional outer dynein heavy chain, subunits in the bulkier radial spokes, and/or CPC proteins were linked to genes that were lost for other evolutionarily advantageous reasons. Future studies might examine flagellar structures and beat strength in species from earlier-branching opisthokonts or amoebozoans as well as other sessile filter feeders to expand on these comparisons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have no pressing recommendations. I really enjoyed the paper both in terms of quality and interest. I've provided a few suggestions below that the authors may wish to implement in order to improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words and for the clarifying suggestions provided below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 1A should be altered I think, as it could more accurately show the phylogenetic relationships between the selected organisms. Both the alveolates and the Archaeplastida belong to the same SAR (stramenopiles, alveolates, rhizaria) supergroup, so they are more closely related to each other. The excavates are (probably) as distantly related to SAR organisms as they are to opisthokonts. To keep the alterations simple, I would recommend moving grouping the alveolates and Archaeplastida together in a single clade on the left-hand side of the panel, and also moving the excavates to the left-hand side. That will better represent the evolutionary distances involved. The unannotated branches (purple, magenta, brown, grey) could simply be removed. Kops et al., 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.021) has an excellent figure that could be used as a template, if the authors wish to make more extensive alterations.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful suggestion. The reviewer is correct to point out that SAR and Archaeplastida are more closely related than other groups. We have revised the diagram in Figure 1 to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I found the figure legends quite difficult to read, because the panel references (A/B/C etc) are jumping around so much. These could perhaps be restructured a bit for improved clarity?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful comment. We have restructured the figure legends to be more straightforward and un-bolded additional references to each figure panel to make it easier for readers to find the main panel explanations they may be looking for.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Similarly, it's harder for the reader to follow the flow of the data when figure panels are not cited in order. From the Introduction to the first couple of Results sections, the figure/panel citations go; Figure 1, Figure 1D, Figure 1A, Figure 1, Figure 2A-F, Figure 2D. Please ensure that the flow of the manuscript matches the flow of the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the text accordingly, and now the figure/panel citations go: Figure 1A, Figure 1B-D + Figure 1 supplements 1 and 2, Figure 1 supplement 2, Figure 2A-C, Figure 2D-F, and so on. Because the structures we discuss in the text are often present in multiple figures, we do refer to each figure in which the structures are visible, which we acknowledge could be confusing but unfortunately is unavoidable due to the nature of our data. Hopefully the revisions still improve the reader’s experience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 6I – I would consider removing the vane from the compiled rendering – there is actually more information available on these filaments in panels A/C/D and the compiled rendering of the vane looks a bit messy and suggests that there is less structure than there actually is.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this area of improvement. We have tested additional denoising methods for the raw tomogram to enhance the vane contrast (nonlinear anisotropic diffusion, SIRT reconstruction, CryoCARE – deep learning content-aware denoising), and we have applied more selective masks to better capture the vane structure (Revised figure 7I). Altogether, we think these changes improve the look of the vane within this figure, and we think it is valuable to include it to provide a more holistic understanding of other structures (<italic>e.g</italic>. CPC, barbs) in relation to the vane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. L359-375/Figure 7 – In general, I don't like new information being introduced in the Discussion. Could this section be moved so that it comes between the existing Figures 3 and 4? Given that the authors highlighted the <italic>T. brucei</italic> axoneme in Figure 1A, is there any reason why it was excluded from the analysis here? They would be sampling more eukaryotic biodiversity if it was included, given that Tetrahymena and Chlamydomonas both belong to the SAR supergroup.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions, and we have moved the previous figure 7 (now figure 4) between figures 3 and the previous figure 4 (now figure 5) as suggested. The SAR group includes stramenopiles, alveolates, and rhizaria; although <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (Archaeplastida) is on the same main branch as SAR, archaeplastids are considered a separate suprakingdom (Burki <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). Concerning ‘Excavates’, although the <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> dataset is available at the EMDB (see entries 20012-20014) (Imhof <italic>et al.</italic> 2019), the data quality is not on par with the other organisms we presented in our manuscript, and therefore it would not make a useful addition to the revised summary figure 4 (former figure 7). Even the dataset with the best resolution (EMD-20012, listed at 21.0 Å) lacks continuously visible radial spokes, and especially the radial spoke heads – one of the key structures we are comparing – are very noisy, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> from the EMDB website. We agree with the reviewer that sampling more eukaryotic biodiversity is important, and we have begun to investigate representatives of the ‘Excavates’ and other major branches as future studies.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78133-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>ReferencesAdl SM, Simpson AG, Lane CE, Lukes J, Bass D, Bowser SS, Brown MW, Burki F, Dunthorn M, Hampl V et al. 2012.
