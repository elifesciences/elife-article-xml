To fight for resources, some Gram-negative bacteria employ direct toxin exchange through a process known as Contact-Dependent growth Inhibition (CDI). This process was first described in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> EC93, where a two-partner secretion system consisting of a CdiA toxin and a CdiB transporter was shown to inhibit other <italic>E. coli</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>). CdiB is an outer membrane transporter that releases its CdiA toxin to the cell surface. Once contact occurs, a toxin domain at the CdiA C-terminus is cleaved and imported into the target bacterium to inhibit growth. To prevent self-destruction, CDI systems also express an immunity protein, CdiI, which protects against CdiA toxins delivered from neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruhe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhe et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>CdiA and CdiB belong to the Two-Partner Secretion family of proteins (TPS; Type Vb secretion system). The core of a TPS system consists of two proteins called TpsA for the secreted proteins, and TpsB for their cognate transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guérin et al., 2017</xref>). Like TpsA, CdiA toxins are predicted to fold into a β-helix, forming an elongated filament that extends several hundred angstroms from CdiB transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clantin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruhe et al., 2018</xref>). CdiA proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and contain two N-terminal domains directing their secretion: a signal peptide and a TPS domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). After inner membrane translocation and signal peptide removal by the SEC machinery, the CdiA TPS domain interacts with the periplasmic domains of its cognate CdiB transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clantin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delattre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hodak et al., 2006</xref>). At this point, translocation across the outer membrane is initiated and the rest of the protein is folded at the surface of the bacterium. Domain organization and folding during secretion are still poorly understood, however a study using electron cryo-tomography suggests that secretion occurs in two distinct steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruhe et al., 2018</xref>). In this model, the CdiA N-terminal half of the protein, including the TPS and FHA-1 domains, is secreted first and forms a 330 Å filament exposing the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD recognizes a specific membrane receptor on the surface of a neighboring cell, triggering the second secretion step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ruhe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruhe et al., 2017</xref>). The CdiA C-terminal half of the protein, which was still in the periplasm, is now released and exported to the cell surface. A short tyrosine- and proline-rich region and a second filamentous hemagglutinin domain (FHA-2) fold and then associate with the outer membrane of the target bacterium to deliver the C-terminal toxin. The toxin domain is cleaved from the rest of the CdiA protein by an unknown mechanism, and then released into the target cell.</p><p>CdiB proteins are members of the Omp85 superfamily. There are two functionally distinct protein classes in the Omp85 superfamily: BamA/TamA proteins that insert newly synthesized outer membrane proteins into the outer membrane, and TpsB proteins that secrete cognate protein substrates to the extracellular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gentle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guérin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinz and Lithgow, 2014</xref>). While there are several BamA, TamA, and BAM complex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakelar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>), only one TpsB structure has been characterized: <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> FhaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clantin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maier et al., 2015</xref>). This TpsB transporter secretes a major adhesin called filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA). BamA/TamA and TpsB proteins share a common fold with distinct features enabling either insertion into the membrane, or secretion across it. The two protein classes use a 16-stranded β-barrel to span the outer membrane, connected to a series of N-terminal periplasmic interaction modules called polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domains. Inside the β-barrel lumen, extracellular loop 6 (L6) forms a ‘lid-lock’ through interactions between two essential signature motifs: (V/I)<bold>R</bold>G(Y/F) at the tip of L6 and (F/G)x<bold>D</bold>xG on strand β13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gruss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noinaj et al., 2013</xref>). Mutagenesis experiments have shown that L6 is essential for activity but its precise function is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guérin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Höhr et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leonard-Rivera and Misra, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rigel et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, TpsB proteins contain an N-terminal α-helix (H1) inserted into the barrel pore that is not found in BamA/TamA proteins. H1 is connected to the first POTRA domain by a short periplasmic polypeptide; this linker has been shown to be essential for secretion in the FhaC/FHA system. Since H1 blocks the barrel pore in the resting conformation, it must be removed for secretion to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guérin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maier et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here we report the first crystal structures of CdiB transporters from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (ACICU) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (EC93). Two distinct conformations for H1 are observed within the β-barrel lumen. Using structure-based sequence alignment, we identified a conserved DxxG motif on strand β1 that is found in all TpsB transporters but not in BamA/TamA proteins. We show that the role of DxxG is to increase the flexibility of strand β1, which in turn affects the β1–β16 interface. We developed a secretion assay to show that CdiB transporters specifically secrete their cognate CdiA proteins and used this assay to analyze the functions of individual amino acids in CdiA secretion. Molecular dynamics simulations illustrate ejection of H1 from β-barrel lumen. Our results highlight conformational changes in the β-barrel domain that facilitate pore opening and secretion of the substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two CdiB transporter structures</title><p>We determined two full-length crystal structures of CdiB transporters from <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> (strain ACICU) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (strain EC93), which will be referred to as CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>. CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> structures were built and refined to final resolutions of 2.4 Å and 2.6 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Despite low sequence similarity (21% sequence identity), both structures adopt a common fold: an N-terminal α-helix (H1) is inserted into the lumen of the β-barrel and is connected by a ~ 20 residue linker to two periplasmic POTRA domains. The POTRA domains have a conserved βααββ fold and extend away from the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The C-terminal β-barrel consists of 16 antiparallel β-strands organized as an oblique cylinder with cross-sectional dimensions of 35 Å x 25 Å.

The N-terminal signal peptide (represented by a yellow box) is cleaved by the SEC complex (yellow) during inner membrane translocation. In the periplasm, CdiB and CdiA follow two different pathways (aided by periplasmic chaperones; not shown). As a TpsB transporter, CdiB interacts with the BAM complex, which folds and inserts CdiB into the outer membrane. BamA (brown), the central element of the BAM complex, and TpsB transporters are part of the same Omp85 superfamily sharing structural homologies (loop 6 and periplasmic POTRA domains (P) are indicated). CdiAs are large multi-domains proteins: the signaling domains TPS and RBD are represented in light green, FHA-1 and FHA-2 domains in dark green, and C-terminal toxin domain in red. In the periplasm, the N-terminal TPS domain recognizes and interacts with CdiB POTRA domains to initiate outer membrane translocation.

In TpsB/CdiB proteins, extracellular loop 5 is usually longer than other extracellular loops; the entire loop 5 can be traced in CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> but electron density is missing for CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> (residues 389–411) and FhaC (residues 381–399; PDB: 4QKY). In CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>, loop 5 is stabilized by contacts with loop 6 (R421) and two residues from strand β8 (R340 and T343) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

A network of interactions connects β-barrel-POTRA2 and the linker through conserved charged residues. A glutamate from helix α4 of POTRA2 (E179 in CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and E168 in CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>) forms a salt bridge with an arginine and a lysine present on strands β6 and β7, respectively (R325-K330 in CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and R309-K314 in CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>), while the N-terminal region of the linker (Y35 in CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and S34-A35 in CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>) is also stabilized by side chains from α4 (D175 for CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>, and R161-E164 for CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>). Some of these interactions are also seen in the FhaC structure, and biochemical experiments have shown that the interactions between POTRA2 and the linker are essential for substrate recognition and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delattre et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maier et al., 2015</xref>).

In both CdiB structures, the C-terminal part of the linker is attached to POTRA1 by a disulfide bond between two cysteines, an interaction that is conserved in all CdiB transporters (and some TpsB transporters). While a network of interactions stabilizes the N-terminal linker region near the β-barrel lumen, the middle region of the linker appears more flexible, sharing fewer surface interactions with POTRA1 (especially for CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> where residues 42–43 are missing in the electron density). This position differs slightly between CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>, confirming the biochemical and biophysical studies that have shown multiple linker conformations in the resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guérin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Structural differences in helix H1</title><p>Both CdiB structures adopt the same overall architecture, with H1 and L6 occluding the interior of the β-barrel.

This region is located on β1, interacts with loop 6, and dictates features of the β1–β16 interface on the extracellular surface of the protein. DxxG can either fully fold as a β-strand or adopt an extended conformation that tilts inward as shown by CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>, the DxxG motif accounts for four residues on the 12-residue β1 strand, allowing β1 to form an extended β-sheet with β2, β3, and β16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The sidechains of the first and third residues (D224 and S226) interact with R460 from loop 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), while the mainchain interacts with strand β2. In this structure, the second and fourth residues of the DxxG motif (D225 and G227) form H-bonds with β16. As a result, the β-barrel is in a fully zipped conformation, stabilized by 10 H-bonds between strands β1 and β16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Extracellular loops 1–2 are short, with loop 2 curved inward and partially blocking the top of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>, the DxxG motif is in an extended conformation and initiates loop 1. As a result, strand β1 is shorter, containing only eight residues. The β-sheet formed by β16 and β1-β3 is also shorter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In this structure, the β1–β16 interface is stabilized by only 6 H-bonds, although the sidechain from the second residue (N211) of the DxxG motif contributes to additional interactions with β16 that further stabilize the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). By increasing the length and flexibility of loop 1, the DxxG motif creates an inward tilting of the loop, allowing it to fold against β2-β3 and interact directly with H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In this position, loop 1 pushes loop 2 away from the lumen of the barrel. In CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>, the conserved glycine from the DxxG motif is also involved in a large conformational change by completing the turn made by loop 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). From our structural analysis, we propose that the role of this region is to increase the flexibility of strand β1, and to facilitate the conformational changes of loop 1 and loop 2.</p><p>A comparison of CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> with TpsB transporter FhaC shows that the structures of FhaC and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> are virtually identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> shows an alternate conformation.

When just the helix is deleted, there is less CdiB in the pellet fraction, especially for CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>, and correspondingly, a smaller amount of CdiA-Nt is secreted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This suggests that H1 is important for folding, membrane insertion, and/or stability of CdiB. However, when both the helix and linker are deleted, CdiB is present and secretion of CdiA-Nt occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results show that the helix and linker are not essential for CdiA-Nt secretion but must be important for CdiB stability.

To understand whether the flexibility of DxxG is important for activity, we engineered paired cysteine variants between β1 and β16 to stabilize the conformation of CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>. The CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> cysteine variants were then tested for their ability to secrete CdiA-Nt<sup>Ab</sup> in the absence or presence of the reducing agent TCEP. Disulfide bond formation was analyzed by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Clear disulfide bond formation was observed for all mutants positioned in the middle of the β-sheet. When β1 and β16 are cross-linked, substrate secretion is greatly impaired, however reduction of the disulfide rescues secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To confirm that crosslinking β1–β16 does not impair CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> biogenesis, we monitored expression of CdiB D224C/S555C and secretion of CdiA-Nt over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Whereas deletion of this loop prevents expression of CdiB, the 4-residue substitution of DDFH to GGAG is tolerated and does not increase cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Removal of the sidechains can prevent loop 2 interaction with the rest of the protein while increasing loop 2 flexibility. The GGAG mutant results in measurable impact on the secretion, where CdiA is detected after just 30 min and continues to increase over time. This result suggests that increasing loop 2 flexibility enhances secretion activity and may promote the active conformation of the β-barrel. As a comparison, when loop 2 adopts an inward conformation in the CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> X-ray structure, the sidechains point in the direction of H1 and loop 6, and the β-barrel lumen is partially capped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><p>Our structural and functional analysis reveal that β1 can be fully folded as a β-strand stabilized by β16 or adopt a more flexible extended secondary structure and be folded inward as part of loop 1. Our hypothesis is that the conserved DxxG motif can facilitate a conformational change that promotes the active conformation. To explore the role of the interaction between DxxG and the conserved loop 6 inside the β-barrel, we made point mutants in the D224-S226-R460 interaction network. Mutations to glycine do not lower the rate of CdiA secretion, indicating no essential role for these residues in producing an active CdiB conformation and/or substrate interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). However, the CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> structure predicts that mutation of S226 to glutamate would allow formation of a salt bridge with R460, further stabilizing the DxxG-L6 network. In fact, S226E delays secretion and results in lower amounts of CdiA secreted over time. Combining S226E with R460G or with the H1-linker deletion (S226E<sup>ΔH1ΔLink</sup>) improves secretion and restores CdiA levels to near wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and C</xref>). These results show that interactions between DxxG and loop 6 affect CdiA secretion and that flexibility in this region is essential.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Link between DxxG conformation and position of H1 helix</title><p>The main conformational differences observed between CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> are at the β1–β16 interface at the DxxG motif, and inside the barrel with H1. Based on structural analysis of CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>, the rearrangement of loop 1 created by DxxG forms a network of interactions between loop 1, H1, and loop 6 (Q214-R10-K440-N211; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, in the FhaC structure, there is a similar network of interactions between β1, H1, and L6, where R17 from H1 interacts with the conserved aspartate from DxxG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In both CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> and FhaC structures, the inward tilting of DxxG in β1 promotes the rearrangement of loop 1 and loop 2 while presenting a new interaction surface for H1. However, due to the weak sequence conservation of H1 in TpsB transporters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), it is difficult to predict whether particular residues either stabilize the helix in the barrel pore or induce its exit in the active conformation. Since the position of H1 in our CdiB structures vary, we wanted to understand whether β1–β16 and DxxG remain flexible. Using molecular dynamics, we ran three 500-ns equilibrium simulations of each CdiB structure in a species-specific outer membrane (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>). Although the position of H1 remains stable in the β-barrel lumen, we observed rupture of several H-bonds between β1 and β16 in the CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> simulations. Part of the DxxG motif can convert from a β-strand to a loop, whereas the β1–β16 interface can fluctuate from a short to a long β-sheet affecting the size of the β16-β1-β2-β3 sheet. During the simulations we observe that water molecules penetrate into the membrane slightly to keep the DxxG motif solvated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This environment may facilitate the interconversion of secondary structure. In comparison, during CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> simulations, the DxxG motif tilts inward, toward the lumen, and the CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> conformation is much more stable, with no H-bond disruption detected between β1 and β16. This result shows that DxxG can exist in two different conformational states: fully folded as a β-strand or in a more flexible, extended conformation. The equilibrium simulations demonstrate that CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> interconverts between the two conformations, while CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> stabilizes only the unfolded conformation. However, the importance of these structural differences to CdiA secretion remains to be determined.</p><media id="video3" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-58100-video3.mp4"><label>Video 3.</label><caption><title>Equilibrium simulation of CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>.</title><p>500 ns equilibrium simulations of three CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> (light teal) and three CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> (pale yellow) molecules.

To understand these conformational changes, we induced the exit of H1 by <underline>s</underline>teered <underline>m</underline>olecular <underline>d</underline>ynamics (SMD) to measure the force needed to extract it from the pore and observe its exit path (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sotomayor and Schulten, 2007</xref>). H1 was pulled in the direction of the periplasm at a constant speed of 0.29 Å/ns over 150–200 ns. In these experiments, we wanted to mimic a hypothetical periplasmic force that could cause the helix to exit the pore as might be expected when substrate is present and/or when large conformational changes in the linker and POTRA domains occur. During the simulations, H1 is free to move or rotate as force is applied to the center of mass of the helix. We tracked the position of H1 and measured the force required. We also used the SMD trajectories to seed potential of mean force (PMF) calculations to determine the free energy required to extract H1 from CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> β-barrels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugita et al., 2000</xref>). Since the exit pathway of H1 is not known, we ran four independent simulations (two per species) to assess the role of sampling during SMD simulations and PMF calculations. In the case of CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>, both independently determined PMF profiles show a continuous rise in energy as the helix is extracted from the barrel. With large energetic barriers measured at 90kcal/mol and 32kcal/mol, respectively, the exit of H1 appears to be energetically expensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, the first PMF determined for H1 extraction from CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> suggests 35 kcal/mol is required to extract H1. However, the second run for CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> found a significantly lower energy path on a similar time scale as the other PMF calculations (35–60 ns/window, or 1.7–2.6 μs in total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, we extended this PMF calculation to 235 ns/window (10.1 μs in total). From this PMF, we discovered a new minimum, one even lower in energy than the crystal structure minimum, at a point of intermediate extraction. In this PMF, the second minimum is separated from the crystal-structure conformation by 7.5 kcal/mol and a barrier of 13 kcal/mol; the fully extracted state is 7.5 kcal/mol higher than the second minimum and almost identical to the crystal-structure conformation. The existence of an intermediate state during helix extraction from the barrel is supported by earlier experimental data where Pulsed-electron double-resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy revealed distinct peaks in the distance distribution on a related two-partner-secretion transporter, FhaC, even in the absence of any substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guérin et al., 2014</xref>). We note that for computational efficiency, the POTRA domains were not present in the PMF calculations; along with the substrate, they may shift the relative energies of the fully embedded, partially embedded, and fully extracted H1 conformations. Also, the different PMFs obtained for different starting conditions illustrates the systematic uncertainty present in these calculations when run for moderate lengths (1–2 μs in total), complicated further by the unknown end-state structure.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>PMF of the extraction of H1 from the CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> β-barrel.</title><p>Plot of the potential of mean force (PMF) measured as a function of the distance between the centers-of-mass of the α-helix H1 and β-barrel of CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>.

Genome databases have reported hundreds of TpsA proteins that come in different sizes and domain organizations, where CdiA toxins represent a special subgroup. An increasing number of studies have reported multifunctional roles for CdiA proteins, apparently independent of toxin activity. CdiA promotes adhesion on epithelial cells in <italic>A. baumannii,</italic> plays a major role in intracellular survival and intracellular escape in <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic>, increases the virulence of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in infection models, and controls biofilm establishment in human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Melvin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mercy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pérez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Roussin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Talà et al., 2008</xref>). Both CDI systems investigated in our study have been shown to be constitutively active, and a secretome analysis of <italic>Acinetobacter spp.</italic> revealed that CdiA is one of the most abundantly secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harding et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>During the secretion cycle, the TpsB β-barrel must adopt multiple conformational states favoring ejection of the N-terminal helix H1, entry and movement of substrate into the β-barrel lumen, folding of substrate in the extracellular space and then re-entry of H1 into the lumen. All steps happen in an environment where no hydrolysable energy or electrochemical gradient sources are available to power conformational changes. The limited space inside the β-barrel lumen and the multiple tertiary interactions with H1 increase the energetic barrier needed to eject the internal α-helix. As a result, additional conformational changes are likely required to obtain the active conformation, such as potential rearrangement of the β-barrel itself. These changes may be induced by the presence of the substrate CdiA, the binding of which to the POTRA domains could provide the additional 7.5 kcal/mol necessary to fully extract the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The flexibility of the β1–β16 interface mediated by the DxxG motif plays an essential role in the transport mechanism, where conformational changes in loop 1 display different interacting surfaces for H1 and possibly for the toxin substrate. At the β1–β16 interface, sidechains from the conserved loop 6 interact with the DxxG motif, helping to stabilize different conformations. Our structures also reveal two different conformations for loop 2 that affect CdiA secretion and H1 ejection. Similar results have been observed for FhaC, where deletion of this loop does not affect the active conformation, whereas insertion of several residues reduces the channel conductance and prevents substrate secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Méli et al., 2006</xref>). These results suggest a common and conserved role of loop 2 in the TpsB transporter family, where the inward state can stabilize the resting conformation, and the outward state facilitate the active conformation.</p><p>H1 and the DxxG motif are both present in CdiB/TpsB transporters, but absent in BamA/TamA proteins. We hypothesize that they contribute to unidirectional secretion where the lumen of the β-barrel is accessible or inaccessible at different stages of the secretion cycle. The position of loop 6 and interactions with β13 are conserved in all Omp85 proteins, suggesting a common function. In addition to possibly interacting with the substrate upon entering the β-barrel lumen, our results suggest that loop 6 can also stabilize different conformational states of the β-barrel at the β1–β16 interface.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and purification of CdiB proteins</title><p>cdiB<sup>Ab</sup> from <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain ACICU (locus tag ACICU_01912, protein id WP_000956371) and cdiB<sup>Ec</sup> from <italic>E. coli</italic> strain EC93 (locus DQ100454, protein id AAZ57197.1) were codon-optimized, synthesized (Genscript) and cloned using ligation- independent cloning into pET9 vector, a derivative of pET20b (EMD Millipore).

A total of 43–50 windows were used, covering a range from +2 to −40 Å (positive values are on the extracellular side and negative values on the periplasmic side compared to the crystal structure at 0 Å). For the four PMF calculations (two for CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> and two for CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>), we ran 35–235 ns/window (1.7–10.1 μs per PMF). Exchange rates between the windows were between 0.1 and 0.5.

To improve sampling in this region, we ran 16 additional windows, spaced every 0.5 Å, with a larger restraint for 10 ns each. While these windows helped with WHAM, it should be noted that they do not benefit from accelerated convergence intrinsic to REUS. Bootstrap error estimates were calculated using WHAM.

To relate structure to function, the authors developed a functional assay and validated the role of the observed conformational change in the transport mechanism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural insight into toxin secretion by contact dependent growth inhibition transporters&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers, including Merritt Maduke as the Reviewing Editors, Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Dukas Jurenas (Reviewer #3); Trevor Moraes (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that if it is not feasible to do the experiments that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors report their findings on a type Vb two-partner secretion system, represented by CdIA and CdIB proteins from <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. In this system, outer membrane protein CdIB is responsible for secretion of its substrate protein CdIA from periplasm to the extracellular environment, which then is delivered to a cell of a competing microbe, triggering its toxic effects on that cell. Thus, this system acts to inhibit growth of competing bacteria. Here, the structures of two CdiB transporters are presented. Previously, only one TpsB structure had been determined. The two new structures adopt two different conformations, one overlapping with that of the previous structure, and one new conformation involved a repositioning of a DxxG motif that is unique to the TpsB transporters. The writing in this manuscript is excellent; the Introduction clearly set up the background, original discovery of contact dependent inhibition, and the known biochemical/structural information about the type Vb secretion system. To test the functional relevance of predicted conformational change, the authors developed a secretion assay that measures secreted CdiA protein by Western blot, and they tested predictions via cross-linking, complementarity, and mutational analysis. The authors additionally perform MD simulations to evaluate energetics of removal of the H1 helix from the pore. The simulations support the main thrust of the paper, but there are major concerns that must be addressed. In summary, this manuscript presents the first structures of CdiB transporters, identifies conformational change in a critical structure motif, confirms the functional relevance of the observed conformational change, and uses MD simulations to lay groundwork for future experimental analysis of CdiB transport mechanism. Going forward, we look forward to follow-up work such as structures with bound substrates/substrate peptides, structures of mutants, and experimental (e.g. EPR/DEER) results on CdiB conformational dynamics. Overall, once issues with the MD simulations are addressed, the results presented in this manuscript will be of broad interest to scientists studying mechanisms of membrane proteins.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>1) In Figure 6B, the authors show that the GGAG mutant increases apparent activity, which is ostensibly consistent with their model. However, it is feasible that the increase in CdiB(Ab) secretion is due to increased cell lysis (as occurs with the Ec homolog, Figure 4A) rather than to increased secretion activity. Therefore, it is important to show a control for this experiment. If an experiment is not possible at this time, then the paper should be revised to specify the caveat.</p><p>2) Figure 5B would benefit from having a WT CdIB protein as control (as was done in Figure 6A). Also, the statement that &quot;CdiBAb was detected in the pellet after 20 minutes and remained at a constant level over the 100-minute time course, in the presence or absence of TCEP&quot; does not seem correct, as the band intensity increased from 20min to 60min. Please correct this statement and if possible shown densitometry analysis on the bands to better quantify and describe the observed phenomenon.</p><p>Simulations:</p><p>The computational expert who reviewed the manuscript provided specific comments that we agree are essential to address. The reviewer's comments are as follows:</p><p>– Regarding the suggestion in subsection “Structural differences in helix H1” these two structures demonstrate mobility of the helix. How can we be certain that this difference in position is not a transporter dependent difference? This is exactly where the simulations could really help support this argument.</p><p>– Do the authors really see the CdiBAb simulation interconvert between the two beta1 configurations as stated in subsection “Link between DxxG conformation and position of H1 helix”, or do they only see one direction (unravelling)? I can't tell from the videos because it is too small. I would really like to see this analysis and any follow up, because while the removal of the helix in Figure 7 is very difficult to accurately capture, these changes are doable. Is there a lipid that plays a role in this happening? The authors do three simulations of each structure, is the lipid placement the same in each case or does that get reinitialized too?</p><p>– I want to give my general impressions of the helix removal simulations. I like that the authors used both umbrella sampling and SMD, but I must say that given the very large energies (and they may actually be very large) and significant contact between the helix and the barrel, I am completely unconvinced by this analysis as it stands. In agreement with the authors, I also worry about a number of things: the reaction coordinate, potential protein conformational changes in the barrel and loops, the action of other elements from the periplasm or extracellular spaces, and most importantly sampling. I am concerned that with a few microseconds of enhanced sampling, you are not going to answer this question adequately, and you may arrive at completely wrong conclusions. For instance, I am left with the impression that the authors believe that the helix unravels to exit, and while it may undergo conformational changes, I don't think it is going to look like your SMD where the entire thing is unravelled in the aqueous environment. My first reason to not think this is the case are the two structures – we see the helix move quite a bit, but it is a well-formed helix in both cases. Moreover, if you run the helix through DISOPRED, is there reason to think that it is marginally stable as an α-helix?</p><p>– Personally, I would really love to see a very careful PMF carried out between the two states that you currently have. Create a homology model of one structure using a template of the other, where needed, or do some other kind of targeting, and then really sample the move from one to the other. This alone would be really hard, and might take tens of microseconds, if not more, to get a converged data set, but there are some really good features of this approach:</p><p>– it is much more tractable,</p><p>– you have end points that you believe, and</p><p>– you will learn a lot about what it takes to move the helix in this barrel and how the helix and rest of the protein have to adapt to do it.</p><p>– With my 2 cents given, I am not opposed to including the current PMF and SMD (although, I wouldn't do it personally), but I really would like to see more simulations to feel better that you have reached some kind of convergence. This is outlined below. Moreover, I would include these as supplemental figures where I focused more on the very general big picture ideas of overall energies supporting one reaction coordinate/transformation over another, etc. But that is my opinion, and I don't want to tell you how to write your own paper (ok, I gave another 2 cents here).</p><p>PMF calculations</p><p>– How were the actual snapshots generated in the 50 windows? Did you use rigid rotation, or did you seed 1 window from the last? If you used rigid rotation/translation, what were the sterics like prior to each run? Did you minimize, etc? I think it would be most ideal to carry these windows out sequentially, where you start in the X-ray structure state, carry out a 20 ns simulation under restraints, and then pick back through the simulation to identify the snapshot that moved the farthest along your reaction coordinate to seed the next step.</p><p>– Figure 7C should have bootstrap error estimates, in my opinion. If it can't be done in Alan Grossfield's implementation (I can't remember) there are some Gromacs tools to do this and mBAR can do it too. It is important to down sample your data here in each bin, however, so that you don't use correlated snapshots. Given the complexity and size of this system, this is going to be very important to see. I would especially like to see in a reply the side by side comparisons of the figures here with any recalculated taking into account correlations.</p><p>– As far as I can tell, it looks like each PMF is made up of about 750-1,000 ns of aggregate data. While there are important questions about how this is seeded and the progress coordinate used, I would at least like to see 1 or 2 more of these PMF profiles for each of the two conditions generated using completely independent simulations to assess the role of sampling in the computed PMF values.</p><p>SMD simulations</p><p>– Two independent runs per each condition (each about 150-200 ns), but only 1 profile is plotted for each in Figure 7A and B. Did you plot the average of the two? Given the small amount of time used to generate these, I would certainly compute 3-5 more SMD runs per condition and make a plot with all of the runs so that we can assess the role of stochasticity and non-equilibrium pulling versus the differences in the protein and or mutation in the protein.</p><p>– Finally, do you see any correspondence between the structural conformations that come out of your PMF and the SMD? You might have mentioned this, but I didn't catch it. This kind of analysis would again make me feel better about the convergence, but since you don't seem to favor the helix exit as a helix, maybe you don't want to get into that.</p><p>The statistics on the simulations is inadequate.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for re-submitting your article &quot;Structural insight into toxin secretion by contact dependent growth inhibition transporters&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have observed this previously for TonB-dependent transporters, for which recent AFM work has shown that unfolding of the plug domain is part of the opening process (Hickman et al., Gating of TonB-dependent transporters by substrate-specific forced remodeling. Nat. Comm. 2017). We ran each H1 segment through DISOPRED as recommended and both are strongly predicted to be helical. In light of this, and the new PMF, we removed the SMD simulations that showed unfolding of H1. The new CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> PMF has been added as Figure 7 (main figure). The new data are discussed in in subsection “Extraction of helix H1 from β-barrel lumen”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Personally, I would really love to see a very careful PMF carried out between the two states that you currently have.

While we carefully considered doing a PMF, we ultimately decided it against it, primarily because the computational expense would be significant. Additionally, there was no obvious reaction coordinate, and using an approach like the string method, for example, would be even more expensive. As a compromise, we ran targeted MD to generate two new structures: (1) CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> with its H1 in the position of that from CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> and (2) CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> with its H1 in the position of that from CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>. TMD was run for 30 ns, followed by 30 ns of H1 restrained to its new position, and then 120 ns of free equilibration. We present the RMSD for H1 compared to its original position and to the new one. We find that H1 in the two systems are stable in their new positions, suggesting that one orientation is not strictly favored over the other for either system.

The closest frame of the SMD trajectory within 0.15 Å of the target window center was selected to seed the REUS calculations. Some initial fraction of the REUS trajectory was then treated as equilibration (as much as 70 ns in the case of the longest one), and only data from after this point was used to determine the PMF. While not identical to the procedure suggested by the reviewer, it is similar. Furthermore, the additional PMF for each system was seeded from one of the new SMD simulations (described below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7C should have bootstrap error estimates, in my opinion.

To utilize this feature, we first ran additional highly restrained 2-ns simulations for each window with inputs taken from the REUS runs with the collective variable value output every time step. This data were then used along with the code ACFCalculator from Chris Rowley (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/RowleyGroup/ACFCalculator">https://github.com/RowleyGroup/ACFCalculator</ext-link>) to determine the autocorrelation function (ACF). The correlation time was taken as the integration of the normalized ACF, cut-off when it first reaches zero. Correlation times were then plotted for all windows and a three-point running average was taken to smooth it; this is following the procedure recommended for Gromacs in the g_wham source paper, Hub et al., 2010. Correlation times ranged from 20 ps to 140 ps. PMFs are now plotted with +/- 1 s.d. as determined by the bootstrap error analysis in WHAM.</p><p>Even in our first submission, trajectory data input to WHAM was sampled only every 20 ps, suggesting it is not significantly oversampled. Nonetheless, as WHAM does not use correlation times for the free-energy calculation, only the error analysis, we downsampled our data by a factor of 10 and recomputed the PMF from the second run of CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>. The difference between the two PMFs is at most 0.2 kcal/mol, and on average is 0.03 kcal/mol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As far as I can tell, it looks like each PMF is made up of about 750-1,000 ns of aggregate data.

We also extended the two pre-existing REUS runs to 40 ns/window (CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>; 2000 ns total) and 35 ns/window (CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>; 1680 ns total).</p><p>In the case of CdiB<sup>Ab</sup>, the extended run only increased the value of the PMF at all points, peaking at ~90 kcal/mol instead of 70 kcal/mol originally. The second run of CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> was lower at ~32 kcal/mol upon exit of the helix from the barrel (60 ns/window; 2640 ns total).</p><p>In the case of CdiB<sup>Ec</sup>, the results were more interesting. While extending the first run to 40 ns/window did little to change the PMF (&lt; 2 kcal/mol difference on average), the second run was not nearly as high initially and flattened rather than continued rising as the helix was extracted from the barrel. To investigate this further, the REUS run was continued significantly longer, finally terminating at 235 ns/window (10.1 μs total), an order-of-magnitude more than previously run, when the change in successive 5 ns/window runs was minimal. From this PMF, we discovered a new minimum, one even lower in energy than the crystal structure minimum, at a point of intermediate extraction. The existence of an intermediate state during helix extraction from the barrel rationalizes earlier experimental data from one of us. In Guérin et al., 2014, pulsed-electron double-resonance spectroscopy (PELDOR) on a related two-partner-secretion protein, FhaC, revealed two distinct peaks in the distance distribution, even absent any substrate (see the first and third distance distributions in Figure 3 from Guérin et al., 2014).</p><p>In our PMF, the second minimum is separated from the crystal-structure conformation by ~7.5 kcal/mol and a barrier of ~13 kcal/mol; the fully extracted state is 8 kcal/mol higher than the second minimum and 1 kcal/mol higher than the crystal-structure conformation. We note, however, that these numbers will likely be shifted by the presence of the two POTRA domains, which were not included in these PMF calculations. Despite this approximation, the existence of an intermediate state, similar to that observed in the PELDOR distance distributions for the resting state of FhaC, gives us confidence that the second-run PMF of CdiB<sup>Ec</sup> is most representative of the real extraction pathway for the helix. Thus, we have replaced Figure 7 in the paper with this PMF alone and relegated the other three to SI for completeness.</p><p>The new PMF have been added in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 2A. The new data are discussed in subsection “Extraction of helix H1 from β-barrel lumen”; and methods has been added in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>SMD simulations</p><p>– Two independent runs per each condition (each about 150-200 ns), but only 1 profile is plotted for each in Figure 7A and B.

We have now deleted the former. SMD are now presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the small amount of time used to generate these, I would certainly compute 3-5 more SMD runs per condition and make a plot with all of the runs so that we can assess the role of stochasticity and non-equilibrium pulling versus the differences in the protein and or mutation in the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated each SMD twice, giving three in total. While some of the runs look roughly similar to one another, others show marked differences between them, e.g., AB wt and AB S-S bond. Inspection of the trajectories indicates that the cause is the formation of an ion-bridged interaction between two acidic residues, namely E4 on H1 and D224, D261, or E469 in the CdiB<sup>Ab</sup> variants. D261 is removed in the ΔL2 mutant, although we still see an ion-bridged interaction between E4 and E469 in one out of three trajectories. We have now taken all SMD plots from the main text figures and moved them to Figure 7—figure supplement 2B. Example ion-bridged interactions are now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Finally, do you see any correspondence between the structural conformations that come out of your PMF and the SMD? You might have mentioned this, but I didn't catch it. This kind of analysis would again make me feel better about the convergence, but since you don't seem to favor the helix exit as a helix, maybe you don't want to get into that.</p><p>The statistics on the simulations is inadequate.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, at this point, we think such a comparison would not be helpful. While we think the significantly improved PMF is a more realistic version of extraction of H1, the SMD simulations are exposing potential sticking points, namely the ion-bridged interactions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>It is great to see that PMF profile was extended and additional simulations run. The new PMF is very different from the previous ones. We would have liked to see more of an attempt to rationalize the distances and compare with this propertied structure. Are they at all close in a semiquantitative manner? For future studies, cross linking from this intermediate state would be ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the comparison should ideally be quantitative. However, we decided that there are too many uncertainties on both the experimental and simulation sides to make even a semi-quantitative comparison. These uncertainties include (1) difference in proteins (FhaC in Guerin et al., 2014 and CdiB here), (2) presence of spin labels experimentally, which will notably affect the distances, (3) inability of the experiments to measure larger distances than what was presented (see Figure 4 in Guerin et al., 2014), and (4) lack of POTRA domains in the PMF calculations. Nonetheless, at least the directions of the changes are in agreement. Specifically, the distance between the extracellular side of the helix is farther from the extracellular loops and closer to the periplasmic loops in the intermediate states identified in both the experiments and the PMF.</p><p>To avoid overstating our claim, we have modified the text as follows:</p><p>“The existence of an intermediate state during helix extraction from the barrel is supported by earlier experimental data where Pulsed-electron double-resonance (PELDOR) spectroscopy revealed distinct peaks in the distance distribution on a related two-partner-secretion transporter, FhaC, even in the absence of any substrate (Guérin et al., 2014).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the current study, the authors should qualify their PMF in the final text and include a statement noting that they got very different results for the same starting conditions, which highlights the high degree of uncertainty in these kinds of calculations, especially when the end point structures are not known.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this suggestion, we have added a qualifying sentence:</p><p>“We note that for computational efficiency, the POTRA domains were not present in the PMF calculations; along with the substrate, they may shift the relative energies of the fully embedded, partially embedded, and fully extracted H1 conformations. Also, the different PMFs obtained for different starting conditions illustrates the systematic uncertainty present in these calculations when run for moderate lengths (1-2 μs in total), complicated further by the unknown end-state structure.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
