However, the presence and epidemiological relevance of genetic exchange in <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, the agent of Chagas disease, has been controversial and debated for many years. Field studies have identified both predominantly clonal and sexually recombining natural populations. Two of six natural <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lineages (TcV and TcVI) show hybrid mosaicism, using analysis of single-gene locus markers. The formation of hybrid strains in vitro has been achieved and this provides a framework to study the mechanisms and adaptive significance of genetic exchange. Using whole genome sequencing of a set of experimental hybrids strains, we have confirmed that hybrid formation initially results in tetraploid parasites. The hybrid progeny showed novel mutations that were not attributable to either (diploid) parent showing an increase in amino acid changes. In long-term culture, up to 800 generations, there was a variable but gradual erosion of progeny genomes towards triploidy, yet retention of elevated copy number was observed at several core housekeeping loci. Our findings indicate hybrid formation by fusion of diploid <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, followed by sporadic genome erosion, but with substantial potential for adaptive evolution, as has been described as a genetic feature of other organisms, such as some fungi.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic></kwd><kwd>genetic exchange</kwd><kwd>hybrid formation</kwd><kwd>comparative genomics</kwd><kwd>microevolution</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matos</surname><given-names>Gabriel Machado</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Björn</given-names></name><name><surname>Miles</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>CAPES</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Student Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Björn</given-names></name><name><surname>Grisard</surname><given-names>Edmundo C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unique mechanisms of genetic exchange in the important protozoan pathogen <italic>Trypanosome cruzi</italic> were characterized in detail using genome analyses of hybrid clones at different time points, showing initial tetraploids followed by genome erosion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> is a kinetoplastid protozoan and the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, one of the neglected and highest impact parasitic infections in the Americas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pérez-Molina and Molina, 2018</xref>). Chagas disease is estimated to cause great loss in both health-care costs and disability-adjusted life years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Human migration and specific modes of transmission than the canonical vector-based have led to a spreading beyond its natural geographical boundaries, becoming a global issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pérez-Molina and Molina, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bern, 2015</xref>). <italic>T. cruzi</italic> transmission is a zoonosis maintained by numerous species of triatomine insects and different species of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansen et al., 2018</xref>). This parasite has a complex life cycle, where transmission to humans occurs most frequently by contamination with infected feces from triatomine vectors. Other routes of human infection include congenital, oral (mainly consumption of raw contaminated foods), and contaminated transplant tissues and blood products. To evade the immune responses, the parasite displays a vast, complex repertoire of surface proteins involved in cell invasion and pathogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Pablos and Osuna, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pech-Canul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talavera-López et al., 2021</xref>). The regions of the genome coding for these molecules are composed of highly repetitive sequences, with hundreds to thousands of members of each family, as well as substantial numbers of transposable elements, microsatellite, and tandem repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talavera-López et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El-Sayed et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The reproductive mode of these parasitic protozoans has been widely debated, and both preponderate clonal evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tibayrenc and Ayala, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tibayrenc and Ayala, 2013</xref>) and sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ramírez and Llewellyn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwabl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inbar et al., 2019</xref>) have been proposed. Many eukaryotic pathogens have essentially clonal population structures while also having non-obligate sexual cycles, which may enable them to adapt to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heitman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steensels et al., 2021</xref>). In trypanosomatids, the most well-studied mating system is that of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, for which a meiotic process is well supported based on the identification of a haploid parasite stage in the vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peacock et al., 2014</xref>) and on the patterns of allele inheritance and recombination observed in experimental hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacLeod et al., 2005</xref>).

Genotyping analysis indicates that TcV and TcVI are recent, natural inter-lineage hybrids of TcII and TcIII, showing that recombination events have shaped the evolution of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwabl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Messenger and Miles, 2015</xref>). In addition to natural evidence of hybridization, the formation of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hybrids in vitro was also described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaunt et al., 2003</xref>). Genetic marker analyses of hybrid strains showed multi-allelic (non-Mendelian) inheritance of microsatellite alleles and an elevated DNA content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaunt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>). The hybridization events in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> were proposed to occur via a parasexual mechanism, similar to those observed in certain fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steensels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaunt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett, 2015</xref>). While certain aspects of the molecular mechanisms involved in this process have been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves et al., 2018</xref>), the contribution of each parental strain in hybrid genomes, as well as the mechanisms and adaptive significance of the hybridization phenomenon, are not well understood.</p><p>Experimental evolution approaches in defined environments have been widely used to study the evolution of model organisms (such as bacteria, yeast, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> sp.)

To investigate the effects of clonal reproduction and genetic exchange on the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genome at the microevolutionary scale, we selected two closely related TcI strains (P1, P2) and three hybrid clones that were generated from a P1 × P2 cross (1C2, 1D12, 2C1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaunt et al., 2003</xref>).

The two parents and three hybrids were included in an in vitro evolution experiment in which they were continuously cultured as epimastigote forms for 5 years, equivalent to approximately 800 generations of replication by binary fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the end of the experiment, we re-cloned the parasite lines and selected three clones per line for analysis. During this microevolution experiment, we monitored the DNA content of each parasite line at approximately 200-generation intervals to check for evidence of large-scale structural genomic changes. We observed that the DNA content of the two parental lines remained approximately constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). At the start of the experiment, the total DNA content of the hybrid clones was approximately 70% greater than the parentals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>), which equated to slightly below expectations for a tetraploid parasite with one kinetoplast (containing mitochondrial DNA), that is, a 4n1k (4C) genome size. Over the course of the microevolution experiment, in contrast to P1 and P2, we found that the DNA content of the hybrids became progressively lower over time, up to a maximum decrease of 22.5% by generation 800. By extrapolation from the estimated genome sizes of P1 (94.5 Mb) and P2 (92.5 Mb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>), these data indicate genome erosion in the hybrids occurred at an average rate of 23 kb per generation. There were, however, notable differences in genome erosion patterns between the three hybrid lines. Hybrid 2C1 showed gradual genome erosion at each time point, with all three 800 generation evolved clones approximating a 3C genome size. Hybrid 1C2 showed a more intermittent pattern – most of the erosion occurred between 0–200 and 400–600 generations, reaching a 3C genome size, but interestingly, 2 of the 800 generation clones gained ~10% more DNA than at t=600. Lastly, hybrid 1D12 had an initial 9% loss between t=0 and t=200, but was then quite stable over time between 3C and 4C.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vitro microevolution of <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> <italic>cruzi</italic> hybrids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of experimental design.

Specifically, at many loci the hybrids inherited more than one allele per parent. We found that three of the nine evolved hybrid clones had lost at least one microsatellite allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data indicated that the enlarged genomes of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hybrids were subject to erosion over an extended period of clonal replication.

Despite high sequence coverage and the linking information provided by additional long insert size libraries, the final assemblies only reconstructed 77.1% and 74.8% of the P1 and P2 genomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), due to the high repeat content of the genomes as also observed to other previously sequenced <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genomes.

Reads from the parental strains were mapped to the reference TcI-Sylvio X10/1 genome, followed by SNP calling and a comparative analysis. The resultant genome-wide average SNP density was 9.28 and 3.71 SNP/kb for P1 and P2, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Most SNPs were located within repetitive regions, particularly in areas containing surface molecule gene family members, which can be related to gene expansion in these regions. Indeed, copy number variation (CNV) analysis showed that P1 displays these tandem-repeated and surface molecule-coding regions expanded in comparison to P2. To avoid the influence of low mapping quality in repeated regions, we applied a strict mapping quality filter, removing any SNP in regions with mapping quality below 50. SNP density in the retained high-quality regions was 2.84 and 2.11 SNPs/kb for P1 and P2, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), and a total of 68,616 and 34,843 SNPs exclusive for each parental strain were catalogued for use in the analysis of the hybrid strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The average SNP density in these regions was higher in all hybrids than in parental strains: 3.48 SNP/kb for 1C2-0, 3.29 SNP/kb for 1D12-0, and 3.49 SNP/kb for 2C1-0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), partially due to the presence of alleles from both parental strains. In addition to the SNPs clearly inherited from each parental strain, additional SNPs common to all hybrids and SNPs exclusive to each hybrid clone were identified in both coding and non-coding regions, revealing sample-specific patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Some SNPs that were common to all hybrid strains were not detected in the parental genomes, mainly consisting in mutations that occurred in culture during the approximately 70 generations of parent parasite growth before the cross was set up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). They are unlikely to be attributable to growth of a common progenitor hybrid prior to the cloning step because of differential inheritance of kDNA in 1D12 vs. 2C1 and 1C2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaunt et al., 2003</xref>), which suggests they are derived from at least two independent hybridization events. Interestingly, de novo mutations common to all hybrids and exclusive to each hybrid clone were predicted to generate a higher percentage of non-synonymous changes in comparison to the mutations inherited from the parental strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Indeed, the ratio of non-synonymous changes per synonymous changes was higher in the de novo mutations common to all hybrids (2.36 for 1C2-0, 2.25 for 1D12-0, and 2.19 for 2C1-0), and exclusive to each hybrid clone (2.40 for 1C2-0, 2.23 for 1D12-0, and 2.37 for 2C1-0) than in those inherited from the parental strains (1.41 for 1C2-0, 1.40 for 1D12-0, and 1.42 for 2C1-0) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the impact of these mutations on the variable regions of the genome, we compared the ratio of surface protein-coding genes per non-surface protein-coding genes.

An increase or decrease in the mean RDC of a chromosome when compared to the overall genome coverage is an indicator of a gain or loss of chromosomal sequences, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reis-Cunha and Bartholomeu, 2019</xref>). If the ratio between the median chromosome coverage and the median genome coverage is approximately one, the chromosome has the same copy number as the genome, while fluctuations in this ratio indicate aneuploidies. Here, the RDC analysis was based on the ratio between the mean coverage of predicted single-copy genes in each chromosome and the mean coverage of all single-copy genes in the genome as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reis-Cunha et al., 2015</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In this CCNV estimation, values of ‘0.5’, ‘1’, and ‘2’ denote that the chromosome has, respectively, ‘0.5’, ‘1’, or ‘2’ copies per haploid genome. This means that, if the studied genome is mainly diploid, a value of ‘1’ in this estimation represents two chromosomal copies (one per haploid genome), whereas a value of ‘1.5’ represents three copies and a value of ‘2’ represents four copies. This methodology was shown to eliminate bias caused by chromosomal repetitive content in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reis-Cunha et al., 2015</xref>), which would otherwise obscure the correct copy numbers. We were unable to estimate CCNV in chromosomes 17, 22, 30, and 47 by this methodology due to the lack of single-copy genes in these chromosomes, and therefore the chromosomal somy prediction presented for them was estimated based on the ratio between the mean RDC of each chromosome position and the mean coverage of all genome positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Aneuploidy was observed in the P2 strain, involving trisomy of chromosomes 2 and 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The RDC analysis indicated aneuploidy in chromosome 44 in the P1 strain, but due to the lack of regions with high-quality SNPs, it was not possible to confirm this in the AB analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The RDC analysis also indicated aneuploidies in chromosome 6 in both parental strains and in chromosome 31 of P1 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the AB analysis was not consistent across the entire chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which may be related to CNV in specific regions of these chromosomes rather than aneuploidy, as observed in other <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwabl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reis-Cunha et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Somy estimation based on read depth coverage (RDC) and allelic balance (AB) reveals aneuploidies in parental strains and tetrasomic hybrid clones.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Aneuploidy analysis based on RDC among all 47 chromosomes in the starting generation of parental strains (P1-0 and P2-0) and hybrids (1C2-0, 1D12-0, and 2C1-0).

In both parental strains, a peak at 50% was observed, while in the hybrids, peaks at 25% and 75% or 50% were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which is expected for diploid and tetraploid genomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reis-Cunha and Bartholomeu, 2019</xref>).

Clear patterns of somy were observed in 37 chromosomes (chromosomes 1–16, 18–19, 21, 23, 25–29, 31–33, 35–39, 41, 43, 45–46; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Due to a lack of regions containing high-quality heterozygous SNPs generating inconsistent AB, somy estimation was not reliable for chromosomes 17, 20, 22, 24, 30, 34, 40, 42, 44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). Based on our filtering criteria, all SNPs called in chromosome 47 were removed from further analysis, therefore no AB plot is presented for this chromosome. AB analysis shown to be reliable for estimating aneuploidy in chromosomes with longer core regions that contain housekeeping genes and other genes that are conserved between kinetoplastids, while the presence of large tandemly repeated regions and surface protein-coding gene families made read mapping, and thus copy number estimation difficult for some chromosomes. High resolution representations of the CCNV analysis are shown for six chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Chromosomes 2, 7, and 13 have longer tandem repeated regions and coding sequences for surface proteins (percentage of surface protein-coding genes: chr2 7.26%, chr7 9.55%, chr13 8.38%), while chromosomes 18, 21, and 37 have longer core regions (percentage of surface protein-coding genes: chr18 1.25%, chr21 1.98%, chr37 3.74%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The mapping quality in surface protein-coding sequences was often observed to drop significantly, which affected the inferred proportions of alleles in those regions, and this was found to lead to erroneous somy estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To avoid this, a strict mapping quality filter was applied, and all the allele proportions were plotted by chromosome position. Using this strategy, it was possible to identify specific regions in chromosomes that could be used to infer CCNV with high confidence. Chromosomes 2, 7, and 13 showed longer regions with diverse allele proportions, nonetheless it was still possible to identify the trisomy of chromosome 2 of P2 and tetrasomies in hybrids based on using the smaller core regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Chromosomes 18, 21, and 37 showed somy patterns that were clearly consistent with the whole genome CCNV, confirming the trisomy in chromosome 21 of P2 and tetrasomy in the hybrid clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Somy estimation per chromosome based on allele balance (AB) in starting generation confirming aneuploidies in parental strains and tetrasomic hybrid clones.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene distribution and its implication in mapping quality (MQ) and somy estimation of six representative TcI chromosomes with longer surface molecule-encoding regions (chromosomes 2, 7, and 13) and shorter encoding surface molecule-encoding regions (chromosomes 18, 21, and 37).

Whole genome ploidy estimation revealed a shrinking pattern in the hybrids, which was consistent with the prior flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Our gene enrichment analysis showed that a number of these genes were located on chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp12">Supplementary file 12</xref>), suggesting that the loss of trisomy in this chromosome could possibly have contributed to the higher number of mutations that was found in the P2 clones.

The SNP density pattern per chromosome remained similar for all samples in first generation (t=0) and after culture growth (t=800). Some chromosomes (e.g. chromosomes 5, 11, 24, and 37) display higher SNP density than the others across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). P2 evolved clone replicates had an increase in SNP density in nearly all chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The emergence of novel SNPs after culture growth resulted in most of the non-synonymous mutations. The ratio of non-synonymous per synonymous changes in novel SNPs was similar between both parental strains (P1-1: 2.26; P1-2: 2.22; P1-3: 2.38; P2-1: 2.25; P2-2: 2.22; P2-3: 2.26) and hybrid clones (1C2-1: 2.20; 1C2-2: 2.48; 1C2-3: 2.26; 1D12-1: 2.41; 1D12-2: 2.5; 1D12-3: 2.40; 2C1-1: 2.21; 2C1-2: 2.18; 2C1-3: 2.30). Interestingly, the regions of the genome with higher genetic variation in all clone isolates contain surface protein-coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). To investigate the impact of new mutations in these regions, we compared the ratio of non-synonymous mutations in surface protein-coding genes to non-synonymous mutations in other genes. This ratio was higher for the mutations that appeared in each evolved parental clone in comparison to those present in the first generation (approx. 2.5-fold higher for P1 clones and 3.5-fold higher for P2 clones; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>). Regarding the hybrid strains, a similar ratio was observed in the SNPs that appeared in each evolved hybrid clone and those exclusive to each hybrid clone present in the first generation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp13">Supplementary file 13</xref>). These results indicate that surface molecule-coding regions may mutate faster than the rest of the genome either by clonal or parasexual mechanisms, representing an important region of genomic diversification.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from whole genome sequencing analysis of this <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genetic cross have clearly demonstrated that, while the parental strains were diploid, all initial hybrid clones were essentially tetraploid. We showed that genomic variants exclusive to both parental strains were present in all hybrid clones, indicating that the tetraploid profile observed is obtained by the fusion of the two disomic parental genomes, although more complex pathways cannot be ruled out in the absence of direct observational evidence. In addition, we showed that genome erosion seems to be gradual, with sequential losses of chromosome copies rather than coordinated jumps between ploidy levels, though with some variation in erosion rates between different evolved hybrid lines. As previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaunt et al., 2003</xref>), our results confirmed that hybridization in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> happened via a parasexual mechanism rather than a canonical meiotic process. This phenomenon resembles the parasexual cycle of the pathogenic fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, which also involves diploid fusion followed by non-meiotic genome reduction back to aneuploids and diploids (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bennett, 2015</xref>). In contrast, hybridization in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and possibly in <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp. has been associated with parental strains having undergone a meiosis-like process followed by a fusion of haploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inbar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peacock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Louradour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van den Broeck et al., 2020</xref>). In this process, mainly diploid hybrids are formed, but polyploid hybrids may also be produced by the fusion between parental cells that failed to undergo meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Inbar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peacock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rogers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Louradour et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Van den Broeck et al., 2020</xref>). Despite the clear evidence of parasexual hybridization in in vitro <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hybrids, it is still not clear if a meiosis-like mechanism could also contribute to the generation of natural <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hybrids, as observed in other trypanosomatids. Further work will be required to establish whether there is a single common mechanism or several alternative modes of hybridization.</p><p>Our microevolution experiment has shown that <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genomes are highly responsive to the environmental conditions. The CNV analysis showed that while surface gene numbers were being eroded after culture growth, genes involved in cell metabolism, cell division, and ion transport were being expanded. This genome plasticity was not only observed at the level of gene CNV, but also at the chromosome level. The parental strains displayed distinct aneuploidies before and after culture, and despite the overall pattern of genome erosion, some chromosomes remained tetrasomic in the hybrid strains. Indeed, aneuploidies have been widely reported in natural <italic>T. cruzi</italic> populations, and although CCNV varies among and within DTUs, it seems constant within a given population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwabl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reis-Cunha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reis-Cunha et al., 2018</xref>). While in many multicellular organisms, aneuploidy is known to have severe consequences, in trypanosomatids it represents an important mechanism for rapidly overcoming environmental diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reis-Cunha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prieto Barja et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussotti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grünebast and Clos, 2020</xref>). Aneuploidy is reversed quickly once the benefits of an extra chromosome expire, as observed in P2 aneuploidies in chromosomes 2 and 21. In addition, trypanosomatids may control overexpression caused by additional gene copies, at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dumetz, 2017</xref>). We found aneuploidy in chromosome 37 in all parental and hybrid clones after culture growth, suggesting a benefit to parasite fitness in culture. As observed in <italic>Leishmania</italic> spp.<italic>,</italic> the fixation of genetic alterations is the result of positive selection processes that adapt parasite fitness to a given ecology or transmission cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussotti et al., 2018</xref>). We can speculate that in natural <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hybrids, distinct CCNV and genome erosion patterns would be observed due to specific environmental selective pressure with the expansion of genes involved in host-parasite interactions.</p><p>Genome variant analyses showed that an increase in genetic sequence diversity was present after hybridization. Hybridization events are associated with a burst of novel mutations and a myriad of genomic rearrangements (e.g. transpositions, genome size changes, chromosomal rearrangements) in distinct eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steensels et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Samarasinghe et al., 2020</xref>). Our results indicate that the process of <italic>T. cruzi</italic> hybrid formation included both new mutations and most likely recombination between parental chromosomes. Here, we were able to show an increase in the number of SNPs in the hybrid strains with the accumulation of amino acid substitutions. Interestingly, the numbers of new SNPs in culture showed a clear difference between the two parental strains after 800 generations, in which P2 showed a higher mutation rate. A previous study has reported that TcI strains have a mismatch repair machinery, which repairs base misincorporation and erroneous insertions and deletions during DNA recombination and replication, that is more efficient than in other DTUs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reis-Cunha et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augusto-Pinto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Machado et al., 2006</xref>). As described in <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, HUS1 was shown to be required for genome stability under non-stressed conditions and its suppression had a genome-wide mutagenic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damasceno et al., 2018</xref>). Since many of the genes coding for the HUS1-like proteins are encoded on chromosome 2, the loss of trisomy in this chromosome after culture growth could possibly be related to the increase in mutations observed in the P2 clones. In general, culture growth led to a reduction in genetic variants in nearly all evolved clones in comparison to the first generation. This reduction may be related to the loss of heterozygosity, but also to the loss of gene copies and genome erosion of surface molecules regions after culture growth. In addition, we could not identify any bias in the loss of a specific parental chromosome even in triploid hybrid clones, suggesting recombination between the parental chromosomes. As material from both parental strains has been lost during over 800 generations, it is likely that the hybrid clones would stabilize at diploidy and contain chromosomes from both parental strains, with a higher polymorphism than the parental strains. This is similar to strains from the known natural hybrid clades, TcV and TcVI. Strains from these clades have diploid genomes with high repeat content, and high levels of polymorphism in many regions, resulting from alleles from two divergent parental strains (from clades TcII and TcIII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Messenger and Miles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>). From our analyses, it thus appears that the in vitro hybrid formation presented here is highly similar to the process that generated the natural hybrids.</p><p>Our microevolution experiment has shown that surface protein-coding genes represent the regions of the genome with higher genetic diversity and more rapid evolution. Accumulations of distinct genomic signatures and amino acid substitutions were observed in both parental and hybrid clones after relatively few generations. We have previously observed that there is a higher frequency of recombination in repeat-rich regions of the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Talavera-López et al., 2021</xref>), and it is likely that this is also the case for the hybrids.</p><p>We can speculate that this is a likely explanation for variability in repeat and gene copy numbers between hybrid and non-hybrid clades in response to the distinct environmental conditions. Since these parasites were cultivated solely in culture, it is still not clear if this mechanism is related to the lack of pressure caused by the progression within triatomine bugs or by the interaction with the host immune system, or if these genomes display an intrinsic mechanism of high diversification of these regions. Recent comparative genomics of natural <italic>T. cruzi</italic> strains have shown a similar pattern, suggesting that these regions indeed evolve more rapidly than other regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>For <italic>T. cruzi</italic>, there is clear evidence for relatively recent inter-DTU hybridization between TcII and TcIII as the origin of TcV and TcVI, which are now widespread in domestic transmission cycles in southern South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Messenger and Miles, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrasco et al., 1996</xref>). Other evidence for inter-DTU genetic exchange between TcI and TcIV comes from phylogenetic incongruence between nuclear and mitochondrial (kDNA maxicircle) sequences. However, the frequency of natural genetic exchange events between lineages/clades/DTUs appears to be too low to disrupt the overall stability of the main six clades, or seven clades if the TcBat lineage is included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lewis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Messenger and Miles, 2015</xref>). The exception is the validity and position of the poorly sampled TcIV clade, which includes strains with TcI-like and/or TcIII-like features. The robustness of the other clades is likely promoted by ecological and/or geographical isolation, for example, association with distinct vector and host species. There may also be a high fitness cost for tetraploidy in the wild that is not replicated in laboratory conditions.</p><p>In summary, we confirmed that in vitro hybrid formation in <italic>T. cruzi</italic> happened in a parasexual mechanism, representing an important mechanism of genetic diversification. Tetraploid hybrids showed patterns of progressive genome erosion shaped by the environment’s selective pressure, which may explain distinct phenotypes in isolated natural hybrid populations. In addition, an increase in coding sequence diversity is observed in hybrids in comparison to the parental strains, related to both new mutations and most likely recombination events. Finally, our microevolution experiment has shown that repetitive gene families related to immune evasion evolved more rapidly than other regions of the genome, indicating an intrinsic mechanism of genetic variation of these regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasites and microevolution experiment</title><p>For routine culture, <italic>T. cruzi</italic> epimastigotes were grown axenically in supplemented RPMI as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrasco et al., 1996</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jos Van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Julius Lukes (Reviewer #1); Fernán Agüero (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors should revise their methods for SNP calling. What GATK variant caller was used? UnifiedGenotyper or HaplotypeCaller? The latter is recommended. It is also unclear which filtering criteria were used to reduce the likelihood of false-positive SNPs. Simply setting the mapping quality to a minimum of 50 is not sufficient. We recommend to have a look at the methods of Schwabl et al. 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-11771-z) where rigorous analyses were done to remove false-positive SNPs. In particular, it would be helpful to mask the reference genome based on the mappability of its own reads. This is also important for later sections in the manuscript where the authors claim increased diversity in repetitive surface molecule genes.</p><p>Editor: Also, it is not clear whether Indels were analysed at all, they appear once in the Methods and not in the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>2. Figure 1e, Table 1 and corresponding main text – We are puzzled regarding the number of SNPs that are unique to each hybrid clone and that are common to all hybrids.</p><p>First, it seems to us that the authors have done SNP calling in all strains independently, which may result in genotypes being missed because of low local coverages. Joint genotyping would mitigate such biases. We would recommend to do a joint genotyping across all parental and hybrid strains, and then only retain those SNP positions for which there is no missing data.</p><p>Second, in the main text on page 7, it is argued that these SNPs would have occurred in culture during the approximately 50 generations of growth BEFORE hybrid formation. But in the last sentence of that paragraph it is stated that these SNPs appeared after the hybridisation event. How can the authors tell whether these SNPs occurred during culture before hybridization, or whether they happened just after hybridization? The setup of the experiment should be more clearly explained: how many generations happened before hybridization, how many after, when exactly was sequencing done during this process? This is also important for later sections that claim that hybridization resulted in a burst of novel mutations.</p><p>It seems like the authors are discovering the impact of tandem repeat regions (copy number variations) on SNP discovery. Most of page 10 and Figure 3 merely describes the fact that you will have more false-positive SNPs within the repeat regions. I'm not sure why this is of interest here. Such SNP's should not have been included in the first place.</p><p>3. Why was the mapping quality in surface molecules inferior to the rest? That begs for explanation. &quot;Surface molecule genes&quot;, frequently used here, sounds somewhat weird to this reviewer. Couldn't it be rather &quot;Surface protein-coding genes&quot; or the like?</p><p>4. I understand the implications of trying to map short reads to repetitive regions. For example, PAINTS (see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7912377/) removes noisy genomic regions (large gene families) before attempting to do ploidy estimations. This seems intuitive, and this is also explained in this Ms, in light of this maybe authors can save some space by omitting text and figures that are used to discuss and show these difficulties? Maybe there is not much to gain by showing that estimating ploidies in chromosomes with low numbers of housekeeping genes is difficult. Just state that and put the data into Supplementary file?</p><p>5. Based on the results presented, I don't agree that there is gradual erosion overall across all clones.</p><p>1D12 hybrid seems to have gone through an initial loss of DNA content but then its DNA content seems to have remained stable (Figure 1D). In addition, it's genome-wide somy profile remained stable at tetrasomy (Figure 4C). Also, there also seems to be an increase in DNA content after 600 generations. Finally, microsatellite alleles are only consistently lost in hybrid 2C1, at three different loci. No loss was observed in hybrid 1D12 and only one allele was lost in hybrid 1C2. This also raises the question what has caused the loss of DNA content in hybrid 1D12. Based on microsats and somy, there is no clear evidence for genomic erosion. So, what part of the genome is lost in the beginning of the experiment? The authors could do a comparative genomic analyses of the parental genomes and the hybrid genomes, to figure out what portions of the genomes are commonly/uniquely lost in the hybrids.</p><p>6. One of the conclusions from the study of accumulation of mutations, is that surface molecules may mutate faster. The reasoning for this if I read and understood correctly, is that there were many &quot;mutations that appeared in each parental clone after culture growth&quot;. Do authors mean to say that these mutations appeared after the genetic cross experiment in Gaunt et al. 2003? Can the authors clarify how these parental clones were kept and passaged since then? How many passages did they undergo before being sequenced? The same clarification is warranted for hybrids. When the authors state that &quot;while the parental strains were diploid, all initial hybrid clones were essentially tetraploid&quot; (Discussion, page 15), the readership would like to know if these essential tetraploid states were observed just after the hybridization (genetic exchange) event (e.g. clones were kept in liquid nitrogen since then and only thawed for brief culture before sequencing) or if these states had some passages in culture after the genetic exchange event (how many?).</p><p>7.

These are important points for this complex genome and we agree that they should be clear. HaplotypeCaller was used, and more information on the SNP calling was added in the revised manuscript. We are familiar with the suggested methods, since the corresponding author co-authored the Schwabl et al. (2019) paper. We have now used the masking used in that paper to compare the two strategies. Only a small number of SNPs are lost when the masking is added, and the distribution is unchanged. Thus, the conclusions are not changed. In addition, we found that our strategy removed a larger proportion of the genome from the analysis than the masking strategy. As the strains used in the hybrid strategy differ significantly from the reference in many repetitive regions, it is likely that the strategy using only the parent/hybrid reads gives more accurate results. The strict mapping, combined with visualization of the mapping quality and comparing with the repeat content, has enabled us to more reliably remove unreliable SNPs in these extremely repetitive regions. As we produced the reference genome (Talavera-Lopez et al., 2021), we have performed extensive mapping of the reference reads to the sequence to identify repetitive regions. Indels were not found to be informative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As the coverage is high, joint genotyping would add significantly to the analysis. Moreover, the independent clone/parental strain analysis would not cause biased SNP detection, since a detailed analysis has compared the same regions of each sequenced genome, being consistent among the raw reads despite the sequencing coverage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, in the main text on page 7, it is argued that these SNPs would have occurred in culture during the approximately 50 generations of growth BEFORE hybrid formation.

This is also important for later sections that claim that hybridization resulted in a burst of novel mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more detail on sample origins and hybrids formation is required, though exact passage numbers from the original crossing experiment (performed in 1998) were not recorded, so these are best estimates from a revised assessment of all the available information (not included in the main text).</p><p>P1 and P2 clones were transfected with the drug resistance genes on episomal constructs, drug selected and polyclonal populations were grown out (~15 generations). Cloning generated the P1-hyg and P2-neo lines (~25 generations). Stationary phase cultures containing metacyclic trypomastigotes were used for the mixed Vero infections (crosses) as described in Gaunt et al., 2003 (~10 generations to point of mixing). The P1 and P2 samples that were sequenced in this study, for t=0, were grown from the pre-transfection parasites, adding another ~20 generations of culture. Thus, the t=0 parent sequences are removed by ~70 generations from the experimental cross.</p><p>Parasites were recovered from mixed Vero cell infections between 7 and 28 days post-inoculation (~15 generations as amastigotes), then selected (on both drugs) and a polyclonal population was grown out (~15 generations). Cloning generated the original 6 hybrid lines (~25 generations), which were cryopreserved. When work resumed on analysing the hybrids’ DNA contents (see Lewis et al., 2009) the t=0 DNA extraction occurred after ~40 generations of epimastigote culture. Thus, the t=0 hybrid sequences are removed by ~95 generations from the experimental cross. So, at the beginning of the microevolution experiment presented in this study, the parents and hybrids were already separated by approximately 165 generations. Figure 1 and the methods section has now been modified to reflect these details.</p><p>In hindsight, it would have been better to have less divergence between the time of DNA sampling and the original cross experiment, but such a long-term microevolution experiment was not planned in advance and the idea developed over time. However, it would never have been possible to avoid some distance between the parent samples, the hybrid clone samples and the actual hybrisation event because of the culture bottlenecks inherent to the process of cell infections, drug selection and cloning, as well as growing out sufficient numbers of parasites to yield enough DNA for the sequencing technologies available at the time.</p><p>In light of the above-mentioned aspects, we consider that SNPs that are common to all hybrids were all almost certainly generated from before hybridisation, falling into two main categories: SNPs that were detected in the three t=0 hybrid samples but not detected in the parent samples, and SNPs occuring in the parent parasite lines during culture before the cross was set up. As above, DNA for this study was derived from parent samples approximately 70 generations separating them from the cross.</p><p>We might rule out less likely origins for SNPs common to all hybrid such as homoplasies, that would be extremely rare across three independent hybrid lines, or those occuring during growth of a hypothetical common progenitor hybrid before the cloning procedure was done. This latter seems unlikely because hybrid ID12 inherited P2 kDNA maxicircles while 1C2 and 2C1 inherited P1 kDNA maxicircles. Thus, a minimum of two independent hybridisation events is more parsimonious than a mixed maxicircle common progenitor. It is noteworthy to mention that maxicircle inheritance is uniparental in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and <italic>Lesishmania</italic>.</p><p>The hybrid clone-specific SNPs are assumed to all be downstream of the hybridisation events, though it is conceivable that a very small fraction might have been undetectable in all samples but one for technical reasons. These are the SNPs being referred to at the end of this section where we state “this ratio was approximately 3.3-fold higher in the SNPs that appeared after the hybridization event”</p><p>We thus changed on page 7 “50 generations of growth before hybrid formation” to “70 generations of <italic>parent parasite</italic> growth before <italic>the cross was set up</italic>“ and added a sentence to explain about the kDNA. Figure 1 was changed to show the time separating the DNA samples from the hybridisation event. We also clarify at the end of section that SNPs that appeared after hybridisation equates to hybrid clone-specific SNPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems like the authors are discovering the impact of tandem repeat regions (copy number variations) on SNP discovery.

Such SNP's should not have been included in the first place.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers are already aware, the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> genome is unusual, even for kinetoplastid parasites. It is effectively divided into two parts, core and repetitive, and the two behave very differently in most respects, both regarding sequence analysis and biology. We have therefore chosen to include this information in order to illustrate the features of the genome for readers are less familiar with this organism and its genome, specially concerning the sequence variability within the multicopy gene families of a clonal organism that would allow detection of distinct SNPs among distinct members of a given gene family. We feel that this will be helpful, as <italic>T. cruzi</italic> is radically different from other trypanosomatids and it is suited for the readership of this more broad journal. We have rephrased the text to reflect to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Why was the mapping quality in surface molecules inferior to the rest? That begs for explanation. &quot;Surface molecule genes&quot;, frequently used here, sounds somewhat weird to this reviewer. Couldn't it be rather &quot;Surface protein-coding genes&quot; or the like?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in mapping quality thus reflects the extreme nature of the sequence composition of the surface-molecule coding gene-containing regions of the genome. Even though rigorous mapping parameters were used, results such as these are expected due to the large and variable number of gene copies and other repeats that cannot reliably be used for mapping. We have changed the terminology as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I understand the implications of trying to map short reads to repetitive regions.

In addition, it's genome-wide somy profile remained stable at tetrasomy (Figure 4C). Also, there also seems to be an increase in DNA content after 600 generations. Finally, microsatellite alleles are only consistently lost in hybrid 2C1, at three different loci. No loss was observed in hybrid 1D12 and only one allele was lost in hybrid 1C2. This also raises the question what has caused the loss of DNA content in hybrid 1D12. Based on microsats and somy, there is no clear evidence for genomic erosion. So, what part of the genome is lost in the beginning of the experiment? The authors could do a comparative genomic analyses of the parental genomes and the hybrid genomes, to figure out what portions of the genomes are commonly/uniquely lost in the hybrids.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the three hybrid lines have distinct genome erosion patterns not fully captured by our use of the term “gradual”. Revision of figure 1C to account for kDNA and infer 3n1k and 4n1k levels has allowed us to better visualise these trends. This shows there was in fact little DNA loss between the hybridisation (diploid fusion) events and t=0 for all three lines. While 2C1 shows the most consistent rate of genome erosion, with all three 800 generation evolved clones approximating a 3C genome size, the 1C2 shows more of a “stop-start” pattern, where most of the erosion occurs between 0-200 and 400-600 generations, reaching a 3C genome size, but two of the 800 generation clones then gain ~10%. The 1D12 clone, as the reviewer correctly observes, shows an initial 9% loss between t=0 and t=200 but was then quite stable between 3C and 4C.</p><p>In terms of the microsatellite data, we only typed four loci so there is very limited value in using them to interpret the total DNA erosion patterns. The purpose of such typing was just to help guide decisions on the analytical approach, i.e., whether to continue culturing for more years, whether to pursue a whole genome sequencing approach and for which samples. We reasoned that once we saw any evidence of microsattellite allele dropout then sequencing was likely to be justified.</p><p>Comparative genomic analyses of the parental genomes and the hybrid genomes is described on section “Patterns of genome erosion after in vitro microevolution” (Pg. 13) and we have now expanded the text of the Results section relating to Figure 1C and 1D to cover these aspects of the data and provided more nuance. Also, Gene Ontology analysis of contracted genes in hybrid strains after culture growth is presented in Supplementary Table 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
