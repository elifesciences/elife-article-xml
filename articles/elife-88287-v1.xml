and Bullock, weakly electric fish have served as a valuable model for investigating spatial and social cognitive abilities in a vertebrate taxon usually less accessible than mammals or other terrestrial vertebrates. These fish, through their electric organ, generate low-intensity electric fields to navigate and interact with conspecifics, even in complete darkness. The brown ghost knifefish is appealing as a study subject due to a rich electric ‘vocabulary’, made by individually variable and sex-specific electric signals. These are mainly characterized by brief frequency modulations of the oscillating dipole moment continuously generated by their electric organ, and are known as chirps. Different types of chirps are believed to convey specific and behaviorally salient information, serving as behavioral readouts for different internal states during behavioral observations. Despite the success of this model in neuroethology over the past seven decades, the code to decipher their electric communication remains unknown. To this aim, in this study we re-evaluate the correlations between signals and behavior offering an alternative, and possibly complementary, explanation for why these freshwater bottom dwellers emit electric chirps. By uncovering correlations among chirping, electric field geometry, and detectability in enriched environments, we present evidence for a previously unexplored role of chirps as specialized self-directed signals, enhancing conspecific electrolocation during social encounters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>weakly electric fish</kwd><kwd>brown ghost</kwd><kwd>chirps</kwd><kwd>apteronotus leptorhynchus</kwd><kwd>electrocommunication</kwd><kwd>conspecific localization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>491192747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krahe</surname><given-names>Rüdiger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electric signals produced by weakly electric gymnotiform fish, long seen as communication attempts, may also serve to localize conspecifics, revealing a distinct functional role.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Homeoactive sensing (i.e. self-directed active signal production) differs from alloactive sensing in that energy changes are actively produced in order to affect object detection in the environment, as opposed to a simple reconfiguration of sensor parameters such as orientation or distance from the signal source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zweifel and Hartmann, 2020</xref>). Homeoactive sensing is often used as a strategy to enhance spatial navigation in heterogeneous and unpredictable environments: by emitting high-pitch calls (8–200 kHz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fenton et al., 1998</xref>), bats are able to detect features of stationary or moving objects while flying at high speeds and in complete darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jones and Holderied, 2007</xref>). Similarly, odontocete cetaceans are capable of echolocating objects by emitting very short (a few ms long) clicks covering a broad frequency spectrum (5 Hz-100 kHz). A few other mammals (shrews and tenrecs), but also bird species (oilbirds and swiftlets) and even blind humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Griffin, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Thaler et al., 2011</xref>), are known to be capable of echolocating target objects through the emission of brief high-frequency echolocation calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Konishi and Knudsen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brinkløv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gould, 1965</xref>). In general, all biosonar systems are good examples of homeoactive sensing strategies and represent a remarkable adaptation to low-light or turbid water environments in which other sensory modalities would offer only a fraction of the information required to optimize fast spatial navigation during foraging or social interactions.</p><p>But navigating in the dark is not only about detecting sounds. The electrosensory system of weakly electric fish is known to offer analogous advantages yet at the same time presenting fundamental differences. In the following study, we focus on the brown ghost – one of the most studied species – and extend this analogy to the use of frequency modulations as useful signals in the context of conspecific electrolocation. Brown ghosts belong to the gymnotiform group (as does the electric eel) and occupy benthic habitats in the Amazon river basin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crampton, 2019</xref>). They generate quasi-sinusoidal electric fields at relatively high frequencies (600–1000 Hz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zakon et al., 2002</xref>) by means of modified motor neurons projecting mainly to the caudal region of the fish body where they form a so-called electric organ. For this reason, these electric fields are also referred to as electric organ discharges (EODs). EODs – and perturbations thereof – are detected through specialized electroreceptors distributed throughout the fish body and mainly concentrated around the head region. Because EODs are actively produced signals, this process is also called <italic>active electrolocation</italic> (as opposed to passive electrolocation, i.e. the sensing of weak bioelectric signals such as those emanating from muscle activity in prey or other organisms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rose, 2004</xref>). Compared to echolocation, passive electrolocation is possible only at shorter ranges (0–5 cm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lissmann and Machin, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">von der Emde, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Knudsen, 1974</xref>) and, although it is so fast to be considered almost instantaneous, it is more sensitive to signal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benda, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nelson and MacIver, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Active electrolocation allows to extend the <italic>active space</italic> of electrolocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hopkins and Westby, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brenowitz, 1982</xref>) slightly beyond such short range: since EODs spread roughly equally in all directions, all affected surrounding objects (preys, substrate, vegetation) are simultaneously detected (up to 10–12 cm away from the skin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">von der Emde, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Snyder et al., 2007</xref>). During social interactions, the range of active electrolocation can be further extended: when two fish approach each other, the alternating constructive and destructive interaction of their sinewave EODs results in an amplitude- and phase-modulated signal (also referred to as <italic>beat</italic>) detectable by each of them within a 30–40 cm radius (see appendix 1: <italic>Detecting beats at a distance</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Knudsen, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benda, 2020</xref>). The frequency of such beat modulations is equal to the frequency difference (DF) of the two sinewave signals. Because individual brown ghosts have each a different EOD frequency, detecting the beat can be used not only to sense an approaching conspecific but potentially also to determine its identity and sex: at 27 °C female EOD frequencies range between 600 and 800 Hz while male frequencies are usually between 800 and 1000 Hz. It follows that low DFs may be indicative of same sex encounters, whereas high DFs could signal opposite sex interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In summary, weakly electric fish are capable of passively detecting bioelectric sources in close proximity to their body (0–5 cm), but also to actively sense inanimate objects as instantaneous EOD perturbations (up to 12 cm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Snyder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, by detecting beats (i.e. the EOD amplitude modulations induced by other EOD emitting sources), they can instantaneously sense the presence of other conspecifics at distances of up to 30–50 cm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>; Silva A., personal communication).</p><p>Importantly, the strength of electric fields decays with the cubed distance (see appendix 1) and EODs are subject to anisotropic degradation even at very short ranges. This is mainly due to the presence of noisy interferences encountered during locomotion through electrically heterogeneous underwater materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gómez-Sena et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pedraja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Milam et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The picture is further complicated by the presence of another critical source of beat interference: communication signals. These consist of brief EOD frequency modulations – or <italic>chirps</italic> – which can be broadly classified in at least 4 different types, based on their duration and the extent of the chirp frequency modulation (FM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>). Different types of chirps are thought to carry different semantic content based on their occurrence during either affiliative or agonistic encounters (this notion will be referred to as <italic>communication-hypothesis</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Larimer and MacDonald, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bullock, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hopkins, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagedorn and Heiligenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zupanc and Maler, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engler and Zupanc, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Since both chirps and positional parameters (such as size, orientation, or motion) can only be detected as perturbations of the beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>), and via the same electroreceptors, the inputs relaying both types of information are likely to overlap and interact in highly variable ways (as noted also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Field et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, as the majority of chirps are produced within a short range (&lt;50 cm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>; see appendix 1) this interference is likely to occur consistently during social interactions.</p><p>Under the <italic>communication-hypothesis</italic>, the assumption that chirps and beats are conveying different types of information (i.e. semantic value as opposed to position and related geometrical parameters) is therefore leaving this issue unresolved.

We have gathered a large dataset of circa 67.000 chirps, obtained from staged social pairings, playback experiments and behavioral assessments of fish locomotory activity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). We first show that the relative number of different chirp types in a given recording does not significantly correlate with any particular behavioral or social context. It is instead correlated to the biophysical properties of underwater electric fields and to the spatial arrangement of interacting EODs. By using high-speed infrared video recordings synchronized with multi-channel voltage data acquisition, we then analyzed chirps considering both their effects on beat processing and their spatial attributes, that is the spatial location of the interacting fish. Analyses of cross-correlation of chirp time-series, chirp-type transitions and of behavioral responses to playback chirps were used to assess the presence of meaningful correspondences. The occurrence of chirps of different types was then analyzed in relation with the most common behavioral displays used by brown ghosts during social interactions.

Chirps have been previously categorized in different types based on the extent and the duration of their frequency modulation (FM in Hz and duration in ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engler et al., 2000</xref>). Initially, we searched for clusters in our chirp dataset using the k-means method and chirp FM and duration as input parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Nonetheless, for consistency with the existing literature, we categorized chirps using rough cut-off values based on the distribution density of an early subset of chirps (N=11,342 chirps, see Materials and methods for details).

Playback electrodes were positioned in either compartment (randomly chosen) and parallel to the longest tank axis, ca. 10 cm apart. Electric stimuli were EOD mimics at different frequency steps (DFs) of both positive and negative sign, relative to the fish’s own EOD frequency (values in Hz:±240,±160,±80,±40,±20,±10,±5, 0). The EOD playback intensity was set at 1 mV/cm at ca. 5 cm distance (which is in the range of natural field strengths of this species).

Each playback trial lasted ca. 60 s with 180 s inter-trial intervals (see Materials and methods for details). An infra-red video camera synched with the EOD recording was used to score the average fish position during trials (see Materials and methods).</p><p>Fish responses to plain sinewave EODs confirmed previously reported findings: fish respond with large chirps (type 1 and type 3) to high DFs and with small chirps (type 2) to low DF signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>), with males producing more chirps than females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engler and Zupanc, 2001</xref>). Notably, a transient decrease in chirping was observed in the immediate temporal surround of playback chirps (modes 1–3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). This effect was similar for all chirp types and seemed to be limited to a short time around chirp occurrence. Accordingly, a more pronounced decrease in chirping was observed during 3 Hz trains of type 2 chirps, possibly due to the higher frequency at which these events were repeated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). Apart from this, fish responses to chirping EODs were hardly distinguishable from non-chirping EOD mimics in terms of number of chirps produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>; but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Triefenbach and Zakon, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the time course of chirping further revealed two interesting details: first, while type 1 and type 3 chirps seem to be randomly scattered throughout the whole trial (60 s), the number of type 2 chirps seems to increase over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>; as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>). This trend was independent of the type of playback and is therefore intrinsically related to the use of this particular type of chirp. All chirp types are subject to a brief decrease only in concurrence with 2 Hz trains of type 2-chirp playback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). Second, the vast majority of rises was produced right at the end of the playback signal, regardless of whether or not playback chirps were occurring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Overall, these results show that brown ghosts do not respond to playback chirps in a chirp-type specific manner. They are coherent with previous reports showing an increase of type 2 chirps over time during paired interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>) and the presence of a short delay between consecutive chirps produced by different subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>). The consistent occurrence of rises at the end of playback signals has also been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kolodziejski et al., 2007</xref>). Eventually, the strong symmetrical dependency of chirp production on positive and negative beat frequencies (DFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engler and Zupanc, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Triefenbach and Zakon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kolodziejski et al., 2007</xref>) and the lack of specific matching in the response of brown ghosts to playback chirps confirms that, in this species, chirping is primarily conditioned by beat parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Walz et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, these findings indicate that, irrespective of the meaning or valence chirps may have, the production of chirps and the detection of non self-generated chirps may be two independent processes.</p><p>Eventually, if chirping depends merely on beat parameters (such as beat frequency, i.e. DF, or contrast) one would expect to observe invariant responses to stimuli of different duration as well as across repeated trials, because the emission pattern of chirps of different types would adjust to frequency changes in similar ways across trials.</p><p>To evaluate this possibility, we stimulated a group of brown ghosts with playback signals with frequency ramps (DF +/-300 Hz, in both directions). Stimuli were provided with different durations (20, 60, 180 s), each in 3–4 repeats. Individual fish were caged in a mesh tube and playback stimuli were calibrated as previously done.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, we found that chirps are produced at higher rates when playback frequency gets closer to the fish’s own EOD frequency (i.e. reaching a low DF value), similarly to what happens when static frequency playbacks are used. Yet, the choice of chirp type seemed to be highly variable across individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Despite this heterogeneity, each individual fish displayed rather similar chirping patterns, both across trials of different length as well as in repeats of the same trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). In addition, regardless of the type of chirp produced in a given trial, the overall number of chirps was reliably correlated with trial duration with an astonishingly high linear correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>=0.987, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). The relative number of the different types of chirps also varied depending on playback duration, possibly as an effect of ramping speed (pie charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). As previously shown, chirp type choice on average appears to reflect changes in the DF sign: larger chirps are scarcer around 0 Hz, while smaller ones are more frequent around the smaller DF values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–I</xref>). In some cases, this implied a quick DF-dependent transition from large to small chirps (see fish IDs S6, G5, and P3 for instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Nonetheless, our results show a general trend for all chirp types to be produced more often around lower DF values, as evident by looking at inter-chirp intervals (ICIs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). The reliability by which the chirping response adapts to both the rate and direction of beat frequency is variable across individuals but rather stable across trials (relative to a given subject), further suggesting that chirp type variations may not reflect changes in internal states or in the animal motivation to specific behavioral displays (presumably subject to less abrupt variations and stereotypical patterning based on DF). Instead, the choice of different chirp types may reflect the presence of different sensory demands posed by different beat frequencies to the processing of the beat itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barayeu et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that chirp patterning is mainly affected by beat frequency (i.e. DF).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Responses to EOD frequency ramps.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Examples of spectrograms from playback trials showing the responses to frequency ramps (increasing from –300 Hz to 300 Hz or decreasing within the same range) of different durations: 20, 60, and 180 s, respectively.

This was done first independently (considering each subject separately; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3B, D</xref>) and then interactively (considering sender-receiver transitions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Chirp time-series correlations during social interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Chirp transition maps representing the median transition probability (normalized) of all possible chirp type pairs calculated for female and male fish, considered together. For each type of social pairing, the identity of the two fish is indicated by different ID numbers in the different map quadrants: 1–1 = fish 1 to fish 1, 1–2 = fish 1 to fish 2, 2-1 = fish 2 to fish 1, 2-2 = fish 2 to fish 2. In mixed pairs, the order given in the sex tag of each plot follows the same order of the fish ID. The presence of higher chirp-transition frequencies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the matrices (labeled with 1–1 and 2–2) indicates a substantial independence between chirp time-series (i.e. lack of temporal correlation). Transitions from female to male fish (<bold>A</bold>) or male-to-female fish (<bold>B</bold>) are considered separately. For each case, chirps were selected based on the sex of the sender fish. The 1–2 numbering refers to fish identity. On the right side of each matrix, chirp totals are displayed in boxplots for sender and receiver fish (outliers are represented as dots lying beyond the boxplot whiskers; red bars = 100) and cross-correlation indices (cci, 50 ms binning) are provided for chirp time series relative to the same fish pairs (red dotted lines = confidence intervals corresponding to 3 cci standard deviations). (<bold>C, D</bold>) Chirp transitions relative to same sex pairings. A higher level of interaction for F-F pairs (visible in the first and third quadrants in C) is probably due to the extremely low chirp rates in these pairs.

As a direct consequence, the most common chirp type transition found is ‘type 2’-‘type 2’, except for the case in which males are chirping to females (labeled as MF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3B</xref>). In this case, repeats of type 1 chirps become more prominent (especially in experienced pairs), possibly due to the higher amount of type 1 chirps produced by males at high frequency beats (i.e. high DF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3C</xref>) and to the concurrent decrease in the number of type 2 chirps produced by experienced fish (see the effect of <italic>chirp timestamp</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and experience in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2D</xref>). In any other case, neither chirp transitions nor chirp type ratios were differently distributed. Rather, the proportion of different chirp types and the transition frequencies from each type to the others were remarkably similar, regardless of the context and the sex of the interacting fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Overall, these results show that, at an individual level, the most common chirp sequence is a repeat of type 2 chirps in both males and females, with type composition being only slightly more heterogeneous for male senders, when paired with female receivers. This further supports the idea that chirp type choice depends mainly on beat frequency (DF). In other words, at least when chirp sequences are considered individually, chirp-type patterning is highly conservative and not connected to any of the behavioral contexts considered, except the one identified by low vs high DFs.</p><p>Yet, it is possible that meaningful chirp transitions (i.e. correlated to a specific behavioral context) are to be identified only when considering time series interactively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fröhlich et al., 2017</xref>). Recordings from brown ghosts, conducted both in the field and in captivity, suggested the presence of correlations between male chirp rate (type 2 and type 3) and female larger chirps (type 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>). Meaningful correlations have been also suggested to consist more broadly in temporal correlations between time-series, with chirps produced with a preferred latency by two interacting subjects. However, different authors reported different latency values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>, latency 500–1000ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>, latency 200–600ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>, latency 165ms). These discrepancies could be due to either species differences or differences in the recording settings.</p><p>In our recordings, although the temporal correlation of chirp series was highly variable among fish pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), it often on the number of chirps produced (as shown also by estimates of the maximum chirp rates in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>, chirp rate 0.4 /s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>, chirp rate 0.53 /s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>, chirp rate 3 /s) raising the question of whether the previously reported temporal correlations could be just a direct consequence of higher chirp rates occurring when fish get closer to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>). We assessed chirp transitions considering both senders and receivers interactively for different sex pairings (M-M, M-F, F-M, F-F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Transition frequencies were mapped onto four quadrants defined by fish identity (1 or 2) and temporal order: 1–1, 1–2, 2–1 and 2–2.</p><p>What stood out most consistently from this analysis was the much lower (or sometimes completely absent) extent of sender-receiver chirp transitions, as shown by the higher transition probabilities along the 1–1 and 2–2 quadrants of the probability maps. According to this, cross-correlation indices are very low or near zero levels in all cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although slightly different interaction rates were observed in different contexts, in all cases the most frequent chirp transitions were self-referenced (1–1 or 2–2). Although within FF pairs 2–1 and 1–2 interactions seem to be more frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, F and H</xref>), this is probably due to the much lower number of chirps produced by this sex (see boxplots showing the total number of chirps in each group).</p><p>Eventually, the absence of conserved temporal correlations could also depend on the type of behavioral interactions and the proximity at which they take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dunlap, 2002</xref>). Social distance in particular could explain the high chirp-rates previously observed during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagedorn and Heiligenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>) and short-range agonistic interactions between fish confined in a relatively small aquarium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>) as opposed to the more sporadic chirping observed during encounters over wider spatial ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, the higher chirp temporal cross-correlation previously observed by other authors could be due to neuro-endocrine effects of courtship or other mating-related factors.</p><p>To test whether cross-correlation would be significantly affected during courtship, we simulated the onset of the reproductive season by gradually lowering water conductivity over the course of a 40-day period (from 400 μS to 100 μS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kirschbaum, 1979</xref>). As a result of this treatment, at least 75% of the females used in this experiment (N=8) showed visible signs of egg maturation. Mixed-sex pairs (N=8 pairs) held in such conditions were then allowed to interact freely, in absence of any tank divider. As a control group we paired males and females in absence of any water conductivity change (‘novel’ vs ‘experienced’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>). Although female fish produced a surprisingly higher number of chirps in these conditions, only minimal signs of cross-correlation could be detected, without reaching on average the threshold for statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that brown ghosts utilize a very limited variety of chirp type transitions in different behavioral contexts and do not emit specific chirp patterns in any given behavioral context analyzed. More importantly, they show that – at least in the social conditions analyzed here and within small-sized time windows – chirp time series produced by different fish during paired interactions are consistently independent of each other. This further confirms the idea of chirp production and detection as independent processes and that chirp type variability merely depends on beat frequency (DF).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Chirping correlates with active sensing behaviors</title><p>To gain better insights into the behavioral correlates of chirping, we conducted simultaneous video and EOD recordings of freely swimming fish pairs (N=12, mixed sexes; see Materials and methods). The aim of these experiments was to assess the occurrence of consistent chirp-behavior correlations and more in general to evaluate chirp patterning in conjunction with behaviors other than chirp production. Behaving fish were recorded using an infrared camera under IR illumination (920 nm). Fish were allowed to habituate to the testing conditions (15 min) prior to recording of both behavioral and electrical activity (15 min). In this phase, fish were allowed to sense each other electrically through a plastic mesh divider. EODs were recorded in this phase and after removing the mesh barrier. Of the 23 fish chirping during these trials, 12 increased chirping once the direct interaction started, 5 did not alter their chirping rates, 6 decreased them. Chirps were coded again in four types. The ethogram used for this analysis was created according to previously published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Triefenbach and Zakon, 2008</xref>) and included the following behaviors: attacks (i.e. bites to the fish head, <italic>atk</italic>), chasing attempts (<italic>ch</italic>), escape attempts (<italic>esc</italic>), head butts (i.e. direct hits of the snout to the target fish flank, <italic>head</italic>), jaw quivering (often preceding attacks directed to the head or the mouth, <italic>jaw</italic>), backward swimming (<italic>knife</italic>), forward locomotion (<italic>loc</italic>), stationary motion or inactivity (<italic>rest</italic>), backward approaches with tail contact (<italic>tail1</italic>) or involving tail waving (<italic>tail2</italic>), and close body contact (not always aggressive in nature, accompanied by side-to-side swimming, body intertwining and even periods of inactivity, <italic>wrestle</italic>).</p><p>Peristimulus time histograms (PSTH) calculated around the annotated chirps (N=4672 chirps, of which 252 were type 1, 4164 were type 2, 77 were type 3 and 179 were rises) showed no behavior reliably occurring immediately after or before chirping (time window = 4 s). Chirps occurred often during active locomotion (directed either forward or backwards), type 3 chirps seemed to occur more evidently towards the end of a forward-oriented swimming bout, while rises appeared to be centered around forward locomotion (<italic>loc</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Although all chirp types were used during aggressive interactions, these seemed to be rather less frequent in the immediate surround of the chirps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Chirping is mainly correlated with locomotion and active sensing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Peri-stimulus time histograms (PSTH) centered around different chirp types (window = 4 s) indicating that chirps are reliably emitted during locomotion-related behaviors (‘knife’, ‘loc’, and ‘tail1’) but also during resting states (‘rest’).

A more detailed description of each behavior is provided in the Materials and methods (see also panel C).

(<bold>C</bold>) To extract meaningful behavioral correlations, a text-mining algorithm (see Materials and methods) was used to perform a co-occurrence analysis on the whole set of annotations in chronological order (data pooled from 12 fish pairs). In the graph, words closely associated with each other are linked with darker lines (according to a 0-1 coefficient scale). This analysis emphasizes the presence of modularity in a group of strings (i.e. chirps and behaviors), which represents the degree of partitioning of the whole word dataset (N = 5). Each cluster delineates strings sharing similar co-occurrence patterns (see color code). (<bold>D</bold>) The multi-dimensional scaling of the same word-database (2D in this case) shows behavioral combinations having similar patterns of occurrence, regardless of their co-occurrence with other behavioral instances. For this representation, each word is considered individually and the color code represents the clustering of objects based on their proximity (method: Kruskal, distance: Jaccard, N of clusters = 8).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88287-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A tendency for a decrease in attack rates (<italic>atk</italic> and <italic>head</italic>) could be seen perhaps more clearly for type 2 chirps, possibly due to the higher number of this chirp type (89% of all chirps were type 2). Chirps and behaviors occurred with some overlap, depending on whether they represented focal instances or continuous states (such as swimming, wrestling or resting). To assess the presence of direct correlations between individual and composite behavioral patterns including chirps, aggressive, defensive or explorative behaviors, a transition matrix (TM) was calculated using all recorded transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>This allowed us to make the following considerations: (1) as previously observed, type 2 chirps are the most represented chirp type. They are mostly produced in repeats and predominantly during backward swimming (<italic>knife</italic>), they are also followed – to a lower extent – by direct contact (<italic>wrestle</italic>), head bites (<italic>atk</italic>), backward tail-to-tail swimming (<italic>tail1</italic>), escape attempts (<italic>esc</italic>), type 3 chirps, head butts and chasing; (2) behaviors occurring during aggressive encounters (offensive or defensive) are related to one another and also occur in repeats; (3) most chirps occurring during backward swimming are followed by other chirps within the same activity bout, but if attacks are present (<italic>knife</italic> + …+<italic>atk</italic> or+<italic>head</italic>) chirps are not (i.e. attacks may follow chirps but not during backward motion); (4) when used during forward swimming, chirps are often preceding a chasing attempt or a reversal in the swimming direction (<italic>loc</italic> → <italic>knife</italic>).</p><p>While this approach allows to assess chirp-behavior correlations considering even complex combinations, the occurrence of over-represented instances may bias the results by masking potentially significant but less frequent correspondences between complex behavioral patterns. In addition, it has the potential limitation of exaggerating differences among similar behavioral patterns simply because they do not always occur in an identical way.</p><p>A way to overcome these issues is to conduct a nearest-neighbor analysis of behavioral sequences, considering not only strictly consecutive instances (as typically done in a transition matrix) but also more general probabilistic correlations among them. To this aim, we have used a <italic>quantitative content analysis</italic> approach using freely available software for text mining (KH Coder; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Higuchi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Notably, this analysis handles words only from a statistical point of view (i.e. as character strings) and does not evaluate semantic correlations. Data from all behavioral observations were pooled into one single text file, maintaining the original chronological order, subsequently uploaded in KH-C.</p><p>We first calculated a co-occurrence network (CON), which linked different strings based on their co-occurrence within the dataset. Importantly, this calculation does not consider only pairwise transitions in which a given word is used but also deals with whole sets of correlated transitions. As a result, words are clustered together based on similarities in the usage pattern of their transition sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Higuchi, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The resulting co-occurrence diagram confirmed that chirps are used more often in association with swimming activity (<italic>knife</italic>, <italic>loc</italic>, <italic>tail1</italic>, <italic>esc</italic>) and direct physical interaction between fish (<italic>wrestle</italic>). More explicitly aggressive behaviors remained more loosely connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Interestingly, resting states and rises seem to be used in similar ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) despite the scarce transition probability from one to the other. Conversely, forward swimming (<italic>loc</italic>) and chasing (<italic>ch</italic>) behaviors seemed to co-occur quite often.</p><p>To validate these results, we also conducted a factor analysis (multidimensional scaling, MDS) to represent different behaviors on transformed coordinates based on their ranking and usage in the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This complementary approach was used to evaluate more simply the extent of clustering among words having similar appearance patterns, regardless of co-occurrence frequencies. Factor analysis confirmed that type 2 chirps are mostly associated with backward swimming (<italic>knife</italic>) but also with forward motion (<italic>loc</italic>). Escape and rises are clustered together, as they are wrestling and head clamping. Chasing and head butts clustered with type 1 chirps. Type 3, jaw quivering and tail waving did not seem to cluster with any other behavior, probably due to their lower frequency within the dataset.</p><p>Overall, these results provided mutually reinforcing evidence indicating that chirps are produced more often during locomotion or scanning-related motor activity and confirm previous reports of a lower occurrence of chirping during more direct aggressive contact (as shown also by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Triefenbach and Zakon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>). This mainly applies to type 2 chirps and backward swimming (<italic>knife;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Triefenbach and Zakon, 2008</xref>), while larger chirps – often co-occurring (type 1 and 3 together, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) – seem to be associated more frequently to fast-occurring behaviors (forward swimming and chasing), but not necessarily in their immediate proximity (as shown by the PSTH plots). Interestingly, despite this co-occurrence, type 3 chirps seem to cluster independently in the factor analysis, possibly suggesting differences in their usage pattern when compared to other large but faster chirps (type 1).</p><p>The significantly higher extent of chirping during swimming and locomotion, consistently confirmed by four different approaches (PSTH, TM, CN, MDS), suggests that – although chirp-behavior correlations may exist at time-scales larger than those here considered – chirping may be linked more strongly with scanning and environmental exploration than with a particular motivational state, thus confirming findings from our playback experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Chirps significantly interfere with the beat and alter the patterning of transcutaneous voltage</title><p>Given the stereotypical use of chirp types across various social contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), the lack of chirp type-specific responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>), the higher degree of auto-correlation of chirp time-series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the co-occurrence of chirps with locomotion and scanning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and the significant influence of beat frequency (i.e. DF) on chirp variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we propose that the function of chirps is linked to physiological aspects of beat processing in the chirping fish. According to this hypothesis, the emission probability of different chirp types would depend on how detectable their interference with the beat is, specifically at the beat frequency at which they are produced (for an in-depth analysis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Walz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). It is worth noting that the frequency-dependent effects of different chirps on the beat have already been extensively described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Walz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>). To evaluate this possibility, we computed an estimate of the interference caused by chirps on beat periodicity (<italic>beat interference</italic>) using an array of Gaussian chirps across a wide range of beat frequencies (±300 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). Estimates of beat interference were made by calculating the ratio between the cumulative duration of the beat cycles affected by a given chirp (1 beat cycle corresponding to the interval between two consecutive beat peaks) over the cumulative duration of all the beat cycles within the time window used as a reference (700ms, for other window sizes see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref>). This ratio was calculated for a wide range of chirp parameters: duration ranged between 10 and 400ms, while FM ranged between 0 and 400 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9A</xref>). Since chirps can be produced at any EOD phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Walz et al., 2013</xref>), estimates of beat-interference were calculated for each chirp at four different phases (with 90° steps) and then averaged. As a result, we obtained a three-dimensional array of beat-interference values which could be matched to recorded chirps (N=30,486 chirps, from our first set of recordings) having the same parameters (duration, FM and DF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>By plotting both beat-interference values and chirp abundance by DF, we found that emitted chirps were indeed often localized in correspondence with areas of high interference: at negative DFs, chirps were localized mainly in the type 2 range, whereas at positive DFs recorded chirps overlapped more often with the type 1 and 3 ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9C</xref>). This resembled what was already observed during the playback experiments in which EOD frequency ramps were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Eventually, by calculating the normalized cumulative interference for each chirp type, a high degree of matching was found between the DF values at which the interference is higher and those at which chirps were actually recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9B</xref>).</p><p>A chirp type comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9D</xref>) further revealed that type 2 chirps at low or even negative DFs may induce similar interference levels as those induced by larger chirps at higher beat frequencies. This agrees with what has been previously reported using other parameters to estimate chirp-induced beat perturbations (i.e. chirp conspicuousness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>) and could perhaps explain the lower occurrence of larger chirps in low frequency fish (more often in negative-DF encounters). In addition, areas of lower interference seem to be symmetrically localized around 60 Hz, the frequency level to which electroreceptors are most sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastian and Electrolocation, 1981</xref>) and at which chirp occurrence was lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9B–D</xref>). However, this could be also due to the lower representation of these DFs values in this sample since responses to frequency ramps do not seem to convincingly validate this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, these results corroborate the hypothesis that chirp production may be explained mainly by the effects chirps have on the beat perceived by the chirping fish (as emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Walz et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Differences in the beat interference elicited by different types of chirps were found: the interference induced by type 1 chirps is almost one order of magnitude higher than the estimates of the same parameter for type 2 chirps, but one order of magnitude lower than the beat interference induced by type 3 chirps. Rises induce interferences in the range of type 1 chirps (not shown).</p><p>Obviously, measuring chirp-triggered beat interferences by using an elementary outlier detection algorithm on the distribution of beat cycles does not reflect any physiological process carried out by the electrosensory system and can be therefore used only as an oversimplified estimate. A more realistic representation of beat processing and chirp-triggered beat perturbations can be done through electric images (EIs), which are 2D representations of the current flowing through electroreceptors located on the fish skin at any given moment in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>). In the context of social interactions, EIs represent the projection of the electric field generated by two interacting fish onto the array of electrosensory receptors, at the net of the environmental perturbations caused by objects, motion and other sources of noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Both, the 3D shape of the electroreceptor array (i.e. the shape of the fish body) and the asymmetric geometry of the electric field contribute to the further alteration of electric images during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rasnow and Bower, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). While the EOD is one order of magnitude stronger at the tail end compared to the head, the EOD harmonic components also change along the body axes. This means that the perception of beat contrast can change at different body locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rasnow and Bower, 1996</xref>). This explains also why electric images are easily altered by motion and why, in the presence of anisotropic electric field diffusion caused by soluble materials or by environmental objects, beat perception is not an homogeneous process throughout the whole population of electroreceptors. In fact, depending on the fish relative positioning and orientation, electric images can be subject to significant degradation or near cancellation, contingent on the phase of interacting EODs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>). To prevent this, image contrast can, in principle, be enhanced either by adjustments of the body position or through other mechanisms amplifying the responses of either electroreceptor afferents (P-units) or downstream circuits (ELL pyramidal cells). Since the beat AMs generated by the chirps always trigger reliable responses in primary electrosensory circuits (pyramidal cells in the ELL respond to both increases and decreases in beat AM), any chirp-triggered AM causing a sudden change in P-unit firing could potentially amplify the downstream signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marsat and Maler, 2010</xref>) and thus enhance EI contrast. If this is the case, chirps should be able to trigger significant EI changes at different body locations. Obviously, if such effects are visible in simplified static scenarios (e.g. measuring transcutaneous voltage resulting from two static EODs at different body locations), they should be even more evident in situations in which the interacting fish are moving around each other.</p><p>To address this point, we first assessed the impact of chirps on EIs by computing EIs using theoretical chirp examples and 778 Hz as carrier EOD frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Chirps were here defined as Gaussian frequency changes with the following parameters: type 1=200 Hz, 40ms; type 2=100 Hz, 20ms; type 3=300 Hz, 100ms; rises = 50 Hz, 100ms. For each chirp type, a signal amplitude loss – similar to that occurring in natural chirps – was applied: type 1: 47%, type 2: 7%, type 3: 45%, rises: 3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Engler et al., 2000</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The receiver frequency was set at different values expressed in percentage of the sender’s EOD frequency: from –20 to +20%, with a 5% step. The resulting beats were phase-shifted using 45° angular steps.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Chirps alter estimates of transcutaneous voltage in sender and receiver fish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmaps representing the electric field (V/cm) generated by a sender fish alone (left) and by two interacting fish (right; fish length = 15 cm, distance = 10 cm).

Overall, both the estimates of chirp-induced beat interference as well as the more realistic representations of chirp-triggered electric images, confirm that chirping exerts conspicuous and spatially referenced effects on the beat that should be easily detectable by electrosensory afferents and could therefore be usable to complement beat processing, perhaps in scenarios in which beat amplitude is either low or poorly resolved.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Chirping is significantly affected by locomotion and social distance</title><p>So far, our analysis focused on interacting fish pairs within a relatively small tank environment (35x80 x 35 cm). In such a scenario, we can expect fish to be able to detect the beat caused by the partner’s EOD at almost all times. As we pointed out in the previous paragraph, chirping could potentially convey enhanced spatial information even at short distances.</p><p>To obtain more insight into how chirps are used in more naturalistic scenarios, we evaluated chirping and different aspects of swimming activity using a <italic>novel environment exploration</italic> assay involving a larger recording aquarium (160x80 x 20 cm) containing shelters (plastic tubes and plants), barriers and other objects with which the animal had no previous experience. We assessed chirp production by brown ghosts freely swimming while localizing a beat source (a caged conspecific). This allowed to evaluate aspects of fish locomotion and social behavior neglected in previous experiments, potentially explaining high inter-individual chirping variability (e.g. thigmotaxis, novelty-seeking, sociability). If chirping relates to geometrical aspects of beat processing (distance, orientation, direction, and motion), a bias for any of these should be evident in these experiments. If chirps enhance beat processing and conspecific electrolocation, for instance, chirping should occur within beat detection range but at a certain distance. Alternatively, if chirps help resolve other parameters of electric field geometry, they may be produced at specific angles or when fish are in close proximity.</p><p>The caged conspecific was located in a mesh tube on one side of the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). A ‘novel object’ (a 1x5 cm graphite rod) was hidden behind a barrier and used to test novelty seeking. Different regions of interest (ROIs) were used to score the occurrence of fish swimming behavior around the shelter area, the tank walls (within 5 cm distance), the novel object and the conspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The time spent swimming in the arena’s open space (5 cm away from the walls) was also evaluated.

In particular, female brown ghosts spent more time swimming in the open space areas of the arena, as opposed to swimming closer to the tank walls (thigmotaxis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Female subjects also spent more time investigating the novel object than the conspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Male behavior showed a different trend as males spent comparatively more time swimming close to the tank walls and more time in contact with conspecifics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Possibly as a direct consequence of this, they also produced a higher number of chirps, compared to their female counterparts. Most chirps were produced in close proximity to the caged conspecific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Analysis of the angles and distances of fish during chirps revealed that first, chirps were mostly produced when subjects were located at 30°, 150°, or 330° angles relative to the axis defined by the mesh tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), and second, most chirps were produced at a distance of less than 25–50 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). While the angle bias could be due to the circular loops described by fish swimming around the conspecific, the rather limited distance range at which chirps are produced could be explained by the range of the EOD field (beat amplitude reaches 1% at around 30 cm; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benda, 2020</xref>; see Appendix 1) and confirms previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, chirps of different types were not all produced at similar angles: while type 1 and type 2 chirps seem to be more often produced at 30–150°, type 3 chirps – produced in this experiment only by males – seem to be used in the ±30° range (i.e. on the right side of both the arena and the plane representing the angles). Rises – in both males and females – seemed more often to be produced at multiples of 30° located on the left side of the cartesian plane (30°, 150°, and 210°). All chirp types, except for rises, were produced within a 50 cm radius from the conspecific fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Rises were produced almost ubiquitously, by both sexes, and most of the time at locations far away from the caged fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">Appendix 1—figure 11</xref>).</p><p>Factor analysis (FAMD) confirmed the already known sex-dimorphisms in chirp distribution (males chirp more than females and more often towards other males, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>). Collectively, caged fish produced more chirps than freely swimming subjects (4410 vs 3483 chirps). In addition, variables associated to beat frequency (such as DF, EOD frequency, sex, chirp type) explain a good percentage of chirp variance (73.7% of variance explained as opposed to the 55% explained including all other variables 55%; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A relatively high loading on principal components was also found for variables associated with locomotion, such as distance and time spent exploring different tank areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12B</xref>). Accordingly, chirp clustering is affected by the EOD frequency difference of the emitting fish (DF) and by distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12C</xref>, insets).</p><p>Modelling of field current and iso-potential lines using dipole models of our fish allows to visualize more intuitively how both chirp angles and distances can be explained by the electric field geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13A</xref>). Most chirps (90%) are in fact produced within a distance corresponding to 1% of the maximum field intensity (i.e. roughly 30 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13B</xref>), indicating that chirping occurs way above the threshold distance for beat detection (i.e. roughly in the range of 60–120 cm, depending on the study; see appendix 1: <italic>Detecting beats at a distance</italic>). This effect is even more evident when chirp locations are compared to the values of field intensity measured at different distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13C, D</xref>). By estimating the interference each chirp type would induce on the beat, based on its decay law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13D</xref>), one can easily see how the two are linearly and directly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13E–H</xref>).</p><p>Overall, given that most chirps are reliably produced within very short range, they may not be useful for improving beat detection per se. Conversely, the orientation bias for chirp locations suggests that chirps are used during specific swimming trajectories and thus likely occurring while brown ghosts are trying to resolve other spatial parameters, such as the orientation, direction and possible motion of the beat source. In all this, rises may represent an exception as their locations are spread over larger distances and even in presence of obstacles potentially occluding the beat source (i.e. shelters, plants, or walls), all conditions in which beat detection or beat processing could be more difficult or simply interrupted (an idea coherent with the production of rises right at the end of EOD playbacks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). Taken together, these observations may possibly explain why female subjects, apparently less motivated in exploring social stimuli, also produce considerably fewer chirps unless they are forced into social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2E, F</xref>). More broadly, these findings indicate that chirping, besides being strongly correlated to the frequency of the beat generated by the interacting fish, is also significantly affected by locomotion and by spatial relationships between subjects within beat detection range.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Chirping increases with environmental complexity</title><p>We hypothesized that if chirps are used as probes to refine beat processing and/or the resolution of electric images produced by conspecifics, higher levels of environmental complexity would likely result in higher chirping rates (as it implies higher probing needs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siemers et al., 2009</xref>). To test this idea, we used both playback experiments and recordings of interacting fish pairs. The objective was to evaluate the chirping responses of brown ghosts to EODs in presence of environmental clutter which would distort electric fields in tangible but unpredictable ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">von der Emde, 2006</xref>).</p><p>We first recorded social interactions using the same divided tank configuration as in our previous recordings. Fish pairs (N=6) were recorded in 3 different conditions: (1) with lights turned ON and no object in the tank other than the mesh divider placed between the 2 fish (lights ON - clear), (2) with lights switched OFF (lights OFF - clear) and (3) with lights OFF and the addition of shelter PVC tubes and plastic plants filling almost entirely the two tank compartments (lights OFF – cluttered; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Fish pairs were recorded for 15 min with no previous knowledge of either the environment or their social partner. Trials were shuffled in a randomized order and were spaced by 5 min inter-trial intervals. Chirp counts were evaluated at the end of the trials. As expected, the total chirp rate increased in absence of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zupanc et al., 2001</xref>). More strikingly, the increase was even more pronounced when clutter was present in the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In all cases, type 2 chirps were the most often produced type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). A slight (non-significant) increase in type 2 and type 3 chirps could be observed under cluttered conditions. These results clearly indicate that chirping is affected by environmental complexity, since in these recordings (1) aggression- or courtship-related behaviors were either absent or randomly occurring in the three conditions and (2) both fishes had equal environmental and social experience.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Effect of environmental clutter on interacting fish pairs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recording of fish pairs (N = 6) in environments of different sensory complexity: lights ON = clear tank environment and direct illumination, lights OFF = clear tank environment, no illumination, lights OFF + clutter = no illumination and cluttered environment.

Therefore, chirp production in these experiments could also be affected by a range of sensory inputs co-occurring in an unnaturally confined space and for the whole duration of the recordings (15 min). To rule out these possibilities, we conducted playback experiments in a larger enclosure (160x50 cm), allowing fish to detect playback EODs from a wider range of distances. Playback electrodes were not directly accessible but placed behind a mesh barrier located at either side of the enclosure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Environmental clutter (plastic plants) was interposed between the electrodes and the mesh divider at a random location in each trial. We found that chirp rates increased in response to playback signals specifically when they were partially concealed by clutter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Notably, this effect seems to be more evident for larger chirps (type 1 and type 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), although combined effects of chirp types and clutter have not been found. Overall, these results indicate that chirping is significantly affected by the presence of environmental clutter partially disrupting – or simply obstructing – the processing of beat related information during locomotion. They further confirm electric signals alone are sufficient to trigger the chirping increase in cluttered conditions. All chirp types seem to be equally affected, with type 2 chirps being the most common type produced also in cluttered conditions.</p><p>The increased utilization of chirping during locomotion around partially concealed EOD sources mirrors the higher probing rates typically observed in complex environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Obrist, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schnitzler and Kalko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Slabbekoorn and Peet, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siemers et al., 2009</xref>). This supports the notion of chirps as self-referenced probing cues, potentially employed to optimize short-range aspects of conspecific electrolocation, such as size, orientation, and direction – a hypothesis that will certainly be explored in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we examined the factors influencing the production of EOD frequency modulations (chirps) in brown ghost knifefish. We gathered a substantial dataset of chirps recorded during various social interactions, evaluating the impact of territory ownership, social hierarchy, sex, reproductive state, and social experiences. Analyzing this data, we found that the most influential factors in chirping are primarily beat frequency (DF) and experience (both environmental and social). Chirp patterns mainly consist of repetitions of the same chirp type which are heavily influenced by DF. Responses to playback chirps inserted into a sinewave stimulus of a particular DF are indistinguishable in terms of chirps emitted by the fish and exploratory behavior (approach/avoidance). Our behavioral observations of freely swimming fish indicate that chirping typically occurs at short ranges, often coinciding with active social approaches. Building upon these findings, we suggest that chirps serve as self-directed signals (sensory probes), aiding in the processing of spatial information derived from beats.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Existing functional hypotheses</title><p>Since the earliest reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Larimer and MacDonald, 1968</xref>), chirps have been assigned behavioral meaning as communication signals based on the following observations (mostly in brown ghosts): (a) fish chirp mainly during social encounters; (b) males chirp considerably more than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dye, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tallarovic and Zakon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dunlap and Larkins-Ford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kolodziejski et al., 2007</xref>) and are also considerably more aggressive; (c) during male interactions (often agonistic) smaller chirps are produced (i.e. shorter duration and lower frequency excursion: type 2) whereas larger chirps (types 1 and 3) are used more often during female-male encounters (presumably courtship-driven); (d) high chirp rates are observed in mating pairs, too, with a relatively higher production of large chirps (i.e. type 1 and type 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagedorn and Heiligenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>). This led to a dualistic semantic subdivision of chirps, with small chirps implied in agonistic interactions and larger chirps pertaining to different aspects of courtship and mating.</p><p>Although intuitive, this idea raises the following concerns: first, several factors (sex and the magnitude of beat-interference) covary with the main corollary of chirping, that is beat frequency. These covariates are not easy to disentangle, which makes it difficult to separate neuroendocrine or other behavioral factors from the biophysical features of EOD fields affecting detection and localization of conspecific fish. Second, observations in a few species are generalized to all other gymnotiforms without testing whether chirping may have similar functions in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Turner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Smith, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Petzold et al., 2016</xref>). Third, social encounters do not only involve communication but also higher levels of locomotion and reciprocal exploration, which could also be linked to chirping activity, but have not been considered in the past. Fourth, studies supporting a dual function of chirping (i.e. aggression and courtship), only rarely addressed this hypothesis using breeding animals. Last, and most importantly, no causal evidence in support of any of the hypothesized functions of the different types of chirps has ever been provided.</p><p>The idea of chirps being used as <italic>probes</italic>, as proposed here, is not entirely new: due to the tight correlation between chirp features and beat frequency (mainly chirp frequency modulation), Walz and coauthors previously hypothesized a role of chirps in determining the sign of the beat frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Walz et al., 2014</xref>). This indeed may represent an ambiguous parameter as two opposite frequency differences (or DFs) result in the same beat frequency: for example consider a fish producing an EOD of 750 Hz (EOD1) and interacting with conspecifics with an EOD of either 700 Hz (EOD2) or 800 Hz (EOD3). The two beats could be indistinguishable (assuming – perhaps not realistically – that the same mechanism involved in DF discrimination at lower DF values would not work in this case; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Metzner, 1999</xref>). However, since any frequency modulation of EOD1 will have different effects on the beat frequency relative to EOD2 and EOD3, chirps could indeed solve the problem of disambiguating the sign of DF (which in brown ghosts could mean no less than discriminating between male and female conspecifics). However, it is also possible to obtain beat frequency information more reliably with a more gradual and slow change in the fish’s own EOD frequency (which knifefish are capable of producing, see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rose and Canfield, 1991</xref>). More banally, the average chirp rates do not seem to realistically reflect such an aim (at low beat frequencies, it is not rare for a fish to chirp more than 100 times per minute).</p><p>More recent studies have further suggested that patterns of specific chirp types could be a salient signal used for communication purposes in the context of mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>). Yet, results obtained from our recordings do not support the existence of a chirp-based syntax in social interactions in which breeding conditions were simulated: fish pairs acclimated to breeding conditions (but not mating) used non-patterned chirp repertoires similar to fish pairs recorded in non-breeding conditions. One exception to the <italic>monotony</italic> of the chirping repertoires observed in this study is given by male-female pairs: in this case, type 1 and type 3 chirps are used more often, while the relative amount of type 2 chirps is lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2C, D</xref>). However, this effect is likely to be a result of the combined effect of the pronounced dependency of chirp type on DF together with the higher chirp rates observed in males (i.e. if chirp variety increases with DFs and males chirp more, chirp type variety will be higher when males interact with high beat frequencies). Moreover, the somewhat stereotypical transition between large and small chirps that can be observed during repeated exposure to playback frequency ramps, appears a convincing argument against the <italic>communication-hypothesis</italic>. Interestingly, a recent study on pulse-type gymnotiforms suggested that chirps could be used for jamming avoidance. In this case, chirps are not an increase of EOD cycles on a sine wave signal, but an increase in the emitted pulses. The hypothesis was based on the temporal correlations of chirps emitted by interacting fish and the effect chirps exerts on EOD phase precession (i.e. a progressive phase shift between two signals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Field et al., 2019</xref>). In both cases (wave- and pulse-type chirps), chirps induce abrupt EOD phase changes (for pulse-type see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Field et al., 2019</xref>; for wave-type see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Stöckl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Walz et al., 2014</xref>) which may be beneficial to avoid jamming potentially occurring at any given phase. Although the EOD waveform generated by wave- and pulse-type gymnotiforms is essentially different (see for an overview <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Zupanc and Bullock, 2005</xref>), the similarities between the chirp waveforms (i.e. the instantaneous EOD frequency) may not be a matter of chance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Field et al., 2019</xref>) and could indicate similarities in the neural mechanisms responsible for their generation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inconsistencies between behavior and hypothesized signal meaning</title><p>In our playback experiments we observed no differences in the responses of fish of the two sexes to playback stimuli, regardless of whether they contained a particular chirp type or not: test subjects chirped at comparable rates in response to all types of EOD mimics (containing type 1 chirps, type 2 chirps or rises), confirming that the main factor determining type choice is DF and therefore self-referenced sensory requirements (as opposed to different semantic contents). This idea is further corroborated by the known symmetric distribution of chirp types within the ±400 Hz DF range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Engler and Zupanc, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Triefenbach and Zakon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kolodziejski et al., 2007</xref>). Nonetheless, it’s plausible that playback stimuli, as employed in our study and others, may not faithfully replicate natural signals, thus potentially influencing the reliability of the observed behaviors. However, EOD waveform and harmonic components – which make natural EODs different from playback mimics – do not seem to play a role in EOD discrimination as EOD frequency alone does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dunlap and Larkins-Ford, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fugère and Krahe, 2010</xref>). Moreover, artificial EODs are widely used in electrophysiological studies as they elicit comparable responses to natural stimuli in the electrosensory system (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marsat et al., 2009</xref>). Future studies might consider replicating these findings using either natural signals or improved mimics, which could include harmonic components (excluded in this study).</p><p>Based on our beat interference estimates, we propose that the occurrence of the different types of chirps at more positive DFs (such as in male-to-female chirping) may be explained by their different effect on the beat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Walz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In line with our behavioral data, electrophysiological recordings conducted at all main nodes of the electrosensory pathway did not show consistent chirp-type-specific responses in either peripheral or central brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Metzen and Chacron, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Marsat, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Metzen et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, the temporal correlations between chirps and other events (locomotion-related) seem to be more salient factors, as recently proposed for midbrain circuits whose phasic responses to moving objects are used to timestamp their occurrence during spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wallach et al., 2018</xref>). Recordings from interacting fish pairs confirmed the absence of any significant correlation between chirp type choice and <italic>behavioral context</italic>, except for those cases characterized by higher beat frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). This suggests that the effect of <italic>behavioral context</italic> highlighted in our factor analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is mainly due to the number of chirps produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>), rather than their type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Type 1 and type 3 chirps (i.e. large chirps), have been often suggested to be courtship related signals because they are emitted predominantly by opposite sex pairs (i.e. fish pairs characterized by a higher DF value; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagedorn and Heiligenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>). However, the symmetric distribution of their production probability around the lowest DF values (relative to the sender EOD frequency), suggests that this conclusion may not be always valid. In addition, here we show not only that large chirps are also consistently produced at very low DFs but also that the relative proportion of different chirp types does not seem to differ in social pairings implying potentially very different internal states in the interacting fish (breeding, aggression, territorial competition, etc.). Both results are further weakening the link between large chirps and courtship displays.</p><p>Type 2 chirps are also considered to be significantly correlated with aggressive encounters, although it is not clear whether they represent purely aggressive, possibly deterring, signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zupanc, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Triefenbach and Zakon, 2008</xref>) or attempts to de-escalate aggression and communicate submission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>). Our results do not support either of these hypotheses: type 2 chirps are produced at higher rates at low beat frequencies (a feature of any encounter in which fish with similar EOD frequency approach each other and which has nothing to do with their intentions), they are more often produced by newly introduced fish (which are not necessarily more aggressive but could just be more explorative), less in experienced fish (which also move less; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), more by males when separated from females (males are more motivated to interact socially; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and more in females when freely swimming (females are more motivated to escape when exposed to males directly).</p><p>Notably, rises reliably occurred at the end of the playback stimulations (as also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kolodziejski et al., 2007</xref>), which could be explained by their use as probes to assess signal presence in case of abrupt interruptions or weakening of EOD mimics (either caused by objects occluding temporarily the EOD field – clutter – or by playback termination). Interestingly, rises were considered by other authors as ‘proximity signals’, although most likely with a different connotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>). Rises larger than those here considered (perhaps more similar to the ‘gradual frequency rises’ reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zupanc et al., 2001</xref>) were recently associated with chasing attempts (15% of the times) and physical contact (less than 5% of the times; Raab T, personal communication). However, these figures appear too small to allow reliable conclusions about the meaning potentially associated with these frequency modulations. Previous experiments reported the use of long rises (larger events compared to those we have labeled as rises) during agonistic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Raab et al., 2021</xref>). However, it is not clear whether these are aggressive signals (as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Raab et al., 2021</xref>) or de-escalating submissive signals (as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hopkins, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Serrano-Fernández, 2003</xref>). In our recordings rises are produced more or less with equal probability by female and male subjects (42.5% of all rises are produced by males, 57.5% by females) and yet, compared to other chirp types, their relative probability is higher in females (1.2% of all chirps in females vs 0.12% in males), although female brown ghosts are less frequently engaged in aggressive interactions.</p><p>Taken together, these considerations strongly indicate that the primary determinants of chirp rates are the locomotor activity levels and the necessity to locate other fish through the beat. In our experiments, the choice of chirp type appeared largely unaffected by the behavioral context in which chirps were recorded, while the degree of social interaction, as observed in comparisons between novel and experienced fish pairs, played a bigger role.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Probing with chirps</title><p>In this study we explore the possibility that chirps could improve the processing of spatial parameters associated to conspecific localization by enhancing beat processing. The frequent use of chirping during close physical interactions, suggests that whatever role chirps may play in beat processing, this may not necessarily be related to the mere localization of a beat source at a distance (such as most echolocation calls) but perhaps to other features detectable at close-range (such as size, orientation, direction, and motion). This could be achieved in at least three different ways. First, chirping could temporarily adjust beat frequency to levels better detectable by the electrosensory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastian et al., 2001</xref>). Second, chirps could be used to improve active electrolocation by briefly enhancing beat temporal resolution (all types of chirps will increase ELL pyramidal cell firing rates, acting on different input lines; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Marsat and Maler, 2010</xref>). Third, as previously discussed within this study, chirps could be used to enhance electrosensory responses to the beat. This may be achieved by simply enhancing the output of the primary electrosensory afferents (through synchronization of different types of input; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benda et al., 2006</xref>) or by phase-shifting the carrier EOD in correspondence of the <italic>destructive</italic> components of the beat cycles (i.e. the beat minima, as previously suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Field et al., 2019</xref>). Because the phase of interacting EODs is affected by both position and movement, phase shifts induced by chirps could be also aimed at recovering blind-spots forming on the electric images as a consequence of particular body positions, obstacles or even by motion (we show in fact that chirps can improve the EI contrast). Although chirp production has been previously reported to be phase-invariant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Metzen and Chacron, 2017</xref>), invariance here means that chirps are not produced at a specific EOD phase. Yet, this does not exclude the possibility that chirps could be used to briefly shift the EOD phase in order to avoid disruptive interferences caused by phase opposition (at the level of p-units). Therefore, this <italic>chirps-as-saccades</italic> idea could be still a valid hypothesis if one considers the effects of beat phase adjustment only at specific body locations (such as the head, which can be considered the ‘electrosensory fovea’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carr et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Castelló et al., 2000</xref>). In this view, chirping could be seen as an attempt to adaptively modify the incoming sensory input and maintain optimal contrast levels or a coherent sensory flow, as sniffing does for olfactory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hahn et al., 1994</xref>), whisking and finger movement for tactile sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Krammer et al., 2020</xref>) and saccades for vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Najemnik and Geisler, 2005</xref>). Future studies focused on the details of the EOD geometries and fish spatial coordinates during chirping will shed more light onto these matters.</p><p>In theory, chirps could also be used to improve electrolocation of objects as well (as opposed to the processing of the beat). Compared to other electric fish using pulse-type EODs, the frequency content of wave-type EODs is narrowly focused on limited components. The larger signal band-width (i.e. frequency content) of pulse EODs affords better object discrimination, when compared to wave-type EODs. However, given their lower production rates compared to the frequency of wave-type EOD cycles, EOD pulses grant a lower sampling rate and thus a poorer temporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crampton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastian, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Watson and Bastian, 1979</xref>). To compensate for this, EOD pulses are emitted at higher frequency during electrolocation bouts and locomotion in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jun et al., 2014</xref>). Conversely, for wave-type fish, chirping could represent a strategy to temporarily compensate for the lower frequency resolution while still being able to resolve EOD perturbations with a good temporal definition. Conducting combined video and playback experiments with a more specific focus on target-reaching behaviors could potentially elucidate whether this is the case. In addition, testing beat detection capabilities at different frequencies (or DFs) would be another important experimental approach to evaluate the probing hypothesis.</p><p>If this idea finds further support, the question arises as to why not all gymnotiforms electrolocate using the same strategy. It may be that a trade-off exists between space- and time-resolution in the evolution and maintenance of electrosensory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crampton, 2019</xref>). While broadband pulse signals may be useful to capture highly complex environments rich in foliage, roots and other structures common in the more superficial habitats in which pulse-type fish live, wave-type EODs may be a better choice in the relatively simpler river-bed environments in which many wave-type fish live (e.g. the benthic zone of deep river channels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crampton, 2019</xref>). In this case, achieving a good spatial resolution is critical during social encounters, especially considering the limited utility of visual cues in these low light conditions. In such habitats, social encounters may be less ‘abrupt’, but spatially less ‘conspicuous’ or blurred (as a 3D electric field may be). In such a scenario, chirps could serve as a means to supplement the spatial information acquired via the beat, accentuating these cues during periods of reduced resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While our results do not completely rule out the possibility of chirps serving a role in social communication, the high stereotypy and auto-correlation of chirp time-series, along with the absence of any meaningful social correlate of chirping, suggests this scenario to be unlikely. Given the clear distance threshold at which chirps are produced, the correlation with locomotion and the increase of chirping in cluttered environments, chirp production mirrors the emission of other self-referenced signals used to gather spatial information obtained from a nearby source (such as echolocation calls; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siemers et al., 2009</xref>). Could chirps be useful for both electrocommunication and electrolocation functions? Or more simply, could chirping be ascribed simultaneously to different functional tasks?</p><p>Signals with such dual function (i.e. echolocation and behavioral referencing) may be a rare find in nature (eavesdropped signals can become cues for localization purposes but are not intentionally produced with that aim), whereas it is more likely that signals directly affecting both senders and receivers do so by delivering the same type of information (i.e. spatial, in this case). In this scenario, probing cues could function simultaneously as proximity signals to signal presence, deter approaches, or coordinate behaviors like spawning, if properly timed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, if chirps would be referenced to specific behavioral states – as posed by the <italic>communication-hypothesis</italic> – the variable rate of chirp production across individuals and the infrequent production of chirp types other than type 2 chirps would render such a communication channel unreliable, semantically limited, and potentially incompatible with previously attributed functions of chirps.</p><p>In echolocating species, the effectiveness of active sensing has been demonstrated to rely significantly on environmental complexity and spatial features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fenton and Bell, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Siemers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fouda et al., 2018</xref>). Considering chirps as probing cues, knifefish might adaptively use different types of chirps based on the features of the foreign EOD source (frequency, position, location, orientation, distance, etc.) and the structure of the habitat. We emphasize the role of chirps as homeoactive signals – as opposed to alloactive – to underline the fact that chirps represent active modulations of signal frequency possibly aimed at optimizing the otherwise passive responses to the beat, occurring continuously and unintentionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zweifel and Hartmann, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, although our behavioral experiments may not offer a comprehensive causal understanding of chirps and behavior, they do shed light on the potential and, in part, hitherto unexplored roles of chirping. The aim is to stir the pot and initiate a discussion on possible alternative functions of chirps beyond their presumed communication role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>A total of 234 <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic> of both sexes – age ranging between 2 and 3 years – were obtained from tropical fish importers and housed in individual 80x35 x 40 cm aquariums under a 12/12 light cycle. Fish were allocated to the different experiments as follows: 130 for the assessment of context-dependent effects on chirping, 16 fish were used for the playback experiments, 14 fish were used for the playback experiments involving EOD frequency ramps, 24 fish were used for the chirp-behavior correlative analysis, 30 fish were used in the novel environment exploration assay, 12 fish were used to assess the environment effects on chirping and 8 to assess the impact of clutter on the fish responses to playback EODs. In all groups both sexes were equally represented. Throughout the experiments, the water was continuously filtered, water conductivity was maintained between 150–300 µS cm<sup>–1</sup>, temperature between 23–26°C and pH between 6–8. The hometank environment consisted of PVC shelter tubes and plastic plants. The fish were fed three times a week with red mosquito larvae. Prior to each experiment, the fish’s EOD frequency (EODf), body length and weight were measured. To identify their sex, the EODf was normalized to a water temperature of 25.0 °C using a Q<sub>10</sub> of 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dunlap and Ragazzi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunlap et al., 2000</xref>).

Tank compartments were separated by a plastic mesh barrier to allow electrical but no physical interaction. EOD recordings were conducted using 2 graphite electrodes placed on opposite sides of the tank (1 pair per compartment).

Dominance was assessed by means of shelter-competition tests prior to EOD recordings. These tests consisted of 30 min long trials in which fish pairs were allowed to interact freely and compete for the occupancy of a plastic shelter tube positioned in one of the three compartments of a tripartite aquarium (1 pair per aquarium).

In a separate set of recordings, male and female pairs were subject to water conductivity changes to simulate the onset of the breeding season: during the course of a 4-week period water conductivity was lowered from 400 to 100 µS cm<sup>–1</sup> (novel fish in high conductivity water = <italic>no breeding</italic>, experienced fish in low conductivity water = <italic>breeding season</italic>). Although, the term ‘breeding’ here refers to the context and not to the actual behavioral repertoire displayed by the fish, this treatment resulted in 6/8 female fish to show evident signs of developed eggs (no post-mortem exam was used to confirm egg presence in the other two fish) while in other fish cohorts (housed in larger aquariums and with improved shelters) we successfully obtained newly spawned fish. At the end of this period, fish were allowed to swim freely and interact without mesh barriers (experienced fish in low conductivity water = breeding + free). Recordings from such pairs were compared with naïve male-female pairs freely swimming in high conductivity (400 µS cm<sup>–1</sup>) water (naïve fish in high conductivity water = no breeding +free).

Each playback trial (50 s with a 5 s time of fade-in and fade-out) had a 180 s inter-trial interval.

The camera was set to acquire a frame every 500 samples of the EOD recording (1 s=20,000 samples) through a TTL channel of the digital acquisition device (NI USB 6211 National Instruments).

A total of 12 fish pairs were first habituated for 30 min to the testing aquarium (30x80 cm) in presence of a mesh divider. Right after, the divider was removed and fish were allowed to interact freely for another 30 min. Both their EODs and behaviors were recorded in both sessions. During the habituation session, most fish remained in proximity to the barrier, parallel to it, swimming back and forth or stationary. Some fish remained stationary in a corner of their tank compartment, others swam more often exploring their surroundings. In the freely swimming session, fish often continued their exploration rounds before interacting more closely. This often implied a repeated circling of the whole tank contour. Interactions often started with backward swimming (a behavior we referred to as ‘knife’), often resolving in a reciprocal backward tail-to-tail approach (‘tail1’). In some cases, one of the two fish would flicker the tail in rapid movements (‘tail waving’, or ‘tail2’). From this positioning, fish would often slide onto each other to begin a more direct physical interaction (‘wrestle’). This would often imply locomotion (‘loc’) towards one end of the tank. When reaching a corner fish would either disengage and part ways or start an aggressive interaction, visible through either head butts (one fish hitting with the snout the flank of the other, ‘head’) or – somehow more frequently – though bites directed to the head of the other fish (‘atk’). Less commonly, the attacking fish would quiver their jaws (‘jaw’) prior to either an attack (directed to the head or the flank) or a chasing attempt (‘ch’). The number and extent of such encounters varied considerably across fish pairs: in some cases, it lasted for the whole duration of the recording, while in others fish were just resting at opposite sides of the tank.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Boundary element model and electric images</title><p>The results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (electric images) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref> (electric field) were calculated using the boundary element method (BEM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pedraja et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hofmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rother, 2003</xref>). This model comprises two main components: a geometric reconstruction of the fish’s body and a calculation of the transcutaneous field by solving the Poisson equation for the fish boundary.</p><p>Briefly, the BEM method determines the boundary electrical distributions by solving a linear system of M x N equations, where M represents poles and N represents nodes. The unknown variables in this system are the trans-epithelial current density and potential at each node. These variables are computed for each node and linearly interpolated for the triangles defined by the nodes, which form the geometry of the fish and objects. Fish geometry as well as internal and skin conductivities were modeled using realistic information.</p><p>Furthermore, the BEM method allows for the concatenation of multiple instants, enabling the rendering of an entire sequence of electric fields and resulting electric images incorporating realistic electric organ discharge (EOD) characteristics such as waveform, duration, and frequencies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pedraja et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, electric images were computed for each fish position and chirp scenario by simulating various phases (the simulations started with eight equally spaced phase relationships between the sender and receiver EODs). The integral of the voltage change over time was calculated throughout the entire duration of the chirp (analysis window = 500ms), ensuring consistent timing for both chirp and non-chirp conditions across 835 body nodes.</p><p>The “Δ chirp-beat” shown for the chirp sender and the receiver in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> represents the cumulative change in voltage across the entire body surface during a chirp, compared to the same time window without a chirp.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Beat decay estimates</title><p>The beat dissipation range in our experimental conditions was estimated by recording the interaction of two EOD mimics (a static reference electrode pair and another identical electrode pair, placed parallel to it, as a moving source) at increasing distances and in the same water conditions as in our recordings (conductivity 200 μS/cm and temperature 25 °C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>). Both the reference and the moving EOD mimic were scaled to natural fish signals (1 mV/cm, measured at 2–3 cm from the playback dipoles). Recordings were made placing recording electrodes at opposite poles of the reference electrodes while shifting the moving source with 5 cm steps up to 60 cm away. The EOD field intensity generated by both reference and moving electrodes was recorded for 5 s at each distance step, always at the extremities of the reference pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Environmental manipulations</title><p>Fish pairs were exposed to changing environmental conditions in the experiments illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.

The first step implied a measurement of the power density in the FFT of the recorded signal (FFT parameters: window size = 2^12; overlap = 90%) within the range set by the fundamental frequency and the first harmonic component (EODf - 5 Hz and 2 x EOD - 100 Hz). Chirps were detected as peaks in the power density. The manual validation consisted of a survey of the detected chirps to eliminate false positives. False negatives were estimated at a rate lower than 10%. Although the two electrode pairs used in each aquarium would detect EODs from both fish, chirps were properly assigned to the sender based on signal intensity and the baseline EOD frequency of the two fish, when possible (EODs generated by a fish will have higher intensity if recorded by electrodes placed in the same compartment). Notably, other authors reported the occurrence of more than two types of large chirps (namely: type 3-6), we included all those in one single group based on the distribution of our data and considering the absence of any obvious clustering for large chirps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Factor analysis mixed data - I</title><p>Factor analysis was conducted using the R package FactoMiner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pagès, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Josse and Husson, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Factor analysis of mixed data (FAMD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) is equivalent to a principal component analysis adapted to analyze mixed datasets, containing both quantitative and qualitative variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pagès, 2004</xref>) and explore their associations.

Quantitative and qualitative variables are normalized in order to balance the influence of each set.</p><p>A total of 30,486 sampled chirps were used. For each chirp, the following qualitative and quantitative variables were considered: frequency_modulation (peak of EOD instant frequency during chirp), chirp duration (instant frequency peak duration), EOD frequency of the sender (EODs), EOD frequency of the receiver (EODr), EOD_amplitude (amplitude of the EOD sinewave during chirp), power (chirp triggered EOD intensity), water temperature, water conductivity, chirp timestamp, weight and length of the sender fish, weight and length of the receiver fish, sender and receiver sex, status of the sender and receiver fish (experience with the recording aquarium), fish ID (to account for interindividual variability), chirp type (categorized as above), state (based on the experience with the other fish of the pair).</p><p>A first model (three dimensions, model#1, dim1 17.46%, dim2 15.76%, dim3 10.67%) was made considering all variables listed above.

For each chirp, the following qualitative and quantitative variables were considered: the percentage of time spent near the tank wall (‘wall’), the percentage of time spent in the tank open space (‘open’), percentage of time spent in the shelter area (‘shelter’), the percentage of time spent within a rectangular area 10 cm around the conspecific location (‘social’), the percentage of time spent investigating the novel object (‘object’), the time at which chirps were produced (‘timestamp’), the chirp type, the fish ID, the EOD frequency of the freely swimming fish, the EOD frequency of the caged fish, the sex of the chirp sender, the sex of the chirp receiver, the DF (i.e. EOD frequency difference between sender and receiver), the distance between sender and receiver (‘distance’), the average speed of the sender (‘avg speed’), the angle between sender and receiver (referred to the a horizontal axis delineated by the tube, ‘angle’), the interference estimate weighed on the distance (i.e. calculated on a beat resulting from EODs attenuated as a function of distance, ‘actual interference’) and the maximum beat interference possible for a given chirp (i.e. without distance attenuation, ‘interference’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-4"><title>Chirp transitions and time-series cross-correlation</title><p>The number of chirp transitions present in each recording (dataset used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) was measured by searching in a string array containing the four chirp types per fish pair, all their possible pairwise permutations (i.e. all possible permutations of 4+4 = 8 elements are: 1–1, 1–2, 1–3 … 7–6, 7–7, 7–8; considering the following legend 1=fish1 type 1, 2=fish 1 type 2, 3=fish1 type 3 … 6=fish2 type 2, 7=fish2 type 3 and 8=fish2 rise). The number of each chirp-type transition was then used to create a 4x4 frequency matrix. Chirp transition diagrams were obtained by calculating the median of such frequency matrices calculated for different fish pairs. Chirp time series were extracted from each recording and binned (50ms) to evaluate the cross-correlation index within a +–2 s lag window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-5"><title>Chirp interference</title><p>Chirp interference was calculated as the cumulative duration of outlier beat inter-peak intervals (IPI) after calculating the beat envelope for each chirp/DF combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). Gaussian chirps were generated on top of a constant frequency carrier of 862 Hz (arbitrarily chosen) and the beat resulting from a paired sinewave with a frequency within ±300 Hz of 862 Hz. The frequency modulation and duration of gaussian chirps were determined by setting the sigma and the amplitude of the peak and by measuring the actual peak size of the instant frequency (‘medfreq’ MATLAB function). This was obtained from the FFT analysis of the chirping signal (window size 2^12, 90% overlap, sampling frequency 20 kHz). For each chirp, beat peaks (i.e. the peaks of the amplitude modulation, AM) were detected searching for local maxima in the signal first-order envelope. Adjacent beat peaks were used to calculate beat cycle durations for the whole segment. The different impact of different types of chirps on the beat would result in different populations of beat cycles (depending on the beat frequency, the duration and FM of the chirp). Outliers in the beat cycle durations resulting from each chirp were used as a measure of how a given chirp would perturbate the otherwise regular beat cycles. Beat cycle outliers were detected using a MATLAB built-in function – ‘isoutlier’ – with the ‘quartile’ setting to include peak durations on both tails of the peak distribution (below 25% and above the 75% quartiles). The interference value for each chirp was obtained by dividing the cumulative outlier beat cycle duration (i.e. the total duration of beat cycles significantly affected by the chirp) by the overall duration of the beat peaks. The duration of each beat cycle corresponded to the difference in time between consecutive beat peaks. In this way, the effect of a chirp could be weighted on the number of peaks (i.e. the beat frequency). The beat interference is calculated within a fixed time window (700ms, but see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig10">Appendix 1—figure 10</xref> for wider windows) which corresponds to the median inter-chirp interval (ICI; median = 0.6987) calculated for 30486 chirps (130 chirp time-series) and is centered around the chirp (chirp peak is always at 350ms). This parameter is used to provide an estimate of the effect of a chirp in its immediate temporal surround.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-6"><title>Text-mining analysis of chirp-behavior sequences</title><p>A text-mining approach was used to identify correlations between behaviors and chirp types in text strings containing both (pooled data from 12 fish pairs of mixed sexes) using KH Coder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Higuchi, 2016</xref>). KH Coder is open-source software designed for computer-assisted qualitative data analysis, with a focus on quantitative content analysis, text mining, and applications in computational linguistics. After creating a word dataset including all the occurrences of chirps and behaviors in string form (words) conserving their temporal order, we have used KH Coder to perform a co-occurrence analysis and a multidimensional scaling. The first aims at analyzing text identifying potential relationships between words. By definition, co-occurrence networks are represented as interconnected networks based on the paired presence of words within a specified unit of text. The second, multidimensional scaling (MDS), is a means of visualizing the level of similarity of individual words based on their appearance pattern within a dataset. MDS is used to translate information about the pairwise 'distances' among a set of words into a configuration of points mapped into an abstract cartesian space.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-7"><title>Statistics on chirp counts</title><p>The numbers of chirps produced during the experiments assessing the effect of environmental factors on chirp rate production were compared using the Friedman’s test (non-parametric ANOVA for repeated measures) as data were not following a Gaussian distribution.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88287-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All information required to replicate these experiments has been provided in the Materials and methods section of the manuscript.

While this equation is useful to describe the static dependency of field intensity on distance for any measuring point in space, electric fields can also be represented as the vector sum of electric gradients. The formula describing field gradients can be obtained from the formula above by resolving it for each charge in the system with reference to a given point in space moving through it. The field is instantaneously generated by the 2 dipole charges, and so can be described by the formula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Knudsen, 1975</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mfenced open="[" close="]" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> clearly shows that within an electric field, the voltage drops with the cube of distance. At double the distance, the field amplitude drop is 8-fold (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benda, 2020</xref> for a recent and exhaustive description of the physical properties of weakly electric fields). According to these considerations, the range at which brown ghosts can realistically detect other electric fields depends on whether or not active electrolocation is used. In fact, while the dipole moment generated by an EOD alone dissipates according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, the amplitude modulation (AM) resulting from the interaction of 2 or more EODs depends on the decay constants of all composing signals. Now, it is known that brown ghosts are not capable of detecting single EODs and reading their absolute voltage values, rather they sense the AM generated by the interacting EODs (i.e. the <italic>beat</italic>). From the amplitude of these AMs (i.e. the <italic>beat contrast</italic>), brown ghosts can infer the relative distance, the size and even the rate of motion of an approaching conspecific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assad et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babineau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>). The beat contrast can be easily calculated as the ratio of the amplitude of the detected signal and the EOD amplitude of the receiver fish (A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>0</sub>x100). Behavioral experiments have shown that responses to beats can be elicited in different knifefish species at electric field gradients as low as a few μV/cm (0.6 μV/cm in <italic>Eigenmannia virescens</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kaunzinger and Kramer, 1995</xref>; 0.2 μV/cm <italic>Sternopygus macrurus</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fleishman et al., 1992</xref> and <italic>Apteronotus albifrons</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Knudsen, 1974</xref>). In <italic>Eigenmannia virescens</italic>, behavioral responses to EOD AMs were observed at 0.02–0.03% beat contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carr et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kawasaki, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kawasaki, 1997</xref>), although other authors reported for the same species slightly higher values (0.16% contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rose and Heiligenberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rose and Heiligenberg, 1985</xref>). Although beat detection thresholds in <italic>Eigenmannia virescens</italic> and brown ghosts may slightly differ, estimates of field gradient sensitivity have been estimated to be similarly low in brown ghosts (0.1 μV/cm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rasnow and Bower, 1996</xref>). Therefore, we could expect similar beat sensitivity levels also in this species. Based on these considerations, we determined the values of EOD amplitude and beat contrast for a reference fish generating an electric field resulting in an average 5 mV voltage measure around its body and a 1.25 mV/cm field gradient starting at 2 cm distance. The average voltage was estimated from skin measurements conducted in brown ghosts and referenced to a ground electrode placed at “infinite” distance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rasnow and Bower, 1996</xref>). At 2 cm distance and starting from 5 mV, the average voltage drops at 1.25 mV (according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) so choosing this value as a starting point for field measurements at the same distance represents a slight overestimation (the electric field decays with the cube of distance according to in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>). Beat contrast is estimated with reference to the first value and only estimates from further distances are shown.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Detecting beat at a distance.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88287-app1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the diagram, electric field ranges are represented by the oval shaped lines drawn around the fish and are based on the voltage values obtained using the equations above. Ranges for passive electrolocation (dotted line) are indicated for reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lissmann and Machin, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">von der Emde, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Knudsen, 1974</xref>). The beat contrast values obtained are plotted as a function of distance. The example illustrates the following situation: a 1.25 mV/cm field is used as reference (on the right) and the beat induced by a neighboring 0.7 mV/cm field at different distances is calculated. The composite signals obtained at representative distances are displayed by the graphs on the top together (blue) with their AM (red). The value in (3) is the lowest possible contrast level at which the moving fish can be detected and corresponds to a limit distance of about 60 cm between the two fish. This estimate is close to the reported range for chirping (32 cm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henninger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zupanc et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hupé et al., 2008</xref>) and EOD envelope processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fotowat et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>As mentioned, active electrolocation of conspecifics implies the summation of 2 or more EODs and the detection of the resulting beat. Because the maximum amplitude of the resulting composite signals is higher than each component - and because beat contrast is calculated using a different reference depending on the receiver - the threshold for beat detection depends on the decay of the contributing signals and is represented by the minimum AM detectable by each fish (other_EOD/own_EOD*100). For example, if a “fish 1” producing a 1.25 mV EOD swims near a “fish 2” conspecific having a 0.7 mV EOD, when they are 16 cm apart, the maximum AM produced by the 2 EODs can be roughly EOD1+EOD2 = (1.25+0.0014) mV, which corresponds to a beat contrast of 0.14%. For fish 2: EOD2+EOD1 = (0.7+0.002) mV, corresponding to a beat contrast of 0,28%. Therefore, at any given distance, different fish will detect beats of different amplitudes. It follows that, if beat detection thresholds can be considered comparable in all brown ghosts, fish with EODs of lower amplitude (usually fish of smaller size such as juveniles or females), will have a wider beat detection range.</p><fig id="app1fig2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 2.</label><caption><title>Chirping in different social contexts and different tank experience conditions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Total chirp counts obtained from resident-intruder assays.

These include environment (free vs divided fish, with or without clutter), breeding state, gender, intruder vs resident, social status, locomotion state and social and environmental experience, without and with playback experiments. It applies state-of-the-art methods for reducing the dimensionality of the data and finding patterns of correlation between different kinds of variables (factor analysis, K-means). The strength of the evidence, collated from a large number of trials with many controls, leads to the conclusion that the traditionally assumed communication function of chirps may be secondary to its role in environmental assessment and exploration that takes social context into account. Based on their extensive analyses, the authors suggest that chirps are mainly used as probes that help detect beats caused by other fish as well as objects.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work is based on completely novel recordings using interaction chambers. The amount of new data and associated analyses is simply staggering, and yet, well organized in presentation. The study further evaluates the electric field strength around a fish (via modelling with the boundary element method) and how its decay parallels the chirp rate, thereby relating the above variables to electric field geometry. The BEM modelling also convincingly predicts how the electric image of a receiver conspecific on a sending fish is enhanced by a chirp.</p><p>The main conclusions are that the lack of any significant behavioural correlates for chirping, and the lack of temporal patterning in chirp time series, cast doubt on a primary communication goal for most chirps. Rather, the key determinants of chirping are the difference in frequency between two interacting conspecifics as well as individual subjects' environmental and social experience. The paper concludes that there is a lack of evidence for stereotyped temporal patterning of chirp time series, as well as of sender-receiver chirp transitions beyond the known increase in chirp frequency during an interaction. The authors carefully submit that the new putative echolocation function of chirps is not mutually exclusive with a possible communication function.</p><p>These conclusions by themselves will be very useful to the field. They will also allow scientists working on other &quot;communication&quot; systems to perhaps reconsider and expand the goals of the probes used in those senses. A lot of data are summarized in this paper, with thorough referencing to past work.</p><p>The alternative hypotheses that arise from the work are that chirps are mainly used as environmental probes for better beat detection and processing and object localization, and in this sense are self-directed signals. This led to their prediction that environmental complexity (&quot;clutter&quot;) should increase chirp rate, which is fact was revealed by their new experiments. The authors also argue that waveform EODs have less power across high spatial frequencies compared to pulse-type fish, with a resulting relatively impoverished power of resolution. Chirping in wave-type fish could temporarily compensate for the lower frequency resolution while still being able to resolve EOD perturbations with a good temporal definition (which pulse-type fish lack due to low pulse rates).</p><p>The authors also advance the interesting idea that the sinusoidal frequency modulations caused by chirps are the electric fish's solution to the minute (and undetectable by neural wetware) echo-delays available to it, due to the propagation of electric fields at the speed of light in water.

Overall the study has been improved by the revision. However, one piece of new data is perplexing to me. The new figure 7 presents the results of a model analysis of the strength of the EI caused by a second fish to localize when the focal fish is chirping. From my understanding of this type of model, EOD frequency is not a parameter in the model since it evaluates the strength of the field at a given point in time. Therefore the only thing that matters is the phase relationship and strength of the EOD. Assuming that the second fish's EOD is kept constant and the phase relationship is also the same, the only difference during a chirp that could affect the result of the calculation is the potential decrease in EOD amplitude during the chirp. It is indeed logical that if the focal fish decreased its EOD amplitude the target fish's EOD becomes relatively stronger. Where things are harder to understand is why the different types of chirps (e.g. type 1 vs type 2) lead to the same increase in signal even though they are typically associated with different levels of amplitude modulations. Also, it is hard to imagine that a type 2 chirp that is barely associated with any decrease in EOD amplitude (0-10% maybe), would cause a doubling of the EI strength. There might be something I don't understand but the authors should provide a lot more details on how this result is obtained and convince us that it makes sense.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope we have now resolved the Reviewer’s concerns by applying major edits to Figure 7. We now use voltage - not current - to quantify the impact of chirps on electric images. The effect of chirps is here estimated using the integral of the beat AM, as a broad measure of the potential effects chirping may have on electroreceptors. We underline in the text that this analysis does not represent proof for any type of processing occurring in the fish brain, but we only express in hypothetical terms that - based on the beat perturbations measured - additional spatial information may potentially be available in electric images, as a consequence of chirping. Whether the fish uses this information, or not, needs to be assessed through electrophysiology in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the reviewer is concerned about this sentence in the rebuttal - &quot;The methods section has been edited to clarify the approach (not yet)&quot;. This section is unfinished, which suggests that it is difficult to explain the modeling results from a logical point of view. Thus the reviewer's major concern from the previous review remains unresolved. To summarize, the model calculates field strengths at an instant in time and integrates over time with a 500 ms window. This window is 10 times longer than the small chirps, while the longer chirps cover a much larger proportion of the window. Yet, the small chirps have a bigger impact on discriminability than the longer chirps. The authors should attempt to explain this seemingly contradictory result. This remains a major issue because this analysis was the most direct evidence that chirping could impact localization accuracy.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new method section describing the new figure and hopefully it is explaining more clearly how the effect of chirps is calculated. Since most p-units are affected by the beat cyclic AMs, any change on the electric image caused by a chirp will result in changes in transcutaneous voltage - i.e. the voltage measurable at the receptor level. Overall, this added analysis is not a central point of the manuscript, it is part of an attempt to hint to physiological mechanisms implied which cannot be explored in the current study. We do not mean to propose that these estimates represent alternatives to electrophysiological recordings, rather theoretical evidences which could in fact support this type of investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review)</bold>:</p><p>Studying Apteronotus leptorhynchus (the weakly electric brown ghost knifefish), the authors provide evidence that 'chirps' (brief modulations in the frequency and amplitude of the ongoing wave-like electric signal) function in active sensing (specifically homeoactive sensing) rather than communication.
