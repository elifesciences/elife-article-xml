Here we visualize the dynamic cell morphologies of tangentially migrating SN-mDA neurons in 3D and identify two distinct migration modes. Slow migration is the default mode in SN-mDA neurons, while fast, laterally-directed migration occurs infrequently and is strongly associated with bipolar cell morphology. Tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons is altered in absence of Reelin signaling, but it is unclear whether Reelin acts directly on migrating SN-mDA neurons and how it affects their cell morphology and migratory behavior. By specifically inactivating Reelin signaling in mDA neurons we demonstrate its direct role in SN-mDA tangential migration. Reelin promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopaminergic system</kwd><kwd>Dab1</kwd><kwd>time-lapse imaging</kwd><kwd>organotypic slice cultures</kwd><kwd>cell tracking</kwd><kwd>cell morphology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001655</institution-id><institution>Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaswani</surname><given-names>Ankita Ravi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008131</institution-id><institution>Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gradute Student Support (BONFOR) and Fellowship for Mid-Career Scientists (Maria von Linden-Programm)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaswani</surname><given-names>Ankita Ravi</given-names></name><name><surname>Blaess</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-HEALTH-F4-2013- 738 602278-Neurostemcellrepair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weykopf</surname><given-names>Beatrice</given-names></name><name><surname>Brüstle</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BL 767/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blaess</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BL 767/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blaess</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BL 767/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blaess</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blaess</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first comprehensive insight into speed, trajectory and morphology profiles of tangentially migrating dopaminergic neurons and the alterations in their migratory behavior in absence of Reelin signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopaminergic neurons in the ventral midbrain (mDA neurons) are the major source of dopamine in the mammalian brain. Dysfunction in the dopaminergic system is associated with schizophrenia, addiction and depression, and degeneration of mDA neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN) results in the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grace and Bunney, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Volkow and Morales, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Przedborski, 2017</xref>). mDA neurons originate in the floor plate of the ventral mesencephalon, from where they migrate to cluster into the laterally-positioned SN, the medially-located ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the posterior retrorubral field. SN-mDA neurons project predominantly to the dorsal striatum and modulate voluntary movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weisenhorn et al., 2016</xref>), while VTA-mDA neurons project to various forebrain targets, including the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens and basolateral amygdala, and are important for the regulation of cognitive function and reward behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>). How this anatomy is setup during development remains unclear. mDA neurons differentiation starts at embryonic day (E) 10.5 in the mouse, when the first mDA neurons that express tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis and a marker for differentiated mDA neurons, leave the ventricular zone of the ventral midbrain. Differentiated mDA neurons undergo a maturation process as they migrate to reach their final positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blaess and Ang, 2015</xref>). We have previously shown that both SN- and VTA-mDA neurons undergo radial migration into the mantle layer of the developing ventral midbrain where they remain intermingled until E13.5. Between E13.5 and E15.5, mDA neurons destined for the SN migrate tangentially to more lateral positions, resulting in the segregation of mDA neurons into the laterally-located SN and the medially-situated VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodea et al., 2014</xref>). This particular migration pattern suggests that SN-mDA neurons have the specific molecular machinery to respond to cues in their environment that direct their lateral migration. As exemplified by migration studies in cortical brain areas, a comprehensive characterization of migratory modes and accompanying changes in cell morphology is indispensable for unraveling the molecular mechanisms by which cell-type specific migratory behavior is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kriegstein and Noctor, 2004</xref>). So far, a detailed understanding of mDA neuronal migratory behavior has remained elusive due to challenges in visualizing migrating mDA neurons in sufficient detail.</p><p>At the molecular level, Reelin, an extracellular matrix molecule and known regulator of neuronal migration in various brain areas, is essential for the correct lateral localization of SN-mDA neurons. Reelin binds to its receptors APOER2 and VLDLR, and induces the phosphorylation of the intracellular transducer DAB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trommsdorff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hiesberger et al., 1999</xref>). Phosphorylated DAB1 then mediates Reelin signaling by regulating cell adhesive properties or cytoskeletal stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Howell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chai et al., 2009</xref>).

Whether Reelin affects tangential (lateral) mDA neuronal migration directly, or whether the failure of SN-mDA neurons to reach their final position in Reelin pathway mutants is due to alterations in glia fibers or neighboring neuronal populations has not been explored. Moreover, it is not understood how the loss of Reelin signaling alters dynamic migration processes of mDA neurons and which of the multiple signaling events downstream of Reelin plays a role in mDA neuronal migration.</p><p>Here, we dissect the complex dynamic morphological changes that underlie the tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons using 2-photon excitation time-lapse imaging and a semi-automated data analysis pipeline. We find that mDA neurons migrate in two modes: infrequent laterally-directed fast migration and frequent slow movement. We demonstrate that migrating mDA neurons undergo dynamic changes in cell morphology and show that fast, directed migratory spurts are strongly associated with bipolar morphology. Combining conditional gene inactivation, genetic fate mapping and time-lapse imaging, we demonstrate that Reelin affects mDA neuronal migration in a direct manner and promotes fast, laterally-directed migration of mDA neurons and stabilizes their leading process morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reelin signaling acts directly on tangentially migrating mDA neurons</title><p>As a first step to understand the regulation of mDA tangential migration by Reelin, we investigated whether Reelin signaling is directly required by mDA neurons for their correct lateral localization.

We defined these groups in the following manner: non-migratory cells with max-speeds of less than 10 μm/hr (control = 126/806, <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> = 205/844), ‘slow’ cells with max-speeds from 10 to 30 μm/hr (control = 355/806, <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> = 430/844), ‘moderate’ cells with max-speeds from 30 to 60 μm/hr (control = 186/806, <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> = 139/844) and fast’ cells with max-speeds &gt; 60 μm/hr, control = 139/806, <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> = 70/844) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Non-migratory cells failed to move more than 1.7 μm in any two consecutive frames of analysis and were not included into the further analysis. Using this classification, a lower percentage of SN-mDA neurons reached moderate or fast migration speeds in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices compared to controls, while the proportion of both non-migratory and ‘slow’ cells was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked how frequently migrating SN-mDA neurons moved with soma speeds comparable to their max-speeds and whether the fraction of total time-points spent in high migratory speeds was different in control and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> populations. To evaluate this, we used the criteria previously defined for max-speeds, but applied them to individual soma speeds for each cell at each time point. For example, we analyzed the fraction of time (percentage of total time-points) spent by each fast’ cell with a soma speed of more than 60 μm/hr (fast migratory phase), 30–60 μm/hr (moderate migratory phase), 10–30 μm/hr (slow migratory phase) and less than 10 μm/hr (resting phase). In control slices, ‘fast’, ‘moderate’ and ‘slow’ cells spent a predominant fraction of time at rest (62.6 ± 20%; 68.5 ± 18.2%, 85.7 ± 11.1%, respectively) and were frequently in a slow migratory phase (26.8 ± 17.4%, 25.1 ± 16.3%, 14.2 ± 11.1%, respectively). ‘Fast’ and ‘moderate’ cells achieved the moderate migratory phase in only a few frames (5.5 ± 5.5% and 6.3 ± 3.9, respectively), and the fast migratory phase (only in ‘fast’ cells) was equally infrequent (5.5 ± 2.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The amount of time SN-mDA neurons of the same max-speed group spent in the resting phase or in the respective migratory phases was comparable between individual cells in control and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these results demonstrate that SN-mDA migration has two distinct modes: a frequent slow migration phase seen in all migrating SN-mDA neurons and an infrequent moderate-to-fast phase occurring in a subset of SN-mDA neurons. These phases are superimposed over frequent periods of rest. Reelin signaling increases the proportion of migratory mDA neurons and the likelihood of moderate-to-fast movements in migrating mDA neurons. As moderate-to-fast migratory phases are only attained in very few frames in our experiments, the average speed distribution of SN-mDA neurons are however not changed in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices compared to control slices.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The Reelin-promoted infrequent fast movements of mDA neurons contribute to large directed cell displacements</title><p>We next asked whether max-speeds and directionality of migration were linked. We computed directionality as the ratio of total displacement (the 3D displacement between the initial and final positions of the neurons) to path length (the distance travelled by each neuron summed up irrespective of direction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petrie et al., 2009</xref>) for migrating SN-mDA populations in control and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices. A high value of directionality (maximum value = 1) indicates almost no change in migratory direction while low values indicate frequent changes in direction.

These data indicate that the infrequent moderate-to-fast movements in SN-mDA neurons result in major contributions to the directed migration of these cells.

Reelin signaling leads to the activation (phosphorylation) of PI3K (Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) through DAB1. PI3K activation results in phosphorylation (activation) of LIMK1 (Lim domain kinase 1) via Rac1/Cdc42 and PAK1. P-LIMK1 inactivates (phosphorylates) Cofilin1, an actin depolymerizing protein of the ADF/Cofilin family. Reelin-mediated inactivation of Cofilin 1 ultimately leads to the stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton and has been implicated in stabilizing LPs of radially migrating cortical neurons as well as in preventing the aberrant tangential migration of neurons of the autonomous nervous system in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maciver and Hussey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krüger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frotscher et al., 2017</xref>).

Studies in cortex have shown that while Reelin is directly required for the stabilization of the LP and for the orientation of radially-migrating cortical projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franco et al., 2011</xref>), Reelin also indirectly affects migration through regulating radial glia cell process extension, morphology and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hartfuss et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keilani and Sugaya, 2008</xref>). Tangentially migrating cortical interneurons are only indirectly affected by Reelin signaling: the improper cortical layering caused by defective radial migration in absence of Reelin signaling ultimately results in mispositioning of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yabut et al., 2007</xref>). Reelin also plays a role in interneuron precursors that undergo tangential chain migration to the olfactory bulb. However, it does not modulate tangential migration directly but rather acts as a detachment signal that regulates the switch form tangential chain migration to radial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hack et al., 2002</xref>). Evidence for a direct function of Reelin signaling in tangential neuronal migration comes from sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord. In these neurons, Reelin has been shown to stabilize LPs via the phosphorylation of during tangential migration thereby preventing aberrant migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phelps et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krüger et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To explore whether Reelin has a direct role in tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons, we inactivated <italic>Dab1</italic> in SN-mDA neurons starting at the onset of their tangential migration without affecting their earlier radial migration step and without inactivating <italic>Dab1</italic> in other cell populations in the ventral midbrain. The similarity in mediolateral distribution of SN-mDA neurons in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and in <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO implies that Reelin signaling has a direct effect on migrating SN-mDA neurons. We also confirmed that the GIRK2-expressing mDA population, which consists of lateral VTA- and SN-mDA neurons was distributed in a similar manner than what we reported previously for <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodea et al., 2014</xref>). Investigation of additional markers that label SN-mDA neurons more specifically, such as <italic>Lmo3</italic> and SOX6, showed that the medially misplaced SN-mDA neurons were partially intermingled with VTA-mDA neurons, but only at the border between SN and lateral VTA. These results imply that in absence of Reelin signaling in mDA neurons, the separation of SN- and VTA-mDA neurons is not fully completed and SN-mDA neurons lose their ability to undergo the long-range tangential migration necessary to form the laterally-positioned SN. Thus, our findings are the first demonstration of Reelin as a direct regulator of tangential neuronal migration in the brain.</p><p>Interestingly, the inactivation of <italic>Dab1</italic> in mDA neurons and the disorganization of the SN and VTA did not obviously alter the density of projections to the striatum. This indicates that the axons of mislocalized mDA neurons may still find their way and correct position in the medial forebrain bundle and then rely on intrinsic markers (cell adhesion molecules) to navigate to their particular projection target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brignani and Pasterkamp, 2017</xref>). However, deeper insight into the consequences of the migratory phenotype on the connectivity of mDA neurons would require further experiments such as specific tracing of projections from SN neurons or single cell labeling to visualize individual axonal arbors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Reelin protein is localized in the lateral ventral midbrain</title><p>In the ventral midbrain, <italic>Reelin</italic> mRNA is restricted to the cells of the red nucleus at E13.5 and E14.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Using immunostaining, we show that Reelin protein is distributed more broadly at these stages. Strong labeling is seen in regions lateral to the migrating SN-mDA, while weaker staining is observed in the area where SN-mDA neurons are localized. Thus, the Reelin protein distribution that we describe here is consistent with a direct role of Reelin in regulating SN-mDA migration. Whether the red nucleus is the only source for Reelin in the ventral midbrain or whether there are additional sources remains to be investigated. Mouse mutants in which the RN is only partially formed do not show any obvious displacement of SN-mDA neurons (at least not up to E18.5), suggesting that other Reelin sources could be important for mDA migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Prakash et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Reelin</italic> mRNA is expressed anterior to the SN, in the hypothalamus and ventral thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcántara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen Institute, 2015</xref>). Moreover, it has been proposed that Reelin is transported from the striatum to the SN via axons in the striatonigral pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nishikawa et al., 2003</xref>). Indeed, Reelin is expressed in the early differentiating cells in the striatum, but the striatonigral pathway is only established (E17 in rat) after the critical time period for SN-mDA migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fishell and van der Kooy, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcántara et al., 1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Reelin promotes the proportion of mDA neurons undergoing fast, directed migration</title><p>The visualization and tracking of a large population of migrating mDA neurons, and the subsequent categorization of the instantaneous soma speed of individual mDA neurons into slow, moderate and fast phases revealed that irrespective of their max-speed, mDA neurons spent a majority of their time at rest. During their migratory phase, mDA neurons move mostly at slow speed. Moderate-to-fast laterally-directed migration spurts that result in large displacements are infrequent and occur in only a subset of labeled mDA neurons during the time-window of imaging. Thus, mDA neurons migrate in two modes: in a frequent, slow mode and in infrequent, fast movements with a strong lateral orientation. A similar pattern of migration with variable instantaneous speeds and periods of rest has also been reported for newly generated granule cells in the dentate gyrus and for cortical projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simó et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Comparing mDA tangential migration in the presence and absence of Reelin signaling, we observed that the duration of the individual migratory phases as well as average speed distribution of mDA neurons was comparable between control and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices, while the likelihood of moderate-to-fast migration events was decreased in mDA neurons in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices. In addition, a higher proportion of mDA neurons spent the entire imaging period at rest. Hence, Reelin promotes the likelihood with which moderate-to-fast migration spurts occur and increases the proportion of cells that enter a migratory phase.</p><p>Interestingly, the increased presence of activated DAB1 in cortical projection neurons – as a consequence of reduced ubiquitination and degradation in absence of the E3 ubiquitin Ligase Cullin-5 <underline>–</underline>leads to the opposite effect in the migratory behavior of these neurons: periods of rest are decreased and average as well as instantaneous speed is increased at late stages of cortical migration (E16.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simó et al., 2010</xref>). This would be consistent with the role of Reelin that we observe in the migration of mDA neurons. In contrast, average speed appears not to be altered in cortical neurons of <italic>reeler</italic> mutants at this stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chai et al., 2016</xref>). Observation of cortical projection neurons in their multipolar-to-bipolar transition phase at E15.5 suggests yet another effect of Reelin: at this stage cortical neurons were observed to migrate faster in the absence of Reelin signaling while addition of exogenous Reelin slowed down migrating neurons, but only within the subventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Britto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Britto et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, even in the same neuronal population, Reelin signaling might have diverse effects on the speed of neuronal migration at different stages of migration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reelin promotes a preference for directed migration</title><p>While moderate-to-fast migratory events are less likely in the <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mDA population, individual moderate-to-fast <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mDA neurons are equally laterally-directed as control mDA neurons.

Whether this increase in isotropy in ‘slow’ cells reflects a general change in the behavior of this group or is specifically due to the population of ‘fast’ and ‘moderate’ cells that are now shifted into the ‘slow’ cell category cannot be resolved from our data. The loss of the laterally-directed slow movements might interfere with mDA neuron’s ability to initiate moderate-to-fast, laterally-directed spurts. Indeed, mDA neurons have an aberrant orientation in E13.5 <italic>reeler</italic> brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bodea et al., 2014</xref>). In the cortex, Reelin regulates orientation and cell polarity of multipolar neurons in the intermediate zone facilitating their switch to bipolar, glia-dependent migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jossin and Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gärtner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gil-Sanz et al., 2013</xref>). Cortical projection neurons in their early phase of migration have been shown to deviate from radial migratory trajectories, in the absence of Reelin signaling as well as in the presence of exogenous Reelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Britto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Britto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chai et al., 2016</xref>). Reelin also promotes directionality during the radial migration of dentate gyrus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study provides evidence that mDA neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells homozygous or heterozygous for a <italic>REELIN</italic> deletion show a disruption in their directed migratory behavior in neurosphere assays. Since the disruption occurs in absence of any organized tissue structure, Reelin signaling seems to modulate the ability of mDA neurons for directed migration independently of a specific pattern of Reelin protein deposition in the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arioka et al., 2018</xref>). In conclusion, Reelin appears to be a crucial factor in enabling SN-mDA neurons to initiate directed migration rather than a factor that guides SN-mDA neurons in a particular direction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Reelin signaling promotes stable morphologies in SN-mDA neurons</title><p>We show that moderate and fast movements of mDA neurons are strongly associated with bipolar morphologies both in control and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices. Bipolarity is still predominant in slow phases, but about a third of the slow phases are associated with a multipolar morphology. In control slices, more than half of mDA neurons maintain a bipolar morphology throughout the imaging period, while about 40% transition between multipolar and bipolar morphologies. Only a small subset of cells (about 10%) stays multipolar at all timepoints. In absence of Reelin signaling, the percentage of transitionary cells is significantly increased, and the proportion of stable bipolar cells is decreased. Interestingly, the increase in the proportion of transitionary cells in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices is particularly pronounced in the cell population that does not reach moderate-to-fast migration speeds and that is significantly more isotropic (data not shown) suggesting a correlation between loss of anisotropy in these cells and increased transitioning between bipolar and multipolar morphology. In transitionary cells of <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> slices, there is a significant increase in branch transitions at the soma and LP, a sign of decreased branch stability. Moreover, the length of the LP is significantly more variable in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> than in control neurons. Thus, Reelin signaling appears to promote stability of morphologies once they have been adopted at specific phases of migration in mDA neurons.</p><p>In cortical neurons, Reelin appears to have multiple effects on cell morphology. In dissociated cortical neuronal cultures, Reelin signaling results in an increase in filopodia formation, likely via activation of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leemhuis et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, in presence of exogenous Reelin in organotypic slice cultures, projection neurons in the ventricular zone display a greater proportion of multipolar morphology, a phenotype concomitant with reduced migratory speeds (see above, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Britto et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, LP morphology of migrating cortical neurons is comparable in presence and absence of Reelin signaling when these neurons first contact the marginal zone of the cortex, but Reelin signaling is required to maintain this morphology and a stable LP during the final somal translocation step of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chai et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, a recent study showing the phosphorylation of DAB1 via the Netrin receptor DCC has reported an increase in multipolar neurons in the subventricular zone of <italic>Dcc</italic> knockout cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In summary, depending on location, concentration, and sub-cellular localization, Reelin and DAB1 can have differing effects on the morphology of migrating neurons.</p><p>An indirect regulation of morphology by Reelin signaling has been reported in tangentially-migrating cortical interneurons. In interneurons, branching of LPs aids in precise sensing of the extracellular environment during chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martini et al., 2009</xref>). In the inverted <italic>reeler</italic> cortex, interneurons display a significantly higher number of branch nodes and higher length of LPs than interneurons in control brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yabut et al., 2007</xref>). This aberrant morphology is accompanied by their ectopic location in cortical layers. Since interneurons do not directly require Reelin signaling for their migration, it is likely that their aberrant morphology in the <italic>reeler</italic> cortex are an indirect effect of their altered position. As we observe similar effects on cell morphology in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mDA neurons, the aberrant mDA neuronal morphology may be a consequence of an increased necessity to scan the environment for guidance cues in ectopic medial positions rather than a direct downstream effect of Reelin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Reelin downstream signaling in SN-mDA neurons</title><p>It has previously been demonstrated that the regulation of CDH2 via the Crk/CrkL-C3G-Rap1 pathway at the cell surface is important for the effect of Reelin on the polarity of cortical projection neurons during their migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franco et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sekine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park and Curran, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Voss et al., 2008</xref>).

In addition to its effect on these actin cytoskeleton modulators, Reelin has also been described to alter microtubule stability in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Meseke et al., 2013</xref>). However, we demonstrate here that expression and/or phosphorylation levels of these Reelin downstream effectors are not obviously altered in mDA neurons in the absence of Reelin signaling. Moreover, we could not detect differences in the expression pattern of EB3 and acetylated α-tubulin, which are indicators for microtubule dynamics and stability, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van de Willige et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernández-Barrera and Alonso, 2018</xref>).

The knockdown of integrin α5ß1 in cortical neurons affects apical process stability during terminal translocation suggesting that additional adhesion molecules may be recruited by Reelin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sekine et al., 2012</xref>). In the cortex, both CDH2 and integrin α5ß1 act downstream of Reelin, with integrin α5ß1 anchoring the leading tip of terminally translocating neurons in the marginal zone and CDH2 regulating the subsequent cell movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sekine et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, integrin α5ß1 has been shown to be important for stabilizing neurite extensions of mDA neurons in vitro. Whether it plays a general role in stabilizing neuronal processes in mDA neurons, including LPs, and in mDA migration has not been explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Izumi et al., 2017</xref>). As mentioned above, cross talk between Netrin1-DCC and Reelin–Dab1 pathways has been reported in migration of cortical projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).

Individual tiles at each z-step were stitched together using the Leica SP8 PC suite (Leica, 2014).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of cell distribution in fixed sections</title><p>Mediolateral distribution of mDA neurons was analyzed for n ≥ 3 animals at each time point of analysis (E15.5, E18.5 and P21-30) by constructing normalized bins spanning the entire TH-positive domain. Since we observed that in both, <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO and <italic>Dab1 <sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, a few TH-positive cells of the lateral most SN lateralis were consistently present (yellow arrowheads <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E,H,I</xref>), we defined the mediolateral bins by quadrisecting a line extending from the midline to the lateral most TH positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The fraction of the total number of TH positive cells in each mediolateral bin was evaluated for control, <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> brains.</p><p>The number of mDA neurons in SN or VTA was determined by defining the anatomical area of the SN and VTA at three rostrocaudal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franklin and Paxinos, 2013</xref>). The number of mDA neurons in these two regions were counted and the numbers were normalized for the total number of mDA neurons (SN +VTA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of TH<sup>+</sup> projections in fixed sections</title><p>10X epifluorescence images of 40 μm thick free-floating slices stained for TH were acquired at an inverted Z1 Axioobserver microscope. Raw integrated intensity of the TH<sup>+</sup> striatal projections (dorsal and ventral) was calculated at three rostrocaudal levels of the striatum. The raw integrated intensity was normalized for the background (intensity of non-TH<sup>+</sup> areas) and for the area (of TH<sup>+</sup> projections) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Speed and trajectories of migrating mDA neurons</title><p>To prevent any bias in selection of cells for tracking, and to track a large number of neurons in 3D in our two-photon time lapse datasets, we used the semi-automatic plugin TrackMate in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>). Before soma detection, a 3 × 3 median filter was applied by the TrackMate plugin, to reduce salt and pepper background noise. Soma detection was carried out using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) detector in TrackMate. The soma detected by the TrackMate plugin were automatically linked across time, in 3D, by using the linear assignment problem (LAP) tracker in TrackMate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>). After automatic tracking, the track scheme view in TrackMate was used to check the accuracy of each track by eye. Spurious tracks were deleted and missed detections were added using the manual tracking mode in TrackMate. Excel files from the TrackMate plugin were imported into MatLab. 3D soma velocity was obtained at every time point (in units of μm/hr) of the analysis (starting t = 10 min) as the change in soma position vector between the previous frame and the current frame, divided by the time duration (0.167 hr) between frames. This data was used to generate probability histograms for average soma speed, maximum soma speed, time spent at rest (defined as soma speed &lt;10 μm/ hr), time spent in slow migration (soma speed between 10 and 30 μm/ hr), time spent in medium-fast migration (30–60 μm/hr) and time spent in fast migration (soma speed &gt;60 μm/ hr). Categories for rest, slow, medium-fast and fast speeds were defined for the purpose of easy visualization of data and were based on 25% percentile (10 μm/hr) and 75% percentile speeds (30 μm/hr) of <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> population.</p><p>Cell trajectory angles were measured in 2D as the angle between midline (positive y-axis in the image) and the line joining the first and final soma positions. Cells that moved with maximum speeds of less than 10 μm/hr were excluded from the trajectory analysis as they were categorized as being at rest. Statistics on trajectory angles were performed with CircStat: a MatLab toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berens, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Only cells for which the soma were detected at all time points of imaging were included in the analysis. Using this approach, we tracked 806 cells in slices from control mice (<italic>Shh<sup>CreER/+</sup>, Rosa26<sup>lox-stop-lox YFP/+</sup>, Dab<sup>+/+</sup></italic> or <italic>Shh<sup>CreER/+</sup>, Rosa26<sup>lox-stop-lox YFP/+</sup>, Dab1<sup>-/+</sup></italic>) and 844 cells from <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<italic>Shh<sup>CreER/+</sup>, Rosa26<sup>lox-stop-lox YFP/+</sup>, Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>), across three slices and acquired their speed and trajectory profiles. Each cell (and track) had a unique ID assigned by the TrackMate plugin. These cell IDs were used to identify and locate individual cells in the slice for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Morphology analysis of migrating mDA neurons</title><p>We restricted our morphological analysis to n = 150 control (70 fast, 40 medium-fast and 40 slow cells), and 129 <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (49 fast, 40 medium-fast and 40 slow) cells. We observed that <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells continuously extended protrusions in slices and this made it difficult to unambiguously assign processes to individual cells as imaging progressed. Hence, we examined the morphology of each cell, in 3D, for the first 18 frames of imaging. Cell soma was defined as the spot detected/assigned to the cells in the TrackMate plugin. Analysis was done manually, by rendering individual neurons in 4D (3D projection over all time frames) in ImageJ and recording the number of primary processes (arising from the soma) and secondary processes at each time point. A cell was defined as bipolar when fewer than two processes were observed arising directly from the soma. The appearance/disappearance of any branch was regarded as a branch transition. At each time point, the morphology of the cell, and the number of branch transitions, was manually annotated to the spot position data of the cell in excel sheets exported from TrackMate. In addition, 20 control and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells were randomly chosen for tracing in 3D. These neurons were traced manually in simple neurite tracer (SNT) plugin of Fiji. Tracings were carried out, at each time point individually, for the first 18 frames of imaging. Fills of traced neurons were generated semi-automatically in the SNT plugin. Fill thickness was decided by eye but was maintained across all time points for a cell. Maximum intensity projections were also generated for the 3D segmentation fills. SNT traces were also used to measure length of the leading process in 3D.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance of mediolateral distributions of TH<sup>+</sup> mDA neurons in control, <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> adult and embryonic brains were assessed by two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for multiple comparisons (n = 6 animals/genotype, at P30 and n = 4 animals/genotype at E18.5). At E15.5, mediolateral distribution of TH<sup>+</sup> mDA neurons and P30 TH<sup>+</sup> GIRK2<sup>+</sup> mediolateral distributions in control and <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO brains were assessed for statistical significance by Student’s t-test. All non-parametric distributions were analyzed with Mann-Whitney’s non-parametric rank test or Kalmogrov-Smirnov test (mentioned in figure legends) in Prism 7/MatLab. Circular variables were analyzed with the CircStat toolbox for MatLab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berens, 2009</xref>).

requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Formation of the substantia nigra requires Reelin-mediated fast, laterally-directed migration of dopaminergic neurons&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christine Metin (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors examined SN formation in the midbrain, and specifically examined the lateral migration of mDA neurons away from the midline and the VTA. Using mutant mice, the same investigators and others previously showed that Reelin signaling is required for this particular event. Here using new <italic>Dab1</italic> conditional knock out mice in DA neurons they demonstrate that laterally migrating mDAs cell-autonomously require Reelin signaling; they then characterize in detail the modes of migration of these neurons and establish that <italic>Dab1</italic> is required to promote movement and especially fast, laterally-oriented migration. Finally, they show that bipolar morphology correlates with this fast mode of migration.</p><p>The paper clearly identifies and characterizes a cellular behavior responsible for the spatial segregation of two populations of DA neurons and the formation of two nuclei with distinct functions. Overall, the study is solid, employing advanced genetic and imaging techniques to carefully document the lateral migration of mDA neurons, and the specific requirement of <italic>Dab1</italic> (and by implication Reelin signaling) in this process. The rigor of this descriptive study will lay a strong foundation for future studies that address mechanism in greater detail.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the careful descriptive nature of the study and agreed that substantially advancing the mechanism is likely beyond the scope of the current study. Nonetheless, there were two experiments that the reviewers felt would strengthen the study within its current bounds, and several points that could be addressed in the text. These are as follows:</p><p>1) About cellular mechanism: Wild-type and <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> SN-mDA neurons strongly differ by their morphology. Immunoblotting did not reveal any differences, but immunoblotting might miss subtle defects at the origin of those migratory abnormalities. In contrast, the organization of the microtubule cytoskeleton, especially the relative abundance of stable and dynamic microtubules could provide clues for understanding the migratory defects observed in <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> SN-mDA neurons. Such analysis can be performed by immunostaining and will give a precise information.</p><p>2) About the details of the DA populations involved in the phenotype: The authors mention that the phenotype is most severe at mid levels. In general, even at mid levels, the phenotype is subtle with only approximately 10-15% of the neurons being mislocalized (Figure 3C, bin 1 and 3). Is there even a phenotype in more rostral sections? The <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO should be analyzed/quantified along the rostrocaudal axis. If one counts total SN and VTA neurons (rather than mediolateral bins), what is the net reduction in SN, and what is the net gain in VTA DA neurons? A related question is why are these phenotypes restricted to a small number of cells, even though <italic>Dab1</italic> expression seems more broad. Also, in this context, most of the live migration studies were apparently performed in very rostral neuron populations (Figure 4B) – can the authors clarify the rationale, as the phenotype is most robust at midlevels?</p><p>3) In need of text clarifications:</p><p>The expression of Reelin in the red nucleus is consistent with a direct role of Reelin signaling in SN-mDA neuronal migration. In the absence of lateral movements, neurons expressing the SN markers and neurons expressing the VTA markers remain intermingled. From the start of the analysis (E13.5), the two populations are well differentiated. Since lateral VTA neurons also express <italic>Dab1</italic> (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), how can the cellular mechanism described in the paper separate two initially intermingled populations of neurons that express the same transducer of Reelin signals? This point deserves to be discussed.</p><p>On the issue of morphology: (a) The section heading &quot;mDA adopt a bipolar morphology during moderate/fast phases of migration&quot; is misleading. Numerically, most bipolar cells are not &quot;fast&quot;. (Figure 8E,F, show% , but total numbers should be mentioned as well); (b) In all these morphological studies, are these migrating cells extending axons?</p><p>The mutant phenotype documented here is rather modest and it should not be overinterpreted. The title claims that that formation of the SN requires Reelin signaling and mDA neuron lateral migration. But SN does appear to form in mutant mice, despite some mingling of lateral and medial mDA neurons.</p><p>The authors should discuss whether the deficit of mDA neuron lateral migration in Reelin and Reelin signaling mutant mice disrupts SN function or connectivity. Even if it doesn't, it would be interesting to speculate about the functional significance of this process and thus the importance of Reelin signaling in the formation of this midbrain structure.</p><p>&quot;We show that Reelin signaling promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.&quot; Related to this point, one could argue that a small population of &quot;fast&quot; neurons, in the <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO, were now shifted into the &quot;slow&quot; bin (as shown in Figure 5), and it is these neurons that are aberrant and result in the appearance of an effect on laterally biased movements in slow migrating neurons (Figure 7).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41623.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors examined SN formation in the midbrain, and specifically examined the lateral migration of mDA neurons away from the midline and the VTA.

Reduction in the number of mDA neurons in the SN and the corresponding gain in the region of the VTA has been quantified for three rostrocaudal levels individually and in total (Figure 1—figure supplement 4). The results show a significant loss of mDA neurons in the SN and a corresponding gain in the VTA at the intermediate level and when the three rostrocaudal levels are combined. We also added images of the SN at rostral levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-C) to show the disorganization of the SN at this level.

In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, we now present immunostaining for DAB1 at E13.5 confirming that DAB1 is expressed in laterally but not medially located mDA neurons at this stage. At E15.5, <italic>Dab1</italic> is expressed more broadly, both at the mRNA (Bodea et al., 2014, Figure S5) and protein level (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). However, at this time point SN and VTA populations are essentially separated. Whether <italic>Dab1</italic> has additional functions in mDA development at E15.5 and later warrants further studies. The change in the <italic>Dab1</italic> expression pattern between E13.5 and E15.5 is now described in the Results (subsection “Reelin signaling acts directly on tangentially migrating mDA neurons”).</p><p>Intermingling of mDA neurons: We would like to point out that we do not try to claim that Reelin is the key factor for the sorting out of SN from VTA cells. Based on our data, Reelin rather seems to regulate the subsequent lateral migration step. The intermingling of SN and VTA mDA neurons in <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO described in Figure 3 only occurs at the SN/lateral VTA border and is likely a consequence of the inability of <italic>Dab1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells to undergo this lateral migration step. We clarify this in the Results (subsection “Reelin signaling contributes to the segregation of SN- and VTA-mDA neurons into separate clusters”) and the Discussion (subsection “Reelin signaling directly regulates tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the issue of morphology: (a) The section heading &quot;mDA adopt a bipolar morphology during moderate/fast phases of migration&quot; is misleading.

Even if it doesn't, it would be interesting to speculate about the functional significance of this process and thus the importance of Reelin signaling in the formation of this midbrain structure.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the density of TH<sup>+</sup> projections to the striatum in controls and <italic>Dab1</italic> CKO animals at P30 and found no significant difference between the two groups (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-G, Results subsection “Reelin signaling contributes to the segregation of SN- and VTA-mDA neurons into separate clusters”). A more detailed insight into possible alterations in VTA and SN projections would require further experiments (e.g. specific tracing and/or optogenetic activation of SN neurons, single cell labeling to visualize axonal arbors). This has been added to the Discussion (subsection” Reelin signaling directly regulates tangential migration of SN-mDA neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;We show that Reelin signaling promotes laterally-biased movements in mDA neurons during their slow migration mode, stabilizes leading process morphology and increases the probability of fast, laterally-directed migration.&quot; Related to this point, one could argue that a small population of &quot;fast&quot; neurons, in the Dab1 CKO, were now shifted into the &quot;slow&quot; bin (as shown in Figure 5), and it is these neurons that are aberrant and result in the appearance of an effect on laterally biased movements in slow migrating neurons (Figure 7).</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our data we cannot resolve this point. We have added a sentence to the Discussion to reflect this (subsection “Reelin promotes a preference for directed migration”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
