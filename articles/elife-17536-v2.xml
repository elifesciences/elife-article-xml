CADASIL, an inherited SVD, alters cerebral artery function, compromising blood flow to the working brain. TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3) accumulation in the vascular extracellular matrix in CADASIL is a key contributor to cerebrovascular dysfunction. However, the linkage between elevated TIMP3 and compromised cerebral blood flow (CBF) remains unknown. Here, we show that TIMP3 acts through inhibition of the metalloprotease ADAM17 and HB-EGF to regulate cerebral arterial tone and blood flow responses. In a clinically relevant CADASIL mouse model, we show that exogenous ADAM17 or HB-EGF restores cerebral arterial tone and blood flow responses, and identify upregulated voltage-dependent potassium channel (K<sub>V</sub>) number in cerebral arterial myocytes as a heretofore-unrecognized downstream effector of TIMP3-induced deficits. These results support the concept that the balance of TIMP3 and ADAM17 activity modulates CBF through regulation of myocyte K<sub>V</sub> channel number.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17536.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17536.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17536.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are currently no effective treatments or cures for small blood vessel diseases of the brain, which lead to strokes and subsequent decreases in mental abilities. Normally, smooth muscle cells that surround the vessels relax or contract to regulate blood flow and ensure the right amount of oxygen and nutrients reaches the different regions of the brain. In a syndrome called CADASIL, which is the most common form of inherited small vessel disease, a genetic mutation causes the smooth muscle cells to weaken over time.</p><p>The accumulation of several proteins – including one called TIMP3 – around the smooth muscle cells plays a key role in the smooth muscle cell weakening seen in CADASIL. Capone et al. have now studied mice that display the symptoms of CADASIL to investigate how TIMP3 decreases blood flow through blood vessels in the brain. This revealed that TIMP3 inactivates another protein called ADAM17. The latter protein is normally responsible for starting a signaling pathway that helps smooth muscle cells to regulate blood flow according to the needs of the brain cells. Artificially adding more ADAM17 to the brains of the CADASIL mice reduced their symptoms of small vessel disease.</p><p>Using smooth muscle cells freshly isolated from the brains of CADASIL mice, Capone et al. also demonstrated that abnormal TIMP3-ADAM17 signaling increases the number of voltage-dependent potassium channels in the membrane of the muscle cells. Having too many of these channels impairs the flow of blood through vessels in the brain.</p><p>Further experiments are needed to investigate whether correcting TIMP3-ADAM17 signaling could prevent strokes in people with inherited CADASIL. It also remains to be seen whether similar signaling mechanisms are at play in other small vessel diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

cause of stroke and age-related cognitive decline and disability for which there are currently no treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pantoni, 2010</xref>). Our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of cerebral SVD is a major obstacle to the development of treatments. Monogenic forms of these diseases, such as CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), provide a window into the mechanism underlying much more common, but largely indistinguishable, sporadic forms of SVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joutel and Faraci, 2014</xref>). CADASIL, the most common hereditary cerebral SVD, is caused by dominant mutations in the NOTCH3 receptor that stereotypically lead to the extracellular deposition of NOTCH3 ectodomain (Notch3<sup>ECD</sup>) and aggregates of other proteins on vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joutel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chabriat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monet-Leprêtre et al., 2013</xref>). A deficit in cerebral blood flow (CBF) hemodynamics is an early feature of the disease, suggesting that cerebrovascular dysfunction may have a key role in disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chabriat et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfefferkorn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liem et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Small vessels of the brain have unique functional properties that ensure that the brain, which has a limited capacity to store energy, maintains an adequate supply of blood-borne nutrients in the face of variations in blood pressure and changing neuronal energy demands. Cerebral arteries exist in a partially constricted state called 'myogenic tone', which reflects an intrinsic contractile response of arterial myocytes to increases in intravascular pressure. Thus, these arteries are positioned to dilate, and thereby increase local CBF, in response to elevated neuronal activity. This phenomenon, known as functional hyperemia, serves to satisfy enhanced glucose and oxygen demands of active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iadecola and Nedergaard, 2007</xref>). Impaired functional hyperemia and CBF autoregulation, attenuated CBF responses to topical application of vasodilators, and diminished myogenic responses of cerebral arteries and arterioles are early and prominent features of the well-established <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> CADASIL mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joutel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dabertrand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capone et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms underlying this cerebrovascular dysfunction are poorly understood.</p><p>Recently, we found that TIMP3 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3) forms complexes with Notch3<sup>ECD</sup> and abnormally accumulates in the extracellular matrix of brain vessels of patients and mice with CADASIL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monet-Leprêtre et al., 2013</xref>). Remarkably, genetic overexpression of TIMP3 recapitulates both CBF and myogenic-response deficits of the CADASIL model; conversely, genetic reduction of TIMP3 in CADASIL model mice restores normal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capone et al., 2016</xref>). TIMP family members are key regulators of the metalloproteinases that degrade the extracellular matrix. Within the TIMP family, TIMP3 has the broadest spectrum of substrates, which extends to members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases) family. These metalloproteinases proteolytically release the extracellular domains of membrane-bound cytokines, cell adhesion molecules and growth factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α and several ligands of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, including HB-EGF (heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brew and Nagase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khokha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arpino et al., 2015</xref>). As such, in addition to being a powerful regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling in various organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arpino et al., 2015</xref>), TIMP3 is a key player in inflammatory pathologies and autoimmune diseases through regulation of cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brew and Nagase, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khokha et al., 2013</xref>). However, how metalloproteinase inhibition might dynamically regulate arterial tone and CBF hemodynamics is unclear.</p><p>In another recent study, we established that upregulation of voltage-gated potassium (K<sub>V</sub>) channels at the plasma membrane of arterial myocytes is responsible for the diminished myogenic responses of cerebral arteries and penetrating arterioles in the <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> CADASIL model. Notably, an influence of the endothelium in myogenic tone deficit was ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dabertrand et al., 2015</xref>). K<sub>V</sub> channels play an important and dynamic role in opposing pressure-induced depolarization and vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Longden et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dabertrand et al., 2015</xref>) and our collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koide et al., 2007</xref>) have found that down-regulation of plasma membrane K<sub>V</sub> channels through activation of the EGFR pathway restores normal responses to pressure. Collectively, our results suggest a fundamental linkage between the activity of TIMP3 in the extracellular matrix of cerebral arterial myocytes and cerebral arterial tone.</p><p>Here, we find that the ADAM17/HB-EGF/EGFR (ErbB1/ErbB4) signaling axis is a key TIMP3-sensitive signaling module that regulates CBF responses and the myogenic tone of cerebral arteries. We further provide evidence that disruption of this TIMP3-sensitive pathway mediates cerebrovascular dysfunction in the <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup> </italic>CADASIL model and identify upregulated K<sub>V</sub> channel current density in cerebral arterial myocytes as a heretofore-unrecognized effector of this pathway. These insights into the relationship between TIMP3 activity and cerebral arterial tone may ultimately lead to therapeutic options in cerebral SVD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exogenous TIMP3, but neither TIMP1 nor TIMP2, strongly attenuates CBF responses</title><p>To explore the role of TIMP3 in the regulation of CBF, we monitored CBF responses in wild-type mice equipped with an open cranial window over the somatosensory cortex, before and after the application of recombinant TIMP3 as well as TIMP1 or TIMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). We initially ensured that a recombinant protein applied over the cranial window could enter the brain. In the absence of robust anti-TIMP3 antibody suitable for immunohistochemistry and of an in situ assay to detect TIMP3 activity, we assessed brain penetration of Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled albumin (FITC-BSA, 66 kDa). After 30 min of continuous superfusion, fluorescence imaging of fixed vibratome slices showed that FITC-BSA entered the cortex along penetrating arteries beneath the cranial window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with transport via the glymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>). We found that TIMP3 (40 nM) did not affect resting CBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but did strongly reduce the increase in CBF evoked by whisker stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">3</xref>).

If TIMP3 does indeed act through inhibition of ADAM17, its effects on CBF responses should be mimicked by pharmacological inhibition of ADAM17. Here, we used the hydroxamate-based GW413333X inhibitor, which specifically blocks both ADAM10 and ADAM17; the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X was used as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hundhausen et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

These mice are viable, but develop eye, skin and heart defects as a consequence of impaired EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>).

Indeed, we found that neocortical application of the selective ErbB1/EGFR and ErbB4 inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1478 (10 and 20 µM), strongly attenuated the evoked CBF responses, but did not impair resting CBF. In contrast, CBF responses were unaffected by the selective ErbB2 inhibitor, tyrphostin AG825, at both 50 and 200 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">3</xref>). Of note, ErbB3 lacks kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roskoski 2014</xref>). We then tested the effect of soluble recombinant decoy ErbB receptors, known as chimeric ErbB receptor traps, which comprise the truncated extracellular domain of the ErbB receptor fused with the constant region (Fc) of human immunoglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stratman et al., 2010</xref>). Evoked CBF responses were attenuated by superfusion of either ErbB1/EGFR (67 nM) or ErbB4 (71 nM) receptor traps, which block the function of ErbB1 and ErbB4 ligands, respectively, but not by superfusion of the ErbB3 (71 nM) receptor trap or by control IgG1 Fc (286 nM) and IgG2 Fc (286 nM) fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">3</xref>). Notably, the effects of ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptor traps on evoked CBF responses were not additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">3</xref>), even though neither ErbB1 nor ErbB4 receptor traps achieved maximum inhibition. ErbB2 has no known ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roskoski, 2014</xref>); thus, these data are consistent with a role for ErbB1/EGFR or ErbB4 activation in CBF responses, and suggest the involvement of bispecific ligands with dual-specificity toward ErbB1 and ErbB4.</p><p>Next, we sought to pinpoint which ErbB ligand that requires <italic>ADAM17</italic> cleavage for activation is involved in CBF regulation. Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is one of three ligands that can bind to both ErbB1 and ErbB4 and is expressed in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). ADAM17 is the major sheddase of HB-EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>), and ADAM17-mediated shedding of proHB-EGF largely regulates soluble, mature HB-EGF binding to and activating ErbB receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamazaki et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, mice lacking HB-EGF have reduced postnatal viability with defective cardiac valvulogenesis, similar to mice lacking ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2003</xref>), prompting us to study the role of HB-EGF in cerebrovascular regulation. To do this, we examined the impact of HB-EGF inhibition on CBF responses. Unlike all other EGF ligands apart from amphiregulin, HB-EGF has a heparin-binding domain, and interactions through this domain with cell surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are necessary for binding and activation of ErbB receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higashiyama et al., 1993</xref>). We found that superfusion of heparin (40 ui/mL), which competitively inhibits binding of HB-EGF to cell surface HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higashiyama et al., 1993</xref>), impaired evoked CBF responses without affecting resting CBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">3</xref>). To further support a role for HB-EGF in evoked CBF responses, we examined the effects of the synthetic peptide p21, which corresponds to the heparin-binding domain of murine HB-EGF and similarly inhibits binding of HB-EGF to cell surface HSPGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Higashiyama et al., 1993</xref>). We found that superfusion of p21 (12 µM) similarly impaired evoked CBF responses without affecting resting CBF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I–K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">3</xref>); in contrast, a mutated inactive p21 peptide (p21-mut; 12 µM) had no effect on evoked or resting CBF.</p><p>To assess the connection between HB-EGF and ADAM17 in the context of cerebrovascular regulation, we tested the ability of a soluble form of HB-EGF (sHB-EGF) to counteract cerebrovascular dysfunction induced by ADAM17 inhibition or depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). TIMP3 or the ADAM10/17 inhibitor, GW413333X, was topically applied over the neocortex and CBF responses were measured before and after superfusion with sHB-EGF. We found that sHB-EGF (20 nM) prevented TIMP3 and GW-induced cerebrovascular deficits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD12-data">3</xref>).

These findings, collectively, suggest that ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) is a key TIMP3-sensitive signaling pathway for cerebrovascular regulation.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17536.020</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>sHB-EGF overcomes CBF deficits induced by ADAM17 inhibition.</title><p>Effects of sHB-EGF (20 nM) on resting CBF (<bold>A</bold>, <bold>D</bold>, <bold>G</bold>) and whisker stimulation (<bold>B</bold>, <bold>E</bold>, <bold>H</bold>)- and adenosine (<bold>C</bold>, <bold>F</bold>, <bold>I</bold>)-induced CBF responses were assessed in the presence and absence of the ErbB1/ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 (10 and 20 µM) (<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>), TIMP3 (40 nM) (<bold>D</bold>–<bold>F</bold>) or the ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibitor GW413333X (GW; 5 µM) (<bold>G</bold>–<bold>I</bold>) using a cranial window model.

Notably, responses cannot be enhanced by stimulation of this pathway, implying that this pathway is maximally activated in a physiological in vivo setting. Given that myogenic tone sets the resting arterial diameter from which other stimuli can induce vasoconstriction or vasodilation, we hypothesized that a reduction in the myogenic tone of cerebral arteries could represent a common mechanism underlying these CBF deficits. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of inhibitors of this pathway on pressure-induced constriction of brain arteries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD13-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>We found that pre-incubation of arterial segments with TIMP3 (8 nM) strongly attenuated myogenic tone at pressures of 40 mmHg and above compared to arteries incubated with vehicle, whereas recombinant TIMP2 (10 nM) had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD14-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>).

Previously, we demonstrated that elevated TIMP3, a protein tightly bound to the extracellular matrix of brain arteries, contributes to cerebrovascular dysfunction in CADASIL, a genetic paradigm of small vessel disease of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monet-Leprêtre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capone et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, we establish the novel concept that a TIMP3-sensitive pathway is constitutively engaged in the regulation of cerebral hemodynamics, and we unravel the mechanism by which excess TIMP3 in brain vessels compromises cerebrovascular regulation in a clinically relevant model of CADASIL.</p><p>By combining genetic and pharmacological approaches with in vivo analyses of CBF regulation and ex vivo measurements of myogenic responses of brain arteries in physiological settings, we found that ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) is a key TIMP3-sensitive signaling module essential for maintaining robust CBF responses to evoked neural activity or topically applied vasodilators as well as for myogenic responses of brain arteries. Next, using the <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C </sup></italic>model, we provided pharmacological evidence that, in the setting of CADASIL, attenuated ADAM17 and HB-EGF-dependent activation of ErbB1/ErbB4 underlies deficits in evoked CBF responses and cerebral arterial tone.

Collectively, these data suggest that elevated TIMP3 blunts the activity of the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway in cerebral arterial myocytes, thereby attenuating myogenic responses in brain arteries and compromising CBF regulation in CADASIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17536.040</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of TIMP3 regulation of cerebral arterial tone and CBF responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Under physiological conditions (upper panel), TIMP3 is present in a low abundance in the extracellular matrix of brain arteries. ADAM17 at the cell surface of cerebral arterial myocytes is therefore active and able to cleave and release sHB-EGF, resulting in ErbB1/ErbB4 activation and K<sub>V</sub>1 channel endocytosis. The internalization of K<sub>V</sub>1 channels relieves the tonic hyperpolarizing influence of these channels on the membrane potential of arterial myocytes, thereby allowing full development of pressure-induced vasoconstriction (myogenic tone) of brain arteries and enabling full CBF responses to whisker stimulation and vasodilators.

K<sub>V</sub> channels are powerful negative regulators of arterial tone, which act by exerting a tonic hyperpolarizing influence on the membrane potential of arterial smooth muscle cells that serves to limit pressure-induced depolarization and vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Longden et al., 2015</xref>). Our results introduce the novel concept that the concentration of TIMP3 in brain vessels regulates arterial tone and blood flow by playing a critical role in adjusting K<sub>V</sub> channel density. We surmise that such an extracellular matrix-dependent paradigm may be at play in more common forms of cerebral small vessel disease where remodeling of the vascular extracellular matrix is a key feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joutel et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that, under physiological conditions, tonic activity of the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway prevents excess accumulation of K<sub>V</sub> channels at the plasma membrane and thereby maintains myogenic tone and robust CBF responses to neural activity and vasodilators. Interestingly, we found that only factors that inhibit this pathway had a functional effect; activating this pathway in wild-type mice by providing sADAM17 or sHB-EGF did not enhance evoked CBF responses or myogenic tone. This suggests that the set point of this pathway in a physiological in vivo setting is already at maximum. In support of this interpretation is a recent study showing that genetic overexpression of ADAM17 protein does not result in enhanced shedding activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoda et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, decreasing K<sub>V</sub> current density in cerebral artery myocytes, which is at least 50% lower than that in peripheral artery myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dabertrand et al., 2015</xref>), could be an in vivo rate-limiting step following physiological activation of this pathway. Notably however, studies in experimental models of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage indicate that this pathway can be further activated in a pathological context. Indeed, Wellman and colleagues have shown that the blood component, oxyhemoglobin, causes suppression of K<sub>V</sub> currents in cerebral arterial myocytes through HB-EGF–mediated activation of ErbB1/ErbB4, resulting in membrane depolarization and enhanced tone of brain arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nystoriak et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we found that any genetic or pharmacological maneuver that blocked the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway attenuated both the myogenic tone of brain arteries and the increase in CBF responses evoked by diverse stimuli; conversely, exogenous sADAM17 and sHB-EGF could overcome the reduction in both myogenic tone and evoked CBF responses elicited by the R169C Notch3 mutation or elevated TIMP3. Moreover, our previous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dabertrand et al., 2015</xref>) and current results collectively indicate that upregulation of K<sub>V</sub> channels is sufficient to explain the decrease in myogenic tone, without an involvement of the endothelium or large conductance, voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> activated K<sup>+</sup> (BK) channels. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude an effect on other channels engaged by pressure. Given the key role of K<sub>V</sub> channels in the regulation of arterial tone, these findings are consistent with the interpretation that the smooth muscle ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4)/K<sub>V</sub> pathway regulates evoked CBF responses by elevating the physiological tone of brain arteries, and that the reduction in myogenic tone caused by inhibition of this pathway by excess TIMP3 in the extracellular matrix surrounding smooth muscle cells likely accounts for the attenuation of evoked CBF responses in CADASIL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). A previous study in acute brain slices provides additional support for this interpretation, showing that the initial degree of arteriolar tone determines the diameter changes elicited by functional hyperemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanco et al., 2008</xref>). On the other hand, a transient loss of myogenic tone is expected to increase resting CBF, and vice versa. Unexpectedly, we found that acute pharmacological blockade of the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway did not affect resting CBF (or inconsistently increased it), despite its ability to profoundly reduce myogenic responses of brain arteries ex vivo. Also, neocortical application of exogenous sADAM17 unexpectedly increased resting CBF in <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic>mice, despite its ability to increase and normalize myogenic tone in these mice. However, although myogenic tone and myogenic responses are known to contribute to the regulation of resting CBF, their relative importance are hard to quantify and poorly understood; their contribution may also change depending on conditions or disease states and other mechanisms —metabolic, neural, endothelial—also influence or contribute to resting CBF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cipolla, 2009</xref>). It is also possible that overall resting CBF does not change despite seeing a change in myogenic tone in one portion of the vasculature because of compensatory adjustments in vessels downstream. Simultaneous in vivo recordings of blood flow and vessel diameters may be of interest to address this possibility. Moreover, it should be stressed that in our experiments cell populations targeted by pharmacological compounds likely differ depending on whether the compound is topically applied in vivo over the somatosensory cortex or incubated ex vivo with isolated brain arteries. In particular, proteins or peptides topically applied in vivo are thought to target only the abluminal surface of the vessel (smooth muscle cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2013</xref>) and may target other brain cells (e.g., astrocytes), whereas ex vivo incubation targets only vascular cells, including both abluminal and luminal (endothelial cell) surfaces. In this regard, involvement of the ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) pathway in cells other than arterial myocytes cannot be ruled out. Finally, our results may point toward the involvement of other downstream effectors in addition to K<sub>V</sub> channels in the regulation of CBF by this pathway.</p><p>The fact that increasing TIMP3 or decreasing ADAM17 caused a concentration-dependent impairment of cerebrovascular function taken together with the observation that exogenous sADAM17 is capable of overcoming elevated TIMP3-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction indicates that ADAM17 activity depends on the relative activity of ADAM17 and TIMP3 in brain arteries. Several lines of evidence from cell systems indicate that the bulk of ADAM17 is intracellular, whereas the majority of ADAM17 shedding activity occurs at the cell surface, where ADAM17 can associate with its natural inhibitor TIMP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapnick et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the ratio of TIMP3 and ADAM17 at the cell surface is likely a key determinant of ADAM17 activity. Biochemical confirmation of this in brain arteries will require further investigation, although the lack of ADAM17 and TIMP3 antibodies suitable for immunohistochemistry, the tiny amount of material provided by segments of cerebral arteries for biochemical studies, and the lack of in situ or specific assay to assess ADAM17 activity in tissues remain major technical obstacles.</p><p>Although many of the molecular details of the mechanism responsible for EGFR-mediated suppression of K<sub>V</sub> channels in cerebral arterial myocytes remain unsettled, previous studies have shown that activation of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity can suppress K<sub>V</sub> channel activity through enhanced endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koide et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishiguro et al., 2006</xref>). Functional homo- or heteromeric K<sub>V</sub> channels are formed from four α-subunits, plus additional β-subunits. K<sub>V</sub>1.5, and to a lesser extent K<sub>V</sub>1.2, are the predominant α-subunits in rodent brain arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thorneloe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Straub et al., 2009</xref>). Whereas direct tyrosine phosphorylation of the channel has been identified as the mechanism regulating K<sub>V</sub> 1.2 endocytosis in HEK or neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nesti et al., 2004</xref>), a role for this mechanism in K<sub>V</sub>1.5 endocytosis has not yet been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishiguro et al., 2006</xref>). Whether other subunits within the K<sub>V</sub> 1.5 channel complex or a closely associated protein is the target of phosphorylation remains to be tested. On the other hand, K<sub>V</sub> channel suppression could be mediated by enhanced lysosomal or proteasomal degradation, as recently shown for K<sub>V</sub> 1.5 in mesenteric arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kidd et al., 2015</xref>). Future experiments are needed to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the regulation and trafficking of K<sub>V</sub>1 channels in cerebral arterial myocytes.</p><p>In summary, our study has uncovered a novel and central role for the ADAM17/HB-EGF/ErbB/K<sub>V</sub> signaling pathway in the physiological and pathological control of CBF and arterial tone. Our results highlight a heretofore-unrecognized mechanistic link between pathological alterations of the vascular extracellular matrix and K<sub>V</sub> channel density that underlies cerebrovascular dysfunction in CADASIL. We believe that this novel extracellular matrix-dependent mechanism establishes an important paradigm for cerebrovascular regulation. Importantly, illumination of its dysfunction in cerebral small vessel disease offers multiple points of potential therapeutic intervention that may prove to be more easily druggable than pathological changes in vascular extracellular matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Acetylcholine, adenosine, the selective ErbB1/ErbB4 inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478, and the selective ErbB2 inhibitor tyrphostin AG825 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levitzki and Gazit, 1995</xref>) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

Rectal temperature was maintained at 37°C, and arterial blood gases were measured. The level of anesthesia was monitored by testing corneal reflexes and motor responses to tail pinch.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and three reviewers, including John P Adelman (Reviewer #2) Scott Earley (Reviewer #3) and David E Clapham (Reviewer #1), who is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Joutel and colleagues reports results that examine the mechanisms by which TIMP3 regulates cerebral arterial tone and CBF responses. Previous work had shown that TIMP3 abnormally accumulates in the extracellular matrix of brain vessels of patients and <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> mice with CADASIL, a monogenic form of small vessel disease. Genetic overexpression of TIMP3 recapitulates both CBF and myogenic response deficits of the CADASIL model, while genetic reduction of TIMP3 restores normal function. Also, they had previously shown that downregulation of plasma membrane K<sub>v</sub> channels restored normal responses to pressure. Here, they demonstrate that TIMP3 mediates cerebrovascular function through ADAM17/HB-EGF/EGFR (ErbB1/ErbB4) signaling pathway. In CADASIL, accumulation of TIMP3 leads to the inhibition of ADAM17, consequently, prevents sHB-EGF from being cleaved and affects the subsequent ErbB1/ErbB4 activity. Through a mechanism yet to be determined, this apparently decreases K<sub>v</sub> 1 channel endocytosis. The enhanced K<sub>v</sub> 1 channel activity due to increased current density limits the myogenic tone and evoked CBF responses.</p><p>This is a very well written manuscript, the data are clearly presented and the results are significant.</p><p>Revisions to address:</p><p>1) Application of sADAM17 (16 nM) did not affect responses in wt. This suggests that endogenous levels of ADAM17 are saturated. Was a higher concentration tested? Also, what was the effect of exogenous application of sADAM17 on the stronger hypomorph, <italic>ex/ex</italic>? This would be interesting as it would determine whether the signaling pathway remains intact even when ADAM17 is largely abolished. Indeed, even in the genetic model of TIMP3 over-expression, ADAM17 application improved CBF responses.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript, using the in vivo model of direct cortical application, the responsiveness to the various treatments and genetic models are presented as relative, percent changes. Since the system seems to operate at maximum in the basal condition, it would be interesting to know whether there are significant differences in the absolute sense. For example, is resting flow the same for the various genetic models? Does application of ADAM17 normalize CBF in the hypomorph to the same absolute value as wt?</p><p>3) Application of ADAM17 to the hypomorph did not affect the relative change in resting flow, but increased it in the N3<sup>R169C</sup> model. If the effect of both of these models is to reduce the effective ADAM17 activity, why are the responses on resting flow different?</p><p>4) The main conclusion of this manuscript is that TIMP3 blunts the ADAM17/HB-EGF/ErbB/K<sub>v</sub> pathway to disrupt neurovascular coupling (NVC) by diminishing myogenic constriction. The authors posit that because arteries and arterioles are already in a dilated state, intrinsic NVC coupling mechanisms cannot further increase CBF. If this is the case, why are increases in CBF due to loss of myogenic tone not seen when exogenous TIMP3 is acutely applied (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)?</p><p>5) The authors show that administration of sADAM17 restores NVC in <italic>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </italic>mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It would be useful to show that sADAM17 also restores impaired myogenic reactivity in isolated cerebral arteries from these mice. These new experiments would provide a direct mechanistic link between restoration of myogenic tone and repair of NVC.</p><p>6) Ex vivo experiments examining myogenic reactivity used cerebral pial arteries, but NVC is primarily regulated by parenchymal (penetrating) arterioles. Prior work from some of the co-authors and other labs indicate that the signaling pathways responsible for vascular contractility differ between smooth muscle cells from pial versus parenchymal arterioles. Additional experiments using isolated cerebral parenchymal arterioles would be helpful to resolve this issue.</p><p>7) Patch-clamp experiments – The effects of exogenous TIMP3 are quite modest and in all experiments shown here, K<sub>v</sub> current densities differ only at very positive membrane potentials. The prior study from this research group (PMID:25646445) shows increases in current density between <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> and wild-type mice at membrane potentials that are physiologically relevant for smooth muscle cells (i.e., -30 mV). If the authors' proposed mechanism is correct, a larger influence of TIMP3 at these membrane potentials would be expected. These findings call into question the authors' contention that increases in K<sub>v</sub> channel surface expression accounts for loss of myogenic contractility. Perhaps a more through characterization of electrophysiological properties is needed that would encompass other K<sup>+</sup> channels (BK) as well as depolarizing influences (TMEM16A, TRPC6, TRPM4). At a minimum, the authors should at least discuss the limitations of the data that are presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17536.042</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Revisions to address:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Application of sADAM17 (16 nM) did not affect responses in wt.

Indeed, even in the genetic model of TIMP3 over-expression, ADAM17 application improved CBF responses.</italic> </p><p>We did not test a higher concentration of sADAM17 in wildtype mice. Interestingly, results of a recent study support the idea that endogenous levels of ADAM17 are indeed saturated. Yoda and colleagues recently showed that ADAM17 transgenic mice, which overexpress ADAM17 mRNA and protein, exhibit no overt defects and no enhanced shedding activity of ADAM17, both in vitro and in vivo (Yoda M et al., PLoS One 2013;8(1):e54412. PMID: 23342154). We thank the reviewers for this insightful comment and this point has been added in the revision (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>We acknowledge that it would have been desirable to perform more experiments in the <italic>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </italic>and ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice. However, because we had a limited access to these mice – we did not set up the colony but imported the mice into the Institute where the CBF experiments have been conducted – and because only one compound can be tested in a given mouse, we prioritized the use of <italic>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </italic>mice to test the effect of sADAM17, as shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and the use of ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup> mice to test the effect of sHB-EGF. Results of this later experiment, now included in the revision, showed that exogenous application of sHB-EGF significantly improved the CBF responses in the ADAM17 <sup>ex/ex</sup> mice, suggesting that the signaling pathway remains intact in these mice (Results, subsection “HB-EGF and EGFR operate downstream of ADAM17 to regulate CBF responses”, last paragraph; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Throughout the manuscript, using the in vivo model of direct cortical application, the responsiveness to the various treatments and genetic models are presented as relative, percent changes. Since the system seems to operate at maximum in the basal condition, it would be interesting to know whether there are significant differences in the absolute sense. For example, is resting flow the same for the various genetic models? Does application of ADAM17 normalize CBF in the hypomorph to the same absolute value as wt?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. Although laser Doppler flow (LDF) derived measurements provide an accurate assessment of relative CBF changes, it is usually considered that LDF is less accurate for obtaining absolute flow measurements and therefore we did not incorporate these values in the original submission. Having said that, we had an excellent day-to-day reproducibility of CBF measurements and we fully agree that absolute flow measurements in the genetic models used in the current study are worth considering. Interestingly, we found that in the <italic>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </italic>mice, resting flow was not significantly decreased and unchanged upon topical application of sADAM17. In contrast, in TgBAC-TIMP3 and <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> mice, resting CBF was significantly reduced, and significantly improved upon application of sADAM17, with values close to values observed in WT mice. Therefore, it appears that application of sADAM17 in these genetic models normalize resting and evoked CBF responses towards the same absolute values of WT mice.</p><p>Accordingly, we now provide in the revision absolute values of resting flows for the genetic models (Results, subsections “ADAM17 is required for TIMP3-induced attenuation of CBF responses” and “Exogenous sADAM17 and exogenous sHB-EGF rescue CBF and myogenic-response deficits in the <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> CADASIL model”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; revised <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 2—source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16-data">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Application of ADAM17 to the hypomorph did not affect the relative change in resting flow, but increased it in the</italic> N3<sup>R169C</sup> <italic>model. If the effect of both of these models is to reduce the effective ADAM17 activity, why are the responses on resting flow different?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for stressing this point. The responses on resting flow appear different in the <italic>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </italic>and <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> mice if we consider the relative changes. However, results appear more consistent if we consider the absolute values. Indeed, as mentioned above, resting flow is unchanged in <italic>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </italic>and unaffected by topical application of sDAM17. In contrast, resting flow, which is decreased in the <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> mice, is improved by exogenous sADAM17 towards wildtype values, suggesting that sADAM17 acts to normalize CBF responses to values observed in WT mice. We have clarified this point in the revision (Results subsections “ADAM17 is required for TIMP3-induced attenuation of CBF responses” and “Exogenous sADAM17 and exogenous sHB-EGF rescue CBF and myogenic-response deficits in the <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> CADASIL model”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; revised <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Figure 2—source data 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD16-data">Figure 6—source data 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) The main conclusion of this manuscript is that TIMP3 blunts the ADAM17/HB-EGF/ErbB/</italic>K<sub>v</sub> <italic>pathway to disrupt neurovascular coupling (NVC) by diminishing myogenic constriction. The authors posit that because arteries and arterioles are already in a dilated state, intrinsic NVC coupling mechanisms cannot further increase CBF. If this is the case, why are increases in CBF due to loss of myogenic tone not seen when exogenous TIMP3 is acutely applied (i.e., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>We fully agree that a transient reduction in myogenic tone was theoretically expected to increase resting CBF, and vice versa. Although we proposed several explanations in the initial version of our manuscript, we acknowledge that this important issue deserves further discussion. Accordingly, we have added the following paragraph in the Discussion: “However, although myogenic tone and myogenic responses are known to contribute to the regulation of resting CBF, their relative importance are hard to quantify and poorly understood; their contribution may also change depending on conditions or disease states and other mechanisms—metabolic, neural, endothelial—also influence or contribute to resting CBF (Cipolla, 2009). It is also possible that overall resting CBF does not change despite seeing a change in myogenic tone in one portion of the vasculature because of compensatory adjustments in vessels downstream. Simultaneous in vivo recordings of local blood flow and vessel diameter may be of interest to address this possibility”.</p><p><italic>5) The authors show that administration of sADAM17 restores NVC in ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It would be useful to show that sADAM17 also restores impaired myogenic reactivity in isolated cerebral arteries from these mice. These new experiments would provide a direct mechanistic link between restoration of myogenic tone and repair of NVC.</italic> </p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, these experiments have been carried out. Actually, we found that sADAM17 also restores myogenic tone in <italic>ADAM17<sup>ex/wt</sup> </italic>mice. These data have been added in the revision (Results, subsection “The ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) signaling module regulates pressure-induced myogenic tone in brain arteries”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) Ex vivo experiments examining myogenic reactivity used cerebral pial arteries, but NVC is primarily regulated by parenchymal (penetrating) arterioles. Prior work from some of the co-authors and other labs indicate that the signaling pathways responsible for vascular contractility differ between smooth muscle cells from pial versus parenchymal arterioles. Additional experiments using isolated cerebral parenchymal arterioles would be helpful to resolve this issue.</italic> </p><p>We thank the Reviewers for this valuable comment. First, we would like to point out that, in <italic>TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup></italic> mice, we previously established that myogenic responses are similarly impaired in parenchymal arterioles and pial arteries (Dabertrand et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2015;112(7):E796–805), suggesting that the pathway altered by the CADASIL mutation is the same in the pial arteries and intraparenchymal arterioles. Second, as suggested, a new set of experiments has been carried out on parenchymal arterioles (PAs). We compared changes in the diameter of PAs in response to increasing intraluminal pressure. We observed that pre-incubation with TIMP3 blunted the myogenic response compared to pre-incubation with vehicle, whereas recombinant TIMP2 (10 nM) had no effect, suggesting that the TIMP3 sensitive pathway similarly operates in both pial and intraparenchymal arterioles. These data have been included in the revision (Results, subsection “The ADAM17/HB-EGF/(ErbB1/ErbB4) signaling module regulates pressure-induced myogenic tone in brain arteries”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition, measurements of pressurized parenchymal arterioles are significantly more challenging than those of pial arteries, with a lower success rate (i.e. more time, money and most importantly animals sacrificed). Therefore, given the extensive number of demanding experiments in the current study and the lack of difference in myogenic impairment of parenchymal arterioles and pial arteries in response to TIMP3 as well as in CADASIL mice, we did not repeat all the pharmacological experiments, shown in the original submission, on the parenchymal arterioles.</p><p><italic>7) Patch-clamp experiments – The effects of exogenous TIMP3 are quite modest and in all experiments shown here,</italic> K<sub>v</sub> <italic>current densities differ only at very positive membrane potentials. The prior study from this research group (PMID:25646445) shows increases in current density between TgNotch3<sup>R169C</sup> and wild-type mice at membrane potentials that are physiologically relevant for smooth muscle cells (i.e., -30 mV).

At a minimum, the authors should at least discuss the limitations of the data that are presented.</italic> </p><p>Exogenous TIMP3 increased current density by 21% at positive voltages (+ 40 mV) compared to 72% increase in myocytes from CADASIL cerebral arteries. A 21% increase in current due to an elevation of channel number would be physiological meaningful, but would not be detectable at negative voltages with our experimental approach. Our results are consistent with the idea that the mechanisms to upregulate channel number are less robust than endocytosis of K<sub>v</sub> channels in isolated myocytes at room temperature. Furthermore, channel trafficking at room temperature (patch clamp analysis on cerebral arterial myocytes) is likely to be slower than at 37°C (intact pressurized arteries and in vivo).</p><p>In a previous study, we found that inhibition of BK channels had no effect on pressure-induced constrictions in WT and in CADASIL (Hannah et al., J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2011; Dabertrand et al., Circ. Res. 2012; Dabertrand et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.2015). Reduction of K<sub>v</sub> channel activity by 4-AP, HB-EGF, and genetically (TIMP3<sup>+/-</sup>) in CADASIL to WT levels completely restored myogenic tone and in vivo CBF responses, suggesting that this mechanism was sufficient.</p><p>Nonetheless, we cannot absolutely exclude possible effects on pressure-induced hyperpolarizing and depolarizing influences on membrane potential. Therefore we have discussed this in the revision (Discussion).</p></body></sub-article></article>
