haematopoietic stem cells and is a primary risk factor for chronic diseases. X chromosome inactivation (XCI) randomly transcriptionally silences either the maternal or paternal X in each cell of 46, XX females to balance the gene expression with 46, XY males. Age acquired XCI-skew describes the preferential selection of cells across a tissue resulting in an imbalance of XCI, which is particularly prevalent in blood tissues of ageing females, and yet its clinical consequences are unknown.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>We assayed XCI in 1575 females from the TwinsUK population cohort using DNA extracted from whole blood. We employed prospective, cross-sectional, and intra-twin study designs to characterise the relationship of XCI-skew with molecular and cellular measures of ageing, cardiovascular disease risk, and cancer diagnosis.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>We demonstrate that XCI-skew is independent of traditional markers of biological ageing and is associated with a haematopoietic bias towards the myeloid lineage. Using an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score, which captures traditional risk factors, XCI-skew is associated with an increased cardiovascular disease risk both cross-sectionally and within XCI-skew discordant twin pairs. In a prospective 10 year follow-up study, XCI-skew is predictive of future cancer incidence.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our study demonstrates that age acquired XCI-skew captures changes to the haematopoietic stem cell population and has clinical potential as a unique biomarker of chronic disease risk.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>KSS acknowledges funding from the Medical Research Council [MR/M004422/1 and MR/R023131/1].

Ageing is a primary risk factor for diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, and a better understanding of the biomarkers of ageing promises to reduce the burden of chronic disease which significantly impacts the human healthspan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>X chromosome inactivation (XCI) evolved in placental mammals to compensate for the X-linked gene dosage between XX females and XY males. XCI transcriptionally silences either the maternal or paternal X in each cell to equalise the gene expression between 46, XX females and 46, XY males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyon, 1961</xref>). The selection of which X is silenced is a random process that occurs during development, with the XCI status then clonally inherited by all daughter cells. Therefore, mammalian female tissues are mosaics with respect to XCI status, with an expected ratio of 1:1.</p><p>However, some individuals display a skewed pattern of XCI (XCI-skew), which is defined as a deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio. Examples of primary XCI-skew have been identified, including stochastic events resulting in XCI-skew across all tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tukiainen et al., 2016</xref>) or the preferential selection of cells expressing functioning alleles in heterozygous females with X-linked recessive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busque and Gilliland, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nyhan et al., 1970</xref>). However, secondary or age acquired XCI-skew is more common and refers to increasing XCI-skew with age, particularly in mitotically active blood tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busque et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale et al., 1997</xref>). Within individuals, the correlation of XCI ratios between blood and other tissues diminishes over the life course as the XCI ratios in blood continue to skew with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolduc et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zito et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The stability of XCI-skew in blood has been demonstrated over 18–24 months and is thought to be a gradual process affecting the whole haematopoietic stem cell population rather than representing fluctuations in the active stem cell pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tonon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Dijk et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, though XCI-skew is a sex-specific measurable phenotype, it is a potential marker of stem cell depletion or polyclonal expansion of haematopoietic stem cells, which are age-associated traits irrespective of chromosomal sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busque et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busque et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale et al., 1997</xref>). Age acquired XCI-skew has previously been linked to autoimmunity, which presents with a stark sex-imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chabchoub et al., 2009</xref>), as well as breast and ovarian cancers, albeit with inconsistent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kristiansen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manoukian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Struewing et al., 2006</xref>). Yet the consequences of XCI-skew on chronic disease risk in an unselected population have largely been unexplored.</p><p>Clonal expansion of haematopoietic stem cells is also measurable by somatic mutations shared across blood cells, indicating a common stem cell precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xie et al., 2014</xref>). Clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a cellular phenotype describing a pre-malignant state in which ≥4% of blood cells harbour the same somatic mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaiswal and Ebert, 2019</xref>), thus representing monoclonal expansion. CHIP is robustly associated with all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>), haematological cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genovese et al., 2014</xref>), and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaiswal et al., 2017</xref>). XCI-skew can sometimes be a marker of CHIP: XCI-skew was previously used to determine clonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busque and Gilliland, 1998</xref>), and exome sequencing of females with XCI-skew identified <italic>TET2</italic> mutations as drivers of pre-malignant clonal haematopoiesis. However, XCI-skew and CHIP are not completely mutually inclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busque et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given XCI-skew is potentially tagging changes to the haematopoietic stem cell pool, we hypothesised that XCI-skew may be a marker of biological ageing and a risk factor for chronic disease. We tested this hypothesis by assaying XCI-skew in 1575 females from the TwinsUK cohort and employed prospective, cross-sectional, and intra-twin study designs to characterise the relationship of XCI with molecular and cellular measures of ageing, cardiovascular disease risk, and cancer diagnoses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TwinsUK cohort</title><p>Archival DNA samples derived from whole blood (collected 1997–2017) were selected from individuals of the TwinsUK population cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verdi et al., 2019</xref>).

The age range of the XCI cohort is 19–99, with a median age of 61 (Figure 2A).

Fluorescently labelled PCR primers (FAM, VIC, NED, or PET; Forward primer 5’-dye-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCTGTGAAGGTTGCTGTTCCTCAT</named-content>-3’, Reverse primer 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCCAGAATCTGTTCCAGAGCGTGC</named-content>-3’) were used in New England BioLabs One <italic>Taq</italic> Master Mix to amplify 1.5 μl of digested PCR product. The Mock and <italic>HpaII</italic> digested DNA were amplified in triplicate (using FAM, VIC, and NED), and the <italic>MspI</italic> digest, used as control of digestion efficiency, was amplified once (using PET). All PCRs were amplified with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, and a final elongation step of 72 °C for 15 min. To minimize technical bias and batch effects, the labelled amplified products were diluted 1:15 with nuclease-free ddH<sub>2</sub>O and pooled together with the GeneScan 500 LIZ size standard and analysed on an ABI 3730xl. Twin pairs were assayed on the same plate and plates contained a mix of both MZ and DZ pairs. Two replicates were included on each plate and a within-plate correlation of 0.99 was measured. A total of 2382 DNA samples were assayed, with 194 failed samples, and 601 samples were homozygous for the CAG repeat and were therefore uninformative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Calculation of XCI</title><p>Data were analysed using the Microsatellite Analysis Software available on the Thermo Fisher Cloud.

Although XCI-skew is measurable in a sex-specific manner, age acquired XCI-skew is potentially a marker of stem cell depletion or clonal expansion of haematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busque et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busque et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Dijk et al., 2002</xref>), and could therefore have a role in age-related chronic disease, which has been robustly established for CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaiswal and Ebert, 2019</xref>). In our cross-sectional study of 1575 females, we identify associations of blood-derived age acquired XCI-skew with an increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score and increased probability of future cancer diagnosis.</p><p>Intriguingly, XCI-skew appears independent of other known markers of biological ageing, including leukocyte telomere length shortening, inflammageing, and a robust measure of frailty, making XCI-skew a unique biomarker with clinical potential. We note that though we also see no association with the mDNA GrimAge measure of accelerated epigenetic ageing, our sample size was limited, and this perhaps warrants a follow-up study to better establish the lack of correlation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that smoking and obesity are not risk factors for age acquired XCI-skew, and with a limited longitudinal dataset, that XCI-skew persists and increases over extended periods of time (median 16 years).</p><p>We find an association with increased probability of future cancer diagnosis in a 10 year follow-up study. Previous studies assessing the role of XCI-skew in cancer have typically used case-control studies of breast and ovarian cancers and have not been robustly replicated. The lack of replication is potentially explained by the heterogeneity in study design, including age-of-onset and therapy timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kristiansen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Struewing et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>BRCA1</italic> mutation stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kristiansen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lose et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Manoukian et al., 2013</xref>), and threshold level for definition of XCI-skew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buller et al., 1999</xref>). We controlled for potential confounding effects of cancer treatment on blood cells by excluding all individuals with a cancer diagnosis prior to study entry. Due to limited cancer events, our Cox regression analysis combined all individuals with XCI-skew (≥75% XCI) and extreme XCI-skew (≥91% XCI), which suggests even modest levels of skewing represents a greater risk of cancer.</p><p>Though CHIP is also predictive of future cancer diagnosis, the association is limited to haematological cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai et al., 2018</xref>). Whereas here we see blood-derived measures of XCI-skew is predictive of all future cancer diagnoses, even when the haematological cancers are removed from the analysis. Follow-up studies to assess the risk of cancer of specific tissues in individuals with XCI-skew are needed, but we hypothesise that the relationship between XCI-skew measures in blood tissue and cancer will not be causal. Instead XCI-skew is likely a marker of chronic inflammation, which can predispose to the development of cancer through increased mutagenesis and can promote tumorigenesis by shaping the tumour microenvironment to stimulate tumour growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greten and Grivennikov, 2019</xref>). However, it is interesting that common environmental factors that induce chronic inflammation, such as smoking and obesity, have not been found to be risk factors for XCI-skew in our study.</p><p>We also present an association with increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk score, which captures traditional risk factors (age, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking, diabetes, systolic blood pressure, and hypertension medication) and estimates the risk of developing CVD in the next 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goff et al., 2014</xref>). We were also able to utilise the powerful discordant twin design to validate this finding, thus excluding the possibility that the cross-sectional association was driven by the age component of the ASCVD risk score. Following our finding of a correlation between blood-derived XCI-skew and risk of CVD, ascertaining whether XCI-skew is associated with incident CVD is of upmost importance. CHIP has been robustly associated with incident CVD and this association is thought to be causal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jaiswal et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the association of CHIP and all-cause mortality is partly driven by CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>). We lacked statistical power to demonstrate an association with all-cause mortality, though the trend was towards greater risk (HR = 1.39 [0.75–2.58]). A higher-powered study able to focus on specific causes of mortality will be of great interest and importance.</p><p>Given the existing links between CHIP and XCI-skew as two age acquired blood traits, and that CHIP mutations can be found in individuals with XCI-skew (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busque et al., 2012</xref>), could the association between XCI-skew and CVD risk be partly driven by CHIP? It is expected that some of the individuals with XCI-skew in our study will also harbour CHIP mutations. However, a better understanding of the co-occurrence of XCI-skew and CHIP within individuals, and the mutational burden within individuals with and without XCI-skew, is an important area of future work. Whether the co-occurrence of XCI-skew and CHIP represents an amplified risk of disease, or helps better define risk categories, will be of clinical significance to establish. As the inherited genetic risk of CHIP is fast becoming better understood, deciphering the genetic predisposition to XCI-skew will also enable the assessment of potential shared genetic susceptibility between the two traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kar et al., 2022</xref>). However, many of the negative results in our study are crucial findings given they expose differences between the risk factors of XCI-skew and CHIP. Notably, recent work has demonstrated smoking and telomere length are causal risk factors for CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kar et al., 2022</xref>), whereas we see no association with either trait in our study, suggesting CHIP and XCI-skew have some distinct aetiologies.</p><p>On a cellular level, we observe that increased abundance of monocytes correlates with increased XCI<bold>-</bold>skew, which is of particular interest given that monocytes/macrophages are involved in the inflammatory pathophysiology of CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Libby et al., 2016</xref>). It is important to note however that changes in monocyte counts alone do not explain the observed levels of XCI-skew. Monocytes account for ~10% of white blood cells whereas XCI-skew is defined here as ≥25% shift in cell mosaicism. Furthermore, age acquired XCI-skew has previously been shown across isolated neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, with correlations between these fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tonon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">van Dijk et al., 2002</xref>), albeit with lower levels of skewing in lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale et al., 1997</xref>). Instead, XCI-skew is likely associated with the age-related haematopoietic bias toward the myeloid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2011</xref>), as we see nominal associations across other myeloid cell types in addition to the monocyte- and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios. Our study also demonstrates an association of reduced levels of IL-10 with increased XCI<bold>-</bold>skew. IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by a broad range of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saraiva and O’Garra, 2010</xref>) and subsets of monocytes differ in their capacities to secrete IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skrzeczyńska-Moncznik et al., 2008</xref>). Follow-up work on inflammatory profiles linked to XCI-skew may reveal mechanistic insights.</p><p>We derived our threshold for XCI-skew from the normalised distribution of the continuous XCI values across the cohort, and defined XCI-skew as measures 1 SD from the mean, corresponding to XCI score ≥75%, and extreme XCI-skew as measures 2 SD from the mean, corresponding to XCI score ≥91%. These values are very similar to thresholds used in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busque et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gale et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zito et al., 2019</xref>), but allow us to test for linear associations across the increasing thresholds of XCI-skew and demonstrate that individuals with lower levels of XCI-skew, which affects &gt;37% of females over 60, are still at elevated risk of ASCVD and future cancer diagnoses. However, to avoid Type I error inflation, we did not run additional tests to compare the extreme XCI-skew group with the random XCI group.</p><p>There are some limitations to our study. Despite the high sample size of individuals with measured XCI, analyses are carried out in subsets of these individuals where date-matched phenotype data were available. In particular, the cytokine analyses have a low sample size and though we detect significant associations with IL-10, we may be underpowered to rule out the possibility of detecting a weaker association with other cytokines, particularly IL-1β. We were also unable to control for cell type composition in the cytokine analyses due to minimal overlap with the date-matched whole blood count data, which may have a significant impact on these findings. Though most of the measures of biological ageing were well-powered, the mDNA GrimAge analysis may benefit from replication in a larger sample size to more robustly establish the relationship between XCI-skew and accelerated epigenetic ageing. Also, with only 41 deaths across the cohort, our all-cause mortality analysis is underpowered, and a study able to focus on specific causes of mortality is warranted.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate XCI-skew is a highly prevalent cellular phenotype in females and is associated with elevated cardiovascular disease risk and predictive of future cancer incidence. Further investigations are needed to translate the biological value of XCI-skew into clinical applications for studying the association of age-related haematopoietic changes and chronic disease associations, regardless of chromosomal sex. Understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, whether XCI-skew is reflective of other ageing markers that increase disease risk, and whether it is therapeutically actionable, are areas of particular interest.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Consultant for Zoe Ltd</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All samples and information were collected with written and signed informed consent, including consent to publish within the TwinsUK study.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Age acquired skewed X Chromosome Inactivation is associated with adverse health outcomes in humans&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carlos Isales as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lambert Busque (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Was XCI measured on whole blood, versus fraction (PMN, Mononuclear cells, buffy coat, other)?</p><p>2. Did the authors look at the correlation between skewing in MZG vs DZ twins. This is known but would be interesting to document.</p><p>3. Was there enough discordant MZG twin pairs (best controls) for the ASCV risk comparison?</p><p>4. Age is the major confounding factor in all analyses. Although the information is present in the text and methods, I think controlling for age (or age-matched) should also be indicated in all figures.</p><p>5. The hypothesis that cardiovascular and cancer risk could be driven in part by CHIP should be added to the discussion.</p><p>6. The XCI skewing data is gathered using the HUMARA test. This is a classical test to score skewing in human cells. Since it is the central method of this manuscript, illustrative examples of the data (random, skew, and extreme skew, as well as non-informative samples) should be provided. This will be helpful to the reader and of broad interest to the <italic>eLife</italic> audience, especially for (epi)geneticists.</p><p>7. When mentioning karyotype, the most common nomenclature is 46, XX, and 46, XY instead of XX,46 or XY,46 – in lines 50 and 51 and maybe elsewhere in the manuscript.</p><p>8. Figure 1B in line 154 and 157 is actually Figure 1C.</p><p>9. Table 1. Table S1, Figure S1 – It is unclear what N means. It should be clarified how many women with or without XCI-skew were analysed.</p><p>10. Please provide in the legend, the numbers of individuals analysed in the three categories in Figure 2A.</p><p>11. Please clarify the methodology performed in the sentence stated on lines 181-183: “XCI-skew was associated with increased ASCVD risk score after controlling for BMI and monocyte abundance”.</p><p>12. In Figure 3, the cumulative number of events table is misleading (e.g. at 10 years, we have 28 events in the random XCI group and 30 events in the XCI-skew group, and therefore they do not look different, while they are in the graph presenting percentages). It should be indicated the total population analysed per group. Also whether the events occur in distinct individuals or in one individual more than one time should be stated.</p><p>13. One aspect that would be important to analyse in the future is the relationship between XCI skewing and mutation burden in blood cells. For example, XCI skew could be a bystander of genetic mutation(s) that would cause clonal expansion of that population. Or XCI skew could determine the fixation of an X-linked mutation in the cell populations. These aspects could be addressed in the discussion.</p><p>14. In the general introduction, dosage compensation by XCI and XCI-skewing is not explained in sufficient detail. Several important features, such as the difference between primary and secondary XCI skewing are completely omitted, as well as a clear overview of the clinical relevance of skewed XCI. The main technology employed to assay XCI skewing is also not described. As a consequence, a general readership is likely to not fully appreciate the open questions addressed by authors, and their relevance in light of the current knowledge and available technologies.</p><p>15. The authors claim to characterize the relationship of skewed XCI with “molecular, cellular and organismal measures of ageing and cardiovascular disease risk and cancer diagnosis”. However, the correlation between XCI skewing in blood-derived DNA and increased age has been already extensively described (i.e. Bolduc et al., 2008, Busque et al., 1996, Hatakeyama et al., 2004; Zito et al., 2019, and many more). Importantly, with the exception of the assessment of XCI skewing which was obtained for &gt;1.500 individuals, the molecular/cellular data presented by the authors is rather limited. Furthermore, when describing the association between skewed XCI and increased monocyte abundance, the authors omit to discuss that within the blood, different populations of hematopoietic cells show different degrees of XCI skewing with myeloid cells showing a high level of skewed XCI (Gale et al., 1997). The association described by the authors is therefore probably reinforcing these observations, and can likely be explained by biases in cell representation within samples. Furthermore, given the limited number of individuals tested for serum levels of CRP and cytokine interleukin, and the negative association observed for IL-10, these results are difficult to interpret.</p><p>16. The relationship between skewed XCI and future cancer diagnosis is also limited by the low numbers of diagnoses in 10-year follow-up and does not allow to take into account cancer type and tissue-specificity. In this context, the authors do not discuss (nor speculate on) how skewed XCI as measured in the blood can be a clinical marker of risk for diseases occurring in other organs. This is a very important point to consider for data interpretation, in light of the existing research addressing the degree of XCI skewing in different tissues and cell types, and not only in blood.</p><p>17. To improve the quality of their manuscript to possibly target a broader audience, the authors should more carefully discuss their findings while including relevant references that are omitted in the current version.</p><p>18. Lines 7-9.</p><p>Age acquired XCI-skew describes the preferential inactivation of one X chromosome across a tissue, which is particularly prevalent in blood tissues of ageing females, and yet its clinical consequences are unknown.</p><p>This sentence is misleading. The preferential inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes only occurs at the onset of XCI and results in primary skewed XCI, which influences the choice of which allele becomes inactivated. Age-acquired XCI skewing is a result of post-XCI selection. The authors should include a clear description of the differences between primary and secondary XCI skewing in the introduction, and they should also describe their relevance to human diseases.</p><p>19. Line 48-49</p><p>X chromosome inactivation (XCI) evolved in placental mammals to compensate for the differences in size between the X and Y sex chromosomes.</p><p>The authors should rephrase this sentence. XCI has evolved to compensate for the X-linked gene dosage between XX females and XY males.</p><p>20. Lines 85-89</p><p>We measured XCI in blood-derived DNA from 1,575 participants (median age = 61) unselected for chronic disease status from the TwinsUK population cohort(Verdi et al., 2019), which comprised of 423 MZ pairs, 257 DZ pairs, and 215 singletons. Using the normalised distribution of XCI, we derive a categorical variable in which XCI-skew equated to 75% XCI, and extreme XCI-skew equated to 91% XCI.</p><p>The authors should describe how the degree of XCI skewing was assayed in their experimental settings as a more general readership is not necessarily familiar with the HUMARA assay. A representative image should be shown in a figure, ideally, a main figure but the Supplementary would also work. A detailed description of the method is also required to allow the reader to follow the considerations related to data analysis in the discussion. Indeed the authors are generally far too vague about their approach, even in the Methods section.</p><p>21. Line 336-337</p><p>The assay failed in 194 samples, and 601 samples were homozygous for the CAG repeat and were therefore uninformative.</p><p>The authors should perhaps comment/speculate on why the assay fail on 194/2382 (almost 10%) of samples. Is this a sample-intrinsic issue? e.g. too-low quality/concentration. If not, 10% failure rate is pretty poor.</p><p>22. Figures quality and data description in legends should be significantly improved. For example, the authors very often talk about &quot;association&quot; in the manuscript with reference to a suboptimal data representation (e.g. a table) – or without showing the data at all. In my opinion, every such statement should be supported be at least a basic scatter plot to illustrate the trends the authors are talking about (and especially the spread of the data). Especially considering that their figures are extremely small in their current version. On a related note, the authors should move the data from the Supplementary to the main figures. They show so little data in the main figures that they can afford to do it.</p><p>23. In figure 2B the labels &quot;lower XCI&quot; and &quot;higher XCI&quot; are misleading.</p><p>24. In figure 3, the authors should plot &quot;probability of cancer diagnosis&quot; as referred to in line 209 of the text and provide a comprehensive figure legend.</p><p>25. When they described the association between skewed XCI and future cancer diagnosis the authors should break the data down into constituent cancer/organ types. It would be interesting to specifically look into data related to blood cancer – especially considering that they are in many cases sex-biased and also more relatable to their blood-derived XCI-skew measurements. Furthermore, the authors should referred to the well-established links between inflammation and many kinds of cancer if this is the reason why it is meaningful to make more general inferences about cancer from blood measurements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Amy L. Roberts et al., investigated the health outcomes impacts of age acquired skewing of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios occurring in blood cells in 1575 females comprised of 423 monozygotic twins pairs, 257 dyzygotic twins pairs and 215 singleton. They demonstrate: (i) associating between skewing and age; (ii) skewing was independent of other biological markers of aging such as smoking, telomere length, or DNAm Grim Age acceleration or frailty index (iii). (iv) that skewing was associated with a myeloid bias with an increase monocyte to lymphocyte and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio; (v)a strong negative association with il-10 level and skewing; (vi) skewing was associated with increase cardiovascular risk; and that (vi) skewing was predictive of cancer.</p><p>General comments.</p><p>Age-associated XCI skewing has been described 25 years ago, yet this phenomenon remains enigmatic in terms of etiology and consequences. The study demonstrates the age-effect on skewing (which is known), but the evolution over time in a sub cohort of subject that were re-sampled. The originality of this study resides in the demonstration that age-associated skewing is associated with health outcomes. The particular strength of the study is the twin component (always aged-matched) and the iterative re-sampling of subgroup of the population study. Despite starting with a large cohort of 1552 individuals, most of the critical observations are made on smaller subsets of subjects: for ASCV risk score the total of subject is 231; IL-10 n=27. Fortunately, for the ASCV score this observation is re-enforced by the twin pairs comparison (N=34). The association with cancer risk is performed on a larger cohort (1417) an controlled for age. However, despite increased risk of Cardiovascular event and cancer, there is no significant association with overall mortality. This indicate that the effect of age-associated skewing is present but modest. The observation that there is a myeloid bias, which is associated with aging, that is more pronounced in subjects with skewing is interesting.</p><p>One of the major unknown of this study is how much of the effect attributed to XCI skewing is in fact related to true clonal hematopoiesis or CHIP that is associated with both outcomes described in this study and will mascarade by changes in XCI.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Roberts et al., is an important piece of work regarding the potentiality of XCI skewing as a biomarker of increase risk for age-driven chronic diseases and cancer. However, the data presenting is exclusively correlative using cohorts of patients.</p><p>– The relationship between XCI skewing and ageing in sound (Figure 1A-B). This is the most robust data from this study that confirms previous results (Busque et al., 1996; Gale et al., 1997; Tonno et al., 1998; van Dijk et al., 2002; Zito et al., 2019). It is unquestionable the importance of this result, but as pointed out by the authors, it is not a novel finding.</p><p>– The link between XCI skewing and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk or cancer incidence is an interesting one. However, the data is not totally convincing in my view. First, the association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is based on a risk score and not in actual CVD events. On the other hand, the prospective study of XCI-skew and future cancer diagnosis is based on 58 cancer events. As the authors pointed out, the link between XCI skewing and cancer has been inconsistent in the literature, perhaps because all these studies, including this one, do not reach enough cancer events to draw definitive conclusions. While the prospect of XCI skewing as a biomarker of chronic disease risk and cancer incidence is important, larger cohorts might be needed to ascertain the usefulness of XCI skew as a prognosis marker.</p><p>– The data presented is exclusively correlative. Although out of scope of this manuscript, functional experiments addressing the effect of XCI skewing in disease outcome would give insights about a potential causal role of XCI skewing in disease onset/progression/prognosis. These types of experiments will increase the impact of the findings using cohort of patients.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78263.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, a better understanding of the co-occurrence of XCI-skew and CHIP within individuals, and the mutational burden within individuals with and without XCI-skew, is an important area of future work. Whether the co-occurrence of XCI-skew and CHIP represents an amplified risk of disease, or helps better define risk categories, will be of clinical significance to establish. As the inherited genetic risk of CHIP is fast becoming better understood, deciphering the genetic predisposition to XCI-skew will also enable the assessment of potential shared genetic susceptibility between the two traits (Kar et al., 2022). However, many of the negative results in our study are crucial findings given they expose differences between the risk factors of XCI-skew and CHIP. Notably, recent work has demonstrated smoking and telomere length are causal risk factors for CHIP (Kar et al., 2022), whereas we see no association with either trait in this study, suggesting CHIP and XCI-skew have some distinct aetiologies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The XCI skewing data is gathered using the HUMARA test. This is a classical test to score skewing in human cells.

In Figure 3, the cumulative number of events table is misleading (e.g. at 10 years, we have 28 events in the random XCI group and 30 events in the XCI-skew group, and therefore they do not look different, while they are in the graph presenting percentages). It should be indicated the total population analysed per group. Also whether the events occur in distinct individuals or in one individual more than one time should be stated.</p></disp-quote><p>To carry out this analysis, we excluded any individual with a cancer diagnosis before or within 6 months of the XCI-skew measure to ensure they were cancer free at baseline. We then took the first cancer diagnosis only for each person within up to 10 years of the XCI measure. Therefore, each event in the Cox regression analysis is an independent cancer diagnosis in one person. These details were included in the methods, but we have added them to the figure legend and the results for clarity. The results now read:</p><p>“We conducted a prospective 10-year follow-up study (median follow-up time 5.65 years) from time of DNA sampling in 1,417 individuals (N<sub>random</sub> = 948, N<sub>skewed</sub> = 469, median age = 60) who were cancer-free at baseline to assess the association between XCI-skew and future cancer diagnoses (cancer events = 58; Supplementary Table S1). Each cancer event represents the first cancer diagnosis (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) in each individual and subsequent diagnoses are not included.”</p><p>We have also added the numbers in each group as well as the percentages of each group with a cancer diagnosis, to the figure legend:</p><p>“A Kaplan-Meier plot (top) and cumulative events (bottom) of cancer diagnosis in individuals with XCI-skew (N=469) and random XCI (N=948) are shown. 2.9% (28/948) of individuals with random XCI, and 6.4% (30/469) of individuals with XCI-skew, developed cancer in the 10-year follow-up.”</p><p>We have also updated Table S1 to represent the number of cancer diagnoses in each organ/tissue for the Random XCI and XCI-skew group which we hope adds clarity to the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. One aspect that would be important to analyse in the future is the relationship between XCI skewing and mutation burden in blood cells. For example, XCI skew could be a bystander of genetic mutation(s) that would cause clonal expansion of that population. Or XCI skew could determine the fixation of an X-linked mutation in the cell populations. These aspects could be addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important piece of future work. We have added the following paragraph to the discussion which addresses the need for this work:</p><p>“Given the existing links between CHIP and XCI-skew as two age acquired blood traits, and that CHIP mutations can be found in individuals with XCI-skew (Busque et al.,. 2012), could the association between XCI-skew and CVD risk be partly driven by CHIP?

In the general introduction, dosage compensation by XCI and XCI-skewing is not explained in sufficient detail. Several important features, such as the difference between primary and secondary XCI skewing are completely omitted, as well as a clear overview of the clinical relevance of skewed XCI. The main technology employed to assay XCI skewing is also not described. As a consequence, a general readership is likely to not fully appreciate the open questions addressed by authors, and their relevance in light of the current knowledge and available technologies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the introduction to include examples of primary XCI-skew before introducing secondary XCI-skew, as well as a broadening the topic more generally:</p><p>“However, some individuals display a skewed pattern of XCI (XCI-skew), which is defined as a deviation from the expected 1:1 ratio. Examples of primary XCI-skew have been identified, including stochastic events resulting in XCI-skew across all tissues (Tukiainen et al., 2016) or the preferential selection of cells expressing functioning alleles in heterozygous females with X-linked recessive traits (Busque and Gilliland, 1998; Nyhan et al., 1970). However, secondary or age acquired XCI-skew is more common and refers to increasing XCI-skew with age, particularly in mitotically active blood tissue (Busque et al., 1996; Gale et al., 1997).</p><p>We have also provided a new Figure 1 which details how XCI-skew is derived from the HUMARA assay (as per point 6 above), and included the following statement in the first Results section regarding the correlation of HUMARA with transcription-based methods:</p><p>“We measured XCI in DNA derived from whole blood using the methylation-sensitive PCR-based Human Androgen Receptor Assay (HUMARA) (Cutler Allen et al., 1992; Hatakeyama et al., 2004) which differentiates between alleles from the active and inactive X (Cutler Allen et al., 1992; Hatakeyama et al., 2004). HUMARA is an extensively used assay which correlates well with transcription-based methods (Bolduc et al., 2008; Zito et al., 2019).<italic>”</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The authors claim to characterize the relationship of skewed XCI with &quot;molecular, cellular and organismal measures of ageing and cardiovascular disease risk and cancer diagnosis&quot;. However, the correlation between XCI skewing in blood-derived DNA and increased age has been already extensively described (i.e. Bolduc et al., 2008, Busque et al., 1996, Hatakeyama et al., 2004; Zito et al., 2019, and many more). Importantly, with the exception of the assessment of XCI skewing which was obtained for &gt;1.500 individuals, the molecular/cellular data presented by the authors is rather limited. Furthermore, when describing the association between skewed XCI and increased monocyte abundance, the authors omit to discuss that within the blood, different populations of hematopoietic cells show different degrees of XCI skewing with myeloid cells showing a high level of skewed XCI (Gale et al., 1997). The association described by the authors is therefore probably reinforcing these observations, and can likely be explained by biases in cell representation within samples. Furthermore, given the limited number of individuals tested for serum levels of CRP and cytokine interleukin, and the negative association observed for IL-10, these results are difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope it was clear in our manuscript that the association seen with ageing is a replication of the many studies that predate ours, and not a novel finding. See lines 463-465 of discussion, which are unchanged from the original version, but which introduce the topic in reference to the long-established association with increasing age. We feel that no study on XCI-skew would be complete without a summary of the association with age seen in this cohort. However, we have amended the manuscript throughout to ensure its as clear as possible that the age association is an expected result, and acts as a validation of our dataset in line with the existing literature. The results now read as follows:</p><p>“As expected, after controlling for relatedness and zygosity, we find a significant positive association between age and XCI skewing (P=2.8x10<sup>-9</sup>, N=1,575). This result replicates the many existing studies on age acquired XCI-skew and acts as a validation of the TwinsUK HUMARA dataset (Busque et al., 1996; Gale et al., 1997; Hatakeyama et al., 2004; Zito et al., 2019).”</p><p>We have also amended the statement in our introduction so that it now reads:</p><p>“We tested this hypothesis by assaying XCI-skew in 1,575 females from the TwinsUK cohort and employed prospective, cross-sectional, and intra-twin designs, to characterise the relationship of XCI with molecular and cellular measures of ageing, cardiovascular disease risk, and cancer diagnoses.”</p><p>We have amended the discussion include reference to the Gale 1997 study, in which there is lower levels of skew in T lymphocytes compared to monocytes, thought to be due to the longer life span of these lymphoid cells. This is appended to our existing discussion point in which we reference two other studies which show correlation between the skew of different cell types.</p><p>“Furthermore, age acquired XCI-skew has previously been shown across isolated neutrophils, monocytes, and T cells, with correlations between these fractions(Tonon et al., 1998; van Dijk et al., 2002), albeit with lower levels of skewing in lymphoid cells (Gale et al., 1997).”</p><p>We agree that the cytokine data are limited, and though we had addressed this in the discussion (see Lines 566-568), we have now updated the results to better reflect this too:</p><p>“We date-matched the XCI data with serum levels of CRP (N<sub>ranodm XCI</sub> = 121; n<sub>Skewed XCI</sub> = 38; N<sub>extreme skew</sub> = 6) and a more modest cytokine dataset of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1B, IL-10, and TNF (N<sub>ranodm XCI</sub> = 23; n<sub>Skewed XCI</sub> = 4) and used linear regression mixed effects models to control for batch effects, age, seasonality, family structure and zygosity (Supplementary Figure S3). We see no association with primary markers of inflammageing CRP (P=0.41), IL-6 (P=0.41), or TNF (P=0.61), though a nominal association with IL-1β is observed (P=0.02) which does not pass multiple correction, but warrants follow up analysis with a larger sample size.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. The relationship between skewed XCI and future cancer diagnosis is also limited by the low numbers of diagnoses in 10-year follow-up and does not allow to take into account cancer type and tissue-specificity. In this context, the authors do not discuss (nor speculate on) how skewed XCI as measured in the blood can be a clinical marker of risk for diseases occurring in other organs. This is a very important point to consider for data interpretation, in light of the existing research addressing the degree of XCI skewing in different tissues and cell types, and not only in blood.</p></disp-quote><p>With 28 cancer events in 948 individuals with random XCI, and 30 cancer events in 469 individuals with XCI-skew, we believe this is a well-powered study for total cancer risk. However, we do agree that we were not sufficiently powered to take into account the tissue-specificity, and it would be interesting to explore cancer risk in specific tissues. Of note, see point 25 below in which removing Haematopoietic / Lymphoid Tissues cancers slightly strengthens the association observed.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, we have added a new paragraph to the discussion in which we speculate on these associations and how they may likely be driven by inflammation and are unlikely to be causally driven by XCI-skew:</p><p>“Though CHIP is also predictive of future cancer diagnosis, the association is limited to haematological cancers (Desai et al., 2018). Whereas here we see blood-derived measures of XCI-skew is predictive of all future cancer diagnoses, even when the haematological cancers are removed from the analysis. Follow-up studies to assess the risk of cancer of specific tissues in individuals with XCI-skew are needed, but we hypothesise that the relationship between XCI-skew measures in blood tissue and cancer will not be causal. Instead XCI-skew is likely a marker of chronic inflammation, which can predispose to the development of cancer through increased mutagenesis and can promote tumorigenesis by shaping the tumour microenvironment to stimulate tumour growth (Greten and Grivennikov, 2019). However, it is interesting that common environmental factors that induce chronic inflammation, such as smoking and obesity, have not been found to be risk factors for XCI-skew in our study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17.

Figures quality and data description in legends should be significantly improved.

In my opinion, every such statement should be supported be at least a basic scatter plot to illustrate the trends the authors are talking about (and especially the spread of the data).

When they described the association between skewed XCI and future cancer diagnosis the authors should break the data down into constituent cancer/organ types. It would be interesting to specifically look into data related to blood cancer – especially considering that they are in many cases sex-biased and also more relatable to their blood-derived XCI-skew measurements. Furthermore, the authors should referred to the well-established links between inflammation and many kinds of cancer if this is the reason why it is meaningful to make more general inferences about cancer from blood measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>The origin of the cancers is included in “Supplementary Table S1: Cancer diagnoses recorded in 10-year follow-up by organ/site.”. We have extended this table to show the cancer diagnoses per XCI random and XCI skewed group too. We are underpowered to run the association on subsets of cancers, however, re-running the analysis after first excluding the Haematopoietic / Lymphoid Tissues cancers slightly strengthens the association observed (P=0.009; HR=2.04 (1.20-3.49)) compared to the original analysis (P=0.012; HR = 1.95 (1.16-3.28)). This suggests the association is not driven by the small number of Haematopoietic / Lymphoid Tissues in the dataset. We have added this to the results (Lines 440-443) and the discussion (Lines 496-498).</p><p>“Though we were underpowered to run associations for specific cancers, given the robust association of CHIP with haematological cancers we were interested to explore the potential that blood cancers were partly driving the association. However, running the analysis without the Haematopoietic/Lymphoid Tissue cancers (see Supplementary Table S1) strengthened the observed association (P=0.009; HR = 2.04 (1.20-3.49)) suggesting a crucial difference in cancer risk between XCI-skew and CHIP.”</p><p>We have also extended the discussion to include the role of inflammation in cancer, and how this may be the link between XCI-skew in blood and cancer across various tissues.</p><p>“Though CHIP is also predictive of future cancer diagnosis, the association is limited to haematological cancers (Desai et al., 2018). Whereas here we see blood-derived measures of XCI-skew is predictive of all future cancer diagnoses, even when the haematological cancers are removed from the analysis. Follow-up studies to assess the risk of cancer of specific tissues in individuals with XCI-skew are needed, but we hypothesise that the relationship between XCI-skew measures in blood tissue and cancer will not be causal. Instead XCI-skew is likely a marker of chronic inflammation, which can predispose to the development of cancer through increased mutagenesis and can promote tumorigenesis by shaping the tumour microenvironment to stimulate tumour growth (Greten and Grivennikov, 2019). However, it is interesting that common environmental factors that induce chronic inflammation, such as smoking and obesity, have not been found to be risk factors for XCI-skew in our study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Amy L. Roberts et al., investigated the health outcomes impacts of age acquired skewing of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) ratios occurring in blood cells in 1575 females comprised of 423 monozygotic twins pairs, 257 dyzygotic twins pairs and 215 singleton. They demonstrate: (i) associating between skewing and age; (ii) skewing was independent of other biological markers of aging such as smoking, telomere length, or DNAm Grim Age acceleration or frailty index (iii). (iv) that skewing was associated with a myeloid bias with an increase monocyte to lymphocyte and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio; (v)a strong negative association with il-10 level and skewing; (vi) skewing was associated with increase cardiovascular risk; and that (vi) skewing was predictive of cancer.</p><p>General comments.</p><p>Age-associated XCI skewing has been described 25 years ago, yet this phenomenon remains enigmatic in terms of etiology and consequences. The study demonstrates the age-effect on skewing (which is known), but the evolution over time in a sub cohort of subject that were re-sampled. The originality of this study resides in the demonstration that age-associated skewing is associated with health outcomes. The particular strength of the study is the twin component (always aged-matched) and the iterative re-sampling of subgroup of the population study. Despite starting with a large cohort of 1552 individuals, most of the critical observations are made on smaller subsets of subjects: for ASCV risk score the total of subject is 231; IL-10 n=27. Fortunately, for the ASCV score this observation is re-enforced by the twin pairs comparison (N=34). The association with cancer risk is performed on a larger cohort (1417) an controlled for age. However, despite increased risk of Cardiovascular event and cancer, there is no significant association with overall mortality. This indicate that the effect of age-associated skewing is present but modest. The observation that there is a myeloid bias, which is associated with aging, that is more pronounced in subjects with skewing is interesting.</p><p>One of the major unknown of this study is how much of the effect attributed to XCI skewing is in fact related to true clonal hematopoiesis or CHIP that is associated with both outcomes described in this study and will mascarade by changes in XCI.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comments. Though we agree that sample sizes are low in some analyses (which we now address more carefully in the revised manuscript), we would also like to draw attention to the many analyses with robust sample sizes, such as smoking (n=1,552), telomere length (n=397), frailty (n=611) and obesity (n=891). These negative findings are vital in our understanding of the causes and consequences of XCI-skew, suggesting XCI-skew as an independent biomarker.</p><p>We completely agree that it is of upmost importance to establish the link with CHIP more robustly, and we hope to do this in follow-up work. However, based on existing literature and our current study, there are some key differences between XCI-skew and CHIP. Firstly, telomere length and smoking are both been identified as causal risk factors for CHIP (Kar, 2022), yet we see no such association in our work. And secondly, CHIP is exclusively associated with blood cancers, whereas we see an association with cancer across all tissues/organs even when removing the small number of haematopoietic cancers from the dataset (n=4 cases). Together these observations suggest that robustly defining the relationship between XCI-skew and CHIP is of vital importance as we do not believe one is fully explained by the other. We have updated the manuscript to draw attention to these important differences. What will be of great interest is determining if the presence of both CHIP and XCI-skew within an individual poses a greater disease risk than either molecular trait occurring independently. We have added these points to the discussion of the paper (see Lines 522-537) which we believe improves the manuscript and we thank you once again for your comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Roberts et al., is an important piece of work regarding the potentiality of XCI skewing as a biomarker of increase risk for age-driven chronic diseases and cancer. However, the data presenting is exclusively correlative using cohorts of patients.</p><p>– The relationship between XCI skewing and ageing in sound (Figure 1A-B). This is the most robust data from this study that confirms previous results (Busque et al., 1996; Gale et al., 1997; Tonno et al., 1998; van Dijk et al., 2002; Zito et al., 2019). It is unquestionable the importance of this result, but as pointed out by the authors, it is not a novel finding.</p><p>– The link between XCI skewing and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk or cancer incidence is an interesting one. However, the data is not totally convincing in my view. First, the association with cardiovascular disease (CVD) is based on a risk score and not in actual CVD events. On the other hand, the prospective study of XCI-skew and future cancer diagnosis is based on 58 cancer events only. As the authors pointed out, the link between XCI skewing and cancer has been inconsistent in the literature, perhaps because all these studies, including this one, do not reach enough cancer events to draw definitive conclusions. While the prospect of XCI skewing as a biomarker of chronic disease risk and cancer incidence is important, larger cohorts might be needed to ascertain the usefulness of XCI skew as a prognosis marker.</p><p>– The data presented is exclusively correlative. Although out of scope of this manuscript, functional experiments addressing the effect of XCI skewing in disease outcome would give insights about a potential causal role of XCI skewing in disease onset/progression/prognosis. These types of experiments will increase the impact of the findings using cohort of patients.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comments. We agree that assessing the risk of XCI-skew on incidence CVD is of upmost importance to establish the true risk of this age acquired trait and this has now been emphasised further in our discussion.</p><p>However, we believe our cancer analysis to be more robust than previous studies for three main reasons: 1) we have corrected for age at study entry in our model; 2) all individuals were cancer-free at baseline therefore removing confounding factors of treatments; 3) we did not focus on cancers of the female reproductive system only as we do not believe this is a robust a priori hypothesis. However, we fully agree with the reviewer that larger studies would ideally be required to confirm the usefulness of XCI-skew as a prognosis marker.</p><p>We also agree with the need for functional experiments, and we hope our study demonstrating these correlations will enable this crucial follow-up work to take place. We would also like to emphasise once more that many of the robust analyses in our study with negative results are of great importance when considering follow-up work. For instance, we have shown that XCI-skew does not correlate with other cellular and molecular markers of biological ageing, nor indeed that frailty, smoking nor obesity are risk factors, and these results we feel are highly significant findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
