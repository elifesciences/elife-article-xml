Polarization with IFNγ and LPS into the ‘classically activated’ M1 macrophage enhances pro-inflammatory and microbicidal responses, important for eradicating bacteria such as <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. By contrast, ‘alternatively activated’ M2 macrophages, polarized with IL-4, oppose bactericidal mechanisms and allow mycobacterial growth. These activation states are accompanied by distinct metabolic profiles, where M1 macrophages favor near exclusive use of glycolysis, whereas M2 macrophages up-regulate oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here, we demonstrate that activation with IL-4 and IL-13 counterintuitively induces protective innate memory against mycobacterial challenge. In human and murine models, prior activation with IL-4/13 enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to a secondary stimulation with mycobacterial ligands. In our murine model, enhanced killing capacity is also demonstrated. Despite this switch in phenotype, IL-4/13 trained murine macrophages do not demonstrate M1-typical metabolism, instead retaining heightened use of OXPHOS. Moreover, inhibition of OXPHOS with oligomycin, 2-deoxy glucose or BPTES all impeded heightened pro-inflammatory cytokine responses from IL-4/13 trained macrophages. Lastly, this work identifies that IL-10 attenuates protective IL-4/13 training, impeding pro-inflammatory and bactericidal mechanisms. In summary, this work provides new and unexpected insight into alternative macrophage activation states in the context of mycobacterial infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>mycobacterium tuberculosis</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>immunometabolism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001637</institution-id><institution>Trinity College Dublin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lundahl</surname><given-names>Mimmi LE</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12/IA/1421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavelle</surname><given-names>Ed C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19FFP/6484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavelle</surname><given-names>Ed C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15/CDA/3310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scanlan</surname><given-names>Eoin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100020270</institution-id><institution>Advanced Materials and Bioengineering Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12/RC/2278_P2 E</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lavelle</surname><given-names>Ed C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15/IA/3154</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>Stephen V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109166/Z/15/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitermite</surname><given-names>Morgane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Activation with interferon gamma (IFNγ) together with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) yields the bactericidal and pro-inflammatory ‘classically activated’ or M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferrante and Leibovich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sica et al., 2015</xref>), whereas activation with the type 2 and regulatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)–4, IL-13, IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)β, results in ‘alternatively activated’ M2 macrophages, which enhance allergic responses, resolve inflammation and induce tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bystrom et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mantovani et al., 2004</xref>). Another key difference between these activation states are their metabolic profiles: whereas classically activated macrophages switch to near exclusive use of glycolysis to drive their ATP production, alternatively activated macrophages instead upregulate their oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van den Bossche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Van den Bossche et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages are key host innate immune cells for controlling the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> has arguably caused the most deaths of any pathogen in human history and continues to be the cause of more than a million deaths annually: in 2020, 10 million people fell ill with active TB and 1.5 million died from the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">World Health Organization team, 2021</xref>). Whilst classifying macrophages into classical and alternative activation states is a simplification – the reality is a broad spectrum of various differentiation states that is continuously regulated by a myriad of signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sica et al., 2015</xref>) – it is nevertheless considered that for a host to control TB infection, classical macrophage activation is vital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jouanguy et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Philips and Ernst, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, a macrophage metabolic shift to glycolysis has been postulated to be a key for effective killing and thus overall control of TB infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, alternatively activated macrophages directly oppose bactericidal responses, which has been demonstrated to lead to enhanced bacterial burden and TB pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). Due in part to the established ability of classically activated macrophages to kill <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, inducing Th1 immunity has been a key aim for TB vaccine development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abebe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersen and Kaufmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ottenhoff et al., 2010</xref>). Apart from targeting adaptive immune memory, another promising approach has emerged in recent years: bolstering innate immune killing capacity by the induction of innate training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khader et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moorlag et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Innate training is regarded as a form of immunological memory. It is a phenomenon where a primary challenge, such as a vaccination or an infection, induces epigenetic changes in innate immune cells, which alters their responses following a secondary challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Meer et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike adaptive immune memory, the secondary challenge does not need to be related to the primary challenge. For instance, Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination has been demonstrated to protect severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice from lethal <italic>Candida albicans</italic> infection; reducing fungal burden and significantly improving survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>). This ability of the BCG vaccine to train innate immunity is now believed to be a mechanism by which it induces its protection against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Apart from the BCG vaccine, it has been demonstrated that other organisms and compounds can induce innate training, such as β-glucan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van der Meer et al., 2015</xref>) which induced protective innate training against virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, as shown by enhanced mouse survival following in vivo infection, and enhanced human monocyte pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion following ex vivo infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moorlag et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, there is a risk that certain immune challenges could lead to innate immune re-programming that hinders protective immune responses. For instance, recent reports have demonstrated how virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 2020</xref>) and mycobacterial phenolic glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lundahl et al., 2020</xref>) can program macrophages to attenuate bactericidal responses to subsequent mycobacterial challenge. In the current study, macrophage activation caused by former or concurrent parasitic infections is considered regarding the possibility of innate immune re-programming that hinders protective immune responses against this disease. Geographically, there is extensive overlap between tuberculosis endemic areas and the presence of helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Salgame et al., 2013</xref>). With regard to macrophage activation and combatting tuberculosis, this is an issue as parasites induce type 2 responses, leading to alternative macrophage activation instead of classical activation and associated bactericidal responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li and Zhou, 2013</xref>). Indeed, it was recently demonstrated how products of the helminth <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> can train murine macrophages for enhanced secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quinn et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Due to the relevance of macrophage plasticity for the control of mycobacterial infection, we primarily focused upon macrophage activation and training in this context. Unexpectedly, our data indicates that macrophage activation with IL-4 and IL-13 induces innate training that enhances pro-inflammatory and bactericidal responses against mycobacteria. Although murine macrophages trained with IL-4 and IL-13 resemble classically activated macrophages, we identify that they do not adopt their typical metabolic profile, instead retaining heightened OXPHOS activity and notably lacking a dependency on glucose and glycolysis. Lastly, we identify IL-10 as a negative regulator of this innate training response, which may have obscured previous identification of this macrophage phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prior alternative activation enhances mycobacterial killing</title><p>Macrophages are key immune cells for combatting <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. Upon infection, alveolar macrophages serve as the initial hosts of the intracellular bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2018</xref>) and bactericidal responses of recruited monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are crucial for control and killing of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, it has been highlighted that an early Th1 driven immune response is key to early eradication of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, where classical activation of macrophages results in effective bactericidal action. However, a complicating factor is the occurrence of concurrent parasitic disease, which instead drives Th2 immunity and alternative macrophage activation, which in turn has been demonstrated to enhance TB pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>). In this context, we sought to investigate how type 2 responses may induce innate memory, and how such memory could affect macrophage bactericidal properties.</p><p>To investigate the effect of IL-4 and IL-13 on macrophage acute and innate memory responses, an in vitro model of BCG infection was used. Murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with IL-4 and IL-13 (M(4/13)) on Day –1, followed by infection with BCG Denmark on either Day 0 or Day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Acutely activated M(IFNγ/LPS) demonstrated elevated secretion of TNFα, IL-6 and IL-10 in response to Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and elevated TNFα and IL-6 in response to PAM3CSK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), compared with M(-). By contrast, M(4/13) had attenuated secretion of each cytokine compared with M(-), following either Mtb or PAM3CSK4 stimulation. However, on Day 6 (innate memory responses), both M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(4/13) secreted greater pro-inflammatory TNFα and reduced anti-inflammatory IL-10 in response to Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and secreted elevated TNFα following PAM3CSK4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

As with the BCG infection, M(IL-4/13) responses changed markedly between Day 0 and Day 6, shifting towards a pro-inflammatory response profile which was similar to classically activated macrophages.</p><p>To consider whether the shift in M(4/13) to a pro-inflammatory cytokine profile was dependent on epigenetic changes, the DNA methylation inhibitor 5′-deoxy-5′-(methylthio)adenosine (MTA), was employed. This inhibitor has been demonstrated to impede training by BCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2012</xref>) and β-glucan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quintin et al., 2012</xref>) – which promote pro-inflammatory responses – as well as training induced by helminth <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> total extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quinn et al., 2019</xref>), which enhances anti-inflammatory responses such as IL-10 and IL-1Ra secretion. The addition of MTA prior to activation with IL-4 and IL-13 on day –1 reduced TNFα, IL-6 and IL-10 secretion induced by either Mtb or PAM3CSK4 on Day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>), resulting in a profile reminiscent of acutely activated M(4/13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). By contrast, inhibition of DNA methylation in M(-) resulted in comparable or even increased cytokine secretion. This suggested that DNA methylation following IL-4 and IL-13 activation contributed to the innate training and subsequent enhancement of pro-inflammatory responses. Moreover, in an attempt to identify which type of histone methylation was occurring, the following global histone H3 modifications were investigated by western blot: H3K4me3, H3K27me3, and H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B-D</xref>). Yeast β-glucan was used a positive control for innate training; however, none of the tested conditions resulted in significant changes in global methylation at any of these sites, demonstrating a need to investigate specific promoter regions in future studies.</p><p>Next, we addressed whether the shift towards pro-inflammatory responses was induced by either IL-4 or IL-13 alone, or was induced by the two cytokines together, and moreover whether this shift applicable to other stimuli. To address the former, BMDMs were trained with either IL-4, IL-13 or both on Day –1, before incubation with media, Mtb or PAM3CSK4 on Day 6. It was observed that any combination of IL-4 and IL-13 activation enhanced the secretion of TNFα in response to PAM3CSK4, and that either IL-4 alone or IL-4 with IL-13 significantly reduced the secretion of IL-10 in response to Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, when comparing training with IL-4 alone or training with IL-4 and IL-13, the combination of the two cytokines resulted further attenuation of IL-10 secretion, to a significant extent, therefore the combination of the two cytokines continued to be used. To address whether trained M(4/13) enhanced inflammatory responses was applicable to other stimuli, various Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists were employed on Day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Incubation of cells with ligands for TLR1/2, TLR4, TLR7/8 or TLR 9 resulted in an increase of TNFα production, reduced IL-10 secretion or both. This demonstrated that prior activation with IL-4 and IL-13 caused a subsequent shift towards a pro-inflammatory response profile in response to a range of pathogen-related agonists.</p><p>Having considered cytokine responses, the expression of <italic>Arg1</italic> and <italic>Nos2</italic> and the secretion of NO were next addressed. In mice, the induction of iNOS is important for bactericidal NO production and subsequent killing of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flynn et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pasula et al., 2017</xref>). In turn, Arg1 directly impedes the bactericidal function of iNOS by sequestering the amino acid, arginine, which each enzyme uses to make their respective products: ornithine and NO. Subsequently, in the murine model of TB infection, Arg1 has been linked with increased bacterial burden and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Without a secondary stimulation on Day 6, M(4/13) and M(IFNγ/LPS) displayed higher levels of <italic>Arg1</italic> and <italic>Nos2</italic> expression, compared with BMDMs incubated in media alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and M(IFNγ/LPS) exhibited markedly higher expression of <italic>Nos2</italic> compared with M(4/13).

Following secondary stimulation with either Mtb or PAM3CSK4, M(4/13) CD80, CD206, and MHC II expression was significantly greater compared with M(-). Having observed a change in activation markers, cytokine induction and bactericidal capacity in M(4/13) between Days 0 and 6, the next question was whether there was a corresponding shift in glycolytic metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BMDMs trained with IL-4 and IL-13 retain OXPHOS metabolism</title><p>The increased energy and biosynthetic precursor demand induced by various macrophage activation states are met in distinct ways. To demonstrate this, extracellular flux analysis was carried out, using a mitochondrial stress test. Following basal respiration, oligomycin – an ATP synthase inhibitor – was added to impede electron transport chain (ETC)-driven ATP synthesis, followed by the proton ionophore FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), which uncouples the ETC from ATP synthase, allowing maximal respiration, and lastly rotenone and antimycin-A were added, which impede complex I and III of the ETC, respectively. Consistent with previous studies, M(4/13) on Day 1 displayed both an increase of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) – indicative of mitochondrial OXPHOS activity – and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) – an indirect measurement of lactic acid secretion and thus indicative of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This demonstrated how alternative activation is intrinsically linked with enhanced mitochondrial OXPHOS activity, via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van den Bossche et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

By contrast, acutely activated M(IFNγ/LPS) displayed an increase in ECAR and reduced OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which was indicative of augmented glycolysis to meet the increased need for ATP, whilst ATP synthesis via OXPHOS is hindered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).

Furthermore, it has recently been proposed that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> impedes this glycolytic shift as an immune evasion strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hackett et al., 2020</xref>). As we had observed that innate memory responses induced by IL-4 and IL-13 caused a switch towards a pro-inflammatory and bactericidal response profile, akin to a classically activated macrophage, it was pertinent to address whether there was an accompanying glycolytic shift. Previous work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van den Bossche et al., 2016</xref> has highlighted that because IL-4 activated human MDMs retain their metabolic versatility, they are able to be ‘re-polarized’ to a classical phenotype. This was demonstrated by activating MDMs for 24 hr with IL-4, before the cells were washed and re-stimulated with IFNγ and LPS for another 24 hr. MDMs previously activated with IL-4 secreted higher concentrations of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-12 compared with MDMs that were naïve prior to IFNγ and LPS stimulation. This adaptive quality to re-polarize is restricted to alternatively activated macrophages, as mitochondrial dysfunction in classically activated macrophages prevents them from re-polarizing to an alternative phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van den Bossche et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, we next addressed whether the IL-4 trained macrophages were adopting a metabolic profile similar to a classical macrophage, or retaining their more versatile metabolic profile.</p><p>As with the BCG infection studies, due to the reduced viability (as observed by reduced cell numbers over time) of the M(IFNγ/LPS) by Day 6 and 7, OCR and ECAR measurements did not reach the detection limit. To compare metabolic phenotypes of the trained macrophages at these later time points, transcription profiles were therefore analyzed. Prior work has established that the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) aids the glycolytic metabolic shift following classical activation, such as upregulating the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seth et al., 2017</xref>) to increase lactic acid fermentation. Tallying with these studies, trained M(IFNγ/LPS) on Day 7 exhibited elevated expression of LDH (<italic>Ldha</italic>) and pyruvate kinase isozyme M2 (PKM2, <italic>Pkm2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). PKM2 has been shown to play a key role in stabilizing HIF-1α and is thus a crucial determinant for glycolytic metabolism re-wiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, on Day 7, M(4/13) displayed a similar level of LDH expression and reduced transcription of PKM2 compared with M(-).</p><p>On the other hand, considering OXPHOS machinery at this time point, trained M(IFNγ/LPS) showed reduced expression of the TCA cycle enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, <italic>Sdha</italic>), whereas this downregulation was not present in M(4/13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, M(4/13) and M(IFNγ/LPS) respectively displayed increased and decreased expression of the transcription factor myelocytomatosis viral oncogene (c-Myc, <italic>Myc</italic>). IL-4 and IL-13 induce c-Myc expression in alternatively activated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Luiz et al., 2020</xref>) and contrastingly LPS induced upregulation of HIF-1α occurs in tandem with downregulation of c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, without secondary stimulation, both trained M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(4/13) retained transcriptional and metabolic profiles consistent with previous reports.</p><p>Upon secondary stimulation on Day 6 with either Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) or PAM3CSK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), M(IFNγ/LPS) maintained the elevated expression of <italic>Pkm2</italic>, accompanied by reduced transcription of <italic>Sdha</italic> and <italic>Myc. Myc</italic> expression was induced in untrained M(-) and M(4/13) by both secondary stimuli, although Mtb did not enhance <italic>Myc</italic> in M(4/13) to the same extent as M(-). Regarding glycolytic metabolism, M(4/13) displayed relatively reduced <italic>Ldha</italic> upon Mtb incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and further maintained a similar level of <italic>Sdha</italic> compared with M(-). These results indicated that trained M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(4/13) maintained their respective metabolic profiles following secondary stimulation with Mtb or PAM3CSK4. As such, these results indicated again that trained M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(IL-4/13) maintained their respective metabolic profiles following secondary stimulation with Mtb or PAM3CSK4.</p><p>That trained M(4/13) retain OXPHOS metabolism was furthermore supported by Mtb stimulation increasing both OCR and ECAR in M(-) and M(4/13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), where M(4/13) displayed significantly greater OXPHOS driven basal respiration, ATP production and concomitant proton leakage compared with M(-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, in response to either Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or PAM3CSK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) there was an increase in spare respiratory capacity (SRC), further signifying that trained M(4/13) retain and even elevate OXPHOS metabolism following secondary stimulation with Mtb.</p><p>To further investigate the metabolic profile of trained M(IL-4/13) vs untrained (media control) stimulated with Mtb, the relative change of intracellular metabolite abundance was furthermore assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref><bold>-E</bold>). This semi-targeted analysis revealed that the trained M(4/13) appeared to have increased use of the urea cycle, as shown by reduced aspartate, arginine and argininosuccinate levels along with enhanced ornithine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Furthermore, there were reduced levels of metabolites associated with glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) – such as lactate and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate – whilst metabolites involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ATP synthesis regulation were enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In the case of FAO, reduced carnitine with enhanced carnitine-bound fatty acids (acyl carnitines) signified that fatty acids were being ferried by carnitine into the mitochondrion for FAO. FAO is upregulated during murine M2 macrophage activation and results in the production of acetyl-CoA, NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub>, which are further used to fuel the TCA cycle and downstream OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O’Neill et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the upregulation of creatine and phosphocreatine – as well as creatine biosynthesis precursor guanidinoacetate – intimated enhanced ATP synthesis. Creatine reacts with ATP to form ADP and phosphocreatine, transporting ATP out of the mitochondrion and preventing allosteric inhibition of ATP synthesis. In the trained M(4/13) the amount of phosphocreatine per ATP was enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which indicated enhanced mitochondrial ATP synthesis and supported the hypothesis that OXPHOS was enhanced. Overall, these results suggested the trained M(4/13) were upregulating their OXPHOS activity in response to mycobacterial challenge.</p><p>Having observed that trained M(IL-4/IL-13) showed a distinct metabolic profile from classically activated macrophages, the roles of glycolysis and OXPHOS in driving cytokine production were next investigated with the use of inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Incubation with the glycolysis and OXPHOS inhibitor 2-deoxy glucose (2-DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) prior to stimulation with Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) significantly reduced TNFα secretion in M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(-). 2-DG also reduced PAM3CSK4 induced TNFα in M(4/13) and M(IFNγ/LPS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and reduced IL-6 secretion in M(4/13) following either Mtb or PAM3CSK4 stimulation. Secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-10 following Mtb stimulation was also reduced by 2-DG in M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(4/13). This demonstrated that glycolysis, OXPHOS or both were involved in driving cytokine responses to Mtb and PAM3CSK4 in all tested macrophages.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>OXPHOS drives inflammatory cytokine responses in IL-4/13 trained BMDMs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cytokine secretion from BMDMs following incubation with media, IL-4 with IL-13 or IFNγ with LPS for 24 hr on Day –1 and incubation with irradiated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) on Day 6 for 24 hr, with or without pre-incubation (Day 6) of oligomycin (OM) or BPTES (n=4).

The role of glutaminolysis in the trained M(IL-4/13) was of interest, as it has previously been highlighted to compensate for inhibition of glycolysis and fuel the TCA cycle during IL-4-induced macrophage activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In the trained M(4/13), inhibition of either OXPHOS or glutaminolysis significantly reduced TNFα and IL-6 secretion following stimulation with either Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) or PAM3CSK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that both processes helped drive pro-inflammatory responses. By contrast, in trained M(IFNγ/LPS), although the markedly lower level of IL-6 was further impeded by either inhibitor, the secretion of TNFα was unaffected, supporting M(IFNγ/LPS) use of glycolysis to drive pro-inflammatory responses. OM and BPTES furthermore impeded IL-10 secretion from M(IFNγ/LPS), whereas OM reduced IL-10 secretion in M(4/13) and BPTES did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the case of trained M(4/13) this implicated that glutamine metabolism was selectively a driver of pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.</p><p>To further cement the differences in glycolytic metabolism between trained M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(4/13), an experiment was carried out where BMDMs were incubated in either glucose depleted media or regular glucose-rich media (both without pyruvate) from Day-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Whereas glucose depletion significantly reduced the secretion of TNFα, IL-6 and IL-10 from M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(-), following Mtb stimulation on Day 6, glucose depletion did not impair pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion of M(4/13); instead the secretion of both TNFα and IL-6 was elevated under these conditions, whilst levels of regulatory IL-10 were further reduced, displaying an even greater shift towards pro-inflammatory responses. Furthermore, stimulation with PAM3CSK4 yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), although IL-6 secretion remained unaltered. This highlighted that although trained M(IFNγ/LPS) and M(4/13) had similar response profiles, M(4/13) appeared to retain M2-typical metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>BMDMs trained with IL-4 and IL-13 retain M2-typical metabolism: schematic summary of results.</title><p>Pathways have been simplified.

Glutaminolysis, FAO and ATP synthesis regulation are implicated. This is demonstrated by inhibitor experiments and by changed expression of metabolites.

Difference in CFU counts after the 3-hr time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were used to calculate killing of internalized BCG. On Day 0, M(-), M(4/13), and M(4/13/10) displayed comparable killing capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

On Day 6, M(-) and M(4/13/10) maintained a similar level of BCG killing, whereas M(4/13) displayed enhanced bactericidal capacity. This indicated that IL-10 hindered the enhanced bactericidal response induced by prior IL-4 and IL-13 macrophage activation. The difference in bacterial killing capacity was further supported by confocal microscopy 27 hr after infection, where it was observed that M(-) and M(4/13/10) had markedly more bacteria per cell compared with M(4/13) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Furthermore, whereas M(4/13) showed a shift towards pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, with IL-10 secretion being reduced whilst TNFα production was largely intact, M(4/13/10) secreted significantly less TNFα than M(4/13), whilst IL-10 secretion was not enhanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

This result was also apparent following secondary challenge with PAM3CSK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), although for MoDMs activated with IL-4 and IL-13, this marked increase was not statistically significant. Moreover, the IL-4 and IL-13 induced enhancement of TNFα was impeded by the addition of IL-10.</p><p>These results showed that prior activation with IL-4 and IL-13 can specifically enhance inflammatory responses to subsequent challenge, and that this phenomenon is impeded by concurrent IL-10 incubation. This data overall reproduced key results shown previously in the BMDM training model, intimating that these findings may be applicable to human macrophages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although ‘classical’ and ‘alternative’ activation are used to describe the two extremes of macrophage polarization, the reality is that a broad spectrum of activation states exist, affected by a multitude of signals. Macrophages are key immune cells for determining the outcome of TB disease, and growing evidence indicates that the macrophage population during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection is highly heterogeneous. Thus, elucidating which subtypes best impede the bacterium is critical for understanding disease control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 2019</xref>). Alternative macrophage activation is particularly relevant to TB pathology, both because alveolar macrophages – the initial hosts of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> upon infection – are biased towards alternative activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2019</xref>), and also considering the influence of concurrent parasitic infection. Given its ultimate relevance in TB pathology, macrophage activation was used as the framework for the work presented herein. The results demonstrate that stimuli of alternative macrophage activation impact innate immune memory, which provides an additional dimension to the noted diversity among macrophage populations.</p><p>The current work demonstrates that prior activation with IL-4 and IL-13 enhances anti-mycobacterial responses towards a subsequent challenge, including enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and BCG killing capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Regarding how this phenomenon is driven, inhibition of DNA methylation prior to activation with IL-4 and IL-13 impeded the enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion induced by a secondary challenge, suggesting that this effect is mediated, at least in part, via epigenetic modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, the role of epigenetic changes – a hallmark for innate training – for the induction of these enhanced responses remains to be addressed in future studies. A role for DNA methylation is in part supported by prior work showing that epigenetic reprogramming is a key component of alternative macrophage activation – crucially de-methylation of H3K27me3 at promoters of key genes such as <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Retnla</italic> and <italic>Chitl3</italic> is required for their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ishii et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether certain epigenetic changes are sustained, or perhaps altered, between the acute activation stage on Day 0 and the secondary stimulation on Day 6 remains to be investigated. Furthermore, given that epigenetic modification is important for alternative macrophage activation, impeding DNA methylation may have also had a downstream effect upon IL-4 and IL-13 activation, which in turn could have resulted in the reduced inflammatory cytokine secretion to subsequent challenge.</p><p>Although further research is required to comprehensively map which mechanism is driving this innate training phenomenon, the current study identifies a macrophage phenotype that is counterintuitively induced by cytokines previously associated with suboptimal mycobacterial containment. Whilst alternatively activated macrophages have been demonstrated to provide an intracellular environment that is favorable for TB growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kahnert et al., 2006</xref>), resulting in greater bacterial burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Moreira-Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>) in an acute setting, there have been some conflicting data concerning the interplay between parasites and mycobacterial infection. Parasitic infection has been shown to enhance mycobacterial bacterial burden in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Potian et al., 2011</xref>) and enhance human TB pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amelio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mabbott, 2018</xref>), but has in some cases also been shown to enhance protection against mycobacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O’Shea et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, discrepancies have been highlighted specifically regarding macrophage activation. In a model of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> macrophage infection in vitro, prior incubation (48 hr) with antigens from <italic>Hymenolepis diminuta</italic>, <italic>Trichuris muris</italic> and <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> resulted in alternative macrophage activation, but only incubation with the <italic>H. diminuta</italic> and <italic>T. muris</italic> antigens resulted in enhanced mycobacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aira et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, the increased growth was accompanied by enhanced secretion of IL-10. This however was not surprising, given that IL-10 has been demonstrated to prevent phagolysosome maturation in human macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Leary et al., 2011</xref>) and promote TB disease progression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beamer et al., 2008</xref>). Herein, an additional mechanism is proposed, where IL-10 reduces IL-4 and IL-13 induced macrophage training and subsequent control of mycobacterial challenge.</p><p>BMDM activation with IL-4 and IL-13, with or without the addition of IL-10, resulted in similar activation states: comparable expression of <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Retnla</italic> and <italic>Chil3</italic> on Day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref><bold>7</bold>), reduced expression of CD80 and upregulation of CD206 on Day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as well as reduced secretion of cytokines TNFα, IL-6 and IL-10 following stimulation with Mtb on Day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref><bold>A</bold>). Whilst this hyporesponsive profile was maintained in the M(4/13/10), the trained M(4/13) on the other hand demonstrated enhanced pro-inflammatory and bactericidal mechanisms in response to mycobacterial challenge a week after initial activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This intimated that IL-10 was a negative regulator of innate training induced by IL-4 and IL-13 and indicates that distinct cytokine-mediated modes of alternative macrophage activation differ regarding their innate memory programming. The ability of IL-10 to modulate innate training was herein further demonstrated by investigating innate memory induced by β-glucan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), where the addition of IL-10 during the training stage resulted in attenuated cytokine secretion following secondary LPS stimulation. This discovery has thereby revealed an exciting avenue for future research in this field.</p><p>In response to mycobacterial challenge the IL-4 and IL-13 trained cells adopted a phenotype similar to classically activated BMDMs: a skewing towards pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion with concomitant increased expression of <italic>Nos2</italic> and NO production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), as well as enhanced mycobacterial killing capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Classical macrophage activation is intrinsically linked with a glycolytic shift in metabolism; it is thus not surprising that prior work has identified an enhancement of glycolysis as critical for efficient <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gleeson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2018</xref>), and that impeding glycolysis attenuates the ability of macrophages to control TB infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hackett et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, upon <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, macrophages appear to undergo a biphasic metabolic profile, where they switch from an initial increase in glycolytic metabolism to an enhancement of the TCA cycle and OXPHOS, a switch which allows mycobacterial survival and disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shi et al., 2019</xref>). As such, it was expected that the trained M(4/13) would shift towards glycolytic metabolism. However, this was not the case, as Mtb stimulation resulted in enhanced OCR and SRC, indicating the use and upregulation of OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, LC-MS analysis of metabolites indicated increased use of FAO, as well as enhanced creatine, further supporting the continued use of M2-typical metabolism. This was moreover confirmed with the use of the ATP synthase inhibitor oligomycin, where it was demonstrated that inhibition of OXPHOS reduced trained M(4/13) cytokine secretion; by contrast, TNFα upregulation in M(IFNγ/LPS) was unaffected. Furthermore, when trained M(4/13) were incubated in a glucose depleted environment during the week preceding secondary stimulation, the pro-inflammatory shift was enhanced as reflected in increased TNFα and IL-6 secretion combined with reduced IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This was in stark contrast to the effect of glucose depletion on untrained M(-) and trained M(IFNγ/LPS), where the secretion of all measured cytokines was attenuated. This contrast between M(4/13) and M(IFNγ/LPS) cemented their differences regarding metabolic dependency on glucose. It should be noted that prior work has identified differences in macrophage metabolic profiles in response to infection with live <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compared with the killed bacterium or infection with attenuated BCG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cumming et al., 2018</xref>). However, the consensus is that classic macrophage activation, and an accompanying shift to glycolytic metabolism, is paramount for effective mycobacterial killing and propagation of inflammatory responses. It is surprising therefore that these results summarily intimated that trained M(4/13) do not rely on glycolysis to fuel anti-mycobacterial responses.</p><p>The addition of a glycolysis inhibitor reduced cytokine secretion, from M(-), M(IFNγ/LPS), as well as M(4/13) following secondary stimulation (Figure 3—figure supplement 2A<bold>-B</bold>). That inhibition of glycolysis impeded pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion, but glucose depletion did not, indicated that glycolysis in trained M(4/13) was fueling the TCA cycle and downstream OXPHOS, and upon glucose depletion, other pathways, such as glutaminolysis, were compensating for this loss. Glutaminolysis has been shown to be upregulated following macrophage activation with IL-4 and has been demonstrated to compensate for glycolysis inhibition in driving the TCA cycle and OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In the present study, it was moreover observed that the use of a glutaminolysis inhibitor reduced TNFα and IL-6 secretion following secondary stimulation in trained M(4/13) specifically, and not in untrained M(-) or trained M(IFNγ/LPS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This work suggests that OXPHOS can be important for pro-inflammatory responses, an observation that is supported by previous work demonstrating that mitochondrial stress is a mechanism of macrophage tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Timblin et al., 2021</xref>) and that the ETC is important for nod-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billingham et al., 2022</xref>). In the latter study, however, LPS induced TNFα secretion was not impeded by inhibition of ETC complexes I and II, demonstrating once more that the metabolic phenotype of the trained M(4/13), explored in the current study, is highly unexpected and warrants further study.</p><p>Regarding classical macrophage activation, in the current study concurrent LPS and IFNγ stimulation did not appear to lead to tolerance, as secondary stimulation with Mtb on Day 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>) or Day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) resulted in enhanced TNFα and dampened IL-10 secretion. This is somewhat contrary to prior work demonstrating how LPS induces tolerance in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domínguez-Andrés et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Timblin et al., 2021</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the relatively low concentration of LPS employed in the present study, and/or the concurrent stimulation with IFNγ. However, although tolerance was not induced, for the classically activated BMDMs and MoDMs there was a reduction in viability over time; as a result there were too few cells to reach the detection limit to measure extracellular flux in the trained M(IFNγ/LPS) BMDM. It could be that the metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis results in a macrophage phenotype that cannot be sustained over such a long period in culture. Overall, this presumed loss of viability greatly limited the number of experiments where trained M(IL-4/13) could be directly compared with trained M(IFNγ/LPS). Although further investigation of long-term activation states of M(IFNγ/LPS) are warranted, the accumulated results for M(IFNγ/LPS) in the current study demonstrate the distinctive metabolic phenotype driving the inflammatory responses in the trained M(IL-4/13).</p><p>The metabolic profile in trained M(4/13), as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, is not only distinct from classically activated macrophages, but also from that seen with other training stimuli, such as β-glucan. Innate training is being tested as a means to bolster innate immunity against <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khader et al., 2019</xref>) and it was recently reported that training with β-glucan was protective against subsequent <italic>M tuberculosis</italic> infection, as seen by enhanced human monocyte pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and increased mouse survival in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moorlag et al., 2020</xref>). Similar to classical macrophage activation, β-glucan training results in a glycolytic shift, as demonstrated in human monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the phenotype of the trained M(4/13) is distinct from other macrophage phenotypes previously demonstrated to protect against TB, and thus offers an additional avenue for future research regarding strategies for combatting this disease.</p><p>The majority of the presented experiments were carried out in a murine in vitro system, using live BCG or irradiated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv. Therefore, future work should address the translation of our findings to TB in vivo models, as well as in the context of human TB disease pathology. Regarding metabolic profiles, prior work has identified differences in human macrophage metabolic phenotypes in response to infection with live virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compared with the killed bacterium or infection with BCG; BCG induced greater glycolytic metabolism, whilst infection with virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> H37Rv resulted in a quiescent phenotype where both extracellular acidification and oxygen consumption were dampened with increasing MOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cumming et al., 2018</xref>). Although preliminary work herein has demonstrated that human monocyte derived macrophages trained with IL-4 and IL-13 show a markedly enhanced secretion of TNFα in response to secondary stimulation with either irradiated Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) or PAM3CSK4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), the metabolic profile driving these responses remains to be investigated, as well as how this macrophage activation state would impact on the outcome of infection with virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van den Bossche et al., 2016</xref> highlighted a key adaptive distinction between classical and alternative macrophage activation: that alternatively activated macrophages can be ‘re-polarized’ due to their metabolic versatility, whereas the mitochondrial dysfunction which occurs during classical macrophage activation prevents such reprogramming. The current study identifies an additional adaptive capacity where activation of macrophages with IL-4 and IL-13 programs BMDMs to better respond to a subsequent mycobacterial challenge, whilst crucially retaining their metabolic diversity. In conclusion, our work presents a new insight into how innate training with IL-4 and IL-13 can enhance macrophage pro-inflammatory responses and mycobacterial killing. This unexpected finding shows how macrophage plasticity belies the usual M1-M2 dichotomy and provides a new framework to explore the impact of comorbidities, such as parasitic infections, on TB disease burden.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, serotype R515)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lipopolysaccharide, LPS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Enzo</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# ALX-581–007 L002</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary cell isolation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Buffy packs from Irish Blood Transfusion Service</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>, C57BL/6JOlaHsd)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary cell isolation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">In-house colonies</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6JOlaHsd</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Both sexes employed</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Denmark 1331</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift to Prof. Gordon from Prof. Behr, McGill University, Canada</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, strain H37Rv)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Irradiated whole cells of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEI resources</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NR-49098</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Non-viable bacteria</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">L929</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">gift of Prof. Muñoz-Wolf, Trinity College, Dublin<break/>gift of Prof. Sheedy, Trinity College, Dublin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell lines maintained in E.

Animals were maintained according to the regulations of the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA).

Briefly, bone marrow cells were extracted from the leg bones and were cultured in high glucose DMEM, supplemented with 8% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 50 U ml<sup>–1</sup> penicillin, 50 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> streptomycin (hereafter referred to as complete DMEM [cDMEM]). Cells were plated on non-tissue cultured treated petri dishes (Corning) on day –8. Fresh medium was added on day –5 and on day –2 adherent cells were detached by trypsinization and collected. Unless specified otherwise, for acute/polarization studies, BMDMs were seeded in 12-well plates at 0.9×10<sup>6</sup> BMDMs per well, and for training studies, BMDMs were seeded in 24-well plates at 0.2×10<sup>6</sup> BMDMs per well.</p><p>On day –1 BMDMs were cultured with medium (naïve/untrained) or activated with 25 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> IFNγ, 10 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> LPS, 40 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> IL-4, 20 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> IL-13, 40 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> IL-10, 100 μg ml<sup>–1</sup> whole β-glucan particles (WGP Dispersible) – derived from the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> – or a combination of one or more activation stimuli, as specified in relevant figure legends. After 24 hr, the supernatant was replaced with fresh media. For acute activation/polarization studies, the BMDMs were left to rest for 2 hr before experiment. For training studies, the BMDMs were left to rest, fed on day 3 or 4 and experiments were carried out on day 6. The cDMEM used was supplemented with L929 cell line conditioned media, containing macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) where two different batches were used. For all experimental repeats where β-glucan was used with or without the addition of IL-10, 20-, 20–10-, 7-, and 5% were used on days −8,–5, –2, 0 and 3/4 respectively (L929 batch gifted by Prof. Sheedy). For all other experiments 25-, 25-, 15-, 10-, and 7% were used on days −8,–5, –2, 0 and 3/4 respectively (batch gifted by Prof. Muñoz-Wolf).</p><p>To generate human monocyte-derived macrophages (MoDMs), mononuclear cells were isolated on day –7 from peripheral blood buffy coats obtained from the Irish Blood Transfusion Services (Dublin, Ireland) using density gradient centrifugation with Lymphoprep. Cells were cultured on plastic in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS (hereafter referred to as complete RPMI [cRPMI]) and 20 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> recombinant human M-CSF at 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells ml<sup>–1</sup>, seeded at 2×10<sup>6</sup> cells per well. On day –4, 1 ml of media was carefully removed from each well and replaced with fresh cRPMI, supplemented with 20 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> recombinant human M-CSF. Non-adherent cells were removed by washing once on day –1 with pre-warmed PBS and incubated with cRPMI, supplemented with 5 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> M-CSF. After a minimum of 4 hr of rest, either more media was added (naïve/untrained) or the MoDMs were activated with 20 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> recombinant human IFNγ with 5 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> LPS or 20 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> IL-4 with 10 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> IL-13, the latter with or without 20 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> IL-10. After 24 hr (day 0), the media was removed and replaced with cRPMI, supplemented with 5 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> M-CSF. For acute activation/polarization studies, the MoDMs were left to rest for 2 hr before experiment. For training studies, the MoDMs were left to rest, fed on day 3 (media supplemented with 2.5 ng ml<sup>–1</sup> M-CSF) and experiments were carried out on day 6. Supply of human blood products from IBTS was approved by clinical indemnity to F.

For imaging of internalized BCG in untrained and trained BMDMs, 0.2×10<sup>6</sup> BMDMs were seeded on circular glass coverslips (placed in 24 well plates, one coverslip per well) that had been previously treated with sodium hydroxide to aid attachment.</p><p>BMDMs were incubated with media (naïve) or activated as outlined above on day –1, for 24 hr before BMDMs were washed and fresh media was added. For acute activation studies, BMDMs were infected with BCG Denmark minimum 3 hr later. For training studies, BMDMs were fed on day 3 and infected with BCG Denmark on Day 6. At the time of infection, the media was removed and replaced with fresh media, either with or without (negative control) bacteria.</p><p>Regarding infection dose (BCG per cell), for infection in acutely activated BMDMs, cell number per well was assumed to be 0.5×10<sup>6</sup>. For infecting trained BMDMs, three extra wells were prepared for all conditions and BMDMs were removed from these wells by trypsinization on day 5, pooled and counted in triplicate. Prepared BCG single cell suspension (see below) was diluted to reach an intended infection dose of 5 BCG per cell (as measured by OD<sub>600</sub>, where 0.1 is estimated to be 10×10<sup>6</sup> bacteria ml<sup>–1</sup>). Each infection dose was measured via CFU counts (see below) and was thus subsequently corrected to an actual infection dose of roughly 30 BCG per cell.</p><p>Three hours post infection the supernatant was removed and the infected BMDMs were washed twice with Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to remove extracellular bacteria, and fresh media was added.</p><p>To measure cytokine secretion at each time point (3-, 27-, and 51 hr post infection), supernatant was collected and filtered (polyethersulfone [PES] 0.22 μm Luer lock syringe filter; Millex-GP) to remove BCG, prior to specific cytokines being measured by ELISA.</p><p>For CFU counts, at each time point the media was removed, wells were washed once with PBS before the BMDMs were lysed with 0.05% Tween20 in water. The cell lysate was diluted in pre-warmed (37 °C) 7H9 media, and 50 μl of dilutions 10<sup>–2</sup>-10<sup>–6</sup> were spread onto enriched 7H11 agar plates by dotting. Agar plates were incubated at 37 °C for 6 weeks and colonies were counted once a week from week 2 and on. CFU counts 3 hr gave the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Killing was assessed by the difference in CFU counts following the 3 hr time point, see accompanying dataset for comprehensive calculations.</p><p>For imaging internalized BCG (wells containing glass coverslips), media was removed, BMDMs were washed with PBS and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) overnight. The paraformaldehyde was then removed and coverslips were stored in PBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Stimulation experiments</title><p>Naive (media control) or activated BMDMs were incubated with media or secondary stimuli on day 0 (acute activation/polarization) or day 6 (training).

Supernatant was removed, cells were washed once in PBS and 10 μl of RIPA buffer was added per well. After pipetting up and down and scraping, the buffer was collected and samples from the same condition were pooled. Of pooled solution, 20 μl was used to measure protein concentration, using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (microplate procedure).

Solvent A was 20 mM ammonium carbonate, 0.05% ammonium hydroxide; Solvent B was acetonitrile. The column oven and autosampler tray were held at 40 °C and 4 °C, respectively. The chromatographic gradient was run at a flow rate of 0.200 mL/min as follows: 0–2 min: 80% B; 2–17 min: linear gradient from 80% B to 20% B; 17–17.1 min: linear gradient from 20% B to 80% B; 17.1–22.5 min: hold at 80% B.

The mass spectrometer was operated in full-scan, polarity-switching mode, with the spray voltage set to +4.5 kV/–3.5 kV, the heated capillary held at 320 °C, and the auxiliary gas heater held at 280 °C. The sheath gas flow was set to 25 units, the auxiliary gas flow was set to 15 units, and the sweep gas flow was set to 0 unit. HRMS data acquisition was performed in a range of <italic>m/z</italic>=70–900, with the resolution set at 70,000, the AGC target at 1×10<sup>6</sup>, and the maximum injection time (Max IT) at 120ms. Metabolite identities were confirmed using two parameters: (1) precursor ion m/z was matched within 5 ppm of theoretical mass predicted by the chemical formula; (2) the retention time of metabolites was within 5% of the retention time of a purified standard run with the same chromatographic method. Chromatogram review and peak area integration were performed using the Thermo Fisher software Tracefinder 5.0 and the peak area for each detected metabolite was normalized against the total ion count (TIC) of that sample to correct any variations introduced from sample handling through instrument analysis.

Whilst on ice, the solution was sonicated for 5 min, at 50% power and 50% time pulse rate, while the tip was immersed roughly 5 mm below the surface of the liquid. The β-glucan particles were then pelleted by centrifugation (1000 G, 10 min, room temperature) and the water was removed by careful decanting and replaced with 0.2 M NaOH in water, at a volume to reach 25 mg ml<sup>–1</sup>. After 20 min, the β-glucan was washed three times with sterile water, using the same pelleting, decanting and replacement of solvent conditions as described.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>General Concerns</p><p>1. Several of the experimental data sets are limited to two experimental replicates (please see Figure 1, 3, 6, S1). These may be enough to calculate t-statistic, but there is no way to assess whether the assumption of normality is true and needless to say that if they employed a non-parametric test, it will not achieve p&lt;0.05. These experiments require additional replicates.</p><p>2. It is unclear how &quot;killed BCG&quot; values were calculated, and the text and material and methods are not consistent. is killing and not just simply lack of mycobacterial replication. There could be a combination of BCG replication and killing and with this assay is very difficult to discriminate that. Does this represent the difference in CFU between 3h (i.e. after the initial inoculum) and each subsequent time point. Since the baseline is different, this calculation will exaggerate differences. The actual viable CFU at each time point should be presented on log scale, and separately as normalised ratios to the 3h data. If any plots presenting 'killing' in the current format are presented, then the method used to calculate killing needs to be clearly outlined in the methods or relevant figure legend. Furthermore, the colony counts are restricted to intracellular bacteria. Neither BCG or Mtb are obligate intracellular organisms. The authors should also assess extracellular bacteria, and quantify macrophage cell death over this time course, which may obviously release bacteria into the extracellular space.</p><p>Specific Concerns</p><p>3. Please clarify with regards to the potential specific effects of IL-4 and IL-13. The authors use a combination of IL-4/IL-13 in their experiments: what is the IL-4 and IL-13 effects separately? One could envisage that maybe only one of the cytokines induces these effects.</p><p>4. What is the effect of IL-4 or IL-13 on trained immunity induced by microbial stimuli such as β-glucan or BCG?</p><p>5. The metabolic studies of the IL-4/14 trained macrophages are very interesting. Is it correct to say blocking glutaminolysis before the secondary stimulation blocked cytokine production? How about if glutaminolysis would be blocked during the initial 24h exposure to IL-4/13 (and not during the secondary stimulation): is the trained immunity effect inhibited as well? This experiment would be required to argue that glutaminolysis inhibits trained immunity.</p><p>6. Does the glucose-depleted medium used for the experiments in Figure 4 contain pyruvate? Pyruvate is a common compound in some growth media, and it can be an alternative substrate for glucose.</p><p>7. Does IL-10 inhibit trained immunity induced by microbial compounds as well?</p><p>8. Consistent with previous reports, the authors observed that (IL-4/13) macrophages on Day 1 have increased OCR and ECAR values. However, a critical comparison with (IFNγ/LPS) macrophages would be at day 6 but as with the BCG infection studies, the M(IFNγ/LPS) showed reduced viability. This is an important experiment that should be done in a way that cell death is not induced, and seahorse studies are needed to validate the transcriptional data. Currently, it looks like the gene expression analysis was performed in dead cells.</p><p>9. Are M(4/13) and M(4/13/10) expressing classical alternative activation markers also at day 6 and following stimulation (either with Mtb or PAM3CSK4)? These data would be important to answer how much surface expression profiles might correlate (or not) with functional responses, such as the pro-inflammatory response or the metabolic profile observed on Day 6 for M(4/13).</p><p>10. The comparisons between IL4/13 and IFNγ/LPS primed BMDM at 6 days are lacking for some key assays (BCG killing and Seahorse metabolic measurements) because the authors say that IFNγ/LPS primed BMDM had reduced viability at this stage. I don't understand why this is case. It reduces the value of the observations in IL4/13 primed BMDM at 6 days, because we can't evaluate their specificity. In addition, the validity/interpretation of cytokine and transcriptomic analyses of day 6 IFNγ/LPS primed BMDM is a particular concern because this is likely to be confounded/biased by the reduced viability of the cells. These data should be excluded.</p><p>11. What is the combined priming with IFNγ and LPS is supposed to be modelling biologically. If the purpose is to model Th1 modulation of macrophage biology, then would IFNγ priming by itself as a more appropriate comparator to Th2 IL4/13 cytokines.</p><p>12. The authors propose that IL4/13 priming of mouse BMDM induces epigenetic changes responsible for the delayed pro-inflammatory phenotype. They need to show this experimentally, by methylation analyses and/or ATAC sequencing. The methylation inhibitor data which are presented in Figure S3C using the methylation inhibitor are too preliminary to draw meaningful conclusions, particularly as an important control has not been presented – unstimulated BMDMs incubated with the methylation inhibitor (to assess for on- or off-target effects on baseline cellular function).</p><p>13. An important consideration is that IL4 in particular can be a stimulus for macrophage proliferation in mouse cells. Therefore, the authors need to experimentally assess whether their 'delayed' phenotype is in fact associated with cell cycle/proliferation.</p><p>14. Please clarify the interpretation of the data from experiments using the metabolic inhibitor 2-DG. I understood the objective was to reverse the metabolic programming mediated by IL4/13 priming, in which case I would expect the IL10 response to increasing in the presence of 2-DG. The fact that 2-DG leads to reductions in all the cytokine responses only serves to show that cytokine production requires active metabolism. In addition, there is no control condition of unstimulated BMDMs incubated with the metabolic inhibitors, which would again be important to assess for on- or off-target effects on baseline cellular function.</p><p>15. The link between changes in metabolism and control of Mtb needs to be verified experimentally, particularly to test the hypothesis that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation attenuates bacterial killing. Key experiments, at least the effects of +/-IL4/13 and +/-IFNγ priming on differential cytokine responses to restimulation after six days, and mycobacterial growth restriction need to be verified in human monocyte-derived macrophages.</p><p>16. The Extracellular flux studies comparing IL-4/IL-13 vs IL-4/IL-13/IL-10 training are missing and would be critical to support the cytokine and transcriptional profile (Figure 6). This will address an important point regarding the functional metabolic consequences of IL-10 during macrophage training, as claimed in the manuscript.</p><p>Other</p><p>Why the title only considers IL4 and not IL-13 the experiments are performed with both cytokines? The title should be revised.</p><p>Most of the evidence cited is derived exclusively from mouse models that have not been replicated in human macrophages. The provenance of data should be clearer throughout the introduction and this limitation of the evidence more prominently stated.</p><p>The authors acknowledge in the Introduction and Discussion that the concept of 'M1 and M2 macrophages' oversimplifies the complexity of macrophage plasticity, they still use the dichotomy as a framework for experimental design and employ the terminology throughout the manuscript. This makes for inconsistent reading and the manuscript would be improved if the experiments &amp; results were contextualised within macrophage plasticity as a broad concept, with references to 'M1' and M2' removed.</p><p>Lines 61-63, the assertion that a metabolic shift to glycolysis is 'crucial for effective killing' of mycobacteria is overstated. The evidence is limited to associations rather than causation.</p><p>Lines 66-68, the strength of the assertion that it is established that Th1 priming of macrophages confers the ability to kill Mtb is overstated. This has never been reproducibly shown in human cells. The references given for this assertion do not contain data to support it and should be revised. In addition, one of the references provided for the subsequent assertion that alternative activation of macrophages opposes bactericidal responses and leads to enhanced bacterial burden (Orecchioni et al.,) does not contain any data about bacterial or mycobacterial control in this context. This should be clarified in case it is not the intended reference, or removed.</p><p>Lines 75-76, the description of innate training as 'non-specific' is misleading. More accurate to describe this as a mechanism for providing heterologous immunity.</p><p>Lines 79-80, the assertion that BCG vaccine protection against Mtb is mediated primarily by trained immunity is misleading. This has not been shown in man.</p><p>Lines 108-117 can be deleted, as they provide unnecessary repetition of the introduction.</p><p>Lines 147-148, the sentence doesn't make sense as written.</p><p>The data presented in figure 1B are referred to as measuring the 'multiplicity of infection' in the different conditions, however, in the text and methods, the authors state that they infect the BMDMs with 30 bacteria per cell, which would therefore be the MOI. Instead, the data presented in 1B appears to be a measure of differential bacterial uptake between the conditions. This should be clarified.</p><p>The cytokine ELISA results in Figure 1 (BCG), Figure 2 and S2 (irradiated Mtb) and Figure S3 (PCSK) have some inconsistencies which need to be clarified. The unprimed unstimulated BMDMs in Figure 1 do not secrete any TNF at baseline, however in some experiments within the subsequent figures, cells in the same unprimed/unstimulated condition secrete &gt;500pg/ml TNF. This discrepancy should be noted and potential reasons for it commented upon. In addition, cytokine ELISA assays typically have a limit of detection which is higher than the 0pg/ml presented as the lower limit of the Y axes in these figures. The figures should be adapted to show this limit of detection. Finally, the presentation of this data is split across multiple core and supplementary figures, and different Y-axis scales are used for plots presenting data for the same cytokine (e.g. TNF in Figure S3a: Y-axis scale 0-2700; TNF in Figure S3b: Y-axis scale 0-15000). This hinders the readers' interpretation, particularly as the results are discussed within one paragraph (lines 173-184) with comparisons drawn therein by the authors. The data should be presented within one figure and consistent Y-axis scales used for each cytokine.</p><p>Figure 3A, the application of oligomycin, FCCP and rotenone and antimycin-A need to be explained in the legend, and in the results narrative.</p><p>The nitric oxide pathway data presented is preliminary, particularly as the authors state the BMDMs did not release NO in relation to their stimulus of interest (irradiated Mtb), so LPS is used instead. The rationale for switching stimulus to LPS is unclear. Other mycobacterial stimuli should instead be tested, e.g. live BCG or Mtb.</p><p>The reference in line 486 (Kahnert et al.,) is stated to show that &quot;acute alternative macrophage activation has been demonstrated to lead to reduce control of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> growth&quot;. This is not shown in this paper, which does not contain any experiments assessing mycobacterial growth or killing. The reference should be altered or removed, or the preceding statement adapted.</p><p>It was assumed that the authors have limited bacterial viability assessments to BCG for lack of access to appropriate biosafety containment level 3 facilities. Ideally, these should be extended to Mtb to confirm that the effects are replicated in bacteria with the full complement of intracellular survival/ immune evasion mechanisms, and more directly relevant to disease. If they are not able to do that, this limitation of their data needs to be highlighted in the discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Macrophage Innate Training Induced by IL-4 and IL-13 Activation Enhances OXPHOS Driven Anti-Mycobacterial Responses&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

One could envisage that maybe only one of the cytokines induces these effects.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewer’s concern about the roles of IL-4 and IL-13 regarding training, we have added Figure 2—figure supplement 1E. This experiment showed how both cytokines could enhance inflammatory responses, yet that IL-4 and IL-13 together resulted in the greatest training effect, especially with regard to secondary stimulation with irradiated Mtb, therefore both were used for all subsequent experiments. Given that both cytokines are typically used together as M2 polarizing stimuli in murine studies, this decision matched prior work in the field. This experiment was carried out at an early stage of the project, but was not included initially due to the Mtb data – that training with IL-4 and IL-13 in this case did not enhance TNF, which did not concur with our prior work. Based on troubleshooting, we found that this was due to an aliquot of irradiated Mtb having been freeze-thawed too many times. However, due to the reduction of IL-10, we still observed a key component of the training profile and an overall skewing towards pro-inflammatory responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. What is the effect of IL-4 or IL-13 on trained immunity induced by microbial stimuli such as β-glucan or BCG?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the reviewers raise a very interesting question regarding how these cytokines interact with other training stimuli, we think that adequately answering these questions are beyond the scope of this story. To adequately answer this question one would need to consider numerous proportions/ratios of the signals given. Furthermore, prior work by Mihai Netea has for instance highlighted that concentration matters hugely when it comes to training; as an example, a low concentration of LPS causes training, whereas a high concentration causes tolerance. In this case, when considering very different mechanisms at play – comparing IL-4/13 training with either BCG or β-glucan training – one would need to consider the strength of each stimulus, try how to provide each to an equal extent, or at least know which is more dominant in one experiment and vary it accordingly. With all these considerations in mind, we believe that this is an interesting question which we cannot adequately answer within the scope of this story.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The metabolic studies of the IL-4/14 trained macrophages are very interesting. Is it correct to say blocking glutaminolysis before the secondary stimulation blocked cytokine production? How about if glutaminolysis would be blocked during the initial 24h exposure to IL-4/13 (and not during the secondary stimulation): is the trained immunity effect inhibited as well? This experiment would be required to argue that glutaminolysis inhibits trained immunity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment that the studies carried out does not answer whether glutaminolysis is important for the induction of training. However, the work herein does show that glutaminolysis is important for driving the enhancement of TNFα and IL-6 following secondary stimulation. This, along with other metabolic data, demonstrated a continued use of M2-typical metabolism. We did consider the suggestion above, but we reasoned that blocking glutaminolysis would impede the acute activation induced by IL-4 and IL-13. Given that previous work has outlined that an upregulation of glutaminolysis is a key component of IL-4/13 activation of macrophages; if glutaminolysis was blocked prior to IL-4/13 activation and there was an inhibition of training, we would not be able to isolate the role of glutaminolysis specifically, as it is a key component of acute alternative activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Does the glucose-depleted medium used for the experiments in Figure 4 contain pyruvate? Pyruvate is a common compound in some growth media, and it can be an alternative substrate for glucose.</p></disp-quote><p>The media does not include pyruvate, this will be amended in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Does IL-10 inhibit trained immunity induced by microbial compounds as well?</p></disp-quote><p>This was a very interesting question and we have carried out new experiments, investigating how IL-10 affects training induced by β-glucan (see Figure 6G). These data indicate that IL-10 can also modulate training induced by other stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Consistent with previous reports, the authors observed that (IL-4/13) macrophages on Day 1 have increased OCR and ECAR values. However, a critical comparison with (IFNγ/LPS) macrophages would be at day 6 but as with the BCG infection studies, the M(IFNγ/LPS) showed reduced viability. This is an important experiment that should be done in a way that cell death is not induced, and seahorse studies are needed to validate the transcriptional data. Currently, it looks like the gene expression analysis was performed in dead cells.</p><p>10. The comparisons between IL4/13 and IFNγ/LPS primed BMDM at 6 days are lacking for some key assays (BCG killing and Seahorse metabolic measurements) because the authors say that IFNγ/LPS primed BMDM had reduced viability at this stage. I don't understand why this is case. It reduces the value of the observations in IL4/13 primed BMDM at 6 days, because we can't evaluate their specificity. In addition, the validity/interpretation of cytokine and transcriptomic analyses of day 6 IFNγ/LPS primed BMDM is a particular concern because this is likely to be confounded/biased by the reduced viability of the cells. These data should be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>By “reduced viability” what is meant is that following IFNγ and LPS stimulation, cell numbers clearly reduced over time, leading to difficulties when measuring extracellular flux via Seahorse (detection limit was not reached). Moreover, whilst stimulating these BMDMs with a relatively small amount of TLR ligand or killed bacteria clearly caused both transcriptional and cytokine secretion changes, indicating that there were enough BMDMs present for these experiments/analyses, however, when given live BCG bacteria, the IFNγ/LPS trained cells died within 24 hours. These comments have now been added to the text to aid clarity. Due to these observations, we believe that the IFNγ/LPS trained cells have reduced viability, which unfortunately leads to certain experimental procedures being impossible to do.</p><p>However, our opinion is that this additional group is not strictly necessary; showing the metabolic and bacterial killing profile on Day 0, is crucial to highlight how much the M(IL-4/13) change over time, and overall showing these differences by comparison to the untrained cells is a more important control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Are M(4/13) and M(4/13/10) expressing classical alternative activation markers also at day 6 and following stimulation (either with Mtb or PAM3CSK4)? These data would be important to answer how much surface expression profiles might correlate (or not) with functional responses, such as the pro-inflammatory response or the metabolic profile observed on Day 6 for M(4/13).</p></disp-quote><p>Nos2, Arg1, CD80, MHC II and CD206 were included in the submitted form of the manuscript, so we have included Retnla and Chil3 +/- Mtb stimulation in Figure 6—figure supplement 1E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. What is the combined priming with IFNγ and LPS is supposed to be modelling biologically. If the purpose is to model Th1 modulation of macrophage biology, then would IFNγ priming by itself as a more appropriate comparator to Th2 IL4/13 cytokines.</p></disp-quote><p>The combination of IFNγ and LPS is the norm for inducing classical macrophage activation. The aim is to investigate these heavily researched macrophages profiles in the context of training and mycobacterial infection of the cells. Furthermore, in the context of an infection, PRR activation would occur in combination with IFNγ signalling and we therefore consider this model to not be irrelevant to this context. Moreover, in preliminary results with inducing M1 macrophage activation with IFNγ and LPS alone, we observed that the “typical” M1 macrophage profile was achieved with the two stimuli together. Crucially regarding iNOS (important for Mtb killing in murine models), where optimisation studies revealed that the addition of LPS was required to effectively enhance its transcription.</p><fig id="sa2fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>100 ng/ml IFNγ, 50 ng/ml LPS, 50 ng/ml each.</title><p>Nos2 expression after 24 hours.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74690-sa2-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>When it came to optimising the BMDM innate training protocol, the concentrations of IFNγ and LPS needed to be revised, as using 50 ng/ml of each resulted in cell death within 72 hours of activation. Therefore, we reduced the concentrations to 25 ng/ml IFNγ and 10 ng/ml LPS, which allowed significant upregulation of classic M1 markers (including Nos2 expression) whilst resulting in enhanced viability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors propose that IL4/13 priming of mouse BMDM induces epigenetic changes responsible for the delayed pro-inflammatory phenotype. They need to show this experimentally, by methylation analyses and/or ATAC sequencing. The methylation inhibitor data which are presented in Figure S3C using the methylation inhibitor are too preliminary to draw meaningful conclusions, particularly as an important control has not been presented – unstimulated BMDMs incubated with the methylation inhibitor (to assess for on- or off-target effects on baseline cellular function).</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst the role of epigenetics is certainly of interest for future studies, the primary emphasis of this manuscript is the role of metabolism. And with regard to metabolism we have used respiration assays, LC-MS, nutrient depletion and targeted disruption of metabolic pathways to support our findings. Again, whilst we agree that the role of epigenetics is of great importance and its implicated role is preliminary based on our data, a detailed examination of its role via ATAC sequencing is another dimension of this story that we think is outside the scope of this manuscript. To try to gather more preliminary data to aid this future research, we did carry out western blot analysis to see if we could identify which type of histone methylation was occurring, however, there were no marked differences in methylation of any of the sites checked (Figure 2—figure supplement 3B-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. An important consideration is that IL4 in particular can be a stimulus for macrophage proliferation in mouse cells. Therefore, the authors need to experimentally assess whether their 'delayed' phenotype is in fact associated with cell cycle/proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>Cell proliferation is most certainly an important factor to consider – in fact enhanced proliferation has been proposed to be a key component of training. To take this factor into account, prior to infection experiments, extra wells were plated, given the various conditions, and taken off with trypsin the day before infection and counted. The amount of live bacteria used and the results were adjusted accordingly so all are standardized to the same number of cells (this is stated in relevant figure legends and calculations are outlined in the accompanying dataset). Similarly, regarding extracellular flux assays, we used the BCA assay to measure protein content, to gain an estimate of cell number and values were adjusted accordingly. Calculations can be viewed in the accompanying dataset.</p><p>For measuring cytokine responses to various stimuli, we opted for measuring several cytokines to see the overall effect upon the cell response profile. The fact that we saw enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion specifically in the trained M(IL-4/13), whilst IL-10 was reduced, indicates a shift in profile which is not due to cell number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Please clarify the interpretation of the data from experiments using the metabolic inhibitor 2-DG. I understood the objective was to reverse the metabolic programming mediated by IL4/13 priming, in which case I would expect the IL10 response to increasing in the presence of 2-DG. The fact that 2-DG leads to reductions in all the cytokine responses only serves to show that cytokine production requires active metabolism.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the text, although 2-DG is well-known as an inhibitor of glycolysis, it has also been demonstrated to also be an inhibitor of OXPHOS. As such, its use serves to show that cellular respiration is required to support cytokine responses. In this context, we were outlining which metabolic processes were key for the innate training phenotype induced by IL-4 and IL-13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, there is no control condition of unstimulated BMDMs incubated with the metabolic inhibitors, which would again be important to assess for on- or off-target effects on baseline cellular function.</p></disp-quote><p>We did measure cytokine secretion from BMDMs given no secondary stimulation for all tested conditions and no background cytokine secretion of IL-6 or IL-10 was detected, and in the case of TNF, there were no differences in background secretion between conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5</xref>). For these reasons this data was not included.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74690-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The link between changes in metabolism and control of Mtb needs to be verified experimentally, particularly to test the hypothesis that inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation attenuates bacterial killing. Key experiments, at least the effects of +/-IL4/13 and +/-IFNγ priming on differential cytokine responses to restimulation after six days, and mycobacterial growth restriction need to be verified in human monocyte-derived macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>We did wish to carry out more infection experiments to investigate the role of metabolism further and elucidate whether this training phenomena were applicable in human macrophages. Unfortunately, due to complications caused by COVID-19, very limited infection experimentation was possible within a reasonable time frame. We were able to carry out some preliminary work with human monocyte-derived macrophages, which intimate that IL-4 and IL-13 activation does specifically enhance inflammatory responses to subsequent challenges, which is moreover reduced by the addition of IL-10, which is promising for future work in this field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. The Extracellular flux studies comparing IL-4/IL-13 vs IL-4/IL-13/IL-10 training are missing and would be critical to support the cytokine and transcriptional profile (Figure 6). This will address an important point regarding the functional metabolic consequences of IL-10 during macrophage training, as claimed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We did look with seahorse with IL-4/13 with or without IL-10 after training, +/- PAM as a preliminary experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>), and we did not see any differences in their metabolic profiles.
