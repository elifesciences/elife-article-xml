cell-to-cell communication. Compelling evidence supports that ATP is released from cells through pannexins, a family of membrane proteins that form heptameric large-pore channels. However, the activation mechanisms that trigger ATP release by pannexins remain poorly understood. Here, we discover lysophospholipids as endogenous pannexin activators, using activity-guided fractionation of mouse tissue extracts combined with untargeted metabolomics and electrophysiology. We show that lysophospholipids directly and reversibly activate pannexins in the absence of other proteins. Secretomics experiments reveal that lysophospholipid-activated pannexin 1 leads to the release of not only ATP but also other signaling metabolites, such as 5’-methylthioadenosine, which is important for immunomodulation. We also demonstrate that lysophospholipids activate endogenous pannexin 1 in human monocytes, leading to the release of IL-1β through inflammasome activation. Our results provide a connection between lipid metabolism and purinergic signaling, both of which play major roles in immune responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>large pore channel</kwd><kwd>untargeted metabolomics</kwd><kwd>secretomics</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>lipid signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114379</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawate</surname><given-names>Toshimitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM131877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Frank C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Michalski</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI1659534</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Lydia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cornell Margaret and Richard Riney Canine Health Center Research Grants Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henze</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><name><surname>Boesch</surname><given-names>Jordyn M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawate</surname><given-names>Toshimitsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK107451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lysophospholipids directly and reversibly activate pannexin channels, triggering the release of signaling molecules critical for inflammation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pannexins, a family of proteins that form heptameric large-pore channels, release signaling molecules like ATP and glutamate from both dying and living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Syrjanen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dahl, 2015</xref>). There are three subtypes (Panx1-3) that share a similar heptameric assembly with a membrane pore capable of allowing such signaling molecules to permeate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuzuya et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hussain et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). All three subtypes of pannexins have been demonstrated to play important signaling roles in processes such as immune cell migration and differentiation, epilepsy, migraine, and chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aquilino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muñoz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yeung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harcha et al., 2021</xref>). However, there is limited knowledge about how pannexins are activated, particularly in living cells.</p><p>In dying cells, Panx1-mediated ATP-release is important not only for depleting cellular energy and halting metabolism but also for facilitating the recruitment of white blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Imamura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>). This so-called ’find-me’ signaling allows phagocytes to clear billions of dying cells daily without causing unnecessary inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chekeni et al., 2010</xref>). Single-channel recordings and in vitro reconstitution studies demonstrated that cleavage of the C-terminus by caspase during apoptotic cell death triggers Panx1-channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narahari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiu et al., 2017</xref>). The prevailing mechanism involves the C-terminus blocking the pore in its closed conformation, with cleavage of this region facilitating pore unblocking to open the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sandilos et al., 2012</xref>). Cleavage of the C-terminus also induces a significant conformational rearrangement in the N-terminus, which appears to play a crucial role in channel gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henze et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In living cells, other activation stimuli for Panx1 must exist, as the C-terminus remains intact. Studies have suggested that Panx1 is activated through intracellular signaling triggered by the stimulation of structurally unrelated membrane receptors, such as G protein-coupled receptors (e.g. α1-adrenergic receptor)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billaud et al., 2011</xref>), ligand-gated ion channels (e.g. NMDA receptor)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>), and tumor necrosis factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maier-Begandt et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains unclear how Panx1 is activated downstream of these apparently unrelated receptors in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ruan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuzuya et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ambrosi et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, essentially nothing is known about the activation mechanisms of Panx2 and Panx3.</p><p>Our previous studies demonstrated that small molecules, such as probenecid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Silverman et al., 2008</xref>), could reversibly activate a point mutant of Panx1 (e.g. W74A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Michalski and Kawate, 2016</xref>). We hypothesized that naturally occurring small molecules could trigger pannexin channel opening. To shed new light on the mechanisms of pannexin activation in living cells, we searched for potential signaling molecules that directly and reversibly activate pannexins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Panx1 and Panx2 are activated by lysophospholipids</title><p>To identify potential candidates for endogenous small molecules that regulate pannexin channel opening, we used an activity-guided fractionation approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). We chose mouse liver as our source due to its involvement in diverse metabolic processes and its significantly larger size compared to other organs, making sample collection more feasible. Mouse liver extract was fractionated using reverse-phase chromatography and the fractions were tested for pannexin activation using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The soluble fractions were excluded from this study, as the most polar fraction gave rise to strong channel activities in the absence of exogenously expressed pannexins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To increase sensitivity of our screen, we employed a Panx1 construct that contains a Gly-Ser insertion at the N-terminus (dubbed ‘Panx1+GS’), which yields significantly larger currents than the wildtype channel in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michalski et al., 2018</xref>). For Panx2, we used the wildtype channel, as it gives rise to large currents in HEK293 cells. Panx3 was excluded because it failed to give rise to detectable currents, despite appreciable surface expression in mammalian tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Metabolomic screening identifies LPC-16:0 as a pannexin agonist.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the metabolite screen.

Comparative analysis by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) revealed approximately 1500 mass spectrometric features that were enriched more than 10-fold in active fractions compared to neighboring fractions that showed negligible activity. To narrow down the candidate metabolites, we pooled the active fractions and performed a second round of activity-guided fractionation. Two of the resulting fractions (#7 and #8) strongly activated both Panx1+GS and Panx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E and G</xref>); comparative metabolomic analysis revealed twelve major metabolites at least 10-fold enriched in the active fractions relative to the neighboring inactive fractions (i.e., #6 and #9). Analysis of their MS/MS fragmentation spectra and comparison with authentic standards indicated that the majority of the differential metabolites were lysolipids, including both isomers of palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC-16:0), palmitoyl-lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE-16:0), and oleoyl-LPC (LPC-18:1), as well as an additional polyunsaturated LPC-20:3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). LPCs are known to serve diverse signaling roles, especially in inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Law et al., 2019</xref>), and exist in extracellular fluids at high micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Psychogios et al., 2011</xref>), similar to the concentrations of these metabolites in the active fractions.</p><p>To test whether LPCs activate pannexins, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings for the wildtype pannexin channels using synthetic compounds. We focused on LPC-16:0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which is commercially available and the most abundant LPC variant in extracellular fluids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ojala et al., 2007</xref>). For Panx1, we used HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells, an HEK derivative commonly used for structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reeves et al., 2002</xref>), as we observed significantly stronger currents in these cells. As for Panx2, we continued using HEK293 cells, as they exhibited lower background signals. Cell-surface-expression analysis revealed that both Panx1 and Panx2 were expressed at higher levels in GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells than in HEK293 cells, potentially contributing to both the increased sensitivity and background signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A robust and reversible current was observed for both Panx1 and Panx2 following stimulation with LPC-16:0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), while Panx3 and other large-pore channels—such as LRRC8A, connexin 43, and innexin 6—failed to show measurable currents under the same experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Panx3 current was not observed in either HEK293 or GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells, despite detectable surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and D</xref>). Recordings from vector-transfected cells and carbenoxolone (CBX) sensitivity confirmed that the LPC-16:0-mediated currents were specific to pannexins; Panx2 was insensitive to CBX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Poon et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, extracellular ATP levels significantly increased when Panx1- or Panx2-expressing cells were stimulated with LPC-16:0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results indicate that LPCs may function as endogenous signaling molecules to promote ATP-release from living cells through activation of Panx1 and/or Panx2.</p><p>To investigate the ion selectivity of lysophospholipid-activated Panx1 and Panx2 channels, we compared whole-cell current density before and after LPC treatment at –60 mV using buffers containing various anions and cations. Both Panx1 and Panx2 channels exhibited significantly larger currents in NaCl or N-Methyl-D-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl) compared to sodium gluconate (NaGluc), indicating that lysophospholipid-activated channels are more selective for anions under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). This finding aligns with the reported ion selectivity of voltage-stimulated Panx1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Romanov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, currents in NMDG-Cl were slightly smaller than in NaCl, suggesting that NMDG may have an inhibitory effect on LPC-16:0-activated channels. While we acknowledge that this analysis does not directly compare ion selectivity within the same patch, the nearly negligible current observed in NaGluc strongly indicates that the anion conductance through both Panx1 and Panx2 channels is greater than cation conductance.</p><p>We next tested structurally diverse lysophospholipids for pannexin activity. To facilitate screening, we developed a fluorescence-based assay in which iodide influx through pannexin channel is measured by fluorescence-quenching of a halide biosensor mVenus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagai et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Galietta et al., 2001</xref>). This pannexin-mediated decrease in signal is normalized to the maximal quenching obtained via membrane permeabilization with the detergent, Triton-X 100. Addition of LPC-16:0 robustly quenched mVenus fluorescence in cells expressing Panx1 or Panx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>). Likewise, LPCs with 14:0, 18:0, 2-16:0, or 18:1 (oleoyl) acyl groups activated both Panx1 and Panx2 with EC50 values within the 10–50 μM range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, neither LPC-12:0 nor LPC-20:0 activated these pannexins, suggesting that the most effective LPC acyl chain length is between 14 and 18 carbons. Lysophospholipids with other headgroups, including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) were as potent as LPC, whereas lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) failed to activate pannexins even at much higher concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Together, these results suggest that pannexins are activated by select lysophospholipids; considering that the extracellular concentrations of LPCs are orders of magnitude higher than the other tested species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2020</xref>), LPCs are the most likely activators of Panx1 and Panx2 in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cellular mVenus-quench assays reveal a series of lysophospholipids as pannexin agonists.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon illustrating the principle of the mVenus quench assay.

To test whether lysophospholipids directly activate pannexins, we performed a functional reconstitution in vitro to investigate pannexin activity in the absence of other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The full-length Panx1 was purified from GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells using affinity and size exclusion chromatography.

We assessed Panx1 channel activity through YO-PRO-1 dye uptake, a well-established method for demonstrating the activity of large-pore-forming channels using proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karasawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>).

Because mastoparan application may trigger Panx1 activation through other mechanisms, such as C-terminal cleavage by caspase or activation of Src kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lohman et al., 2019</xref>), we applied mastoparan following preincubation with a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK or the Src inhibitor PP2. However, neither inhibitor affected mastoparan-dependent mVenus quenching, indicating that indirect modes of Panx1 activation were unlikely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, mastoparan-mediated mVenus quenching was not observed in cells expressing Panx2. It is possible that Panx2 may prefer lysophospholipids produced from the outer membrane leaflet. Together, these experiments indicate that both PLA1 and PLA2 can activate pannexins, likely through the production of lysophospholipids from the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Synovial fluid from canine patients experiencing pain stimulates Panx1</title><p>Given that lysophospholipid and phospholipase concentrations are elevated in patients suffering from joint diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jacquot et al., 2022</xref>), we hypothesized that synovial fluids from dogs with naturally occurring algogenic disease might trigger Panx1 activation. To test this hypothesis, we investigated Panx1 channel activation using joint fluid collected from 22 canine patients suffering from varying degrees of pain. We found that the joint fluid collected from dogs with moderate to severe pain triggered a robust mVenus quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast, joint fluid collected from dogs assessed to have only mild pain showed significantly weaker mVenus quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Interestingly, LPC-dependent ATP and IL-1β release were blocked by CBX or probenecid, suggesting that the release of these signaling molecules may be mediated by Panx1.</p><p>To clarify whether lysophospholipids activate endogenous Panx1 to trigger inflammasome formation, we assessed IL-1β release from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated human THP-1 monocytes. Western blot analysis confirmed the expression of endogenous Panx1 protein in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, and two independent shRNAs effectively reduced its expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). While lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment alone promoted inflammasome activation to some extent, LPC-16:0 treatment increased the amount of released cleaved IL-1β by approximately 10 fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Panx1 cleavage was minimal and similar between the LPS-only and LPS +LPC-16:0 treated control cells, and control cells treated with LPC-16:0 alone did not promote Panx1 cleavage, indicating that the increase in IL-1β release with LPC-16:0 treatment is not due to further LPC-induced cleavage of Panx1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Conversely, Panx1-knockdown cells released less cleaved IL-1β into the supernatant and accumulated intracellular pro-IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). The expression levels of NLRP3 and pro-caspase 1 remained comparable among all samples, eliminating the possibility that differences in the expression levels of these key inflammasome components might explain any differences in the maturation and release of IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This bona fide stimulus triggers the release of signaling molecules including ATP and the newly characterized Panx1 permeant MTA from living cells, uniting lipid and purinergic signaling pathways important for inflammation. Our in vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrate that full-length Panx1 can be activated by lysophospholipids in the absence of other proteins, providing compelling evidence that this channel possesses an intrinsic mechanism for activation in this manner. Considering that lysophospholipid concentrations are elevated in many inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kano et al., 2022</xref>), pannexin-mediated ATP release likely plays a critical role in such pathological conditions. This is consistent with our experiments demonstrating that joint fluid from dogs experiencing pain triggers robust Panx1 activation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary of Panx1-mediated signaling.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Panx1 activation in dying cells. In dying cells, the C-terminal tails of Panx1 are cleaved by caspases, initiating an irreversible mode of Panx1 activation.

In living cells, activation of membrane receptors such as NMDA, P2X7, TNF-α, and α1-adrenergic receptors stimulates the production of lysophospholipids via cytoplasmic phospholipase A (PLA) enzymes. Lysophospholipids are abundant in extracellular microvesicles and oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs). They are also produced by secreted PLAs during pathological conditions, including atherosclerosis and joint or metabolic diseases. These lysophospholipids reversibly activate Panx1, leading to the release of signaling molecules crucial for inflammation and pain.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-107067-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The discovery of lysophospholipids as a common stimulus for Panx1 and Panx2 may underlie the proposed compensatory roles between Panx1 and Panx2 described in ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargiotas et al., 2011</xref>) and insulin secretion from β-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berchtold et al., 2017</xref>). Given that Panx3 is ~45% identical to Panx1 and shares a similar overall structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hussain et al., 2024</xref>), it is surprising that Panx3 was not activated by lysophospholipids. Since Panx3 does not generate any currents in our heterologous expression systems, it is possible that Panx3 requires a currently uncharacterized posttranslational modifications or binding partners for activation by lysolipids. Alternatively, it may respond to a different class of metabolites.</p><p>Lysophospholipid-mediated pannexin activation makes biological sense for several reasons. First, PLA enzymes are activated downstream of NMDA, P2X7, TNF-α, and α1-adrenergic receptors, which have been demonstrated to lead to pannexin channel opening following their stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billaud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maier-Begandt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burch et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alzola et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tapia-Arancibia et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoeck et al., 1993</xref>). Second, the concentrations of lysophospholipids increase under pathological conditions, in which pannexins play significant roles. For example, vascular inflammation caused by platelet-derived microvesicles can be explained by the action of extracellular ATP released through Panx1 channels, as these microvesicles contain a large amount of LPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diehl et al., 2019</xref>). Likewise, potentiation of angiotensin-II dependent vasoconstriction by oxidized low-density lipoproteins (oxLDLs)—a condition associated with vasospasm in atherosclerotic arteries—may be mediated by Panx1 activation, since oxLDLs are rich in LPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galle et al., 2003</xref>). Third, both augmented Panx1 channel expression and elevated levels of lysophospholipids have been independently reported to be associated with insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Law et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tozzi et al., 2020</xref>), a common health problem linked to a wide array of pathologic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.</p><p>We also demonstrated that lysophospholipids can induce the release of signaling metabolites beyond ATP through Panx1 channel activation. While it is possible that this metabolite release occurs indirectly, the overlap of several permeants with previous studies involving apoptotic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Medina et al., 2020</xref>) suggests that the Panx1 channel activated by lysophospholipids in living cells likely exhibits a similar selectivity to that observed following C-terminal cleavage in dying cells. The finding of MTA as a novel Panx1-secreted metabolite opens a new area of inquiry into the role of this membrane channel in immune cell signaling, particularly as it relates to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2019</xref>). MTA acts as an adenosine receptor agonist to tamp down the inflammatory response, which discourages infiltration of T cells and NK cells to the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobs et al., 2020</xref>). Given the emerging positive link between Panx1 expression and various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laird and Penuela, 2021</xref>), it is possible that this metabolite is responsible for this trend.</p><p>Our findings suggest that lysophospholipids activate endogenous Panx1 in human THP-1 cells, leading to inflammasome activation. This is consistent with a previous study demonstrating that lysophospholipids stimulate ATP release and inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ismaeel and Qadri, 2021</xref>). Although previous studies using bone marrow derived macrophages from Panx1-knockout mice suggested that this channel is dispensable for P2X7-dependent inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qu et al., 2011</xref>), those experiments utilized both nigericin (an ionophore known to activate potassium efflux and the inflammasome) and exogenous ATP, which would directly activate the P2X7 receptor without the upstream endogenous ATP-release event. Indeed, Ismaeel et al. showed that IL-1β release was blocked by either apyrase or P2X7 receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ismaeel and Qadri, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, Yang et al. showed that Panx1 was required for IL-1β release and with P2X7 exacerbated mortality in a mouse model of sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, our experiments revealed that LPS stimulation alone triggered some cleavage of Panx1 and release of cleaved IL-1β to a limited extent. The limited liberation of mature IL-1β from control cells treated with LPS alone may be attributable to the Panx1-independent action of LPS on large-conductance potassium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parzych et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, although the underlying mechanism of Panx1 cleavage remains unclear, this cleavage may contribute to IL-1β release from cells treated only with LPS. Additionally, we observed attenuated IL-1β release in Panx1-knockdown cells; residual IL-1β release may be attributed to incomplete suppression of gene expression or through the opening of two-pore domain potassium (K2P) channels known to be involved in inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Madry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Immanuel et al., 2024</xref>) and activated by lysophospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maingret et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Our functional reconstitution studies revealed some basal activity of the full-length Panx1 channel, which is inconsistent with findings from the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narahari et al., 2021</xref>). While the underlying mechanism remains unclear, there are substantial differences between the two experimental setups that may account for the divergent results. First, we used human Panx1 tagged in the flexible intracellular loop, whereas the Bayliss group used frog Panx1 tagged with GFP at the C-terminus. This difference in tagging and species may have contributed to variations in basal activity. Second, the lipid compositions used for reconstitution were significantly different. In our experiments, we used POPE, POPG, and sphingomyelin, while the Bayliss group employed a mixture of brain phosphatidylcholine, total brain lipid extract, cholesterol, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Given that the function of many ion channels is heavily influenced by lipid composition, these differences could have contributed to the observed discrepancy. Regardless, our functional reconstitution experiments clearly demonstrate that LPC stimulates YO-PRO-1 uptake in a dose-dependent manner, which forms the foundation of our interpretation.</p><p>Although our activity-guided fractionation led to the discovery of lysophospholipids as activators of Panx1 and Panx2, it is conceivable that other classes of activators may exist for these channels. Particularly, whole-cell patch-clamp experiments would limit the target molecules to those acting externally, potentially overlooking molecules that act intracellularly. Additionally, our extraction and fractionation methods were biased towards relatively non-polar compounds, leaving open the possibility that hydrophilic molecules may also activate pannexins. Nevertheless, given the signaling roles of lysophospholipids, especially in immune responses where pannexin involvement has been well-documented, it makes sense that these signaling molecules trigger the activation of pannexin channels.</p><p>In conclusion, our study supports the idea that pannexins are key downstream players in lysophospholipid signaling. Our discovery connects purinergic signaling with lipid metabolism and bolsters the importance of the less-understood lysophospholipid-mediated signaling arm of the clinically impactful lipid mediator inflammatory pathway. Alongside the well-studied activation observed in dying cells, our study unveils another layer of activation mechanisms of pannexins in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 21,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 15 min and the supernatant was recovered. Streptactin sepharose high-performance resin (GE Healthcare) was added to the lysates and rotated for 2 hr and 30 min. Samples were washed six times and the biotinylated proteins were eluted by incubating resin with 1.5 x SDS sample buffer supplemented with 75 mM DTT for 30 min at 55 °C with intermittent vortexing. Anti-FLAG (1:2000; clone M2), or anti-actin monoclonal antibodies (1:2000; line AC-40), were used to detect the target proteins by western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cellular pannexin activity assay</title><p>HEK293 or HEK293 GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells were plated onto 96-well poly-D-lysine coated, black-walled plates (Corning) at ~90% confluency and infected with 10% (v/v) BacMam P2 virus made with the pEZT-BM constructs encoding pannexins (and mVenus for the quench assays). Sodium butyrate (5 mM) was added to the media 10–12 hr after infection and the pannexin activity assays were performed 40–48 hr after infection (36–40 hr for hPanx1 expressed GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells). Growth media was replaced with Assay buffer containing in mM: 147 NaI (NaCl for YO-PRO-1 uptake assays), 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 13 Glucose, pH 7.3. For the stimulation with LPA, Assay buffer was modified to include: 147 NaI, 2 KCl, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 13 Glucose, pH 7.3 for preventing precipitation. After 10 min equilibration (for mVenus-quench) or 5 min equilibration with 5 μM YO-PRO-1 (for YO-PRO-1 uptake), the cells were stimulated with various compounds and enzymes as indicated in the figures. Inhibitors were added concomitantly or 5 min after the stimulation for sPLA2. Pannexin activity was monitored by measuring fluorescence using a plate reader (Biotek Synergy2) at 480 nm (excitation) and 528 nm (emission) wavelengths with 20 nm bandwidth. The maximum quench/fluorescence was obtained with 1% Triton-X100 or Tween-20.

Cells were washed with the external patch-clamp buffer and incubated for 10 min with D-luciferin (0.5 μM) and luciferase (1.3 μg/mL) using ATP Determination Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). Three minutes after the addition of LPC-16:0 (30 μM) in the presence or absence of CBX (50 μM), ATP released in the external buffer was measured by following the luminescence using a plate reader (Biotek Synergy2). Luminescence was normalized to the maximum value obtained with 1% Triton-X100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Panx1 purification</title><p>Panx1 was purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michalski et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, Panx1 expressing cells (GnTI- for hPanx1 and HighFive cells for frPanx1-ΔLC+GS) were harvested by centrifugation and broken by nitrogen cavitation (4635 cell disruption vessel; Parr Instruments). The membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min followed by at 185,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 45 min in PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (2.0 μg/mL leupeptin, 8.0 μg/mL aprotinin, 2.0 μg/mL pepstatin, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Membranes were solubilized in S buffer (PBS, protease inhibitor cocktail, 10% glycerol, and 1% C12E8) for 60 minutes. Following ultracentrifugation at 185,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 45 min, the supernatant was incubated with Strep-Tactin Sepharose resin or Strep-Tactin XT resin (Cytiva) for 60 min. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of Wash buffer (150 mM NaCl, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.27% C12E8) and the bound protein was eluted with five column volumes of Wash buffer containing 2.5 mM desthiobiotin (for Sepharose) or 25 mM biotin (for XT resin). Eluted Panx1 was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200; Cytiva) in SEC buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 0.27% C12E8). A single monodisperse Panx1 peak was collected for functional reconstitution into liposomes or into lipid nanodiscs for cryo-EM studies. All steps were carried out at 4 °C or on ice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Functional reconstitution of Panx1</title><p>Empty liposomes composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG), and sphingomyelin (SM; brain extract) were resuspended in Reconstitution buffer (in mM; 50 Tris-HCl, 150 NaCl, 0.1 EGTA, pH 7.4) to a concentration of 10 mg/mL and extruded 13 times through a 400 nm polycarbonate filter before use. Following incubation with 0.65% (w/v) DDM for 15 min, purified Panx1 was added at 50:1 (hPanx1) or at 100:1 (frPanx1-ΔLC+GS) ratio and incubated for 30 min. Detergents were removed by Bio-beads SM2 (Bio-Rad) and 20 bp oligo DNAs (40 μM each) were incorporated by freeze-thaw and extrusion through a polycarbonate filter. Unincorporated DNA was digested by incubating the liposomes with 0.2 mg/mL DNAse I in the presence of 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> for 60 min, followed by centrifugation at 280,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min and resuspension in Reconstitution buffer. DNA-incorporated proteoliposomes (50 μg/well) were dispensed into 96-well Poly-D-lysine coated black-walled plates (Corning). Upon LPC-16:0 and YO-PRO-1 (60 nM) application, Panx1 activity was monitored by measuring fluorescence using a plate reader (Biotek Synergy2) at 480 nm (excitation) and 528 nm (emission) wavelengths with 20 nm bandwidth. The maximum fluorescence was obtained with 1% Triton-X100. Quantification of Panx1 activity was performed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Canine synovial fluid sample collection</title><p>Synovial fluid was collected from 22 different client-owned dogs presenting to the Cornell University Hospital for Animals. The Cornell University Veterinary Clinical Studies Committee approved the project (#100121–16), and all the dog owners gave informed consent to use samples from their dogs. Dogs were aged 6.5 (0.67–10) years (median [range]) and consisted of neutered females (n=13), neutered males (n=8), and an intact male (n=1). Represented breeds included mixed breed (n=8), Labrador retriever (n=5), Golden retriever (n=2), and n=1 each of Akita, Australian shepherd, Bernese mountain dog, Chesapeake Bay retriever, German shepherd dog, German shorthaired pointer, and pit bull terrier. All dogs had a history of joint pain of at least 1 month duration secondary to developmental, degenerative, and/or inflammatory disease (e.g. degeneration and rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament, osteochondrosis dissecans, osteoarthritis, septic arthritis). Synoviocentesis was performed under sedation or general anesthesia for either diagnostic or therapeutic purposes (e.g. cytology, bacterial culture, or injection of pharmaceuticals [after sample collection], n=8), or before the start of orthopedic surgery on the joint (n=14); an aliquot was reserved for this study. Surgeries included tibial plateau-leveling osteotomy (TPLO) with (n=6) or without (n=3) meniscectomy, arthroscopy (n=2), multiple procedures on one stifle joint (n=2), or implant removal with meniscectomy (n=1). Samples were collected from the stifle (i.e. femorotibial or knee joint, n=17), elbow (n=8), and shoulder (n=4); 1 sample was collected from either the elbow or shoulder but not labeled. Using standard aseptic technique, at least 500 µL were collected into a 2.0 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube and frozen at –80 °C within 30 min. There is currently no single validated scale for grading severity of pain of all etiologies in dogs. Therefore, before anesthetic drugs were administered, and before the synovial fluid was collected, a single investigator (a veterinary anesthesiologist experienced in assessing pain in dogs, J.M.B.) used a simple descriptive scale to grade the severity of pain in the joint to be sampled; pain was assessed as mild, moderate, or severe. Clinical signs of pain included lameness, behavioral reaction upon palpation or manipulation of the joint (i.e. struggling, vocalizing), and impaired ability to perform normal activities, such as running or using stairs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>IL-1β release assay using THP-1 cells</title><p>IL-1β response of PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells to treatment with LPC-16:0. THP-1 cells were seeded uniformly at a density of 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells per well in a 24-well plate with 1 mL 10% FBS-RPMI supplemented with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 100 ng/mL). Empty pLKO.1 vector lentivirus-transduced THP-1 cells were used as the control. After 48 hr of differentiation, the media was changed to 1 mL of 10% FBS-RPMI without PMA. After 24 hr of rest, the media was replaced with 0.5 mL of 10% FBS-RPMI supplemented with or without lipopolysaccharide from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> O111:B4 (LPS, 200 ng/mL, Sigma, L2630). After 3.5 hr of priming in the incubator, each well was gently washed thrice with 0.5 mL of 37 °C serum-free RPMI (SF-RPMI). Throughout the washing procedure, a 20 mM solution of LPC-16:0 (Sigma, L5254) in PBS in a polypropylene tube was incubated at 37 °C in a water bath. The 20 mM LPC-16:0 solution was removed from the water bath and vigorously vortexed, and then an aliquot was diluted in 37 °C SF-RPMI to a final concentration of 50 µM with gentle end-over-end mixing. The PBS wash buffer was aspirated from each well and gently replaced with 380 µL of the LPC-16:0-containing media; prior to each addition, the LPC-16:0-containing media was pipetted up-and-down three times to minimize loss of LPC-16:0 due to its potential adsorption to the polypropylene pipette tips. The plate was placed in the incubator for 1.5 hr. The supernatant media was collected and cleared of cells by centrifugation at 5000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4 °C for 5 min. A 100 µL aliquot of cleared supernatant was collected for each treatment group; 20 µL of 6 x Laemmli buffer was added to each aliquot, which were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Immediately after removing the supernatant media from the wells of the plate, each well was washed once with 0.5 mL of ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed by the addition of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, protease inhibitor cocktail) to each well followed by shaking at 4 °C for 45 min. Total protein of the cleared (17,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 4 °C, 20 min) cell lysates was quantified by the Bradford assay (Pierce Bradford Protein Assay Kit, Thermo, 23200). A 100 µL aliquot of cleared cell lysate was collected for each treatment group; 20 µL of 6 x Laemmli buffer was added to each aliquot, which were then heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Media supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting (12% SDS-PAGE, 200 V, 50 min; block 1 hr at room temperature in 5% BSA-TBST; transfer to 0.2 µM PVDF), with gel loading volume normalized to the total protein content of cell lysates to account for any potential loss of cells following the three cycles of PBS washing. Blots were visualized on a BioRad ChemiDoc MP instrument using chemiluminescence (Clarity Max Western ECL Substrate [BioRad, 1705062 S] or Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate [Thermo, 32106]). The following primary antibodies were used at 1:1000 dilution at 4 °C overnight (5% BSA-TBST): Panx1 (91137, Cell Signaling Technologies [CST]), cleaved IL-1β (83186, CST), pro-IL-1β (12242, CST), NLRP3 (15101, CST), and caspase 1 (AG-20B-0048-C100, AdipoGen). The following secondary antibodies were used at room temperature for 1 hr at 1:5000 dilution (5% BSA-TBST): anti-rabbit IgG HRP-linked (7074 V, CST) and anti-mouse IgG HRP-linked (7076, CST).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Materials availability</title><p>All materials, including plasmids generated in this study, are available from the authors upon

ATP release through Panx channels during the process of apoptosis is one established biological role of these proteins in the immune system, but they are widely expressed in many cells throughout the body, including the nervous system, and likely play many interesting and important roles that are yet to be defined. Although several structures have now been solved of different Panx subtypes from different species, their biophysical mechanisms remain poorly understood, including what physiological signals control their activation. Electrophysiological measurements of ionic currents flowing in response to Panx channel activation have shown that some subtypes can be activated by strong membrane depolarization or caspase cleavage of the C-terminus. Here, Henze and colleagues set out to identify endogenous activators of Panx channels, focusing on the Panx1 and Panx2 subtypes, by fractionating mouse liver extracts and screening for activation of Panx channels expressed in mammalian cells using whole-cell patch clamp recordings. The authors present a comprehensive examination with robust methodologies and supporting data that demonstrate that lysophospholipids (LPCs) directly Panx-1 and 2 channels. These methodologies include channel mutagenesis, electrophysiology, ATP release and fluorescence assays, and molecular modelling. Mouse liver extracts were initially used to identify LPC activators, but the authors go on to individually evaluate many different types of LPCs to determine those that are more specific for Panx channel activation. Importantly, the enzymes that endogenously regulate the production of these LPCs were also assessed along with other by-products that were shown not to promote pannexin channel activation. In addition, the authors used synovial fluid from canine patients, which is enriched in LPCs, to highlight the importance of the findings in pathology. Overall, we think this is likely to be an important study because it provides strong evidence that LPCs can function as activators of Panx1 and Panx2 channels, linking two established mediators of inflammatory responses and opening an entirely new area for exploring the biological roles of Panx channels. This study provides an excellent foundation for future studies and importantly provides clinical relevance.</p><p>[Editors' note: this paper has been through two rounds of review and revisions, available here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.10.23.563601">https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2023.10.23.563601</ext-link>]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107067.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Henze</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Burkhardt</surname><given-names>Russell N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fox</surname><given-names>Bennett William</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schwertfeger</surname><given-names>Tyler J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gelsleichter</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Michalski</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kramer</surname><given-names>Lydia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lenfest</surname><given-names>Margret</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boesch</surname><given-names>Jordyn M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Hening</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Chicago</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Frank C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kawate</surname><given-names>Toshimitsu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cornell University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ithaca</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>(This author response relates to the first round of peer review by Biophysics Colab.

The authors present a comprehensive examination with robust methodologies and supporting data that demonstrate that lysophospholipids (LPCs) directly Panx-1 and 2 channels. These methodologies include channel mutagenesis, electrophysiology, ATP release and fluorescence assays, molecular modelling, and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Mouse liver extracts were initially used to identify LPC activators, but the authors go on to individually evaluate many different types of LPCs to determine those that are more specific for Panx channel activation. Importantly, the enzymes that endogenously regulate the production of these LPCs were also assessed along with other by-products that were shown not to promote pannexin channel activation.

Based on their valuable comments and suggestions, we have made substantial revisions. The updated manuscript now includes two new experiments supporting that lysophospholipid-triggered channel activation promotes the release of signaling molecules critical for immune response and demonstrates that this novel class of agonist activates the inflammasome in human macrophages through endogenously expressed Panx1. To better highlight the significance of our findings, we have excluded the cryo-EM panel from this manuscript. We believe these changes address the main concerns raised by the reviewers and enhance the overall clarity and impact of our findings. Below, we provide a point-by-point response to each of the reviewers’ comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations:</bold></p><p>(1) The authors present a tremendous amount of data using different approaches, cells and assays along with a written presentation that is quite abbreviated, which may make comprehension challenging for some readers. We would encourage the authors to expand the written presentation to more fully describe the experiments that were done and how the data were analysed so that the 2 key conclusions can be more fully appreciated by readers. A lot of data is also presented in supplemental figures that could be brought into the main figures and more thoroughly presented and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree with the reviewers’ observation. Our initial manuscript may have been challenging to follow due to our use of both wild-type and GS-tagged versions of Panx1 from human and frog origins, combined with different fluorescence techniques across cell types. In this revision, we used only human wild-type Panx1 expressed in HEK293S GnTI- cells, except for activity-guided fractionation experiments, where we used GS-tagged Panx1 expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). For functional reconstitution studies, we employed YO-PRO-1 uptake assays, as optimizing the Venus-based assay was challenging. We have clarified these exceptions in the main text. We think these adjustments simplify the narrative and ensure an appropriate balance between main and supplemental figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would also be useful to present data on the ion selectivity of Panx channels activated by LPC. How does this compare to data obtained when the channel is activated by depolarization? If the two stimuli activate related open states then the ion selectivity may be quite similar, but perhaps not if the two stimuli activate different open states. The authors earlier work in eLife shows interesting shifts in reversal potentials (Vrev) when substituting external chloride with gluconate but not when substituting external sodium with N-methyl-D-glucamine, and these changed with mutations within the external pore of Panx channels. Related measurements comparing channels activated by LPC with membrane depolarization would be valuable for assessing whether similar or distinct open states are activated by LPC and voltage. It would be ideal to make Vrev measurements using a fixed step depolarization to open the channel and then various steps to more negative voltages to measure tail currents in pinpointing Vrev (a so called instantaneous IV).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer on the importance of ion selectivity experiments. However, comparing the properties of LPC-activated channels with those activated by membrane depolarization presented technical challenges, as LPC appears to stimulate Panx1 in synergy with voltage. Prolonged LPC exposure destabilizes patches, complicating G-V curve acquisition and kinetic analyses. While such experiments could provide mechanistic insights, we think they are beyond the scope of current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Data is presented for expression of Panx channels in different cell types (HEK vs HEKS GnTI-) and different constructs (Panx1 vs Panx1-GS vs other engineered constructs). The authors have tried to be clear about what was done in each experiment, but it can be challenging for the reader to keep everything straight. The labelling in Fig 1E helps a lot, and we encourage the authors to use that approach systematically throughout. It would also help to clearly identify the cell type and channel construct whenever showing traces, like those in Fig 1D. Doing this systematically throughout all the figures would also make it clear where a control is missing. For example, if labelling for the type of cell was included in Fig 1D it would be immediately clear that a GnTI- vector alone control for WT Panx1 is missing as the vector control shown is for HEK cells and formally that is only a control for Panx2 and 3. Can the authors explain why PLC activates Panx1 overexpressed in HEK293 GnTl- cells but not in HEK293 cells? Is this purely a function of expression levels? If so, it would be good to provide that supporting information.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we believe our revised version is more straightforward to digest. We have improved labeling and provided explanations where necessary to clarify the manuscript. While Panx1 expression levels are indeed higher in GnTI- than in HEK293 cells, we are uncertain whether the absence of detectable currents in HEK293 cells is solely due to expression levels. Some post-translational modifications that inhibit Panx1, such as lysine acetylation, may also impact activity. Future studies are needed to explore these mechanisms further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The mVenus quenching experiments are somewhat confusing in the way data are presented. In Fig 2B the y axis is labelled fluorescence (%) but when the channel is closed at time = 0 the value of fluorescence is 0 rather than 100 %, and as the channel opens when LPC is added the values grow towards 100 instead of towards 0 as iodide permeates and quenches. It would be helpful if these types of data could be presented more intuitively. Also, how was the initial rate calculated that is plotted in Fig 2C? It would be helpful to show how this is done in a figure panel somewhere. Why was the initial rate expressed as a percent maximum, what is the maximum and why are the values so low? Why is the effect of CBX so weak in these quenching experiments with Panx1 compared to other assays? This assay is used in a lot of experiments so anything that could be done to bolster confidence is what it reports on would be valuable to readers. Bringing in as many control experiments that have been done, including any that are already published, would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the Y-axis in Figure 2 to “Quench (%)” for clarity. The data reflects fluorescence reduction over time, starting from LPC addition, normalized to the maximal decrease observed after Triton-X100 addition (3 minutes), enabling consistent quenching value comparisons. Although the quenching value appears small, normalization against complete cell solubilization provides reproducible comparisons. We do not fully understand why CBX effects vary in Venus quenching experiments, but we speculate that its steroid-like pentacyclic structure may influence the lysophospholipid agonistic effects. As noted in prior studies (DOI: 10.1085/jgp.201511505; DOI: 10.7554/eLife.54670), CBX likely acts as an allosteric modulator rather than a simple pore blocker, potentially contributing to these variations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Could provide more information to help rationalize how Yo-Pro-1, which has a charge of +2, can permeate what are thought to be anion favouring Panx channels? We appreciate that the biophysical properties of Panx channel remain mysterious, but it would help to hear how a bit more about the authors thinking. It might also help to cite other papers that have measured Yo-Pro-1 uptake through Panx channels. Was the Strep-tagged construct of Panx1 expressed in GnTI- cells and shown to be functional using electrophysiology?</p></disp-quote><p>Our recent study suggest that the electrostatic landscape along the permeation pathway may influence its ion selectivity (DOI: 10.1101/2024.06.13.598903). However, we have not yet fully elucidated how Panx1 permeates both anions and cations. Based on our findings, ion selectivity may vary with activation stimulus intensity and duration. Cation permeation through Panx1 is often demonstrated with YO-PRO-1, which measures uptake over minutes, unlike electrophysiological measurements conducted over milliseconds to seconds. We referenced two representative studies employing YO-PRO-1 to assess Panx1 activity. Whole-cell current measurements from a similar construct with an intracellular loop insertion indicate that our STREP-tagged construct likely retains functional capacity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In Fig 5 panel C, data is presented as the ratio of LPC induced current at -60 mV to that measured at +110 mV in the absence of LPC. What is the rationale for analysing the data this way? It would be helpful to also plot the two values separately for all of the constructs presented so the reader can see whether any of the mutants disproportionately alter LPC induced current relative to depolarization activated current. Also, for all currents shown in the figures, the authors should include a dashed coloured line at zero current, both for the LPC activated currents and the voltage steps.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the ratio of LPC-induced current to the current measured at +110 mV to determine whether any of the mutants disproportionately affect LPC-induced current relative to depolarization-activated current. Since the mutants that did not respond to LPC also exhibited smaller voltage-stimulated currents than those that did respond, we reasoned that using this ratio would better capture the information the reviewer is suggesting to gauge. Showing the zero current level may be helpful if the goal was to compare basal currents, which in our experience vary significantly from patch to patch. However, since we are comparing LPC- and voltage-induced currents within the same patch, we believe that including basal current measurements would not add useful information to our study.</p><p>Given that new experiments included to further highlight the significance of the discovery of Panx1 agonists, we opted to separate structure-based mechanistic studies from this manuscript and removed this experiment along with the docking and cryo-EM studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The fragmented NTD density shown in Fig S8 panel A may resemble either lipid density or the average density of both NTD and lipid. For example, Class7 and Class8 in Fig.S8 panel D displayed split densities, which may resemble a phosphate head group and two tails of lipid. A protomer mask may not be the ideal approach to separate different classes of NTD because as shown in Fig S8 panel D, most high-resolution features are located on TM1-4, suggesting that the classification was focused on TM1-4. A more suitable approach would involve using a smaller mask including NTD, TM1, and the neighbouring TM2 region to separate different NTD classes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and attempted 3D classification using multiple smaller masks including the suggested region. However, the maps remained poorly defined, and we were unable to confidently assign the NTD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The authors don’t discuss whether the LPC-bound structures display changes in the external part of the pore, which is the anion-selective filter and the narrower part of the pore. If there are no conformational changes there, then the present structures cannot explain permeability to large molecules like ATP. In this context, a plot for the pore dimension will be helpful to see differences along the pore between their different structures. It would also be clearer if the authors overlaid maps of protomers to illustrate differences at the NTD and the &quot;selectivity filter.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Both maps show that the narrowest constriction, formed by W74, has a diameter of approximately 9 Å. Previous steered molecular dynamics simulations suggest that ATP can permeate through such a constriction, implying an ion selection mechanism distinct from a simple steric barrier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The time between the addition of LPC to the nanodisc-reconstituted protein and grid preparation is not mentioned. Dynamic diffusion of LPC could result in equal probabilities for the bound and unbound forms. This raises the possibility of finding the Primed state in the LPC-bound state as well. Additionally, can the authors rationalize how LPC might reach the pore region when the channel is in the closed state before the application of LPC?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insight. We incubated LPC and nanodisc-reconstituted protein for 30 minutes, speculating that LPC approaches the pore similarly to other lipids in prior structures. In separate studies, we are optimizing conditions to capture more defined conformations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In the cryo-EM map of the “resting” state (EMDB-21150), a part of the density was interpreted as NTD flipped to the intracellular side. This density, however, is poorly defined, and not connected to the S1 helix, raising concerns about whether this density corresponds to the NTD as seen in the “resting” state structure (PDB-ID: 6VD7). In addition, some residues in the C-terminus (after K333 in frog PANX1) are missing from the atomic model. Some of these residues are predicted by AlphaFold2 to form a short alpha helix and are shown to form a short alpha helix in some published PANX1 structures. Interestingly, in both the AF2 model and 6WBF, this short alpha helix is located approximately in the weak density that the authors suggest represents the “flipped” NTD. We encourage the authors to be cautious in interpreting this part as the “flipped” NTD without further validation or justification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the density corresponding the extended NTD into the cytoplasm is relatively weak. In our recent study, we compared two Panx1 structures with or without the mentioned C-terminal helix and found evidence suggesting the likelihood of NTD extension (DOI: 10.1101/2024.06.13.598903). Nevertheless, to prevent potential confusion, we have removed the cryo-EM panel from this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Since the authors did not observe densities of bound PLC in the cryo-EM map, it is important to acknowledge in the text the inherent limitations of using docking and mutagenesis methods to locate where PLC binds.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have removed this section to avoid potential confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional suggestions:</p><p>(1) The authors used MeOH to extract mouse liver for reversed-phase chromatography. Was the study designed to focus on hydrophobic compounds that likely bind to the TMD? Panx1 has both ECD and ICD with substantial sizes that could interact with water soluble compounds? Also, the use of whole-cell recordings to screen fractions would not likely identify polar compounds that interact with the cytoplasmic part of the TMD? It would be useful for the authors to comment on these aspects of their screen and provide their rationale for fractionating liver rather than other tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a rationale in line 90, stating: “The soluble fractions were excluded from this study, as the most polar fraction induced strong channel activities in the absence of exogenously expressed pannexins.” Additionally, we have included a figure to support this rationale (Fig. S1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors show that LPCs reversibly increase inward currents at a holding voltage of -60 mV (not always specified in legends) in cells expressing Panx1 and 2, and then show families of currents activated by depolarizing voltage steps in the absence of LPC without asking what happens when you depolarize the membrane after LPC activation? If LPCs can be applied for long enough without disrupting recordings, it would be valuable to obtain both I-V relations and G-V relations before and after LPC activation of Panx channels. Does LPC disproportionately increase current at some voltages compared to others? Is the outward rectification reduced by LPC? Does Vrev remain unchanged (see point above)? Its hard to predict what would be observed, but almost any outcome from these experiments would suggest additional experiments to explore the extent to which the open states activated by LPC and depolarization are similar or distinct.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, in our hands, the prolonged application of lysolipids at concentrations necessary to achieve significant currents tends to destabilize the patch. This makes it challenging to obtain G-V curves or perform the previously mentioned kinetic analyses. We believe this destabilization may be due to lysolipids’ surfactant-like qualities, which can disrupt the giga seal. Additionally, prolonged exposure seems to cause channel desensitization, which could be another confounding factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) From the results presented, the authors cannot rule out that mutagenesis-induced insensitivity of Panx channels to LPCs results from allosteric perturbations in the channels rather than direct binding/gating by LPCs. In Fig 5 panel A-C, the authors introduced double mutants on TM1 and TM2 to interfere with LPC binding, however, the double mutants may also disrupt the interaction network formed within NTD, TM1, and TM2. This disruption could potentially rearrange the conformation of NTD, favouring the resting closed state. Three double Asn mutants, which abolished LPC induced current, also exhibited lower currents through voltage activation in Fig 5S, raising the possibility the mutant channels fail to activate in response to LPC due to an increased energy barrier. One way to gain further insight would be to mutate residues in NTD that interact with those substituted by the three double Asn mutants and to measuring currents from both voltage activation and LPC activation. Such results might help to elucidate whether the three double Asn mutants interfere with LPC binding. It would also be important to show that the voltage-activated currents in Fig. S5 are sensitive to CBX?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment, with which we agree. Our initial intention was to use the mutagenesis studies to experimentally support the docking study. Due to uncertainties associated with the presented cryo-EM maps, we have decided to remove this study from the current manuscript. We will consider the proposed experiments in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Could the authors elaborate on how LPC opens Panx1 by altering the conformation of the NTDs in an uncoordinated manner, going from “primed” state to the “active” state. In the “primed” state, the NTDs seem to be ordered by forming interactions with the TMD, thus resulting in the largest (possible?) pore size around the NTDs. In contrast, in the “active” state, the authors suggest that the NTDs are fragmented as a result of uncoordinated rearrangement, which conceivably will lead to a reduction in pore size around NTDs (isn’t it?). It is therefore not intuitive to understand why a conformation with a smaller pore size represents an “active” state.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the uncoordinated arrangement of NTDs is dynamic, allowing for potential variations in pore size during the activated conformation. Alternatively, NTD movement may be coupled with conformational changes in TM1 and the extracellular domain, which in turn could alter the electrostatic properties of the permeation pathway. We believe a functional study exploring this mechanism would be more appropriately presented as a separate study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Can the authors provide a positive control for these negative results presented in Fig S1B and C?</p></disp-quote><p>The positive results are presented in Fig. 1D and E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Raw images in Fig S6 and Fig S7 should contain units of measurement.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It may be beneficial to show the superposition between primed state and activated state in both protomer and overall structure. In addition, superposition between primed state and PDB 7F8J.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to superimpose the cryo-EM maps; however, visually highlighting the differences in figure format proved challenging. Higher-resolution maps would allow for model building, which would more effectively convey these distinctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Including particles number in each class in Fig S8 panel C and D would help in evaluating the quality of classification.</p></disp-quote><p>Noted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) A table for cryo-EM statistics should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, noted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) n values are often provided as a range within legends but it would be better to provide individual values for each dataset. In many figures you can see most of the data points, which is great, but it would be easy to add n values to the plots themselves, perhaps in parentheses above the data points.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that transparency is essential, adding n-values to each graph would make some figures less clear and potentially harder to interpret in this case. We believe that the dot plots, n-value range, and statistical analysis provide adequate support for our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) The way caspase activation of Panx channels is presented in the introduction could be viewed as dismissive or inflammatory for those who have studied that mechanism. We think the caspase activation literature is quite convincing and there is no need to be dismissive when pointing out that there are good reasons to believe that other mechanisms of activation likely exist. We encourage you to revise the introduction accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Although we intended to support the caspase activation mechanism in our introduction, we understand that the reviewer’s interpretation indicates a need for clarification. We hope the revised introduction removes any perception of dismissiveness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Why is the patient data in Fig 4F normalized differently than everything else? Once the above issues with mVenus quenching data are clarified, it would be good to be systematic and use the same approach here.</p></disp-quote><p>For Fig. 4F, we used a distinct normalization method to account for substantial day-to-day variation in experiments involving body fluids. Notably, we did not apply this normalization to other experimental panels due to their considerably lower day-to-day variation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) What was the rational for using the structure from ref 35 in the docking task?</p></disp-quote><p>The docking task utilized the human orthologue with a flipped-up NTD. We believe that this flipped-up conformation is likely the active form that responds to lysolipids. As our functional experiments primarily use the human orthologue for biological relevance, this structure choice is consistent. Our docking data shows that LPC does not dock at this site when using a construct with the downward-flipped NTD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Perhaps better to refer to double Asn ‘substitutions’ rather than as ‘mutations’ because that makes one think they are Asn in the wt protein.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) From Fig S1, we gather that Panx2 is much larger than Panx1 and 3. If that is the case, its worth noting that to readers somewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the molecular weight of each subtype in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Please provide holding voltages and zero current levels in all figures presenting currents.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided holding voltages. However, the zero current levels vary among the examples presented, making direct comparisons difficult. Since we are comparing currents with and without LPC, we believe that indicating zero current levels is unnecessary for this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) While the authors successfully establish lysophospholipid-gating of Panx1 and Panx2, Panx3 appears unaffected. It may be advisable to be more specific in the title of the article.</p></disp-quote><p>We are uncertain whether Panx3 is unaffected by lysophospholipids, as we have not observed activation of this subtype under any tested conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
