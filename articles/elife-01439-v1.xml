In this study, we have defined such a program for multi-ciliated epithelial cells (MCCs), a cell type critical for proper development and homeostasis of the airway, brain and reproductive tracts. Starting from genomic analysis of the cilia-associated transcription factor Rfx2, we used bioinformatics and in vivo cell biological approaches to gain insights into the molecular basis of cilia assembly and function. Moreover, we discovered a previously un-recognized role for an Rfx factor in cell movement, finding that Rfx2 cell-autonomously controls apical surface expansion in nascent MCCs. Thus, Rfx2 coordinates multiple, distinct gene expression programs in MCCs, regulating genes that control cell movement, ciliogenesis, and cilia function. As such, the work serves as a paradigm for understanding genomic control of cell biological processes that span from early cell morphogenetic events to terminally differentiated cellular functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01439.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01439.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01439.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells that have hundreds of tiny hair-like structures called cilia on their surface have important roles in our airways and also in the brain and reproductive system.

While recent advances in genomic technology have dramatically empowered these studies, we still know comparatively little about the mechanisms linking systems-level programs of gene expression to discrete cell biological processes in vivo. This gap in our understanding is important because organ and tissue function are ultimately executed by the specialized behaviors of individual cells (e.g., polarized secretion in excretory organs, coordinated contraction in muscle cells).</p><p>Recent studies of cilia and ciliated epithelial cells highlight the current disconnect between genomics and cell biology: it is clear that hundreds of proteins are required for cilia assembly and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gherman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inglis et al., 2006</xref>), and moreover, assembly of new cilia/flagella clearly requires new transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). Nonetheless, only a handful of transcription factors have been identified that control cilia structure and function, and their associated gene regulatory networks remain largely undefined, especially in vertebrates. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the sole RFX family transcription factor <italic>daf-19</italic> is the central regulator of ciliogenesis, and dozens of target genes are known to effect its action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Efimenko et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phirke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burghoorn et al., 2012</xref>). The one Rfx factor in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is likewise well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laurencon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Newton et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, multiple RFX family members are essential for ciliogenesis in vertebrates, but as yet, there has been no comprehensive genome-wide survey of Rfx-dependent gene expression as it relates to ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonnafe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashique et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">El Zein et al., 2009</xref>). This gap in our knowledge of the genomics of RFX factors is made the more important because these proteins also possess cilia-independent functions about which very little is yet known, including control neuronal and pancreatic development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Senti and Swoboda, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ait-Lounis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pearl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benadiba et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>One vertebrate cell type in which Rfx factors are known to play particularly important roles is the multi-ciliated epithelial cell (MCC). These cells project dozens or hundreds of motile cilia from their apical surfaces, and the polarized beating of these cilia generates fluid flow that is essential for development and homeostasis in many organ systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Such cells are central to the normal homeostasis of airway, brain and reproductive tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Worthington and Cathcart, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yeung et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lyons et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fahy and Dickey, 2010</xref>), and defective functioning of these cells is associated with pathologies ranging from chronic infection to hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afzelius, 1976</xref>). Despite these cells’ importance and long history of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sharpey, 1830</xref>), the transcription factors that control MCC development and function are only now being elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">You et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stubbs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marcet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tan et al., 2013</xref>), and among these factors is Rfx2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01439.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conserved cell behaviors during multi-ciliated cell development in mammalian airways and Xenopus epidermis.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01439.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01439.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-01439-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>In this study, we sought to combine systems biology approaches with in vivo cell biological studies in order to better define the genomic control of MCC development and function. We used high-throughput sequencing of Rfx2-regulated transcripts, systematic mapping of Rfx2 chromosomal binding sites, and bioinformatic exploration of functional protein interactions to guide our mechanistic cell biology experiments. This approach provided diverse new insights into the roles played by Rfx2 in ciliogenesis and polarized ciliary beating. Surprisingly, we also find that Rfx2 plays a central, but unanticipated, role in controlling cell movement in newborn MCCs, a process about which almost nothing is currently known. Overall, Rfx2 activates a complex program of gene expression that serves to coordinate several distinct features of MCCs, including cell migration, ciliogenesis, and cilia function, thus serving as a paradigm for genomic control of cell biological processes that span from early differentiation events to terminally differentiated cell functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Systems-level analysis of Rfx2 function in a vertebrate mucociliary epithelium</title><p>To explore the genomic control of cell behavior in MCCs, we turned to the amphibian embryo, which has emerged as a powerful and rapidly assayable in vivo model for this cell type. Indeed, several foundational studies of specification, ciliogenesis, and planar polarization in MCCs have been performed in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deblandre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stubbs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marcet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sirour et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Werner and Mitchell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stubbs et al., 2012</xref>).

The row titled ‘Total reads’ provides the numbers of Illumina Hi-Seq sequencing reads after pre-processing to remove low quality. We used the set of JGI 6.0 scaffolds longer than 10,000 bp for genome mapping, and the longest isoform of each gene model (‘Oktoberfest’ version), with bowtie1 (version 0.12.7) allowing two mismatches on the seed (-v 2 option). For mapping ChIP-Seq data to genomic scaffolds, we considered only unique hits (-m 1 option). For mapping RNA-seq reads to transcript models, we allowed for redundant hits (-an option) so as to maximize the signals from the RNA-seq datasets for the purposes of calculating differential gene expression, where redundant hits should not significantly affect the analysis, as each gene model was independently tested across conditions. We normalized across libraries by the total number of reads mapped onto a gene model. Subsequent tests of mapping without allowing redundant hits (-m 1 option) against the longest gene model confirmed that the differences between these two options was negligible.

Briefly, RNA-seq was performed on isolates of <italic>Xenopus</italic> mucociliary epithelium grown in organotypic culture, comparing control samples to knockdown using validated Rfx2 morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2012</xref>). We performed two biological replicates, each containing 100–200 individual tissue isolates; analysis of the correlation found excellent reproducibility between the two replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As we are most concerned here with results that will be relevant to human health, we confined our analysis of the RNA-seq data to <italic>Xenopus</italic> genes for which there were unambiguous human orthologues to facilitate cross-organism comparison. From this list of 11,644 genes, we identified 2750 genes that were differentially expressed following Rfx2 knockdown (&gt;twofold; FDR&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We next used ChIP-seq to ask which of these differentially expressed genes were direct targets of control by Rfx2. We identified 3465 genes that were significantly bound by Rfx2 and, importantly, this set of genes overlapped significantly with the set of genes differentially expressed in Rfx2 morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) (p≤10<sup>−6</sup>, hypergeometric test). The intersection of these two experiments defined 911 genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>), corresponding to the directly regulated downstream target genes of Rfx2. We tested a subset of these directly bound, differentially expressed genes by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis; 100% were confirmed as Rfx2-dependent genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We then focused our further studies on this set of 911 direct targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Rfx2 controls assembly of diverse ciliogenic machinery</title><p>An unbiased analysis of enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms suggested a key role for Rfx2 in the control of ciliary gene expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>), consistent with the known roles for Rfx2 in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, direct examination of the 911 Rfx2 target genes revealed that components of essentially all known ciliary machinery are under the control of Rfx2 in MCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Principal among these is the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, the core mechanism for moving cargoes into and out of the cilium. IFT involves two separable complexes, IFT-A and IFT-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008</xref>), and we identified the IFT–B complex components <italic>ift172</italic> and <italic>ift88</italic> as direct Rfx2 targets, consistent with data from flies, worms, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>).

Additionally, we found that Rfx2 directly controls expression of genes encoding axonemal dynein subunits, components of the transition zone, and a component of the BBSome, and many of these genes are mutated in human ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Significantly, our analysis identified several ciliary systems that have not previously been associated with RFX factors. For example, Rfx2 controlled expression of tubulins, enzymes involved in tubulin post-translational modification, and microtubule binding proteins, such as <italic>map7</italic> and <italic>spef1/clamp</italic>, which localize to the proximal and distal axonemes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks and Wallingford, 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Rfx2 also controlled the expression of the planar cell polarity (PCP) effector gene <italic>fritz</italic>/<italic>wdpcp</italic>, which encodes a protein governing assembly of the septin diffusion barrier at the base of cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Rfx2 also controls many centriolar genes required for ciliogenesis, including <italic>cep164</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Graser et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, <italic>wdpcp</italic> and <italic>cep164</italic> are both implicated in human ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaki et al., 2012</xref>). This analysis thus provides a comprehensive view of Rfx-related ciliary gene expression in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genomic analysis of Rfx2 identifies a novel regulator of intraflagellar transport</title><p>These data provide a foundation for understanding Rfx-mediated control of known cilia genes. However, a particularly striking feature of the Rfx2 target genes was the large number whose relationship to cilia (or lack thereof) is not known. Because transcriptionally co-regulated genes frequently share functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marcotte et al., 1999</xref>), we next asked if our Rfx2 target gene set might provide a jumping-off point for exploring the molecular biology of ciliogenesis, with an aim towards implicating new proteins in this important process.</p><p>To focus our search, we used the direct Rfx2 target genes as a seed set to interrogate a probabilistic human gene network (HumanNet) that captures functionally linked genes based on observations in large-scale functional genomics and proteomics datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Using ‘guilt-by-association’ in this network, we identified <italic>ttc29</italic> as a candidate for functional interaction with the IFT machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We tested this prediction and found not only that Ttc29-GFP localized to ciliary axonemes, but also that knockdown elicited substantial defects in ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). To test the HumanNet prediction more directly, we used high-speed in vivo confocal imaging of IFT particle dynamics in <italic>Xenopus</italic> MCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooks and Wallingford, 2012</xref>). Strikingly, partial knockdown of Ttc29 resulted in a significant decrease in the mean rate of anterograde IFT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), consistent with the bioinformatic linkage of <italic>ttc29</italic> to components of the anterograde IFT-B complex (<italic>ift88</italic> and <italic>ttc30a</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Retrograde IFT movement was not significantly affected by Ttc29 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

For example, many cells must first undergo transitions from mesenchyme to epithelium or vice-versa, must engage in migration, or must radically change their shape. Then, as they terminally differentiate, most cells will assemble specialized cellular machinery in order to execute their cell-type specific functions. Understanding how disparate cell types execute specialized cell behaviors is therefore a key challenge in developmental biology and will require us not only to delineate gene regulatory networks, but also to associate particular genes in the network with particular cellular machinery.

Using the edgeR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>), we identified significant changes in RNA abundances between control and Rfx2 knockdowns, requiring greater than twofold abundance changes and a false discovery rate (FDR) less than 5%. Out of 11,644 genes tested, we identified 2750 genes significantly differentially expressed following Rfx2 knockdown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Rfx2 chromatin-immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq)</title><p>ChIP-seq was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) to identify direct chromosomal binding sites of Rfx2. Briefly, ChIP-seq assays were performed with stage 20 <italic>X. laevis</italic> embryos, injected with in vitro transcribed mRNA coding for either GFP-Rfx2 or GFP alone. Samples were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 1 hr and the reaction stopped by adding glycine (to 125 mM) for 10 min. The embryos were rinsed with PBS and resuspended in lysis buffer with protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Chromatin was sonicated to an average size of 200–600 base pair using a Branson 450 Sonifier, then immunoprecipitated using protein G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) coupled to 5 μg α-GFP antibody (ab290) at 4°C overnight. Magnetic beads were washed, the bound chromatin eluted, and crosslinks reversed. ChIP DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform and purified with a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). ChIP-seq libraries were prepared according to the standard manufacturer’s Illumina sequencing protocol and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq.</p><p>Reads were mapped to the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> draft genome (version 6) using bowtie (‘-m 1 -n 2’ options were applied) and peaks identified using MACS (version 1.4.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) with default options. Out of 29,448 peaks identified, we selected 6646 peaks for further study that exhibited either a FDR &lt;5% or a fold-enrichment &gt; 20. Genes were associated with significant ChIP-seq peaks based on proximity in the draft genome, requiring genes (specifically, the longest transcript for each gene model as mapped to the draft genome sequence) to lie within 10,000 bases from an identified peak. Out of the 6646 significant ChIP-seq peaks, 3465 peaks could be assigned to nearby genes and 911 of those putative target genes also showed significantly different gene expression after Rfx2 knockdown. We focused on these differentially expressed, directly bound genes for subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of RFX2 targets using the HumanNet gene network</title><p>To better understand the molecular mechanisms of genes regulated by RFX2, we analyzed the clustering of RFX2 target genes using a human functional gene network (‘HumanNet’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). To increase potential coverage, we considered <italic>X. laevis</italic> genes that were either marked by RFX2 binding sites in the ChIP-seq data or that were significantly differentially expressed following RFX2. For the human orthologs of these genes (as defined by the International <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> genome project using phylogenetic analyses of gene models during the course of annotating <italic>X. laevis</italic> genes), we extracted HumanNet gene–gene linkage information and associated confidence scores (log likelihood scores; LLS). The resulting network contained 4609 genes with 52,714 functional linkages, and served as the basis for later analyses.</p><p>Due to an ancestral genome duplication along the <italic>X. laevis</italic> lineage, many human genes have (typically) two <italic>X. laevis</italic> orthologs, generally referred to as ‘homeologs’ or ‘alloalleles’<italic>.</italic> For the purposes of calculating gene networks among RFX2 target genes, we transferred evidence from either of the alloalleles to the single orthologous human gene. For example, in the case of having one human gene orthologous to two frog genes, if one of the frog homologs was identified as a direct target of RFX2 and the other was not, we considered the human gene as a direct target of RFX2 for the purposes of reconstructing the network. To identify functional modules regulated by RFX2 in unbiased way, we clustered this network using the clusterONE algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nepusz et al., 2012</xref>) available in Cytoscape (version 2.8.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cline et al., 2007</xref>), considering linkage confidence scores during the clustering.

This outer layer peel was then transferred onto a host embryo after removing a similar patch of outer cells. To help the healing process, a small piece of glass coverslip with clay feet was used to press down embryos. Transplantations were performed in Danilchick’s Solution for Amy (DFA) + 0.1% BSA.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor, Marianne Bronner, and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper entitled by Chung et al. describes the role of the transcription factor RFX in driving expression of genes involved in diverse cellular functions in the multiciliated cells of <italic>Xenopus epithelium</italic>. Specifically, they perform both RNA-seq (wild type versus morphant) and DNA Chip-Seq to identify genes directly bound and upregulated by RFX. They then use these data to perform computational analysis that assigns unknown genes into possible cellular processes including ciliogenesis, cilia beating, and cell migration. Finally with a subset of novel targets they test function using gene specific morphants. They identify several uncharacterized proteins that are involved in IFT, in cilia beating and in migration.</p><p>This manuscript contains an impressive amount of data that deal with an important biological issue. In addition, it describes a novel mode for identifying potentially important proteins. The authors do a nice job of putting their data into the broader context of what is known in the field. That said, there some additions, detailed below, that are required to render this paper appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) It is essential that the authors provide a list of all of the 911 genes identified in their screen in the form of an excel sheet. This is critical so that the community can compare and contrast the quality and usefulness of the data. In this way, this “screen paper” would provide a truly useful and important data set for the community.</p><p>2) The authors should provide a complete description of the technique and some more detailed analysis of the gene set, for example using gene ontology. While knocking down 911 genes is wholly impractical and clearly beyond the scope of the present paper, the use of gene ontology groupings may identify other potential modules and provide new hypotheses into the roles of Rfx2 in early epithelial development.</p><p>3) In their diagram, the authors place Mcidas above RFX due to the fact that RFX and FOXJ1 came up from the Mcidas screen, which makes sense. However, RFX is important for multiple types of cilia, including primary, whereas Mcidas is not required for primary cilia. This causes confusion over the hierarchy of these factors and should be discussed on a cell type specific basis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01439.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is essential that the authors provide a list of all of the 911 genes identified in their screen in the form of an excel sheet.

We hasten to note that the entire dataset was submitted to the NCBI, but we also acknowledge that a table included in the paper will be far more useful. This table has been added as Figure 2–source data 1.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should provide a complete description of the technique and some more detailed analysis of the gene set, for example using gene ontology.

We have also now added a supplemental table of enriched GO terms (Figure 2–source data 2). Satisfyingly, this analysis finds that cilia-related and cell locomotion/cell projection GO terms are the most enriched. Moreover, we also find a neuron projection category that is enriched, in line with the discussion of our paper. Finally, we find a fourth category (nucleotide/nucleoside related terms) that we had not previously appreciated. This information has now been presented in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p><italic>3) In their diagram, the authors place Mcidas above RFX due to the fact that RFX and FOXJ1 came up from the Mcidas screen, which makes sense.

This causes confusion over the hierarchy of these factors and should be discussed on a cell type specific basis</italic>.</p><p>We regret that we were unclear on this point. It is true that Rfx2 is required for primary ciliogenesis. However, our RNAseq and ChIPseq were performed on multi-ciliated cells, so we do not yet know the extent to which these findings will apply to primary cilia.</p><p>We have therefore clarified the Figure, the figure legend, and the manuscript text to emphasize that our findings apply specifically to multi-ciliated cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
