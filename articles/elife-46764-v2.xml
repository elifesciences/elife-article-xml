However, it is becoming widely appreciated that the cerebellum also contributes significantly to many non-motor processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmahmann, 1991</xref>) such as cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 1994</xref>), social processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Van Overwalle et al., 2014</xref>), aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reis et al., 1973</xref>) and emotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schmahmann and Caplan, 2006</xref>). Moreover, cerebellar deficits are associated with non-motor conditions including autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), deficits of language processing and vocal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2008</xref>), schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mothersill et al., 2016</xref>) and other impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivry and Spencer, 2004</xref>). Together, these observations strongly suggest that the cerebellum, and cerebellar learning, must operate in a manner compatible with adjusting motor as well as non-motor processes.</p><p>Classical models posit that cerebellar learning is instructed by signals carried by an afferent fiber projection from the inferior olive called climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ito, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marr, 1969</xref>). Such models suggest that climbing fibers operate according to a supervised learning rule to instruct changes in motor output by signaling the occurrence of movement errors. However, it is unclear how such a supervised learning rule could contribute to modification of many non-motor behaviors. In line with this view, accumulating evidence has demonstrated a wide range of climbing fiber responses that are distinct from motor error signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitazawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Streng et al., 2017</xref>), including temporal-difference error signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>) and reward prediction signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larry et al., 2019</xref>). Together, such data provide evidence that the cerebellum may utilize alternative learning rules to support a wider range of behaviors than can be driven by error-based supervised learning alone.</p><p>Under what conditions might the climbing fiber system instruct alternative learning rules? Rabies tracing experiments have identified a disynaptic pathway from the lateral cerebellum to the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>), and recent functional connectivity experiments have revealed a direct, monosynaptic connection from the lateral cerebellum to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carta et al., 2019</xref>). These experiments also showed that lateral cerebellar output can modulate reward-driven behaviors by the same pathway. If the cerebellum acts to modulate striatal and VTA pathways involved in reward-driven behaviors, it must contain information related to such behaviors, and likely mediate cerebellar learning in a manner consistent with reward-based associations. Indeed, there is evidence that cerebellar granule cells can display reward related signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wagner et al., 2017</xref>), and climbing fibers can display signals consistent with reward prediction errors in certain behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unclear how cerebellar learning, and in particular, how learning signals provided by cerebellar climbing fibers, operate during the types of classical conditioning behaviors classically studied to evaluate reward processing and learning in the VTA and striatum.</p><p>A key first step in understanding how cerebellar learning can contribute to reward processing and reward driven behaviors is to test what instructional signals are carried by cerebellar climbing fibers in behavioral paradigms known to involve striatal computations. To this end, we have utilized an appetitive classical conditioning task that mirrors well-studied reward prediction paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), and performed <italic>in vivo</italic> calcium imaging to measure cerebellar climbing fiber driven complex spike (Cspk) activity across the lateral cerebellum in awake mice. These experiments reveal distinct, functionally compartmentalized, reward-related Cspk signals in each of the lateral cerebellar lobules. Specifically, in Lobule Simplex (LS), Crus I and Crus II, robust Cspk responses emerge with learning in response to a visual cue that predicts reward. In LS and Crus II, unexpected reward produces Cspk responses, both before and after learning. In contrast, Crus I shows no Cspk response to unexpected reward in naïve animals, but a robust Cspk response to unexpected reward once animals have associated a visual cue with reward. Imaging Cspk activity across learning suggests that the same climbing fibers that respond to reward in naïve animals can instead respond to a reward predictive cue after learning. Finally, we observe no evidence of negative prediction error following reward omission immediately after learning, suggesting the possibility that Cspk responses may not instruct a strict temporal difference (TD) learning model in this paradigm. The learned, reward predictive Cspk signals observed here are, however, consistent with a model that would allow learned cerebellar output to provide information about rewarding stimuli to downstream structures such as the VTA and striatum. Hence, these data provide a key link between the instructional signals known to be involved in cerebellar learning and the types of reward-based processing observed in downstream areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An appetitive classical conditioning paradigm to investigate climbing fiber responses in the lateral cerebellum</title><p>To investigate climbing fiber driven Cspk activity during an appetitive classical conditioning paradigm that parallels tasks typically used to study reward processing in the VTA and striatum, we first established an appropriate behavior for head-fixed mice that is compatible with calcium imaging in the lateral cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). In this task, mice learn a simple association between a visual cue and the timing of subsequent reward delivery. Specifically, mice were trained by viewing a continuously present, full screen vertical grating that was transiently (100 ms) replaced with a horizontal grating to signal the delivery of a saccharine reward at a 600 ms delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). After multiple training sessions (mean = 5.7 ± 0.4 days), mice learned the association between the visual cue and the time of reward delivery, significantly reducing both their reaction times (Day 1, 742.8 ± 25.4 ms; Day N+1, 544.7 ± 13.0 ms; p=8.52 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, n = 27 mice, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and miss rates (Day 1, 0.39 ± 0.04; Day N+1, 0.03 ± 0.01; p=6.37 × 10<sup>−9</sup>, paired t-test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In addition to developing well-timed licking responses that approximated the time of reward delivery on rewarded trials, mice also developed robust licking responses following the visual cue on omission trials after learning that were absent in naïve animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Together, these data indicate that mice successfully learn the association between visual cue and the timing of reward delivery in this paradigm.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46764.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Appetitive classical conditioning regime for head-fixed mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of headplate and 3 mm cranial window.

To obtain a broad view of Cspk activity across LS and assess whether any reward-related signals are carried by climbing fibers in this paradigm, we first performed single-photon, mesoscale calcium imaging of Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites expressing GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This method has previously been demonstrated to accurately report Cspk activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>). Using this approach, we observed a significant increase in the Cspk activity following reward delivery in naïve animals (n = 308 trials, five mice, p=5×10<sup>−19</sup>, paired t-test), but no significant response on reward omission trials (n = 74 trials, five mice, p=0.595, paired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top). After learning, significant Cspk responses were maintained (n = 749 trials, six mice, p=3.3×10<sup>−100</sup>, paired t-test), but were shifted in time, and preceded reward delivery on rewarded trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, after learning there was also a significant response on omission trials preceding reward delivery (n = 156 trials, six mice, p=5.4×10<sup>−16</sup>, paired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Across experiments, the latency of Cspk activity decreased significantly (n = 6 mice, p=1.04 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, paired t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Notably, this shift in Cspk timing (Δ<sub>Cspk</sub> = 441 ms) was greater than the change in lick timing (Δ<sub>lick</sub> = 185 ms), indicating that the Cspk response did not simply follow the timing of motor output. In addition, we find that Cspk responses after learning had the same timing for rewarded and omission trials (Rewarded trial latency = 383 ± 15 ms, Omission trial latency = 378 ± 19 ms, n = 6 mice, p=0.78 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, paired t test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, when reward was delivered unexpectedly after learning (i.e. in absence of the visual cue), Cspk activity followed reward delivery, and was significantly delayed compared with rewarded trials (Day N+2; rewarded trial latency = 366.1 ± 31 ms, unexpected trial latency 793 ± 31 ms, n = 5 mice, p=2.40 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, paired t-test). The latency of Cspk responses on unexpected reward trials was, however, equivalent to the timing of responses to rewarded trials in naïve animals (p=0.38, two-sample t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these data reveal that complex spiking shifts in time as a result of learning, initially following reward delivery in naïve animals and later preceding reward delivery in trained animals, occurring with the same timing on both rewarded and omission trials after learning.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46764.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single photon, mesoscale imaging of Cspk activity during behavior.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the cerebellar cortex with GCaMP6f expressed in PCs for single or two photon dendrite imaging.

However, to further disambiguate Cspk activity related to reward, reward expectation and licking, and to test whether Cspk activity in individual PC dendrites changes across learning, we next used two-photon imaging to visualize Cspk responses in individual PC dendrites. As in our mesoscale imaging experiments, these data revealed significantly elevated Cspk rates following reward delivery in naïve animals (n = 1040 dendrites, 15 mice, p=5.5×10<sup>−48</sup>, one-tailed t-test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) but no significant response during this window on omission trials (p=0.98). After learning, we observed significantly elevated Cspk rates prior to reward delivery on both rewarded (n = 906 dendrites, 16 mice, p=2.3×10<sup>−60</sup>, one-tailed t-test) and omission trials (p=1.4×10<sup>−33</sup>) that were comparable across trial types (p=0.01, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,E</xref>). In addition, post-reward Cspk rates were significantly reduced after learning (p=2.0×10<sup>−19</sup>, unpaired t-test), with small elevations in spiking (reward trials: p=3.3×10<sup>−4</sup>; omission trials: p=6.7×10<sup>−6</sup>; one-tailed t-test) that were equivalent on both rewarded and omission trials (p=0.46; paired t-test). Notably, there were no Cspk responses that were reliably suppressed below baseline after the time of expected reward on omission trials (see Materials and methods). These data indicate that Cspk activity shifts from an association with reward prior to learning to the cue that predicts reward after learning. To test whether unique populations of PC dendrites exhibit Cspk responses to reward and following the visual cue after learning, we identified the subset of PC dendrites with significant post-reward responses (n = 204/906 dendrites; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This small subset of PC dendrites also responded following the visual cue (p=5.9×10<sup>−36</sup>; one-tailed t-test), indicating that a minority of PC dendrites can exhibit Cspk responses to both reward and the visual cue after learning. These data suggest the possibility that some Cspk responses had not fully transitioned between encoding the reward and the reward-predicting cue immediately after learning. However, the majority of PC dendrites (n = 702/906 dendrites) did not respond to the reward after learning, and instead only responded to the reward-predicting cue (p=3.9×10<sup>−36</sup>, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46764.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cspk modulation in LS across learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ΔF/F timecourses from an example neuron measured via two-photon calcium imaging for the first day of training in naïve mice.

On these trials, Cspk rates increased significantly after the time of unexpected reward delivery (n = 243 dendrites; six mice, p=1.6×10<sup>−8</sup>, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, with this additional day of training, there was no longer a significant post-reward response on trials where reward was expected (p=0.8). These data indicate that after learning, Cspk responses in area LS are only reward responsive if the reward is unexpected. In the same experiments, Cspk rates increased significantly prior to reward delivery when reward was expected (p=1.2×10<sup>−12</sup>, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Notably, the PC dendrites that were significantly responsive following the reward-predicting cue (n = 84/243 dendrites), were also significantly responsive after the unexpected reward (p=2.3×10<sup>12</sup>, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). This suggests that the same PC dendrites exhibit Cspk responses to the reward-predictive cue and unexpected reward, thus signaling predictions under two different conditions. However, lick timing also differs between these two trial types, and changes across learning. Thus, we also sought to further disambiguate reward related Cspk responses from possible Cspk responses driven by motor output during licking.</p><p>To directly assess the role of licking in modulating Cspk rates, we first generated a lick-triggered average of Cspk activity from licks generated during the inter-trial interval (ITI). These data revealed no significant Cspk response to licking (p=0.6; n = 768 dendrites, 13 mice, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), consistent with previous reports showing a lack of lick-related Cspk activity in area LS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>). To further address the contribution of licking to the emergent Cspk responses following the reward-predicting cue after learning, we segregated rewarded trials into subsets according to lick timing. Specifically, we averaged trials with the earliest and latest quartiles of licking. This analysis revealed that the peak of the pre-reward Cspks occurred at nearly the same time relative to the cue on trials with early as compared to late licks (Cspk latency on early trials: 300 ms; late trials: 330 ms), and with similar, but slightly smaller, amplitude (p=4.4×10<sup>−4</sup>; n = 906 dendrites, 16 mice, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). There was, however, a difference in Cspk rate following reward delivery (p=8.8×10<sup>−9</sup>), likely due to the increased variability in the timing of reward consumption for trials with late licks. In addition, we also compared trials with the highest and lowest lick rates, and found that Cspk responses had identical timing (high and low lick rate Cspk latency = 300 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>) and a qualitatively similar, though statistically different amplitude prior to reward delivery (p=7.4×10<sup>−05</sup>, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). These data indicate that the pre-reward Cspk responses that emerge with learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,L</xref>) are related to the cue-driven expectation of reward, and not conditioned motor output due to licking.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The same climbing fibers can respond to reward and a reward-predictive visual cue</title><p>While our data indicate Cspk activity within individual dendrites can represent different reward-related events (i.e. the reward-predicting cue and unexpected reward), these data do not address whether it is the same climbing fibers that shift their responses, or whether separate populations of climbing fibers generate different responses before and after learning. To address this question, we measured Cspk activity from PC dendrites in the same coordinates before and after learning in a subset of experiments. To evaluate responses, we took two approaches. First, we manually identified individual PC dendrites across imaging days and measured their Cspk responses before and after learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This approach revealed clear examples of single PC dendrites with reward responsive Cspk activity in naïve animals that became cue responsive after learning. However, because this approach relies on user identification of the same PC dendrites, we also sought to test an automated approach. To do so, we first independently generated pixel masks for PC dendrites from our pre and post-learning fields of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). We then motion registered the mean fluorescence image from the post-learning session to the pre-learning session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and applied the same pixel shifts from this registration to the segmented pixel masks from the post-learning condition. By overlaying the shifted post-learning pixel masks with the pre-learning masks, we assessed the overlap between imaging days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). Despite closely matched fields of view, this process led to a majority of PC dendrite masks with little overlap. We thus employed a stringent criterion of greater than 50% overlap to increase the probability of accurately identifying the same PC dendrites across imaging sessions. With these criteria, we identified a group of PC dendrites likely corresponding to the same PC dendrites before and after learning. In these PC dendrites, as in our other experiments, we find that Cspk activity was initially absent following the visual cue in naïve animals (p=0.59; n = 61 dendrites, 14 mice, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), and that cue driven responses emerged with learning (p=1.2×10<sup>−8</sup>). We note that because of the close spacing and similar size and orientation of PC dendrites, such approaches cannot provide definitive evidence of tracking the same PC dendrites across learning. However, these data support the conclusion that individual CFs can develop a learned response to the reward predictive cue as a result of learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46764.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cspk responses measured in the same fields of view across learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of manual identification from a field of view containing several of the same PC dendrites on day one and day N+1.

Thus, we next measured Cspk responses in Crus I and Crus II.</p><p>In Crus I, pre-learning Cspk activity differed substantially from LS. Specifically, in naïve animals, Cspk activity was sensory-related, and followed the visual cue at a time well before reward delivery or licking on both rewarded (p=3.6×10<sup>−20</sup>, n = 133 dendrites, six mice; one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>) and omission trials (p=3.4×10<sup>−17</sup>).

In contrast, there were only weak or non-significant reward responses on rewarded or omission trials, either before (rewarded: p=0.002; omission: p=0.21; one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>) or after learning (rewarded: p=1.0; omission: p=0.84; one-tailed t-test). Again, however, we did not identify any PC dendrites that were reliably suppressed at the time of expected reward after learning. Notably, despite the lack of a Cspk response to unexpected reward in naïve animals, there was a large Cspk response to unexpected reward in the same animals after learning (p=5.1×10<sup>−11</sup>, n = 141, five mice, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data suggest that in Crus I, where Cspk responses are sensory related in naïve animals, activity can also be generated by expectations that are specifically linked to a learned, reward-predictive sensory cue after learning.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46764.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cspk modulation in Crus I across learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ΔF/F timecourses from an example neuron measured via two-photon calcium imaging for the first day of training in naïve mice.

Indeed, these PC dendrites (n = 100/141) also showed a robust response to unexpected reward (p=7.7×10<sup>−11</sup>; one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that PC dendrites can signal expectation under distinct conditions. As further evidence that Cspk responses in Crus I are sensory related in naïve animals, there was no significant Cspk response to licks during the ITI (p=0.04; n = 93 dendrites, four mice, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). To test whether licking contributes to the learned increase in response amplitude following the cue, we segregated trials according to the timing of the first lick. This revealed that the timing (early and late lick Cspk latency: 230 ms) and amplitude (p=0.04, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) of Cspk activity following the visual cue was largely independent of lick timing. In addition, we also compared trials with the highest and lowest lick rates, and found the amount of licking also did not alter the timing (high and low lick rate Cspk latency: 230 ms) or amplitude of pre-reward Cspk responses (p=0.4, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Thus, as with lobule simplex, learned changes in Cspk responses are not related to conditioned motor output due to licking. Together, these data indicate that Cspk activity in Crus I is sensory related in naïve animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>), but can also be modulated by reward expectation because it is enhanced by associating the visual cue with reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,L</xref>), and driven by delivering a reward unexpectedly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we measured Cspk activity in Crus II.

After learning, a robust cue response was observed in Crus II on both rewarded (p=9.7×10<sup>−26</sup>; n = 245 dendrites, n = 6 mice, one-tailed t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C,E</xref>) and omission trials (p=6.1×10<sup>−21</sup>).

Interestingly, however, these responses disappeared after learning (p=0.98; n = 136 dendrites, three mice). Moreover, after learning, the pre-reward timing of Cspks was independent of lick timing (Cspk latency on both early and late lick trials = 300 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), and Cspks maintained a similar rate following the cue (p=0.002; paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) regardless of lick timing. In addition, we also compared trials with the highest and lowest lick rates, and found the amount of licking also did not alter the timing of Cspk responses (high and low lick rate Cspk latency = 300 ms; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), and produced Cspk responses with similar though statistically different amplitude prior to reward (p=4.1×10<sup>−5</sup>, paired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). These results suggest that, while some activity can be driven by licking in naïve animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), motor output alone is not the central determinant of Cspk activity in Crus II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–L</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we sought an additional approach to test whether movement contributes to the cue-associated, post-learning Cspk responses in LS, Crus I and Crus II. While we have demonstrated that Cspk responses do not correlate with licking, it remains possible that animals exhibit additional conditioned responses that are uncorrelated with licking. We thus used a piezoelectric sensor positioned under the animal to detect body movements during a subset of our post-learning imaging sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This sensor is extremely sensitive to the smallest movements, even registering the animals’ breathing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Specifically, in LS and Crus II, Cspk responses emerged as a function of learning to a cue that predicted upcoming reward. In Crus I, while a sensory-evoked Cspk response to the visual cue was already evident in naïve animals, this response was enhanced once the cue had been associated with upcoming reward. Hence, in all three areas, there was a learned Cspk response related to reward prediction. Cspk responses also exhibited significant differences across areas. In LS, the response to expected reward was largely lost after learning, but was pronounced when reward was delivered unexpectedly. In Crus I, while there was no reward response in naïve animals, a Cspk response to unexpected reward emerged only after the animals established an expectation of reward delivery in response to the visual cue. Finally, in Crus II, reward responses persisted across learning, even after a separate Cspk response emerged to the reward-predictive visual cue. The post-learning Cspk response to unexpected reward was enhanced, however, as compared to trials when reward was expected.</p><p>Together, these common, learned responses to a reward-predictive cue and to unexpected reward indicate that all three areas exhibit Cspk responses related to reward prediction. Such commonalities suggest a broad role for the lateral cerebellum in reward-based learning. The differences in responses, however, also suggest that learned changes in each area are overlaid on the unique sensory and motor Cspk signals pre-existing in each region. Thus, these data also indicate that the lateral cerebellum can harness other distinct sensory and motor signals across each area for different forms of sensorimotor learning, and perhaps to utilize alternate learning strategies that depend on task requirements.</p><p>Indeed, previous work supports the idea that LS, Crus I and Crus II may each have multiple functions, as they receive a diverse range of inputs, and have been implicated in both motor and non-motor behaviors.

This combination of sensory and motor input has been suggested to enable integration that allows the lateral cerebellum to modulate voluntary behaviors though output to the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Proville et al., 2014</xref>). However, these lateral cerebellar regions have also been implicated in non-motor behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deverett et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schmahmann et al., 2019</xref>), and with cognitive deficits such as autism spectrum disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Such contributions to cognitive processes may be enabled by connectivity from these cerebellar regions to downstream targets such as the anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badura et al., 2018</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McAfee et al., 2019</xref>) and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>). In combination, this apparent complexity of connectivity and function suggests that correlations between neural activity and discrete behavioral parameters in absence of additional information about behavioral state or task goals may be insufficient to infer how these regions contribute to behavior.</p><p>In this study, cue and reward-associated Cspk responses could be clearly distinguished from motor responses due to licking or other movement in all three areas, as the timing or amount of licking did not correlate with Cspk responses, nor did overall movement as measured piezoelectric sensor. In a previous study, we identified a subset of lick-responsive PC dendrites after learning in area LS, and we concluded that such Cspk responses were learned and related to reward expectation rather than motor output per se (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>). Here, by imaging naïve animals, we were able to demonstrate no significant lick response in absence of learning in area LS and Crus I, consistent with previous reports indicating Cspk responses to licking are localized primarily to Crus II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>). Also in agreement with these data, we did observe a significant Cspk response to licking in Crus II in naïve animals. Interestingly, however, once the association between visual cue and reward had been established, licking during the ITI when no reward was possible failed to produce Cspk activity. These data suggest that even in areas with motor related signals, Cspk responses are more complex than was previously appreciated. While earlier studies investigating Cspk responses to licking did not disambiguate the roles of motor output, reward, and reward expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaffield et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Welsh et al., 1995</xref>), we suggest that such efforts are crucial to understanding the role Cspk signals in cerebellar learning.</p><p>This study is part of a growing literature suggesting new roles for climbing fiber signals that are distinct from classical error-based supervised learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kitazawa et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kostadinov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Streng et al., 2017</xref>). In a previous study, we identified Cspk activity consistent with an unsigned reinforcement learning rule in an operant conditioning task after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we measured Cspk activity both before and after learning in a task with different requirements, and found responses that showed many similarities but also significant differences in Cspk activity. In both tasks, we observed Cspk responses to an event that predicted upcoming reward. However, in the current study, Cspk activity was linked to a visual cue that predicted reward delivery, whereas previously we observed Cspk activity linked to an arm movement that was required to produce reward delivery. Indeed, a key difference between our previous operant task and the classical conditioning task studied here is that animals do not affect trial outcome with their motor output in this task. Specifically, while animals learn to lick earlier after learning in this task, a change in lick timing is not required for reward delivery, and there is no consequence for licks occurring with ‘correct’ or ‘incorrect’ timing (i.e. correctly or incorrectly matching the time of reward delivery). Hence, we speculate that observed differences in Cspk activity across tasks are related to the distinct sensory input and motor output that predicts reward delivery. In this task, the reward-predictive event was a visual cue alone. Previously, however, despite a visual cue that instructed arm movement, correct execution of the movement was required for reward delivery, and this action was therefore the necessary predictor of task outcome. In support of a role for task-specific movement requirements is shaping instructional signals, in the mesolimbic dopamine system it has been shown with a similar operant task that dopamine release is governed by correct movement initiation, and not simply reward prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Syed et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Another notable difference from our previous work is that we do not observe clear reward omission responses in this task. While it is unclear why such responses are absent in the current task, we again speculate that such responses may only be generated when movement is required to determine task outcome. In neither task, however, did we observe decreases in Cspk activity at the time when reward was expected on reward omission trials. Thus, we have not observed any evidence of signed, negative prediction errors in Cspk activity. These results contrast with a recent eyeblink conditioning study that used an aversive stimulus to drive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohmae and Medina, 2015</xref>), and further suggests a key role for task parameters in establishing the specific features of Cspk responses. Another possibility is suggested by the mesolimbic dopamine system, where neurons have different response profiles depending on their striatal projection target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Menegas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parker et al., 2016</xref>). It thus remains possible that climbing fibers also exhibit an analogous target-specific response variability, and signal diverse reward-related information such as negative prediction errors in other regions of the cerebellum. Lastly, recent measurements of VTA dopamine neuron responses have revealed that increased firing to reward can persist after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coddington and Dudman, 2018</xref>), similar to what we observe in Crus II. In those experiments, negative prediction errors did emerge eventually, but only very late in training, indicating that over-training can be required for omission responses to develop.</p><p>Finally, in this study we have measured Cspk responses across learning, thus revealing how Cspk activity shifts from reward-related responses to responses driven by reward predictive cues in the same animals. While we cannot rule out a contribution of sensory gating due to arousal, these data are most consistent with Cspks representing learned reward predictions. These data also suggest that the same climbing fibers can adjust their responses as a function of learning, and can signal diverse reward expectation information (i.e. both reward-predicting cues and unexpected reward in the same climbing fibers). These learned, reward-predictive climbing fiber signals are ideally suited to instruct both cerebellar learning and modulation of reward processing in downstream brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chabrol et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, a recent study has demonstrated that output from the lateral cerebellum via the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) forms a monosynaptic, excitatory connection onto dopamine neurons in the VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carta et al., 2019</xref>). Activating these DCN projections is sufficient to positively modulate reward-driven behaviors, and these same projections are endogenously active under social conditions. These data strongly suggest that the cerebellum must contain, or have the ability to learn, information about rewarding stimuli. While speculative, such a model fits well with the observations made here. Specifically, we have shown Cspk instructional signals can become associated with stimuli that predict reward. If combined with contextual information from the mossy fiber pathway, such Cspk signals would be effective in instructing plasticity to depress Purkinje cell output and thereby enable DCN output to the VTA in response to any new, earlier reward-associated stimuli or actions. Hence, a key next step will be to evaluate the intersection of cerebellar learning with cerebellar output to the mesolimbic dopamine system during behavior. For the present, the patterns of Cspk activity demonstrated here provide key information about how instructional signals carried by cerebellar climbing fibers can change as a function of learning to signal reward expectation across the lateral cerebellum.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All experimental procedures using animals were carried out with the approval of the Duke University Animal Care and Use Committee.

Surgical procedures were performed under anesthesia, using an initial dose of ketamine/xylazine (50 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg) 5 min prior to surgery and sustained during surgery with 1.0–2.0% isoflurane. Toe pinches and breathing were used to monitor anesthesia levels throughout surgeries. Body temperature was maintained using a heating pad (TC-1000 CWE Inc). Custom-made titanium headplates (HE Parmer) were secured to the skull using Metabond (Parkell). For imaging experiments, a 3 mm diameter craniotomy was made over the lobule simplex at approximately 1.4 mm lateral and 2.8 mm posterior to lambda or crus I and II at approximately 3.0 mm lateral and 4.3 mm posterior to lambda. Glass cover slips consisting of two 3 mm bonded to a 5 mm coverslip (Warner Instruments No. 1) with index matched adhesive (Norland No. 1) were secured in the craniotomy using Metabond. Buprenex (0.05 mg/kg) and cefazolin (50 mg/kg) were administered following surgery twice a day for two days. Following a minimum of 4 recovery days, animals were water deprived for 3 days, or until body weight stabilized at 85% of initial weight, and were habituated to head restraint (3–5 days) prior to behavioral training.</p><p>For imaging experiments involving viral expression of GCaMP (all non-Ai148 animals), the glass cover slip was removed following behavioral training, and mice were injected (WPI UMP3) with AAV1.CAG.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40 (UPenn vector core, titer = 1.48×10<sup>13</sup> or 7.60 × 10<sup>12</sup>). 150 nL virus diluted 1:1-1:5 in ACSF was injected at a rate of 30 nl/min and a depth of 150 μm at 1–3 sites in dorsal lobule simplex.

Animals were trained to associate a visual cue with a saccharine reward. A high contrast vertical black and white grating was present at all times, including the inter-trial interval (ITI; 24–30 s), except when the reward cue was presented. The reward cue consisted of a horizontal grating, presented for 100 ms, and followed reward delivery after a 500 ms delay (600 ms from cue onset)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>).

Imaging sessions lasted an average of 63.0 ± 1.2 min and consisted of 128.5 ± 2.5 trials (n = 71 sessions). For reward omission sessions, 20% of randomly determined trials were unrewarded. For unexpected reward sessions, no reward cue was presented on 20% of randomly determined trials. Behavioral parameters including cue presentation, reward delivery, and licking were monitored using Mworks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mworks-project.org">http://mworks-project.org</ext-link>) and custom software written in MATLAB (Mathworks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heffley, 2019</xref>).

Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected within LS according to the pattern of GCaMP expression. Window location and the lobule identity were identified according to folia patterns visible through the cranial window, landmarks recorded during surgery, and post-hoc histology. Baseline fluorescence (F) was measured on a trial-by-trial basis during the ITI as the mean F between 900 and 200 ms before trial initiation. Normalized fluorescence (ΔF/F) was calculated according to the cumulative activity within an ROI. ΔF/F latency was measured by first finding the peak ΔF/F response following cue onset averaged across trials. Next, the latency was measured as the time when mean ΔF/F trace achieved a maximum rate of change (the peak of the first derivative) in a 500 ms window preceding the identified peak ΔF/F response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Two-photon imaging</title><p>Motion in the X and Y planes was corrected by sub-pixel image registration. No data were excluded (after collection, see above) due to z-axis motion (assessed in each experiment by reviewing the trial averaged, cue aligned movie after X-Y motion correction). To isolate signals from individual PC dendrites, we utilized principal component analysis (PCA) followed by independent component analysis (ICA). Final dendrite segmentation was achieved by thresholding the smoothed spatial filters from ICA. A binary mask was created by combining highly correlated pixels (correlation coefficient &gt;0.8) and removing any overlapped regions between segmented dendrites. Notably, image segmentation using these criteria did not extract PC soma, which were clearly visible in some two-photon imaging experiments. Fluorescence changes (ΔF) were normalized to a window of baseline fluorescence (F) between 500 ms and 100 ms preceding trial initiation. One experiment was excluded from analysis based on single trial ΔF/F values that were more than double the amplitude of any other experiment, according to the rationale that any increases in Cspk activity during learning could be obscured by indicator saturation.</p><p>To extract events corresponding to Cspks, the first derivative of the raw fluorescence trace was thresholded at 1.7 standard deviations from baseline. Events above this threshold were variable in amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, also described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heffley et al., 2018</xref>). Previous work has demonstrated that calcium transient amplitude variability reflects the properties of climbing fiber input, and not a combined climbing fiber and parallel fiber signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaffield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaffield et al., 2018</xref>). All events separated by at least one frame were included. The pre-reward window was defined as the 600 ms between the cue and the reward delivery; the post-reward window was defined as the 600 ms following reward (or the time of expected reward). Peak spike rates for individual PC dendrites were defined by first identifying the peak spike rate in the mean peri-stimulus histogram (PSTH) across all PC dendrites within either the Pre- or Post-reward window. Next, this peak was used to define a 100 ms analysis window centered on the peak, to calculate spike rate. To identify PC dendrites responsive at the time of this peak, we selected only those PC dendrites with a peak response at least one standard deviation above their pre-cue baseline activity. To determine whether responses were significant across the population, we compared the responses of all PC dendrites at the time of the peak in the PSTH to a peak found in a 1200 ms window during the baseline and performed a one-tailed t-test across PC dendrites.</p><p>To identify PC dendrites that were responsive to task events (i.e. visual cue or reward), we selected PC dendrites with spike rates that were elevated one standard deviation above the pre-cue period for two consecutive frames in the pre- or post-reward windows. To identify PC dendrites that were suppressed following expected reward, we selected PC dendrites with spike rates that were suppressed one standard deviation below both their pre-cue and pre-reward firing rates for two consecutive frames during the post-reward window. These criteria selected a very small number of dendrites, which upon inspection, revealed no clear suppression associated with the time of expected reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Single licks during the ITI (separated by at least 250 ms from other licks) were used to generate lick triggered averages; only experiments with at least four licks were included for this analysis. Peaks in the lick triggered average were identified within a window spanning five frames centered on the lick. Significance was calculated by comparing the amplitude of this peak with two frames 250 ms before the lick and two frames 250 ms after the lick. To segregate trials according to lick times, on each trial we identified the first lick bout (at least 3 licks within 300 ms) following the cue, and separated trials into quartiles according to lick latency.</p><p>To track single PC dendrites across imaging sessions, we first independently generated pixel masks for PC dendrites from each field of view. We then motion registered the mean fluorescence image from the post-learning session to the pre-learning session, and applied the same pixel shifts from this registration to the segmented pixel masks from the post-learning condition. By overlaying the shifted post-learning pixel masks with the pre-learning masks, we assessed the overlap between imaging days. We employed a stringent criterion of greater than 50% overlap to increase the probability of accurately identifying the same PC dendrites across imaging sessions. With these criteria, we identified a group of PC dendrites likely corresponding to the same neurons before and after learning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Additional statistics</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M., unless stated otherwise.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Talia Lerner (Reviewer #1); Isabel Llano (Reviewer #2); Kamran Khodakhah (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Through the study of climbing fibre calcium activity before and after a learning task, this work aims to study how cerebellar learning contributes to the acquisition of a reward-driven behaviour. The work is timely, since recent evidence indicates that the cerebellar circuit intervenes in behaviours that have an &quot;emotional&quot; and/ or &quot;cognitive&quot; content. The authors used single and two photon calcium imaging, as a proxy for neuronal activity, to examine the response of the cerebellar cortex and individual Purkinje cells in behaviors typically used to explore classical conditioning and reward processing in the reward circuitry. In their 2P imaging studies, they explored complex spike-evoked calcium signals in the dendrites of Purkinje cells. Depending of the specific cerebellar region imaged, calcium signals from complex spikes (Cspk) are active either while the animal learns to associate a visual cue with a reward or once the association is accomplished. The key conclusion is that the Cspks primarily signaled reward prediction, rather than reward prediction error, and hence the Cspk is not functioning according to the predictions of a classical &quot;temporal difference learning model&quot;.</p><p>Overall, this is rigorous and interesting work. The presentation is generally clear and the conclusions supported by the data and pertaining analysis, with recognition of recent publications pertaining to the aim of the present work. The reviewers are enthusiastic, but would like to see a few issues addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers acknowledged the technical difficulty of these experiments, yet felt the number of animals seemed insufficient in some cases, with less than three animals in some sub groups. Increasing the number of animals per group to have meaningful statistical power when all the data from each animal are considered to be an n=1 would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, although information on number of mice used for different regions is given in Materials and methods, there are sections of Results in which it is unclear how many animals are being used in each data set. For example, in the subsection “An appetitive classical conditioning paradigm to investigate climbing fiber responses in the lateral cerebellum”, n = 24, from how many mice?. In the first paragraph of the subsection “Cspk responses in LS signal reward predictions that emerge with learning”, n = 1040 dendrites, from how many mice? In Figures 3, 5, 6 and Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2, the number of repetitions for the averaged traces is given in the panels as n = XX, but from how many dendrites and from how many mice is not stated in the text or Figure legends. For Figure 4 there is no mention of number of repetitions or of the number of animals. For each statistical comparison, the animal number and, when it applies, number of dendrites per animal should be specified in the corresponding section of the main text and/or in the figure legend. This is most important when discussing data from subsets of PC dendrites as in the subsection “The same climbing fibers can respond to reward and a reward-predictive visual cue”, since such results may be derived from a smaller number of animals.</p><p>2) The possibility that the Cspk responses associated with reward prediction are actually driven by licking or other movements made by the mice in anticipation of reward should be more rigorously addressed.</p><p>More extensive analysis of licking would be helpful. The strongest evidence that the Cspk responses are not licking-related was that the shifts in timing for the Cspks and the licks with learning were not aligned. The authors also indicate that the Cspk latencies are not substantially different (30 ms) for trials with the fastest vs. slowest lick latencies. The lick latencies for those samples should also be given, so that the reader can evaluate whether there was sufficient variability in the licking for the lack of variability in the Cspk latency to provide evidence for a dissociation between the two. In addition, although the lick-triggered averages are informative, perhaps isolated licks in the ITI aren't representative of effects that could be observed during more intense licking bouts, hence it may be helpful to look at Cspk latencies in trials with more vs. less intense licking, in addition to the latency analysis.</p><p>A key issue is that it is highly likely that the mice are making a variety of other movements besides licking when they are anticipating a reward, which could potentially drive the Cspk responses. Jorntell et al., 2000 showed short and long-latency Cspk responses to somatosensory stimulation in similar regions of the cerebellum in rats. This might explain why the Cspk responses look more like reward prediction than reward prediction error-- one would not necessarily expect opposite movements (or opposite movement-related climbing fiber responses) for reward cues and omitted rewards. This potential confound should be addressed, ideally with additional experiments or analyses, but at the very minimum with explicit acknowledgement and discussion.</p><p>Finally, the authors should consider whether their observations could be conceived as a general arousal effect rather than specific to reward processing.</p><p>The reviewers recognize that it is difficult to control for all of the possible movements an animal might make when anticipating a reward. Yet there was also concern about the confusion that could be created by labeling signals as reward without more rigorously ruling out potential confounds such as movements or motor reafference.</p><p>3) There are several places where fuller representation and/or analysis of the data would be helpful.</p><p>a) PC dendrites responding to the visual cue after training also respond to unexpected reward in many cases, though not all. Are these the same PC dendrites that responded to reward initially in each area? Are there PC dendrite that respond to unexpected reward but not cues? What are the differences in distributions of how many PC dendrites represent each thing across the different regions? E.g. Do unexpected reward responses only emerge with training in Crus I or is that also happening in subsets of cells in the other areas? It could be helpful to see a statistical criteria established for which dendrites significantly respond to each stimulus, then put those in color on the scatter plots, and maybe have pie charts to show distributions of responsive neurons in each of the different cerebellar areas.</p><p>b) The amplitude and the variability of the calcium signals is not discussed. Statistics on the mean peak DF/Fo value for pooled data before and after learning would be useful. Even is this parameter is not used in the present work, it may be of value for other studies. In the figures, the sem of the averaged calcium traces could be shown along with the mean trace. Moreover, the authors should address the issue of how the non-linearity of the calcium signals may affect the interpretation of Results.</p><p>c) The authors also find that in a number of Purkinje cells the complex spikes change the nature of the information that encode. The reviewer felt that these data were not analyzed as extensively as possible (perhaps because of the relatively small number of animals and identified cells), to explore whether there is anything special or different about these Purkinje cells in terms of spatial distribution (lobules, sub lobules, or zebrin bands), and temporal progression.</p><p>4) The Discussion should be expanded to consider how previous knowledge of the function of these regions of the cerebellum can inform the interpretation of the current results.</p><p>What is the significance of LS, Crus I and Crus II? What were the previously known distinctions between them that caused the authors to compare and contrast?</p><p>In Carta et al., 2019, it's not clear where within the cerebellum monosynaptic inputs to the VTA arise. Would the signals the authors observe here actually be setup to control output to the VTA? This seems like a key question to resolve a bit more given the stated purpose and takehome message of the work.</p><p>Wagner et al., 2017 looked at granule cells over simplex, V, VIa, VIb. How does this align with the authors' observations here?

Increasing the number of animals per group to have meaningful statistical power when all the data from each animal are considered to be an n=1 would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, although information on number of mice used for different regions is given in Materials and methods, there are sections of Results in which it is unclear how many animals are being used in each data set. For example, in the subsection “An appetitive classical conditioning paradigm to investigate climbing fiber responses in the lateral cerebellum”, n = 24, from how many mice?. In the first paragraph of the subsection “Cspk responses in LS signal reward predictions that emerge with learning”, n = 1040 dendrites, from how many mice? In Figures 3, 5, 6 and Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2, the number of repetitions for the averaged traces is given in the panels as n = XX, but from how many dendrites and from how many mice is not stated in the text or Figure legends. For Figure 4 there is no mention of number of repetitions or of the number of animals. For each statistical comparison, the animal number and, when it applies, number of dendrites per animal should be specified in the corresponding section of the main text and/or in the figure legend. This is most important when discussing data from subsets of PC dendrites as in the subsection “The same climbing fibers can respond to reward and a reward-predictive visual cue”, since such results may be derived from a smaller number of animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that animal numbers were previously low for our Crus I and II experiments, and that our reporting of animal and dendrite numbers was not sufficiently detailed. Thus, we have now performed additional experiments in Crus I and II to bolster the number of animals and dendrites from these sessions (each of these experiments now has a minimum of 5 animals). Moreover, within the Results section, each experiment now references both the number of animals and the number of dendrites contributing to each measurement. In addition, we have also added the range of dendrites per animal contributing to each experiment in the Materials and methods section (subsection “Two-Photon Imaging”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The possibility that the Cspk responses associated with reward prediction are actually driven by licking or other movements made by the mice in anticipation of reward should be more rigorously addressed.</p><p>More extensive analysis of licking would be helpful. The strongest evidence that the Cspk responses are not licking-related was that the shifts in timing for the Cspks and the licks with learning were not aligned. The authors also indicate that the Cspk latencies are not substantially different (30 ms) for trials with the fastest vs. slowest lick latencies. The lick latencies for those samples should also be given, so that the reader can evaluate whether there was sufficient variability in the licking for the lack of variability in the Cspk latency to provide evidence for a dissociation between the two. In addition, although the lick-triggered averages are informative, perhaps isolated licks in the ITI aren't representative of effects that could be observed during more intense licking bouts, hence it may be helpful to look at Cspk latencies in trials with more vs. less intense licking, in addition to the latency analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a new analysis to evaluate a possible role for licking intensity in our Cspk responses: Specifically, as suggested, we have selected trials with the highest and lowest lick rates (measured starting at the time of the visual cue), and compared Cspk responses across these trial types. We find no relationship between the intensity of licking and the pre-reward Cspk responses in any of the three imaged lobules (Figures 3, 5 and 6, panel J). For these experiments, we have reported lick rates in the figure legends to illustrate the separability of our “high” and “low” lick rate categories. We have also added quantification of lick timing for the “early” and “late” lick categories to the figure legends as requested. We note that lick timing was previously plotted on panel F in Figures 3, 5 and 6 with S.E.M. However, these points were somewhat small, and may have been difficult to discern. We have thus made the lick latency points larger, and labeled them on the figure to better illustrate the separability of “early” vs. “late” lick categories (Figures 3, 5, and 6 panel I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A key issue is that it is highly likely that the mice are making a variety of other movements besides licking when they are anticipating a reward, which could potentially drive the Cspk responses. Jorntell et al., 2000 showed short and long-latency Cspk responses to somatosensory stimulation in similar regions of the cerebellum in rats. This might explain why the Cspk responses look more like reward prediction than reward prediction error-- one would not necessarily expect opposite movements (or opposite movement-related climbing fiber responses) for reward cues and omitted rewards. This potential confound should be addressed, ideally with additional experiments or analyses, but at the very minimum with explicit acknowledgement and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an extremely important point, and one that we felt required a new experimental approach to more rigorously test whether some other conditioned movement (apart from licking) might explain the pre-reward Cspks that occur after learning. Thus, we have integrated a piezoelectric movement sensor into the animals’ behavioral apparatus. This sensor is exquisitely sensitive to even the smallest movements (for example, we find that it provides a reliable measure of mouse breathing). This setup has allowed us to collect a continuous record of animal movement during our experiments. Using this system, we have performed new imaging experiments and added the results to a new Figure 7 (Results subsection “Crus I and Crus II exhibit reward-related Cspk responses that are distinct from area LS”, last paragraph). When trials are sorted according to the most and least movement, we find that the learned, pre-reward Cspk response is independent of movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors should consider whether their observations could be conceived as a general arousal effect rather than specific to reward processing.</p></disp-quote><p>It would indeed be interesting if Cspk responses could be gated by the arousal state of the animal. However, in our view this is an unlikely explanation for the changes we have measured in prereward Cspks across learning, as animals are not disengaged on the first day of training. On Day 1, naïve water deprived animals are significantly aroused when they are receiving bouts of unexpected reward for the first time. However, because we do not have any specific measure of arousal such as pupil tracking to support this claim, we have added a statement to the Discussion indicating the possibility of arousal in contributing to the Cspk responses measured here (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers recognize that it is difficult to control for all of the possible movements an animal might make when anticipating a reward. Yet there was also concern about the confusion that could be created by labeling signals as reward without more rigorously ruling out potential confounds such as movements or motor reafference.</p></disp-quote><p>By incorporating a piezoelectric movement sensor into our measurements, we have endeavored to provide as rigorous a test as we could devise to evaluate this issue. In our view, the results of these experiments, along with more extensive quantification of licking, make reafference or sensory feedback from movement an unlikely explanation for the learned Cspk responses we have measured.</p><p>However, we agree that conclusively disambiguating sensory and movement signals is extremely challenging, and it is always possible that there are movements we still cannot detect. We hope that our new experiments and discussion of movement (Discussion) will provide a sufficiently balanced perspective, and serve to mitigate potential confusion in interpreting our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are several places where fuller representation and/or analysis of the data would be helpful.</p><p>a) PC dendrites responding to the visual cue after training also respond to unexpected reward in many cases, though not all. Are these the same PC dendrites that responded to reward initially in each area? Are there PC dendrite that respond to unexpected reward but not cues? What are the differences in distributions of how many PC dendrites represent each thing across the different regions? E.g. Do unexpected reward responses only emerge with training in Crus I or is that also happening in subsets of cells in the other areas? It could be helpful to see a statistical criteria established for which dendrites significantly respond to each stimulus, then put those in color on the scatter plots, and maybe have pie charts to show distributions of responsive neurons in each of the different cerebellar areas.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that more extensive characterization of Cspk responses on different trial types before and after learning would be useful. Thus, we have added several pie charts to Figures 3, 5 and 6 to illustrate how PC dendrites respond to: The visual cue and unexpected reward after learning (inset for panel G), and the visual cue and reward delivery before and after learning (panels K and L). We have also added a new panel to Figure 4J to directly show firing rates of the same neurons to reward on Day 1 and the visual cue after learning. Statistical criteria for responsivity are described in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The amplitude and the variability of the calcium signals is not discussed. Statistics on the mean peak DF/Fo value for pooled data before and after learning would be useful. Even is this parameter is not used in the present work, it may be of value for other studies. In the figures, the sem of the averaged calcium traces could be shown along with the mean trace. Moreover, the authors should address the issue of how the non-linearity of the calcium signals may affect the interpretation of Results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added raw DF/F traces from example cells (taken from the same animal within each figure) to Figures 3, 5 and 6 showing the first 50 rewarded trials and the average of those trials. To visualize the variability in DF/F, we have added a supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) quantifying the dF/F amplitude in the time windows before and after reward for both Pre and Post-learning sessions across all areas for all measured dendrites.</p><p>With the analysis approaches we have used, it is not clear what effect calcium transient or indicator non-linearities would have on our interpretations. By thresholding the DF/F traces to generated binarized spiking, we have restricted our interpretation to whether or not an event occurred at any given timepoint, regardless of variation in amplitude. Cspk Ca transients are extremely large, and well separated in time on a single trial basis (as documented previously in Heffley et al., 2018). Thus, there is little chance of missing events due to differences in indicator expression across cells or working in the sublinear range of the indicator. Moreover, previous work has suggested that there is little reason to suspect indicator saturation is a concern for brief bursts of complex spikes in awake mice (Gaffield et al., 2019). Certainly, responses diminish during bursts, and we cannot detect unique events unless they are separated by at least one frame (30 ms). However, these issues do not significantly complicate our approach of binary event detection, nor should they significantly alter our measures of mean event timing in these experiments.</p><p>Regarding calcium transient non-linearities, recent work has made clear that no contribution of parallel fiber input can be detected with these approaches (parallel fiber input does not enhance the Cspk response unless inhibition is blocked, and parallel fiber input cannot be detected when there is no Cspk) (Gaffield et al., 2018, Gaffield et al., 2019). We are well aware that combined Cspk and parallel fiber input can produce calcium non-linearities under some conditions, but it would appear that such non-linearities that have been measured in vitro at the level of spines may either not occur broadly across the dendritic shaft, or not be detectable with the global, in vivo dendritic calcium measurements that we and others have performed (at least when synaptic inhibition from MLIs remains intact). We have added a statement of rationale regarding our thresholding approach and its relationship to possible calcium transient non-linearities to the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors also find that in a number of Purkinje cells the complex spikes change the nature of the information that encode. The reviewer felt that these data were not analyzed as extensively as possible (perhaps because of the relatively small number of animals and identified cells), to explore whether there is anything special or different about these Purkinje cells in terms of spatial distribution (lobules, sub lobules, or zebrin bands), and temporal progression.</p></disp-quote><p>A more detailed, within lobule examination of variability across the medio-lateral cerebellar axis is not practical with the current dataset. We do not have a way to reveal zebrin bands during imaging, or label them post-hoc in a way that enables registration to our imaging ROIs. Even in absence of ground truth established by a histological feature such as zebrin staining, the numbers of isolated neurons per experiment in our dataset are not sufficient for further breakdown of subareas (nor is the field of view large enough for such comparisons spanning greater than 200 μm microzones). Such within lobule measurements would indeed make a compelling future study, but lies beyond the scope of what we can accomplish here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion should be expanded to consider how previous knowledge of the function of these regions of the cerebellum can inform the interpretation of the current results.</p><p>What is the significance of LS, Crus I and Crus II? What were the previously known distinctions between them that caused the authors to compare and contrast?</p></disp-quote><p>The rodent lateral cerebellum remains poorly understood in terms of both function and detailed anatomical projections. Each of these areas has been implicated in non-motor function and cognitive processes, and therefore our motivation was simply to assess how climbing fiber driven instructional signals in these areas respond in a reward-association task that does not require motor output to influence task outcome. Ideally, we would have also tested even more lateral areas, but our imaging approach only provides access to the lateral areas we have tested.</p><p>We have now included a new section in the Discussion to highlight what is known about these areas and better contextualize our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Carta et al., 2019, it's not clear where within the cerebellum monosynaptic inputs to the VTA arise. Would the signals the authors observe here actually be setup to control output to the VTA? This seems like a key question to resolve a bit more given the stated purpose and takehome message of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>It is our working hypothesis that a climbing fiber signal driven by a reward-predictive cue could serve to drive Purkinje cell LTD for any temporally-associated context carried by the parallel fibers. If so, this would enable cerebellar output (DCN spiking) in response to a context where reward is likely, and accordingly generate an excitatory input to the VTA like those measured by Carta et al. We have described this model in the last paragraph of the Discussion. However, in absence of more direct evidence for such a model, we cannot push further than this general hypothesis with support from our current data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Wagner et al., 2017 looked at granule cells over simplex, V, VIa, VIb. How does this align with the authors' observations here? Would the granule cells Wagner recorded also send inputs to the same PC dendrites the authors are interested in?</p></disp-quote><p>We view the signals recorded by Wagner as additional information that can be pooled by the granule cells to form complex sensory, motor, and contextual representations that can be learned by Purkinje cells. We view climbing fiber signals differently; namely, because they are instructional, we view them as a way to infer the learning rules implemented by the cerebellum. Our work suggests an extension to the error-based supervised learning rules that have typically been described in other types of behaviors. In other words, we view climbing fiber signals as way to understand how the cerebellum learns, and the granule cell responses as a way to understand what can be learned.</p><p>Importantly, in Wagner et al., reward prediction was one of many features the granule cells encoded, along with other task features (such as motor information). We thus find it unlikely that Purkinje cells would receive a confluence of the same information from granule cells and climbing fibers in such tasks. The Wagner data suggests that reward information is pooled with other sensorimotor information in the granule cell layer in order to establish unique contexts that can be learned by Purkinje cells (perhaps according to the reinforcement learning rules implied by our experiments). Apart from such distinctions, we do not have meaningful hypotheses about what it would mean if the Wagner granule cells impinge on the Heffley Purkinje cells, or what features of cerebellar learning would be conferred if the Wagner granule cells impinge on Heffley Purkinje cells in LS vs. Crus I vs. Crus II.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main difference between this manuscript and the authors' previously published work (that is emphasized by the authors themselves) is the difference between Pavlovian vs. instrumental learning. This is an important distinction, but raises the question of whether the implication of this work (coupled with the authors' evidence that much of this reward signaling is motor-independent) is that the Cspk responses observed are used primarily for driving motor-independent Pavlovian associations? Are they interfacing with motor information in some other part of the circuit?</p></disp-quote><p>These are great questions, and we do not have experimental evidence to answer them at this point. The differences in Cspk responses between this task and our previous operant task occur primarily when reward is omitted. It is possible that the difference between tasks on omission trials reflects a difference between signaling reward prediction and reward prediction error, and that reward prediction error is only necessary in the motor domain. However, it also remains possible that we simply did not observe reward prediction error signals on omission trials in this study because we measured responses immediately after learning. We are now beginning to test whether robust omission responses depend on training history or duration of training, as has been suggested by the dopamine literature. To fully explore these issues will require a future study, as this is a ‘next-step’ question that will require significant new experimental effort.</p><p>There are also many features of Cspk signaling that are shared between paradigms, and we speculate that the learned, reward-predictive Cspk responses that are common between this task and our previous task could serve to instruct LTD and thus cerebellar output for any granule cell input that is co-active. Such inputs could carry motor or non-motor contextual information. Thus, how these signals are used would depend on what is carried by the granule cells, as well as what output pathway is engaged (where the co-active granule cell inputs occur). We thus think it is possible that the learned, cue-predictive Cspk responses could enable both motor and non-motor associations that are reward predictive. In our view, the wide distribution of these signals across the lateral cerebellum supports such a hypothesis. We have now amended the Discussion to highlight what is known about such inputs and outputs across the lateral cerebellum, and to provide a basis for what these climbing fibers signals might enable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
