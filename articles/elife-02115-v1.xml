The sensitivity and chemical range of animal olfactory systems is remarkable, enabling animals to detect and discriminate between thousands of different odor molecules. Although there is a striking evolutionary convergence towards a conserved organization of signaling pathways in vertebrate and invertebrate olfactory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hildebrand and Shepherd, 1997</xref>), the involved receptor gene families evolved independently. The molecular identity of olfactory receptors was first unraveled in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>). In mammals, as many as 1000 heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (or G protein)-coupled receptors are considered to be employed in olfactory discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck and Axel, 1991</xref>). A similar number of chemoreceptors, with about 1300 receptor genes and 400 pseudogenes, have been hypothesized for <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Robertson and Thomas, 2006</xref>)<italic>.</italic></p><p>All data on insect olfactory receptors are based on studies investigating the neopteran insects (overview of insect order relationship is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The identity of receptors involved in olfaction in the evolutionarily more ancient apterygote insects (Archaeognatha, Zygentoma) and paleopteran insects (Odonata and Ephemeroptera) is thus completely unknown. In neopteran insects (Polyneoptera, Paraneoptera, and Holometabola) most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family (ORs). ORs are multitransmembrane domain proteins unrelated to nematode or vertebrate olfactory receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mombaerts, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robertson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2002</xref>), displaying a distinct membrane topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6a">Benton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lundin et al., 2007</xref>). The number of functional OR genes varies from 10 in the human body louse <italic>Pediculus humanus humanus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkness et al., 2010</xref>) to about 60 in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao and Chess, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vosshall et al., 1999</xref>) and up to 350 OR genes in ants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). ORs have been suggested to be distantly related to the gustatory receptors of arthropods, with some proteins containing a signature motif in the carboxyl terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scott et al., 2001</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02115.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hexapodan phylogeny.</title><p>Phylogeny was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trautwein et al.

Interestingly, while Orco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vosshall and Hansson, 2011</xref>) is highly conserved among insects, the sequences of other olfactory receptor genes exhibit very little sequence similarity even within the same insect order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krieger et al., 2003</xref>), complicating their identification. So far, Orco homologues have been identified in Lepidoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krieger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pitts et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smadja et al., 2009</xref>), and Orthoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Neither Orco nor ORs are present in the genome of the crustacean <italic>Daphnia pulex</italic>, indicating that ORs are insect specific. However, GRs were found in Crustacea, just as in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peñalva-Arana et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A second receptor family, the variant ionotropic glutamate receptors (IRs), is also involved in insect chemosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benton et al., 2009</xref>). IRs act in combinations of up to three subunits; individual odor-specific receptors and one or two of the broadly expressed coreceptors IR25a, IR8a, and IR76b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abuin et al., 2011</xref>). IRs are present in olfactory tissues across the Protostomia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Croset et al., 2010</xref>), for example two conserved members of this group were described in the <italic>Daphnia</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Croset et al., 2010</xref>) and the coreceptor IR25a homologue is expressed in many, if not all mature OSNs of the American lobster <italic>Homarus americanus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hollins et al., 2003</xref>) and the spiny lobster <italic>Panulirus argus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tadesse et al., 2011</xref>). Since crustaceans are the closest relatives of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedrich and Tautz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boore et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Regier et al., 2010</xref>), IRs are most likely the ancient type of insect olfactory receptor.</p><p>But when and why did insect ORs evolve? Hexapods derived from an aquatic crustacean ancestor, probably in the Early Ordovician, approximately 483 mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rota-Stabelli et al., 2013</xref>). The transition from sea to land meant that molecules needed to be detected in gas phase instead of aquatic solution. Therefore, the olfactory system of a hexapod ancestor had to adapt to the terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile, air-borne chemicals. One proposed hypothesis has been that Orco and ORs of the insect type are an adaptation to this terrestrial lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robertson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krång et al., 2012</xref>). To reconstruct an evolutionary scenario for insect ORs, we investigated species belonging to different ancient insect orders, including Archaeognatha (jumping bristletails) and Zygentoma (silverfishes and firebrats), and a neopteran insect belonging to the Phasmatodea (leaf and stick insects) as so far not analyzed control group using morphological, electrophysiological and molecular techniques.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our first step was to analyze the evolutionary ancestry of the insect olfactory system by assessing its complexity in each of three non-holometabolan insects.</p><p>To correlate OSN responses with type of sensillum (with pores and grooves) identified in SEM studies of the antennae, we investigated the morphological and physiological characteristics of olfactory sensilla and their olfactory sensory neurons.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Morphology and physiology</title><p>On the antennae of <italic>L. y-signata</italic> the only putative olfactory sensilla were porous olfactory basiconic sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–E</xref>).

Responses to all tested chemical classes of odors, including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, esters, and ketones, were recorded from OSNs housed in these sensilla using the single sensillum recoding measurements (SSR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, uppermost heat map). Based on the response profile, spontaneous activity, and colocalization inside the same sensillum, we identified 12 OSN types, present in five functional basiconic sensillum types. Out of the 12 OSN types, only seven responded to odors tested; two exclusively to acids, while five responded with a similar activity rate to acids or amines and to other odors. OSNs belonging to this second class were broadly tuned and exhibited relatively low spiking activity. In general, OSN classes displayed a low baseline activity with about 1 to 7 spikes/s, with Lys-ab2A that had a spontaneous activity of more than 25 spikes/s as the only exception. Only rarely was an increase in spiking rate of more than 60 spikes per second recorded, even for the best identified ligands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). No responses were obtained for ammonia or pyridine. Coeloconic-like sensilla, s-shaped trichoid sensilla, and chaetic sensilla did not display any morphological features indicating olfactory function and did also not respond to any odor tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Missbach et al., 2011</xref>; data not shown). In conclusion, 7 OSN types that were all housed in basiconic sensilla responded to a wide spectrum of odor molecules.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02115.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Olfactory sensilla on the antennae of <italic>L. y-signata</italic> (A–E), <italic>T. domestica</italic> (F–I) and <italic>P. siccifolium</italic> (K–O).</title><p>Animals are depicted next to the corresponding antennal SEM images.

Five different functional types of olfactory sensilla were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: three porous, two grooved <italic>s. basiconica</italic>, the latter are indicated by blue caption). In contrast to <italic>L. y-signata</italic>, a nascent functional and spatial separation of the detection of amines and acids, and ketones and alcohols appeared in <italic>T. domestica</italic>. The former primarily elicited responses in OSNs of grooved sensilla, while less polar ones were mainly detected by porous sensilla. However, most of the OSNs in porous sensilla exhibited broad tuning and responded to at least one of the tested acids or amines as well.</p><p>We then turned to a neopteran insect. Unlike the other analyzed species, the leaf insect <italic>P. siccifolium</italic> displayed a strong sexual antennal dimorphism, with males having very long antennae covered with trichoid sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), and the females very short antennae without trichoid sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). In comparison to the wingless insects, the response repertoire of the leaf insect was much more diverse, with a total of 23 different functional sensillum types as identified by SSR recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). No responses were obtained from trichoid sensilla, but since they were only present on the male antennae they could be involved in detection of an unknown volatile pheromone. In all cases, reported detection of volatile pheromones in insects is dependent on very specific ORs. Taken together these data suggest that leaf insects have a much broader response repertoire with a higher number of different OSN types than the more basal species we analyzed; apparently the number of olfactory receptors has increased. It also seems likely that at least the leaf insect makes use of ORs in odorant detection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An antennal and maxillary palp transcriptome</title><p>We generated expansive antennal transcriptome datasets of the three insect species, employing a bioinformatics-based approach to identify Orco, ORs, GR, and IRs.

Consequently, we selected insects at crucial positions of the phylogenetic tree with a functional olfactory system adapted to terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile chemicals. This species collection provides an excellent model to study the early evolution of the insect olfactory system.</p><p>To address which receptors are involved in odor detection in these insects and in basal insects in general, we applied several different approaches. Based on our transcriptome data sets, we suggest a stepwise evolution of the Orco/OR complex with Orco having evolved in the lineage of Dicondylia (Zygentoma + Pterygota) and the functional complex of Orco and ORs emerging within the pterygote insects (this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao and Chess, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smadja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vosshall et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robertson and Wanner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kirkness et al., 2010</xref>). Although it is impossible to completely rule out the presence of ORs, none of our extensive experiments led to the identification of either ORs or Orco in the bristletail <italic>L. y-signata</italic>. The well-established conservation of the <italic>Orco</italic> coding gene through evolution suggests that it is highly unlikely that we missed it. We did, however, identify a number of IRs, including the IR coreceptors IR25a, IR8a, and IR76b in the <italic>L. y-signata</italic> antennal transcriptome. FISH allowed us to visualize expression of the IR co-receptors in a large number of OSNs associated with basiconic sensilla. Based on these results we propose that the olfactory system of <italic>L. y-signata</italic> is not based on ORs.</p><p>In insects, different sensillum types house OSNs typically responding to different sets of odors. In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> IRs are the functional receptor type of OSNs in double-walled coeloconic sensilla, and ORs are predominantly expressed in OSNs housed in single-walled basiconic and trichoid sensilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallem et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). It follows that this organization cannot exist with just one sensillum type present, as is the case in Archaeognatha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg and Schmidt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Missbach et al., 2011</xref>) and older hexapod taxa as the Collembola (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altner and Prillinger, 1980</xref>). The oldest insect taxon where double-walled sensilla were investigated is Zygentoma, which have both single-walled basiconic sensilla with pores and double-walled sensilla with spoke channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg and Schmidt, 1997</xref>). Coeloconic sensilla differ dramatically from the single-walled trichoid and basiconic types in both wall structure and in internal environment. The coeloconic structure has been thought to be a prerequisite for IR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the Archaeognatha we find that IRs are most likely located in OSNs of Sensilla basiconica. IRs might thus have evolved in a single-walled sensillum and did not find their modern, coeloconic environment until neopteran insects evolved.</p><p>In the bristletail <italic>L. y-signata,</italic> we found that many of the OSNs are very broadly tuned, responding to volatiles with several different functional groups at higher doses. However, broadly tuned receptors might not have high affinities. By counting and integrating molecules over longer times, OSNs could include even low-probability binding events in generating their response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Firestein, 2001</xref>). This might also mean that the system does not have a high temporal resolution, which seems to be a fair trade-off for a walking insect that lives in its substrate.</p><p>The response spectrum of <italic>Drosophila</italic> IRs is much narrower than the responses we find in the bristletail. If IRs are the only olfactory receptor type in basal insects they should exhibit a broader spectrum of possible ligands, including acids, aldehydes, alcohols, but also esters and ketones, as revealed in our physiological measurements. One additional observation in the bristletail is that many of those neurons have a broad overlap in their response spectra. One hypothesis to explain an IR-based olfactory system in <italic>L. y-signata</italic> would be very broad tuning of single receptors, another that the selectivity of OSNs could be regulated by combinations of different IRs.</p><p>In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, one conserved IR (IR64a) is expressed in different subpopulations of sensilla in the third chamber of the sacculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silbering et al., 2011</xref>). Corresponding OSNs are activated either by free protons or organic acids and many other odors, including esters, alcohols, and ketones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2010</xref>). Expression of this IR together with IR8a is both necessary and sufficient for sensitivity towards organic acids and other odors, but probably requires a different, until now unknown cofactor to mediate the specific response of OSNs to inorganic acids and CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, GR candidates could account for part of the non-neopteran olfactory setup, especially since it has been shown that GRs can add to the olfactory repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tauxe et al., 2013</xref>). Putative contact chemosensory sensilla are highly abundant on the antennae of <italic>L. y-signata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Missbach et al., 2011</xref>) and <italic>T. domestica (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adel, 1984</xref>). Both detection of sugars/amino acids (shown for <italic>T. domestica</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen-Delkeskamp, 2001</xref>) and a proposed contact-pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fröhlich and Lu, 2013</xref>) likely involve GRs, indicating that involvement of the limited set of GRs beyond this scope is unlikely.</p><p>However, these data do not explain the presence of three different Orco variants in the firebrat. So far only one Orco orthologue has been identified in each studied insect species (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krieger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pitts et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smadja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). All <italic>T. domestica</italic> variants were found to be expressed in antennae, suggesting their involvement in chemosensation. TdomOrco3 even has an amino acid exchange of a functional important residue from asparagine to glutamic acid at position 466. This residue was demonstrated as critical for the ion channel function in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, where substitution of D466 with amino acids other than glutamic acid resulted in a substantial reduction in channel activity, but substitution to glutamic acid leads to an increase in sensitivity of the heteromeric receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, this residue is highly conserved across insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>) including two of the three <italic>T. domestica</italic> Orcos (this study).</p><p>While the antennal expression argues for a potential involvement in chemosensation, the existence of three Orco types remains mysterious. It will be part of future studies to investigate if the Orco candidates form heterodimers with other receptors like GRs or with each other to build functional receptors or if they fulfill a channel function in other processes than olfaction.</p><p>Altogether our data suggests that ORs evolved in insects after the emergence of Archaeognatha and Zygentoma, and therefore long after insects transitioned to a terrestrial lifestyle. At the time when flying insects occurred, the vegetation on earth was rapidly spreading and diversifying. ORs might not only increase the diversity of detected chemicals, but also allow the olfactory system to rapidly assess airborne odors. This is especially important for insects for which stimulus contact is very short and a fast response time is critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Getahun et al., 2012</xref>). The oldest flying insect orders Odonta (dragonflies and damselflies) and Ephemeroptera (mayflies) were traditionally considered to be anosmic, lacking both a glomerular antennal lobe and mushroom body calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strausfeld et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farris, 2005</xref>). Recent studies have shown that at least dragonflies have an aerial sense of smell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rebora et al., 2012</xref>). However the small antennae and the low number of olfactory sensilla will make it even more challenging to identify putative ORs and Orco in antennal transcriptomes. ORs were definitely present in the last common ancestor of ‘hemi’- and holometabolan insects at least 318–300 million years ago, with <italic>Orco</italic> present in both groups (this study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krieger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pitts et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smadja et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang et al. 2012</xref>). The increasing dispersion of vascular plants together with the development of wings and a secondary wing articulation opened new and wider ranges of habitats and ecological niches for insects and the receptors to find them.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Different stages and sexes of <italic>Lepismachilis y-signata</italic> were collected at several locations around Jena (Germany).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, Detlef Weigel, and 3 reviewers, one of whom served as a guest Reviewing editor.</p><p>The editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper provides insights into the origins of the Odorant Receptor (OR) family of insects. By studying antennal transcriptomes of two insect species belonging to different ancient insect orders (Archaeognatha and Zygentoma) and another derived group (Phasmatodea) the authors show that the OR gene family arose later in insect diversification than has been suggested and was preceded by the Orco co-factor gene. The data do not support a previous suggestion that ORs evolved as an adaptation to terrestrialisation. In contrast to the OR family, ionotropic glutamate receptors (IRs), representing a more ancient class of chemosensory receptors, were identified and shown to be expressed in the antennal olfactory sensilla in Archaeognatha. The authors also perform anatomical and electrophysiological analyses, which provides useful novel data on the properties of the olfactory organs of these species. The paper represents a significant contribution to our understanding of insect olfaction with an interesting insight into the evolution of the OR family.</p><p>Essential revision requirements:</p><p>1) The results are largely built on the absence of OR genes in the transcriptomes of the antennae/palps of two of the lineages studied, and as acknowledged by the authors there is always uncertainty in documenting absence. These genes may be present in the genome and expressed in other chemosensory tissues not sampled here. There is a precedent for this: in the mosquito <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, Orco and ORs have been found to be expressed in the proboscis (PMID 16938890). Given these uncertainties the text should be toned down by changing the claim that OR and Orco are lacking to OR expression not being detectable in antennae (most likely because the genes are missing from the genome).</p><p>2) The in situ images are quite hard to interpret. The important conclusion is drawn that all OSNs contain IRs, therefore supporting the idea that ORs are absent. However, the images are not very clear and poorly described in the figure legends. It is also not clear how the cell body signal is correlated with the sensillum. The authors should try to improve the presentation of these data. Fluorescent imaging in <italic>T. domestica</italic> gives a confusing background signal at the edge of the antenna. This artifact should be mentioned in the legend.</p><p>3) The authors should provide more detail about how OSN types were identified. The response profiles of e.g., Lys-ab5A and Lys-ab2B are similar. Why are these two types? Anatomical information ('colocalization inside the same sensillum') was also taken into account, but it is not clear how. A summary of the spatial distribution of the receptor types in the antenna would be important, if this information was used to define types. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> some spiking rates show negative values, which indicates that the values shown represent spiking rates relative to baseline. However, there is no information about baseline activities. Since this information was also used to classify the OSN types, it should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02115.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revision requirements</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The results are largely built on the absence of OR genes in the transcriptomes of the antennae/palps of two of the lineages studied, and as acknowledged by the authors there is always uncertainty in documenting absence.

To address this problem we have included another transcriptome that is based on pooled RNA of heads and whole bodies from adults and juvenile stages.
