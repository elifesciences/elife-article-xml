but are also found in benign cases such as loss-of-function variants in the phosphate transporter <italic>SLC34A2</italic>. Here, we show that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), a regulator of phosphate homeostasis, is expressed in testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), embryonal carcinoma (EC), and human embryonic stem cells. FGF23 is not glycosylated in TGCTs and therefore cleaved into a C-terminal fragment which competitively antagonizes full-length FGF23. Here, <italic>Fgf23</italic> knockout mice presented with marked calcifications in the epididymis, spermatogenic arrest, and focally germ cells expressing the osteoblast marker Osteocalcin (gene name: <italic>Bglap</italic>, protein name). Moreover, the frequent testicular microcalcifications in mice with no functional androgen receptor and lack of circulating gonadotropins are associated with lower <italic>Slc34a2</italic> and higher <italic>Bglap</italic>/<italic>Slc34a1</italic> (protein name: NPT2a) expression compared with wild-type mice. In accordance, human testicular specimens with microcalcifications also have lower <italic>SLC34A2</italic> and a subpopulation of germ cells express phosphate transporter NPT2a, Osteocalcin, and RUNX2 highlighting aberrant local phosphate handling and expression of bone-specific proteins. Mineral disturbance in vitro using calcium or phosphate treatment induced deposition of calcium phosphate in a spermatogonial cell line and this effect was fully rescued by the mineralization inhibitor pyrophosphate. In conclusion, testicular microcalcifications arise secondary to local alterations in mineral homeostasis, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced levels of mineralization inhibitors due to high alkaline phosphatase activity in GCNIS and TGCTs facilitate osteogenic-like differentiation of testicular cells and deposition of hydroxyapatite.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microlithiasis</kwd><kwd>mineral homeostasis</kwd><kwd>hydroxyapatite</kwd><kwd>Fgf23</kwd><kwd>testis</kwd><kwd>Sertoli cell dysfunction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015459</institution-id><institution>Danish Cancer Society Research Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blomberg Jensen</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004836</institution-id><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blomberg Jensen</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blomberg Jensen</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aase and Ejnar Danielsens Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boisen</surname><given-names>Ida Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008733</institution-id><institution>Hørslev Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blomberg Jensen</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dagmar Wilhelms Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blomberg Jensen</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ib Henriksens Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blomberg Jensen</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Testicular microcalcifications arise secondary to local alterations in mineral homeostasis, which in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function and reduced levels of mineralization inhibitors facilitate deposition of hydroxyapatite.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Testicular microlithiasis in infertile men is associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leblanc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbonetti et al., 2019</xref>). However, both ultrasonic and histological microcalcifications are also frequent findings in the testis of asymptomatic men and the etiology remains largely unknown in both malignant and benign cases. The histological microcalcifications have been shown by Raman spectroscopy to consist of hydroxyapatite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Jong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smith et al., 1999</xref>), which is normally found exclusively in the skeleton and requires the presence of cells with osteoblast-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boström et al., 1995</xref>). Extra-skeletal mineralization is often caused by an imbalance in promoters and inhibitors of biomineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kirsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rowe, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martin and Quarles, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shanahan et al., 2011</xref>). Tissue mineralization is tightly controlled by small integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins (SIBLINGs) such as osteopontin (OPN) and dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 (DMP1) that regulate mineralization in concert with osteocalcin and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2). Pyrophosphate (PPi) generated by ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) is an essential suppressor of hydroxyapatite deposition and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) inactivates PPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hessle et al., 2002</xref>). ALP abundance is thus a central factor for local phosphate homeostasis, and during osteogenic differentiation increased ALP activity is a hallmark of the bone-like characteristics of the cells in other extra-skeletal tissue such as blood vessels. In this paper, ALP is used as an acronym for all four isozymes of ALP as all can be found in TGCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofmann et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) and its receptor Klotho (gene name: <italic>KL</italic>), the phosphate transport proteins solute carrier family NPT2-a and -b (gene names: <italic>SLC34A-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic>, respectively), and vitamin D metabolizing enzymes are essential for maintaining stable mineral homeostasis and that imbalance in their activity may lead to extra-skeletal calcifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieben et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golub, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Komori et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ducy et al., 1996</xref>). Interestingly, loss-of-function variants in the <italic>GALNT3</italic> gene (protein name: GalNAc-T3) and hence a lack of degradation-protective glycosylation of FGF23 leads to systemic hyperphosphatemia and severe testicular microcalcifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garringer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campagnoli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kato et al., 2006</xref>). Intratesticular phosphate levels seem to be essential in the formation of testicular microlithiasis as loss-of-function variants in the main testicular phosphate transporter <italic>SLC34A2</italic> also lead to severe testicular microcalcifications without affecting systemic phosphate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corut et al., 2006</xref>). Testicular microlithiasis is also found in patients with loss-of-function variants in the gene encoding ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 6 (<italic>ABCC6</italic>), which results in abnormal PPi metabolism and thus less inhibition of mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vanakker et al., 2006</xref>). These studies show that particularly local and potentially systemic changes in phosphate homeostasis induce testicular microcalcifications. Therefore, we hypothesized that the etiology of testicular microcalcifications involves disturbances in intratesticular mineral homeostasis.</p><p>TGCTs originate from a common progenitor germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS), which is characterized by the expression of pluripotency factors such as octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (gene names: <italic>POU5F1</italic>, protein name: OCT4), NANOG, and high ALP activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofmann et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Skakkebaek, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajpert-De Meyts et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hart et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobsen and Nørgaard‐pedersen, 1984</xref>). GCNIS cells undergo malignant transformation and form either a seminoma that retains germ cell characteristics or a non-seminoma that may contain embryonal carcinoma (EC) resembling human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), teratoma, yolk sac tumor, choriocarcinoma, or a combination of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodriguez et al., 2003</xref>). During the malignant transformation of GCNIS into invasive TGCTs, duplication of chromosome 12p (often as isochromosome 12p) is the most consistent chromosomal aberration and may be involved in the dedifferentiation from GCNIS to EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rodriguez et al., 2003</xref>). In healthy individuals, FGF23 is produced exclusively in osteocytes, and the location of the gene on chromosome 12p may be important for its presence and role in TGCTs. Full-length FGF23 increases phosphate excretion by decreasing the luminal expression of NPT2a in the kidney and by lowering the concentration of active vitamin D via increased expression of the inactivating enzyme CYP24A1 and reduced expression of the activating enzyme CYP27B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimada et al., 2004</xref>). We have previously shown that the local metabolism of vitamin D disappeared during the malignant transformation of GCNIS to EC and that FGF23 was expressed in an EC-derived cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomberg Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation by GalNAc-T3 protects FGF23 from rapid degradation, and full-length FGF23 activates a receptor complex consisting of Klotho heterodimerization with FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, the cleaved C-terminal fragment (cFGF23) can bind and serve as a competitive antagonist for intact FGF23 (iFGF23), and iFGF23 can also induce Klotho-independent effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goetz et al., 2010</xref>). Loss-of-function variants in the genes <italic>FGF23</italic>, <italic>GALNT3</italic>, or <italic>KL</italic> lead to tumoral calcinosis partly through osteogenic-like differentiation of mesenchymal-derived cells due to altered mineral homeostasis and vitamin D metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farrow et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we investigated whether ectopic FGF23 production and abundant ALP activity in TGCTs alter testicular mineral homeostasis, which alone or in combination with impaired Sertoli cell function may facilitate osteogenic-like differentiation and thus be responsible for the frequent deposition of hydroxyapatite in TGCTs and dysgenetic testes. To address this question, we investigated the expression of mineral regulators and bone factors in human tissues containing TGCT-associated calcifications, <italic>Fgf23</italic> knockout (<italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>-/-</sup>) mice, hypogonadal (no gonadotropins) mice, androgen-insensitive mice with microcalcifications, mice with microcalcifications due to Sertoli cell ablation, mice xenografted with a TGCT-derived cell line, mice treated with a high phosphate diet, mineral deposition in a mouse spermatogonial cell line (GC1), and an ex vivo mouse testis culture model.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Testicular microcalcifications are associated with the presence of renal phosphate transporters and bone markers in human testis</title><p>Ultrasonic testicular microlithiasis is often observed adjacent to TGCTs but can also be found in testes without TGCTs or GCNIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Ultrasonic testicular microlithiasis is not always associated with histological microcalcifications but intratesticular mineral depositions can be confirmed by von Kossa or alizarin red staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and Raman spectroscopy has previously demonstrated that testicular microcalcifications consist of hydroxyapatite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Jong et al., 2004</xref>). In GCNIS-containing tubules adjacent to microcalcifications, we found that the renal phosphate transporter NPT2a and FGF23 were ectopically expressed. In contrast, Klotho was expressed in the cytoplasm of the germ cells in normal tubules, with or without adjacent microcalcifications, but not in GCNIS. FGFR1 expression was found in both GCNIS and normal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The expression of the bone marker Osteocalcin was present in tissue with GCNIS and adjacent to the microcalcifications but not the normal tubules with full spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The microcalcifications vary in size from small calcifications focally in the center of seminiferous tubules to occupying most of the intraluminal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In sporadic severe cases there was intratesticular bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We investigated the presence of several bone factors in the cells adjacent to the microcalcifications. The early osteoblast marker RUNX2 was not expressed in testes with normal spermatogenesis. However, occasionally, when microcalcifications or bone formation were detected, a small fraction of the germ cells in the seminiferous tubules had cytoplasmic staining of RUNX2 supporting a bone-like phenotype of some germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Thus, expression of <italic>FGF23</italic> was investigated in human testicular specimens containing ‘normal testis’ (adjacent tissue to TGCT/GCNIS without presence of malignant cells), Sertoli-cell-only pattern, GCNIS, seminoma, and EC with or without teratoma components. The transcriptional level of <italic>FGF23</italic> was highest in EC components, significantly higher compared with normal testis, and was positively correlated with the expression of the pluripotency factor <italic>NANOG</italic> but not significantly with <italic>POU5F1</italic> (r=0.813, p=0.049, and r=0.780, p=0.068, respectively). Two EC specimens with polyembryoma components (the most dedifferentiated structure resembling early embryonic formation) had several fold higher levels of <italic>FGF23</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). A higher expression of <italic>FGF23</italic> in GCNIS compared with normal testis was also confirmed in microdissected GCNIS cells, while fetal gonocytes and hESCs also expressed <italic>FGF23</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The high expression of <italic>FGF23</italic> in hESC and EC was validated by a ~30-fold higher expression in different strains of hESC cells and the EC-derived cell line NTera2 compared with normal testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In contrast, normal testicular tissue had a high expression of the FGF23 receptor Klotho (<italic>KL</italic>), whereas the expression was low in GCNIS cells and hESC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). IHC confirmed the marked expression of FGF23 solely in OCT4-positive GCNIS cells that also expressed FGFR1, while Klotho was exclusively expressed in normal germ cells and not found in any of the OCT4-positive cancer cells including seminoma and EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). FGF23 was also expressed in the EC cells characterized by concomitant OCT4 expression but was virtually absent in seminoma cells despite their marked OCT4 expression suggesting that the chromosome 12p duplication (occurring in both seminoma and EC) alone is not sufficient to maintain FGF23 production. Western blot confirmed the presence of FGF23 with two bands corresponding to the sizes of cFGF23 and iFGF23 in GCNIS and EC. cFGF23 was also expressed in NTera2 cells, and neither cFGF23 nor iFGF23 were detected in normal testis or the seminoma-derived cell line TCam2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). cFGF23 and iFGF23 were expressed in an anaplastic seminoma sample, which is considered a rare intermediate between seminoma and EC due to the high proliferative index and morphological resemblance with EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Clinically, ALP expression is used as a marker for GCNIS and seminoma. ALP activity was markedly higher in GCNIS tubules compared with normal seminiferous tubules as determined by NBT/BCIP staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). All four types of ALPs were expressed in normal testis and the expression in GCNIS with microlithiasis and seminoma was not significantly higher, although some tumor specimens have marked expression of all four ALP isozymes. This shows that ALP activity is higher in GCNIS/TGCTs and typically mediated by a combination of different isozymes rather than a single type of ALP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To determine if mineralization can be induced in germ cells, the mouse spermatogonial cell line GC1 was treated with increasing concentrations of calcium and phosphate, and mineral deposition was subsequently visualized by alizarin red. Mineralization was already observed after co-treatment with calcium and phosphate for 2 days, but also after 7 days of treatment with calcium or phosphate alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). With a low serum phosphate concentration (0.9 mM), 3 mM calcium was required to obtain rapid mineralization after 2 days, whereas even 4 mM phosphate did not induce mineralization in a normal calcium concentration (1.8 mM) after 2 or 4 days. However, an increment in calcium to 2.0 mM enabled five of the six phosphate doses to induce rapid mineralization of the GC1 cells. This shows that low calcium levels are protective in the high intratesticular phosphate environment. Longer exposure (4 and 7 days) augmented the response in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of PPi, an inhibitor of mineralization, reduced mineralization, whereas co-treatment with PPi and pyrophosphatase (PPA1) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of PPi to inorganic phosphate (Pi) reintroduced mineralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). To assess the regulation of phosphatase activity in germ cells, a human cell line TCam2 was used as a positive control. TCam2 is derived from a seminoma and retains high expression of ectopic ALP, as assessed by NBT/BCIP staining, which was critically dependent on an alkaline environment with marked phosphatase activity at pH 9, but not at pH 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Staining with Fast Blue RR revealed that ALP activity was increased in the presence of osteogenic medium compared with control medium, indicating that germ cells increase their ALP activity in the presence of factors that facilitate bone differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, an ex vivo model using wild-type mouse testicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) cultured for 14 days with osteogenic medium -/+ phosphate did not change the expression of the bone markers <italic>Bglap</italic>, <italic>Runx2</italic>, or <italic>Alpl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, occasionally one or few tubules had expression of RUNX2, which was observed more often in specimens treated with osteogenic medium than in specimens treated with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Few of the specimens only had Sertoli cells in the tubules due to loss of germ cells and were therefore excluded from the analysis.

Microcalcifications are more prevalent in testicular biopsies with GCNIS than without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kang et al., 1994</xref>), which highlights that GCNIS or TGCTs release factors involved in the development of microlithiasis. Still, the accompanied impaired Sertoli cell function appears to be of greater importance than the presence of malignant germ cells. In this manuscript, we show that impaired Sertoli cell function in both mice and humans increases the risk of testicular microlithiasis and this association seems to be more persistent than the malignant linkage.</p><p>The systemic master regulator of phosphate, FGF23, is highly expressed in GCNIS, EC, and hESC but not in classical seminoma. This suggests that the expression of FGF23 is linked with the transformation of GCNIS to the invasive EC and is not a result of duplication of chromosome 12p which is also prevalent in classical seminoma. The marked expression in EC and hESCs highlights that FGF23 is an early embryonic signal, which is further supported by the strong correlation between <italic>FGF23</italic> and pluripotency factor <italic>NANOG</italic> in EC and the high <italic>FGF23</italic> expression in EC with polyembryoma formation. Moreover, it is in accordance with previous reports identifying <italic>FGF23</italic> transcripts in hESCs and during early embryonic life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cormier et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wei et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Phosphate levels in the testis are threefold higher than in serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenkins et al., 1983</xref>). In vascular and soft tissue calcification, FGF23-Klotho activity has been suggested to regulate ion metabolism and subsequently induce the presence of bone-like cells in the vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Memon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leszczynska and Murphy, 2018</xref>). The observed hydroxyapatite in the cauda epididymis of <italic>Fgf23<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice shows that loss of FGF23 signaling causes deposition of hydroxyapatite. As EC and GCNIS have no GalNAc-T3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rajpert-De Meyts et al., 2007</xref>), FGF23 will rapidly be cleaved into cFGF23 which is in accordance with the detection of mainly cFGF23 (and not iFGF23) in seminal fluid from GCNIS and EC patients. High intratesticular cFGF23 may bind the Klotho/FGFR1 receptor and antagonize the effect of iFGF23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goetz et al., 2010</xref>) thereby inducing a phenotype resembling <italic>Fgf23<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with increased expression of <italic>Bglap</italic>. However, in our human testis ex vivo model neither cFGF23 nor iFGF23 induced changes in phosphate transporters or <italic>BGLAP</italic> suggesting that short-term exposure (24 hr) to high cFGF23 does not induce changes in phosphate transporters, bone factors, or microcalcifications. The epididymal phenotype of <italic>Fgf23<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice does not appear to be mediated via systemic hyperphosphatemia as a high phosphate dietary exposure for weeks did not result in testicular or epididymal microcalcifications or changes in testicular phosphate transporter expression. Instead, we have previously shown that germ cell-specific deletion of Klotho in mice leads to aberrant mineral homeostasis, particularly calcium transport through transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V 5 (TRPV5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bøllehuus Hansen et al., 2020</xref>), which may be important as low calcium appears to be protective for inducing microcalcifications in a high phosphate environment. Local testicular mineral levels depend mainly on the presence and activity of specific transporters and sensors of calcium and phosphate in the reproductive organs, rather than on systemic concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boisen et al., 2021</xref>). This also explain why patients with loss-of-function variants in the predominant testicular phosphate transporter <italic>SLC34A2</italic> present with testicular microcalcifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corut et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, patients with loss-of-function variants in <italic>GALNT3</italic>, which lead to the early degradation of iFGF23 to its C-terminal form, present with global calcifications, severe testicular microlithiasis, and microcalcifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garringer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campagnoli et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice exhibit hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeLuca et al., 2008</xref>) and spermatogenic arrest, which resembles the condition of some men with testicular dysgenesis syndrome that occasionally have testicular microcalcifications despite no malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rebourcet et al., 2014a</xref>). Benign microcalcifications may be facilitated by low levels of androgens or gonadotropins as such hormonal imbalances can disrupt the Sertoli cell function. As a result, the germ cells may remain in their prepubertal stem cell state, rather than maturing properly leaving them susceptible to external stimuli that could trigger abnormal differentiation. Changes in the local testicular phosphate concentration (which is threefold higher than serum) could exert such a stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenkins et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenkins et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sharpe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Shaughnessy et al., 2010b</xref>). This hypothesis was supported by the presence of microcalcifications in <italic>hpg</italic> mice with concomitant global <italic>AR</italic> ablation as these mice have immature Sertoli cells and are unable to complete spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O’Shaughnessy et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, these mice had altered testicular phosphate homeostasis characterized by a nonsignificant tendency toward lower <italic>Slc34a2,</italic> but significantly higher <italic>Slc34a1</italic> expression compared with WT mice. However, both <italic>hpg</italic> and <italic>hpg</italic> mice with Sertoli cell-specific <italic>AR</italic> deletion (<italic>hpg.SCARKO</italic>) had similar changes in phosphate transporters and only 30–36% frequency of microlithiasis, suggesting that additional mechanisms are contributing to the formation of microlithiasis. The bone marker <italic>Bglap</italic> was detected exclusively in all the <italic>hpg</italic> mice with concomitant global <italic>AR</italic> deletion (<italic>hpg.ARKO</italic>) but not in <italic>hpg</italic> mice with intact AR, which supports that some testicular cells undergo osteogenic trans-differentiation, and this is related to more abundant deposition of hydroxyapatite. We cannot determine the cell-of-origin, but we have previously shown that vitamin D induces an osteogenic-like differentiation of NTera2 cells which start to express bone-specific proteins such as Osteocalcin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blomberg Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). However, the osteogenic-like differentiation in <italic>hpg</italic> mice occurs in non-malignant prepubertal/non-maturated testicular cells.</p><p>Peritubular cells could be a good candidate because they are mesenchymal-derived and such fibroblast-like cells can undergo osteogenic-like differentiation during vascular calcification at other sites of extra-skeletal mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ronchetti et al., 2013</xref>). However, human Sertoli cells can also form large-cell calcifying tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gourgari et al., 2012</xref>), indicating that multiple gonadal cell types have the potential to become bone-like. In mice, Sertoli cell ablation before puberty caused extensive intratubular microcalcifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rebourcet et al., 2014b</xref>), whereas Sertoli cell ablation in adulthood did not result in the formation of microcalcifications when assessed 3 months later despite a greater burden of immediate intratubular cell death. This finding is important because it demonstrates that microcalcifications are not caused by massive intratubular cell death in mice but are critically dependent on germ cells with stem cell potential. Sertoli cell maturation and function seem essential for protection against osteogenic-like differentiation of the germ cells or peritubular cells and benign microcalcifications are more likely to occur due to prepubertal Sertoli cell disturbance. The spermatogonial stem cells may also be the cell type that undergoes osteogenic-like differentiation as they can spontaneously develop into all three germ layers when isolated from adult mice, form teratomas in nude mice, and participate in the formation of multiple organs when injected into blastocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan et al., 2006</xref>). RUNX2 is an essential transcription factor for osteoblast development, and although germ cells express a different isoform of RUNX2 (lacking exons 4–8), it is transcribed from the same promoter as in bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ogawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeong et al., 2008</xref>). RUNX2 was undetectable in healthy seminiferous tubules using an antibody targeting exon 5, but was detected in GCNIS, hyalinized/calcified tissues, and the otherwise seemingly healthy seminiferous tubules adjacent to bone in the testis, indicating that the bone-specific RUNX2 isoform is also expressed in the testis when microcalcifications occur. Also, the mature bone marker Osteocalcin was expressed in a fraction of cells that morphologically resemble germ cells. Unfortunately, there was no cell-tracing marker in the mouse models so the required tracing experiments to support that these bone-like cells originated from the germ cells could not be conducted. Instead, a spermatogonial mouse cell line was exposed to calcium and phosphate at concentrations like those found in the testis or the epididymis. After 2–7 days of exposure, the spermatogonia started to deposit minerals illustrating that they developed some osteoblast-like characteristics, but they did not undergo complete osteogenic differentiation. A similar experiment using an adult mouse testis culture model without exposure to gonadotropins or androgens showed that treatment with an osteogenic cocktail for 14 days did not induce <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Bgalp</italic>, or <italic>Alpl</italic> but a focal expression of the RUNX2 (using the antibody targeting exon 5) was found in specimens treated with both vehicle and the osteogenic cocktail. This suggests that RUNX2 expression was switched to the bone-specific isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanto et al., 2016</xref>) during ex vivo culturing and in accordance RUNX2 was more frequently found in specimens treated with the osteogenic cocktail+high phosphate.</p><p>One of the most potent mineralization inhibitors is PPi, which can be degraded by ALP or pyrophosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orriss, 2020</xref>). PPi prevented the mineralization induced by calcium and phosphate in the GC1 cell line, which was reintroduced in the presence of pyrophosphatase-degrading PPi. This highlights the role of PPi as an inhibitor of spermatogonial mineralization. ALPs convert PPi to Pi and are expressed by primordial and malignant germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofmann et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobsen and Nørgaard‐pedersen, 1984</xref>). Four genes encode ALPs in humans (five in mice), and all are expressed in malignant germ cells, including the tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hofmann et al., 1989</xref>). TNAP is required for normal bone formation and regulates vascular matrix mineralization by inactivation of the mineralization inhibitors PPi and OPN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lomashvili et al., 2004</xref>). We show here that TCam2 cells have high ALP activity in alkaline pH, suggesting that mineralization is promoted by malignant cells. This implies that men with GCNIS and TGCTs are prone to microcalcifications due to lower PPi levels caused by increased ALP activity. Several other inhibitors and promoters of mineralization could be involved, but the marked epididymal mineralization observed in <italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, despite the presence of SIBLING proteins that inhibit hydroxyapatite formation and the extensive testicular microcalcifications in men with loss-of-function variants in <italic>SLC34A2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corut et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that aberrant function of just one component can be enough to promote the formation of microcalcifications. Immature bone formation in the testis is commonly observed in teratomas but can occur without malignancy. Mature bone tissue formation has also been reported in the testis after trauma or bleeding without signs of GCNIS or invasive TGCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoneda et al., 1979</xref>). Here, we also show intratesticular bone in a specimen despite no detection of GCNIS or malignant cells. A comprehensive analysis of germ cells adjacent to the bone tissue revealed focally bone-specific RUNX2 positive germ cells but none of them expressed the other investigated bone markers or deposition of hydroxyapatite, indicating that the mature bone has been formed in the interstitial compartment through a different mechanism related to the trauma rather than alterations in mineral homeostasis leading to testicular microcalcifications.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that the formation of testicular microcalcifications occurs due to either malignant or benign etiology, and includes one or more of the following events: aberrant function of Sertoli cells, disturbed local phosphate homeostasis, change in mineralization inhibitors, or aberrant germ cell function. These changes alone or in combination can drive osteogenic-like differentiation of germ cells resulting in intratubular deposition of microcalcifications consisting of hydroxyapatite. Thus, this study suggests that microcalcifications alone should not be considered a marker for malignancy in the testis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human tissue samples</title><p>Patients were recruited from the Department of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration after approval from the local ethics committee (Permit No. H-15000931, H-17004362, KF 01 2006-3472).

The NTera2 cells were grown on the mice for 28–56 days. Tumor volumes were calculated from two tumor diameter measurements using a Vernier caliper: tumor volume = L × W × ½W. If a tumor diameter of 12 mm was reached the animals were sacrificed. At the end of the study, mice were euthanized according to the animal welfare euthanasia statement. Tumors, kidneys, and testes were harvested and weighed, and one half was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for IHC, and the other half was snap-frozen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Hypogonadal mice with androgen receptor ablation globally or specifically in the Sertoli cells and Sertoli cell-ablated mice</title><p>The <italic>hpg</italic> mice were bred in Glasgow and all procedures were carried out under UK Home Office License and with the approval of a local ethical review committee. <italic>hpg</italic>.SCARKO and <italic>hpg</italic>.ARKO mice were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O’Shaughnessy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Shaughnessy et al., 2010a</xref>).

GC1 cells (ATCC CRL-2053, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:CVCL_8872">CVCL_8872</ext-link>) were grown under standard conditions at 37°C at 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in DMEM supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml) (Gibco), 10% FBS (Gibco, #11573397), and L-glutamine (Gibco, #25030–024) (2 mM final conc.) was also added to the media. To investigate calcification in the GC1 cells, the cells were grown in 24-well plates and treated with increasing concentrations of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> · Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> alone or in combination with PPi (Merck, #P8010) and/or phosphatase (Prospec, #ENZ-241). The medium was changed every second day. Human and mouse testes were cultured ex vivo using a hanging drop culture approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jørgensen et al., 2014</xref>) or culture on agarose gel pieces, respectively. In human testis specimens, the effects of 50 ng/ml iFGF23 or 200 ng/ml cFGF23 were investigated after being added to culture media with 0.1% BSA for 24 hr. In the mouse ex vivo cultures, testis from adult 8-week-old mice were dissected and treated with osteogenic medium in a gel-based tissue model. Briefly, agarose gels (1.5%) were cut into 8×8×8 mm<sup>3</sup> cube, placed in four-well plates, and soaked in culture media (DMEM-F12, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1× insulin, transferrin and selenium supplement [ITSS], 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]) for a minimum of 24 hr before setup of tissue cultures. Mouse testis was dissected into 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup> pieces and placed in opposite corners on each gel.

Sections were then incubated with 1% silver nitrate solution under ultraviolet light for 20 min. Thereafter, the sections were rinsed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and incubated with 5% sodium thiosulfate for 5 min and rinsed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O (and sometimes counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin) and dehydrated through graded alcohol and cleared in xylene. For alizarin red staining of tissue sections, deparaffinized sections were stained with 2% alizarin red solution (pH 4.1–4.3) for 5 min. The sections were then dehydrated in acetone and acetone-xylene (1:1) and cleared in xylene. For alizarin red staining of GC1 cells, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed in ddH<sub>2</sub>O and incubated with 0.5% alizarin red (pH 4.1–4.3) for 20 min protected from light with light shaking. Cells were washed two to three times with ddH<sub>2</sub>O and left to dry. Cryosections (10 µm) were treated with BCIP/NBT mixture for 90 s. The BCIP/NBT mixture consisted of 45 µl BCIP stock solution and 35 µl NBT stock solutions in 10 ml water. Stock solutions: 50 mg/ml BCIP (Sigma #B8503) in 100% dimethylformamide (Sigma #D4254) and 75 mg/ml NBT (Sigma #N6876) in 70% vol/vol dimethylformamide/distilled water. The reaction was stopped in water (1 min). BCIP/NBT staining of cell lines was performed the same way but in citrate buffer (pH = 7) or revelation buffer (pH = 9.2–9.5). For Fast Blue RR staining, the cells were washed in PBS and then fixed with 3.7% formalin for 10 min. Then, the cells were rinsed in PBS and stained for 15 min at RT lightly shaking and protected from light. The cells were stained for ALP activity with Napthol AS-MX, 144 <italic>n</italic>,<italic>n</italic>-dimethylformamide and Fast Blue RR salt (Sigma #F0500).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism v. 8 (GraphPad Software). Evaluation of Gaussian distribution was performed and if the residuals did not have Gaussian distribution or unequal variances, variables were transformed with natural logarithm and reevaluated. Hence, a two-sided unpaired Student’s t-test was used between two groups of mice except for serum calcium between WT and <italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>-/-</sup> where a Mann-Whitney test was used. One-way ANOVAs followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test were used to test for differences between gene expression in human normal testis and tumors, ex vivo cultures of human and mouse testes, and between WT and the different <italic>hpg</italic> mouse models. Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test was used to test for differences between levels of iFGF23 and total FGF23 (iFGF23+cFGF23) in seminal fluid from healthy men and tumor patients. For correlation analyses, residual plots were evaluated to ensure the validity of the correlation analyses. As a result, the Pearson correlation test was used to investigate the correlation between <italic>FGF23</italic> and the pluripotency genes <italic>POU5F1</italic> or <italic>NANOG</italic> in EC. Statistical significance was determined at the following levels: not significant p&gt;0.05, *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, and ****p&lt;0.0001. Sample-size estimation was based on similar type of experimental design conducted previously by us or others.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Guest editor &lt;i&gt;eLife&lt;/i&gt;</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Patients were recruited from the Department of Growth and Reproduction, Rigshospitalet, Denmark in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration after approval from the local ethics committee (Permit No. H-15000931, H-17004362, KF 01 2006-3472).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The hpg mice were bred in Glasgow and all procedures were carried out under UK Home Office License and with the approval of a local ethical review committee.

All antibodies used in this manuscript were purchased before the whole world was aware of mistreatment of goats that was evident several years later.</p><p>We do not support animal cruelty in anyway but the purchase of antibodies from Santa Cruz biotechnologies were conducted long before mistreatment was reported. Moreover, antibodies from Santa Cruz biotechnologies are being used in thousands of publications annually. The company has been punished for their misconduct, and subsequently granted permission to produce antibodies from the relevant authorities again.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Despite the study being a collation of important results likely to have an overall positive effect on the field, methodological weaknesses and suboptimal use of statistics make it difficult to give confidence to the study's message.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Relevant human and mouse models approached with in vivo and in vitro techniques.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The methodology, statistics, reagents, analyses, and manuscripts' language all lack rigour.</p><p>(1) The authors used statistics to generate P-values and Rsquare values to evaluate the strength of their findings.</p><p>However, it is unclear how stats were used and/or whether stats were used correctly. For instance, the authors write: &quot;Gaussian distribution of all numerical variables was evaluated by QQ plots&quot;. But why? For statistical tests that fall under the umbrella of General Linear Models (line ANOVA, t-tests, and correlations (Pearson's)), there are several assumptions that ought to be checked, including typically:</p><p>(a) Gaussian distribution of residuals.</p><p>(b) Homoskedasticity of the residuals.</p><p>(c) Independence of Y, but that's assumed to be valid due to experimental design.</p><p>So what is the point of evaluating the Gaussian distribution of the data themselves? It is not necessary. In this reviewer's opinion, it is irrelevant, not a good use of statistics, and we ought to be leading by example here.</p><p>Additionally, it is not clear whether the homoscedasticity of the residuals was checked. Many of the data appear to have particularly heteroskedastic residuals. In many respects, homoscedasticity matters more than the normal distribution of the residuals. In Graphpad analyses if ANOVA is used but equal variances are assumed when variances among groups are unequal then standard deviations assigned in each group will be wrong and thus incorrect p values are being calculated.</p><p>Based on the incomplete and/or wrong statistical analyses it is difficult to evaluate the study in greater depth.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we should lead by example and improve clarity on the use of the different statistical tests and their application. In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have extended the statistical section, focusing on the analyses used. Additionally, we have specified the statistical test used in the figure legends for each figure. Additionally, we did check for Gaussian distribution and homoskedasticity of residuals before conducting a general linear model test, and this has now been specified in the revised manuscript. In case the assumptions were not met, we have specified which non-parametric test we used. If the assumptions were not met, we specified which non-parametric test was used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While on the subject of stats, it is worth mentioning this misuse of statistics in Figure 3D, where the authors added the Slc34a1 transcript levels from controls in the correlation analyses, thereby driving the intercept down. Without the Control data there does not appear to be a correlation between the Slc34a1 levels and tumor size.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a correlation analysis is inappropriate here and have removed this part of the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is more. The authors make statements e.g. in the figure levels as: &quot;Correlations indicated by R2.&quot;. What does that mean? In a simple correlation, the P value is used to evaluate the strength of the slope being different from zero. The authors also give R2 values for the correlations but they do not provide R2 values for the other stats (like ANOVAs). Why not?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have replaced the R2 values with the Pearson correlation coefficient in combination with the P value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors used antibodies for immunos and WBs. I checked those antibodies online and it was concerning:</p><p>(a) Many are discontinued.</p></disp-quote><p>Many of the antibodies we have used were from the major antibody provider Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SCBT). SCBT was involved in a scandal of animal cruelty and all their goats and rabbits were sacrificed, which explains why several antibodies were discontinued, while the mice antibodies were allowed to continue. This is unfortunate but out of our hands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Many are not validated.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that antibody validation is essential. All antibodies used in this manuscript have been validated. The minimal validation has been to evaluate cellular expression in positive control tissue for instance bone, kidney, or mamma. Moreover, many of the antibodies have been used and validated in previous publications (doi: 10.1593/neo.121164, doi:10.1096/fj.202000061RR, doi: 10.1093/cvr/cvv187) including knockout models. Moreover, many antibodies but not all have been validated by western blot or <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. We have included the following in the <italic>Materials and Methods</italic> section: “All antibodies used have been validated by testing in positive control tissue and/or Western blot or <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Many performed poorly in the Immunos, e.g. FGF23, FGFR1, and Kotho are not really convincing. PO5F1 (gene: OCT4) is the one that looks convincing as it is expressed at the correct cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We fail to understand the criticism raised by the reviewer regarding the specificity of these specific antibodies. We believe the FGF23 and Klotho antibodies are performing exceptionally well, and FGFR1 is abundantly expressed in many cell types in the testis. As illustrated in Figure 2E, the expression of Klotho, FGF23, and FGFR1 is very clear, specific, and convincing. FGF23 is not expressed in normal testis – which is in accordance with no RNA present there either. However, it is abundantly expressed in GCNIS where RNA is present. On the other hand, Klotho is abundantly expressed in germ cells from normal testis but not expressed in GCNIS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(d) Others like NPT2A (product of gene SLC34A1) are equally unconvincing. Shouldn't the immuno show them to be in the plasma membrane?</p><p>If there is some brown staining, this does not mean the antibodies are working. If your antibodies are not validated then you ought to omit the immunos from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge your concerns regarding the NPT2A, NPT2B, and NPT2C staining. While the NPT2A antibody is performing well, we understand your reservations about the other antibodies. It's worth noting that NPT2A is not expressed in normal testis (no RNA either) but is expressed in GCNIS where the RNA is also present. Although it is typically present in the plasma membrane, cytoplasmic expression can be acceptable as membrane availability is crucial for regulating NPT2A function, particularly in the kidney where FGF23 controls membrane availability. We are currently involved in a comprehensive study exploring these phosphate transporters in the organs lining the male reproductive tract. In functional animal models, we have observed very specific staining with this NPT2A antibody following exposed to high phosphate or FGF23. Additionally, we are conducting Western Blot analyses with this antibody, which reinforces our belief that the antibody has a specific binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study set out to examine microlithiasis associated with an increased risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT). This reviewer considers this to be an excellent study. It raises questions regarding exactly how aberrant Sertoli cell function could induce osteogenic-like differentiation of germ cells but then all research should raise more questions than it answers.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Data showing the link between a disruption in testicular mineral (phosphate)homeostasis, FGF23 expression, and Sertoli cell dysfunction, are compelling.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Not sure I see any weaknesses here, as this study advances this area of inquiry and ends with a hypothesis for future testing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the acknowledgment and highlighting that this is an important message that addresses several ways to develop testicular microlithiasis, which indicates that it is not only due to malignant disease but also frequent in benign conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I applaud the authors' approach to nomenclature for rodent and human genes and proteins (italicised for genes, all caps for humans, capitalised only for rodents, etc), but the authors frequently got it wrong when referring to genes or proteins. A couple of examples include:</p><p>(1) SLC34A1 (italics) refers to gene (correct use by the authors) but then again the authors use e.g. SLC34A1 (not italics) to refer to the protein product of SLC34A1(italics) gene. In fact, the protein product of the SLC34A1 (italics) gene is called NPT2A (non-italics).</p><p>(2) OCT4 (italics) refers to gene (correct use by the authors) but then again the authors use e.g. OCT4 (not italics) to refer to the protein product of OCT4 (italics)gene. In fact, the protein product of the OCT4 gene (italics) gene is called PO5F1(non-italics).</p><p>The problem with their incorrect and inconsistent nomenclature is widespread in the manuscript making further evaluation difficult.</p><p>Please consult a reliable protein-based database like Uniprot to derive the correct protein names for the genes. You got NANOG correct though.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for addressing this important point. We have corrected the nomenclature throughout the manuscript as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors use the word &quot;may&quot; too many times. Also often in conjunction with words like &quot;indicates&quot;, and &quot;suggests&quot;. Examples of phrases that reflect that the authors lack confidence in their own results, conclusions, and understanding of the literature are:</p><p>&quot;...which could indicate that the bone-specific RUNX2 isoform may also be expressed... &quot;</p><p>&quot;...which indicates that the mature bone may have been...&quot;</p><p>Are we shielding ourselves from being wrong in the future because &quot;may&quot; also means &quot;may not&quot;? It is far more engaging to read statements that have a bit more tooth to them, and some assertion too. How about turning the above statements around, to :</p><p>&quot;...which shows that the bone-specific RUNX2 isoform is also expressed... &quot;</p><p>&quot;...which reveals that the mature bone were...&quot;</p><p>...then revisit ambiguous language (&quot;may&quot;, &quot;might&quot; &quot;possibly&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;indicate&quot; etc.) throughout the manuscript?</p><p>It's OK to make a statement and be found wrong in the future. Being wrong is integral to Science.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for addressing this. We agree with the reviewer that it is fair to be more direct and have revised many of these vague phrases throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors use the word &quot;transporter&quot; which in itself is confusing. For instance, is SLC34A1 an importer or an exporter of phosphate? Or both? Do SLC34As move phosphate in or out of the cells or cellular compartments? &quot;Transporter&quot; sounds too vague a word.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that it might be easier for the reader with the term &quot;importer&quot;. However, we should use the specific nomenclature or &quot;wording&quot; that applies to these transporters. The exact terminology is a co-transporter or sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter as reported here (doi: 10.1152/physrev.00008.2019). Thus, we will use the terms “co-transporter” and “transporter” throughout the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
