EV-D68 is often detected in patient respiratory samples but has also been detected in stool and wastewater, suggesting the potential for both respiratory and enteric routes of transmission. Here, we used a panel of EV-D68 isolates, including a historical pre-2014 isolate and multiple contemporary isolates from AFM outbreak years, to define the dynamics of viral replication and the host response to infection in primary human airway cells and stem cell-derived enteroids. We show that some recent EV-D68 isolates have decreased sensitivity to acid and temperature compared with earlier isolates and that the respiratory, but not intestinal, epithelium induces a robust type III interferon response that restricts infection. Our findings define the differential responses of the respiratory and intestinal epithelium to contemporary EV-D68 isolates and suggest that a subset of isolates have the potential to target both the human airway and gastrointestinal tracts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enterovirus</kwd><kwd>airway</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI081759</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coyne</surname><given-names>Carolyn B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI060525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Alexandra I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI149866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Alexandra I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005886</institution-id><institution>Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship in Basic and Translational Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>Megan Culler</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel studies in primary human airway cells and stem cell-derived enteroids show that Enterovirus D-68 differentially infects and induces innate immune signaling in the respiratory and intestinal epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enteroviruses (EVs) are a family of positive-stranded RNA viruses, including coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), and enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) that are responsible for a broad spectrum of illness in humans. EVs, specifically EV-D68 and EV-A71, have been associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like illness causing paralysis in previously healthy individuals, primarily children, which has peaked in even numbered years from at least 2014 until 2018 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Messacar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Midgley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mishra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schubert et al., 2019</xref>). While 2020 was anticipated to be a peak year for AFM, there was not a surge of cases reported, indicating that coronavirus infection-control measures such as social distancing and mask usage also diminished exposure to other circulating pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">CDC, 2020</xref>). While EVs are traditionally spread via the fecal-oral route, but previous work with EV-D68 isolates before the AFM outbreak in 2014 suggested reduced replication in acidic environments and improved replication at lower temperature than traditional EVs, suggesting suitability for respiratory tract replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oberste et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>EV-D68 has undergone rapid evolution since the 1990s, leading to the emergence of four clades, termed A–D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tokarz et al., 2012</xref>). This degree of evolution has led to loss of neutralization from pre-existing antibodies, highlighting the potential significance of these changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imamura et al., 2014</xref>). Contemporary EV-D68 isolates exhibit different biological properties than historical reference isolates, including replication in neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2018</xref>). EV-D68 is often detected in patient respiratory samples; however, EV-D68 genetic material has also been detected in stool specimens and wastewater, suggesting presence in the digestive tract and potential transmission by the fecal–oral route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisseux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Weil et al., 2017</xref>). The viral and host determinants that influence EV-D68 tropism remain largely unknown, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal (GI) epithelium. Moreover, whether there are differences in the replication dynamics and/or host responses to isolates circulating prior to AFM outbreaks versus contemporary isolates is also unclear.</p><p>The EV-D68 reference isolate Fermon is often used as a historic isolate, due to its isolation in the mid-1960s. However, this isolate has undergone decades of passage through cell lines and has thus likely undergone changes that make it well-adapted for replication in cell culture and less representative of its original sequence when it was isolated from a child with pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schieble et al., 1967</xref>). These changes highlight the need to perform comparative studies using pre-outbreak and contemporary EV-D68 isolates in order to define the viral and host determinants of infection. In this study, we performed comparative studies of replication kinetics, temperature sensitivity, polarity of infection, and cellular responses to infection using a panel of EV-D68 isolates, including a historic isolate and multiple isolates from AFM outbreak years. To define host cell-type-specific differences in EV-D68 replication and/or host responses, we performed comparative studies in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells grown at an air–liquid interface and in primary human stem-cell-derived intestinal enteroids. We found that respiratory and intestinal cell lines were permissive to both historic and contemporary EV-D68 isolates, but that there were isolate-specific differences in temperature sensitivity at 33°C or 37°C. In contrast, primary HBE cells were largely resistant to EV-D68 replication, with only one isolate, KY/14/18953, able to replicate. KY/14/18953 and MA/18/23089 were able to replicate in human enteroids. Primary HBE, but not enteroids, mount a robust innate immune response to EV-D68 infection, characterized by the induction of type III interferons (IFNs) and, to a lesser extent, type I IFNs. Lastly, we show that inhibition of IFN signaling enhances EV-D68 replication in primary HBE, supporting a role for this signaling in the control of viral replication in the airway. Collectively, these data define the differential responses of the respiratory and intestinal epithelium to historic and contemporary EV-D68 isolates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EV-D68 replication in lung and intestinal cell lines varies with isolate and temperature</title><p>We sought to evaluate the replication competency of a panel of EV-D68 isolates, including a historical 2009 isolate and five contemporary isolates from outbreaks in the AFM peak years of 2014 and 2018 in cell lines representing the respiratory and intestinal tracts (details of viral isolates can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To do this, we used the MD/09/23229 isolate, collected in 2009 and in clade A, as a reference isolate prior to the 2014 outbreak and multiple isolates associated with AFM outbreak seasons, including 2014 and 2018.

We found that while all isolates replicated to some degree at 33°C in Calu-3 cells, two isolates, MD/09/23229 and MA/18/23089, were unable to efficiently replicate at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In Caco-2 cells, all isolates were able to replicate at 33°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

However, in addition to cellular tropism, enteric viruses must be stable in acidic environments to infect the GI tract. Previous work suggested that select EV-D68 isolates were destabilized following exposure to low pH (pH 4–6) as a mechanism of genome release during vial entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). However, whether this instability might influence the enteric route of transmission is unclear. In order to define the stability of EV-D68 virions in various conditions that mimic the environment in the GI tract, we exposed historical and contemporary isolates of EV-D68 to simulated intestinal fluids of the stomach and fed and fasted states of the small intestine over short (30 min) and long (60–120 min) exposure times. These fluids reflect not only the differential pH of the GI tract, but also contain bile acid and phospholipids that better recapitulate some aspects of the GI luminal content. To compare the stability of EV-D68 to other members of the enterovirus family that are transmitted primarily via the fecal–oral route, we performed similar studies with echovirus 11 (E11) and EVA71. E11 and EVA71 were stable in both fed state small intestine (FeSSIF pH 5) and fasted state small intestine (FaSSIF pH 6.5) for all exposure times tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). However, whereas E11 exhibited significant reductions in titer when exposed to fasted state simulated gastric fluid (FaSSGF pH 2.0), EV71 was less impacted by this exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). None of the EV-D68 isolates tested were able to withstand the most acidic fluid (FaSSGF, pH 2.0) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). However, whereas EV-D68 isolates were generally stable in FaSSIF pH 6.5 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>), there were isolate-specific differences in stability in FeSSIF pH 5 conditions, with KY/14/18953 and to a lesser extent MA/18/23089 exhibiting some stability in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>).

However, given that cell lines do not fully recapitulate the complexities of the airway and intestinal epithelium, we performed similar studies in primary cell models. To model the human airway, we used primary HBE cells grown at an air–liquid interface (ALI). HBE have increased similarity to the human respiratory tract with respect to polarization, functional cilia, and mucus production than cell-line-derived respiratory models and thus provide a more physiological system to study EV-D68 infections in the human airway. We infected HBE cells from at least two independent donors from either the apical or basolateral domains and first measured viral titers to determine whether EV-D68 exhibited a polarity of entry. First, we measured titers in the apical supernatants and found that one isolate, KY/14/18953, infected similarly from the apical and basolateral domains at 33°C or 37°C, but exhibited preferential release from the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). In contrast, MD/09/23229 replicated more efficiently from the basolateral surface and exhibited a temperature preference for 33°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). Another contemporary isolate, IL/14/18952, infected best from the basolateral surface at 33°C while the contemporary isolate MA/18/23089 infected primary HBE inefficiently from either domain or temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–E</xref>). Next, we measured titers from the basolateral supernatants to determine if EV-D68 exhibited preferential egress from the apical or basolateral cell surface. We found that all isolates that replicated efficiently in primary HBE exhibited low to undetectable titers in basolateral supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>) compared to those detected in apical supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

To do this, we used human primary stem cell-derived enteroids, which we previously used to define the cellular tropism of other enteroviruses in the GI epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2019</xref>). We found that only one isolate, KY/14/18953, replicated in human enteroids, which occurred in a temperature-independent manner whereas there were very low levels of infection by other isolates tested, although MD/09/232229 exhibited some capacity to replicate to low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). A limitation of the above-described model is that enteroids grown in Matrigel exhibit an ‘inside out’ polarity, with the luminal surface facing inward. As we have previously shown that some enteroviruses such as EV-A71 exhibit preferential infection of the apical domain, we next determined whether EV-D68 exhibited a similar polarity, which might explain the low levels of infection in enteroids grown in Matrigel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2019</xref>). To address this, we cultured intestinal crypts on Transwell inserts, which allows for the development of a monolayer containing diverse intestinal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to our studies in HBE, we infected intestinal monolayers from the apical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>) or basolateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>) domains and sampled the apical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>) or basolateral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>) supernatant for infectious virus. We focused on KY/14/18953 and MA/18/23089 for these studies because they replicated the best in Caco-2 cells at 37°C compared to other isolates. We found that KY/14/18953 replicated to high titers when inoculated from either the apical or basolateral surfaces but exhibited a preferential release into the apical compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>), similar to what was observed in primary HBE. In contrast to our findings in Matrigel-derived enteroids, we found that MA/18/23089 replicated to high titers when infection was initiated from the apical surface, with slightly lower titers from the basolateral domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>). However, similar to KY/14/18953, this isolate also exhibited preferential release into the apical compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>).

Consistent with our infectious titer data, HBE cells infected from the basolateral surface had higher viral RNA (vRNA) fragments per kilobase per million reads mapped (FPKM) reads than those infected apically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Despite significant differences in the levels of infection, HBE infected with either MD/09/23229 or KY/14/18953 from the basolateral surface induced similar numbers of transcripts, with MD/09/23229 inducing 178 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) and KY/14/18953 inducing 189 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

These transcripts were enriched in interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). In contrast, there were very few transcripts induced by both HBE and enteroids infected with KY/14/18953, with only nine transcripts shared between these conditions, despite enteroids inducing a greater total number of transcripts (332 total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

In addition, utilizing two primary human cell models representing common tissue sites targeted by enteroviruses in humans, we defined differences in epithelial responses to EV-D68 between the respiratory and GI tracts. Collectively, this work details the varied responses of the respiratory and intestinal epithelium to historic and contemporary EV-D68 isolates and defines the role of type III IFN signaling in the control of EV-D68 infection in the respiratory, but not intestinal, epithelium.</p><p>We found that most isolates of EV-D68 efficiently replicated in both respiratory and intestinal epithelial cell lines, although there were some isolate-specific differences in temperature sensitivity. By comparison, primary HBE cells were less permissive to EV-D68 infection. One isolate, KY/14/18953, replicated very efficiently in primary HBE from either the apical or basolateral domains at both 33°C and 37°C, but exhibited a preferential release into the apical compartment. Another isolate, IL/14/18952, infected preferentially from the basolateral surface, but similarly was released into the apical compartment. The historic isolate MD/09/23229 and contemporary isolate MA/18/23089 replicated to comparably lower levels in all conditions but shared an apical release preference. Viruses with respiratory tropism as well as those with enteric tropism vary in their capacity to infect via the apical or basolateral surfaces, and while this information does not dictate which system is most susceptible to infection, it can inform future studies of cellular entry and receptor determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bomsel and Alfsen, 2003</xref>). As for viral egress, basolateral release is often associated with viral dissemination throughout the body, while apical release is associated with continued presence at the mucosal surface which can contribute to viral shedding and subsequent transmission to a new host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owusu et al., 2021</xref>). Despite high levels of infection in the intestinal-derived Caco-2 cell line, only one isolate, KY/14/18953, replicated to high titers in stem cell-derived enteroids, although the contemporary isolate MA/18/23089 also replicated to low, but detectable, levels which improved when access to the apical surface was available. These studies point to key differences in the susceptibility of different primary epithelial-derived cell models to EV-D68 infection and suggest that host factors likely influence this tropism. For example, although attachment factors have been identified for EV-D68, including sialic acid and decay accelerating factor, some contemporary strains of EV-D68 including KY/14/18953 do not bind to sialylated receptors and their role in mediating infection is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baggen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blomqvist et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the neuron-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM-5/telencephalin) has been identified as a potential receptor for several historic and contemporary isolates of EV-D68, but restricted expression in other cell types makes it unclear what role it might play in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hixon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wei et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Previous work with EV-D68 before the emergence of AFM suggested that due to preferences for replication at 33°C and sensitivity to acid in vitro, it was more suited to be a respiratory pathogen behaving similarly to rhinoviruses as opposed to other enteroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Oberste et al., 2004</xref>). While previous studies have evaluated acid stability of EV-D68, we utilized biologically relevant solutions with complexities other than acidity, such as bile acid and phospholipids, that more closely mimic the GI environment. Our studies using multiple contemporary isolates after the emergence of AFM suggest that these isolates are relatively stable at 37°C and also have improved acid stability. However, none of the EV-D68 isolates tested were stable during even short incubations with the most acidic fluid, the simulated fasted state stomach fluid, at a pH of 2. Our data also indicate that many isolates of EV-D68, even those associated with AFM outbreaks, are unable to replicate efficiently in human enteroids. However, one contemporary isolate, KY/14/18953, replicated to high levels in human enteroids and we observed replication of the contemporary isolate MA/18/23089 when primary intestinal enteroids were cultured on Transwell inserts. The basis for the very high capacity of KY/14/18953 to replicate in enteroids is unknown, but this isolate is genetically unique, and it is one of the very few members of the newly defined clade D, which thereby exhibits significant sequence variation in the VP1 region often used for receptor binding. These data suggest that the intestinal epithelium might serve as a site of EV-D68 transmission, particularly for some isolates.</p><p>The factors that mediate EV-D68 infection in the epithelium remain largely unknown, but our studies suggest that the induction of IFN signaling plays a major role in restricting replication in the airway epithelium. We have shown previously that type III IFNs are preferentially induced by enterovirus infections in human enteroids and that this signaling restricts replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, type III IFNs are also the dominant IFNs induced in response to influenza, RSV, measles, and mumps infections of respiratory epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crotta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jewell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Okabayashi et al., 2011</xref>). Although the type I IFN IFN-β was induced in response to EV-D68 infection, its induction was delayed compared to type III IFNs. Of note, we observed significant induction of IFNs even when levels of infection were not detectable, highlighting the potency by which the airway epithelium responds to these infections. The induction of IFNs is likely one mechanism by which the airway restricts EV-D68 replication, which is supported by our findings that treatment of HBE with ruxolitinib increased viral replication. However, it should be noted that ruxolitinib only partially recovered infection, suggesting that other cellular pathways in addition to IFNs also restrict infection. Surprisingly, despite robust IFN induction in response to EV-D68 infection of primary HBE, primary human enteroids did not mount any detectable IFN response to EV-D68 infection, suggesting that there are important differences in the capacity of the respiratory and airway epithelium to sense and respond to EV-D68 infection. The lack of antiviral signaling in infected enteroids would appear to be specific for EV-D68, as we have shown previously that enteroids infected with other enteroviruses including CVB, echoviruses, and EV71 respond via the induction of type III IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Good et al., 2019</xref>). While the mechanistic basis for this is unknown, differences in viral antagonism strategies and/or host detection mechanisms may explain these differences.</p><p>There are currently no available virus-specific treatments or vaccines to prevent AFM, which is an important emerging illness with significant morbidity to young children. Further understanding how EV-D68 targets the airway and/or GI epithelium are critical to improve our understanding of how this virus is transmitted, particularly given increases in its circulation. Our work presented here provides important insights into the dynamics of EV-D68 replication in the human airway and intestinal epithelium and provide ideal models to develop and test anti-EV-D68 therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>HeLa 7B cells were provided by Dr. Jefferey Bergelson, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, and grown in MEM, with 5% FBS, non-essential amino acids, and penicillin/streptomycin.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Is enterovirus D68, currently endemic in the US and many countries in Asia, an enteric or respiratory pathogen? Surprisingly, different isolates have remarkably different phenotypes in cell lines, polarized cells and organoid cultures, supporting the argument that EV68 infection can either be a respiratory or enteric pathogen, which might contribute to its somewhat confounding epidemiology. This is an important paper that supports the interesting concept that EV-D68 is currently evolving for both respiratory and fecal/oral spread.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Respiratory and intestinal epithelial cells exhibit differential susceptibility and innate immune responses to EV-D68&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shin-Ru Shih (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data that support the differential infectivities of different EV68 isolates are strong. Findings of the authors are discussed below, accompanied by requests for clarification and/or improvement of the presentation.</p><p>Figure 1: Six different viral isolates show differential temperature- and cell specificity in cultured lung and intestinal cells. Careful time courses are shown with infectivity measured with good statistics. There is a nice table in Figure 1C that summarizes this, but confusing because, as in the other tables orange, used in the figure for historical isolate MD/09/23229, is a different virus in the table. It would also be good to see panels in which the early time points are more spread out so that we could ascertain any differences between the first infectious cycle and subsequent spread.</p><p>Figure 2. If EV-D68 replicates in the intestine, it should be insensitive to conditions that mimic the small intestine or even the stomach. The six isolates are now winnowed to four based on the categories identified in Figure 1: one growing well under all conditions (KY), the historical isolate that grows primarily in lung cells (MD), primarily in intestinal cells (MA) and primarily at low temperatures (IL). Interestingly, all viruses except the MD strain are resistant to incubation in small intestine-mimicking solutions.</p><p>Figure 3 shows comparative growth in primary lung epithelial cells and compared apical vs basolateral infection and release. While the data are good, the reader is not helped with the interpretation of these interesting but confusing results – the cell model figures only illustrate entry, but the figure shows entry and release.</p><p>Figure 4 shows growth in primary enteroids from two different individuals. The KY strain, which grows under most previous conditions, does in organoids too. The other three strains don't grow in the organoids of one donor. That growth in the enteroids of the second donor are not tested for all samples weakens any arguments made about including these data.</p><p>Figure 5 shows RNA-SEQ data. Differential induction of antiviral responses are shown, but discussed in such a confusing way that the conclusions become unclear. This section needs to be re-written to discuss one variable at a time, for the non-specialist.</p><p>Figure 6 shows that, as suggested from the genomics in Figure 5, in which titers of both the MD and KY isolate are shown to be susceptible to the inhibitor of type 1 IFN signaling in bronchial epithelial cells. However, this does not distinguish whether the infections are controlled by interferons α/β of λ, a conclusion that must be inferred from the RNA-SEQ data, and therefore more carefully explained. Given the format of <italic>eLife</italic>, some of the requisite data to make these arguments could be rescued from the Supplemental Figures.</p><p>In short, this is an important paper that supports the interesting concept that EV-D68 is currently evolving for both respiratory and fecal/oral spread. However, the significance of the findings are not given satisfactory explication and interpretation. pH-resistance is clear even to the non-expert audience of <italic>eLife</italic>, but, in terms of apical vs. basolateral entry and release, what is expected for fecal-oral vs. respiratory spread? This reviewer had to make a table. With respect to the suppression of host responses, some comments on comparative sequence in relevant genes, correlation with viral yield, etc. are necessary to interpret the results.</p><p>The chosen isolates are difficult for the non-specialist to follow. An evolutionary perspective is needed, and should be addressed by the inclusion of:</p><p>1. A sequence and/or evolutionary tree with the tested isolates identified.</p><p>2. Alignments of any viral sequences available in Supplemental Materials, with comments on the protein-coding sequences that are most variable, especially those concerned with host responses. Under normal circumstances, I would suggest that the authors perform sequence analysis of EV-D68 strains they studied and list the similarities and differences of the sequences. If any particular sequences may involve in the different phenotypes, then perform a mutagenesis study to confirm the findings.</p><p>3. Figure, 6D, ruxolitnib, a jak1/2 inhibitor was used to prove that inhibition of ISG signaling would reduce viral replication. The conclusion should be more cautious because the specificity of this inhibitor is not high. Other inhibitors should be tested too.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66687.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The data that support the differential infectivities of different EV68 isolates are strong.

In addition, we have amended the x-axis, as requested, to better represent the early time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 shows comparative growth in primary lung epithelial cells and compared apical vs basolateral infection and release. While the data are good, the reader is not helped with the interpretation of these interesting but confusing results – the cell model figures only illustrate entry, but the figure shows entry and release.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure and associated table/diagrams have been modified to assist with result interpretation. In addition, we have clarified the discussion of these results to assist with interpretation as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 shows growth in primary enteroids from two different individuals. The KY strain, which grows under most previous conditions, does in organoids too. The other three strains don't grow in the organoids of one donor. That growth in the enteroids of the second donor are not tested for all samples weakens any arguments made about including these data.</p></disp-quote><p>There may be some confusion about the interpretation of this figure that we have addressed both in the figure and in the text. The graphs in A and B correspond to the experimental condition of enteroids grown in Matrigel. Experiments are inclusive of at least two independent donor-derived, genetically diverse enteroid lines. The graphs in C-F correspond to the experimental condition of enteroids grown in a single layer on Transwell inserts, again inclusive of at least two independent donor-derived, genetically diverse enteroid lines. Only two strains of virus were tested in these experiments, as they had previously performed best at 37<sup>o</sup>C in the intestinal cell line (Caco-2, Figure 1). Modifications were made to the figure to be consistent with the format/table/diagram changes in revised Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 shows RNA-SEQ data. Differential induction of antiviral responses are shown, but discussed in such a confusing way that the conclusions become unclear. This section needs to be re-written to discuss one variable at a time, for the non-specialist.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5 (revised Figure 7) are data generated from multiplexed Luminex assays, not RNASeq. To eliminate confusion regarding the order of figures and the discussion of results, we have reincorporated the RNAseq data that was previously in the supplement. The RNASeq data are now found in the revised Figure 6, with the Luminex data in revised Figure 7. In addition, discussion of both RNASeq and Luminex has been edited for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 shows that, as suggested from the genomics in Figure 5, in which titers of both the MD and KY isolate are shown to be susceptible to the inhibitor of type 1 IFN signaling in bronchial epithelial cells. However, this does not distinguish whether the infections are controlled by interferons α/β of λ, a conclusion that must be inferred from the RNA-SEQ data, and therefore more carefully explained. Given the format of eLife, some of the requisite data to make these arguments could be rescued from the Supplemental Figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Ruxolitinib abrogates signaling downstream if both type I and III IFNs, thus we agree with the reviewer that conclusion cannot be drawn regarding the contribution of either pathway. To address this concern, we have reorganized figures and relocated data previously in the Supplemental Figures to the main text. In addition, we have modified the discussion to provide a more integrated analysis of these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In short, this is an important paper that supports the interesting concept that EV-D68 is currently evolving for both respiratory and fecal/oral spread. However, the significance of the findings are not given satisfactory explication and interpretation. pH-resistance is clear even to the non-expert audience of eLife, but, in terms of apical vs. basolateral entry and release, what is expected for fecal-oral vs. respiratory spread? This reviewer had to make a table. With respect to the suppression of host responses, some comments on comparative sequence in relevant genes, correlation with viral yield, etc. are necessary to interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have supplemented the discussion around these issues to assist with interpretation for a more general audience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The chosen isolates are difficult for the non-specialist to follow. An evolutionary perspective is needed, and should be addressed by the inclusion of:</p><p>1. A sequence and/or evolutionary tree with the tested isolates identified.</p><p>2. Alignments of any viral sequences available in Supplemental Materials, with comments on the protein-coding sequences that are most variable, especially those concerned with host responses. Under normal circumstances, I would suggest that the authors perform sequence analysis of EV-D68 strains they studied and list the similarities and differences of the sequences. If any particular sequences may involve in the different phenotypes, then perform a mutagenesis study to confirm the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we now include a figure displaying the evolutionary relationship between isolates (Figure 1 in the revised manuscript), which includes a phylogenetic tree (Figure 1A) as well as an overview of the amino acid differences in the polyprotein which demonstrates that VP1 has the greatest number of mutations from isolate to isolate (Figure 1B). We have added a protein sequence alignment as Supplemental Figure 1 (new numbering) showing differences in the VP1 region. We have added additional commentary on regions of conservation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure, 6D, ruxolitnib, a jak1/2 inhibitor was used to prove that inhibition of ISG signaling would reduce viral replication. The conclusion should be more cautious because the specificity of this inhibitor is not high. Other inhibitors should be tested too.</p></disp-quote><p>Ruxolitinib is an FDA-approved selective JAK 1/2 inhibitor. While we agree with the reviewer that the specificity of this inhibitor to distinguish between type I and III IFN signaling is non-selective, it should be noted that Ruxolitinib is used clinically to target JAK signaling given its potency and specificity. We are not aware of more specific inhibitors that could target the pathways downstream of IFNs. Given the relatively non-tractable nature of primary HAE cultures, genetic-based approaches (e.g., RNAi, CRISPR-mediated deletion) are limited. However, we agree that given that we are unable to differentially target the type I and III IFN pathways using this inhibitor, we have amended the text to better reflect this limitation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
