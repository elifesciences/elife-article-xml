factors affects epithelia at the macroscale. To explore this question, we performed nuclear export inhibition (NEI) via leptomycin B and Selinexor treatment, which biases nuclear localization of CRM1-associated E-M factors. We examined changes in collective cellular phenotypes across a range of substrate stiffnesses. Following NEI, soft substrates elevate collective migration of MCF10A cells for up to 24 hr, while stiffer substrates reduce migration at all time points. Our results suggest that NEI disrupts migration through competition between intercellular adhesions and mechanoactivation, generally causing loss of cell–cell coordination. Specifically, across substrate stiffnesses, NEI fosters an atypical E-M state wherein MCF10A cells become both more epithelial and more mesenchymal. We observe that NEI fosters a range of these concurrent phenotypes, from more epithelial shYAP MCF10A cells to more mesenchymal MDCK II cells. α-Catenin emerges as a potential link between E-M states, where it maintains normal levels of intercellular adhesion and transmits mechanoactive characteristics to collective behavior. Ultimately, to accommodate the concurrent states observed here, we propose an expanded E-M model, which may help further understand fundamental biological phenomena and inform pathological treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>nuclear export</kwd><kwd>nucleocytoplasmic transport</kwd><kwd>epithelial–mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM128764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pathak</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nuclear export inhibition reveals concurrent epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes that cause mechanosensitive disorder in collectively migrating epithelia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Collective cell migration facilitates diverse tissue functions, ranging from normal physiological activities, like embryogenesis and tissue repair, to malignant processes, like cancer invasion. While carrying out these functions, grouped cells can manifest diversely – as monolayers, clusters, or streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Etienne-Manneville, 2014</xref>). Regardless of appearance, coordinated migration of the group is a carefully orchestrated balance between intercellular adhesive forces and intracellular propulsive ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trepat and Sahai, 2018</xref>). Cells transmit active forces from myosin molecular motors to their substrate (i.e., traction) to enable their forward motion. Meanwhile, those same motors generate tensile stress across adherens junctions, imparting strength to intercellular adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alert and Trepat, 2020</xref>). Cellular phenotypes arise, in part, from the degree of balance between these forces. When intercellular adhesion is high and anisotropic intracellular force is low, cells appear epithelial, presenting with apicobasal polarization and minimal motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Reversal of that force balance gives rise to a mesenchymal phenotype; cells become more motile and invasive, polarizing front–back in their direction of migration. This shift in cellular characteristics constitutes a process termed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, far from a phenotypic switch, the transition between epithelial and mesenchymal states encompasses a spectrum of intermediate phenotypes, where a range of moderate intercellular adhesion and substrate tractions coincide. Ultimately, it is these intermediate states that enable the varying modes of collective cell migration.</p><p>Migrating epithelia comprise distinct leader and follower cell populations, which cooperate to facilitate group motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Desai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). Cells at the edge, the leaders, exhibit higher polarity and generate higher tractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reffay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reffay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trepat and Sahai, 2018</xref>). These cells apply most of the force required for locomotion, and they retain lower intercellular adhesion to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Matsuzawa et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, cells behind – the followers – supplement leader tractions. Whereas followers maintain better adhesion to neighbors, they also extend cryptic protrusions to help forwardly propel the collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trepat and Sahai, 2018</xref>). What arises from these distinct cell populations is an EMT gradient that fundamentally supports migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarker et al., 2019</xref>). This gradient transpires from the tactful regulation of transcription factors (TFs) and migration-related proteins. Core EMT TFs, including Zeb, Snail, Slug, and Twist directly regulate E-M phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>; and auxiliary migration-related proteins (e.g., YAP, IκBα, SOX9, and HIF2A, FOXA2) further contribute to movement between E-M states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). However, while, on their own, these proteins unidirectionally affect cell fate (i.e., promote or inhibit EMT), it is unknown whether opposing factors compete, cooperate, or cancel during the construction of cell phenotypes.</p><p>To explore this question, we consider that the ability of EMT-TFs and related proteins to engender transcriptional changes hinges on their location within the cell: nuclear localization facilitates transcription of target genes, and cytoplasmic sequestration prevents it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Köster et al., 2005</xref>). Such trafficking between the nucleus and cytoplasm is termed nucleocytoplasmic (NC) transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartwright and Helin, 2000</xref>). It denotes a highly controlled process, where nuclear import and export receptors ferry protein cargos through the nuclear pore complex to coordinate the signaling required for proper cell function. One way to survey interactions between opposing EMT factors is to force the nuclear co-localization of EMT-related proteins by biasing their import. Interfering with the appropriate nuclear export receptor achieves this outcome, and this process is called nuclear export inhibition (NEI). NEI has already been developed as a therapeutic strategy for cancer, where inhibition of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 returns critical tumor suppressor and oncogenic proteins to the nucleus and helps restore cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gravina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gravina et al., 2017</xref>). However, CRM1-based NEI also biases the nuclear import of several key EMT promoters (i.e., SNAIL, YAP, SOX9, HIF2A) and inhibitors (i.e., IκBα, FOXA2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we leverage this function of CRM1-based inhibitors to determine how nuclear co-localization of opposing EMT-related proteins manifests phenotypically. Interestingly, previous studies have found evidence only that CRM1-based NEI reverses EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gravina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gravina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashyap et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashyap et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galinski et al., 2021</xref>). However, E-M characteristics during NEI have been investigated thus far in a relatively limited context, discussed in terms of one or a few markers. Therefore, we wondered whether cellular outcomes could be more intricate than initially credited. To test this hypothesis, we treat monolayers composed of healthy MCF10A human mammary epithelial cells, chosen for their known E-M plasticity and mechanosensitivity, with the CRM1-based inhibitor of nuclear export, leptomycin B (LMB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kudo et al., 1999</xref>). We then assess changes in E-M cellular features and collective migration characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To assess whether the type of cell or method of induced NEI influence phenotypic outcomes, we also report findings for MDCK I and II cells, and for the selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE), Selinexor.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic depicting experimental design and study hypotheses.</title><p>The enlarged panel illustrates normal nucleocytoplasmic transport and accompanying well-regulated gene transcription (left).

Thus, the relative rates of import and export decide transcriptional outcomes. These rates are set by cargo size and geometry but are subject to change depending on the stiffness of the underlying substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elosegui-Artola et al., 2017</xref>). More precisely, high stiffness promotes nuclear flattening and increases the nuclear import of proteins with higher molecular weight and stability. This process is one of the ways that stiffness-induced cellular mechanoactivation occurs, that is, through Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP)-mediated signaling. Therefore, amidst competing EMT cues, substrate stiffness may contribute rate-dependent differences or additional mechanoactive features to phenotypic outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fattet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wei et al., 2015</xref>). To uncover this potential stiffness dependency, we compare NEI effects for MCF10A epithelia seeded on polyacrylamide gels spanning a range of stiffnesses.</p><p>Given the complexity of EMT signaling arising from the combined NEI and substrate cues, in this study we describe epithelial and mesenchymal cellular traits comprehensively, using physical characteristics, migratory phenotypes, together with candidate gene and protein expressions, as discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Ultimately, we find that NEI generates – in parallel – cellular characteristics classically categorized as epithelial or mesenchymal, and ultimately forces competition between cellular E-M states. What arises is highly disordered collective migration; yet, whether NEI promotes or inhibits migration depends distinctly on the underlying matrix stiffness. Together, these experiments demonstrate that NEI traverses length scales – concurrently trapping E-M factors, jumbling cellular E-M states, and disrupting grouped epithelial migration. Overall, the presented work suggests that epithelial and mesenchymal states are not necessarily mutually exclusive, which has implications for how cells may manipulate phenotypes to promote cancer, wound healing, and embryonic development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NEI reinforces epithelial characteristics in a stiffness-dependent manner</title><p>Previous investigations have proposed that NEI reverses EMT, and mechanistic studies indicate this reversal may transpire via NFκB Inhibitor Alpha (IκBα)-dependent inhibition of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFκB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gravina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azmi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gravina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashyap et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashyap et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galinski et al., 2021</xref>). However, E-M characteristics during NEI have been investigated thus far in a relatively limited context, discussed in terms of one or a few markers, and with culture performed primarily on tissue culture plastic. Because NEI causes nuclear localization of multiple competing EMT-related proteins and stiff substrates themselves trigger EMT through mechanoactive signaling, we wondered whether the manner in which NEI changes cellular E-M state could be more intricate than initially credited. To investigate this question, we perform a broad analysis of cell phenotype across mechanically varying substrates. Here, we begin by assessing IκBα localization and intercellular adhesion strength to determine how NEI influences epithelial characteristics in our model system.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nuclear export inhibition (NEI) enriches epithelial features in MCF10A collectives.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images for epithelial characteristics of WT MCF10A on 0.5, 2, and 50 kPa polyacrylamide gels.

Therefore, to determine whether epithelial characteristics changed with substrate stiffness, we surveyed the localization of IκBα and junctional p120 levels on 0.5, 2, and 50 kPa polyacrylamide gel. Consistent with prior studies in cancer cells, we found that NEI contributed to higher IκBα nucleocytoplasmic (N:C) ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>). The preferential nuclear localization of IκBα developed in both leader and follower cells. However, the strength of epithelial characteristics did depend on substrate stiffness. Nuclear localization of IκBα was higher on 0.5 kPa than on 2 and 50 kPa, and junctional p120 levels exhibited a matching stiffness effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Yet remarkably, across stiffnesses, the conventional relationship between leader and follower cells – where followers adhere more strongly to their neighbors – was preserved. Together, these findings suggest that mechanoactivation, as translated through substrate stiffness, limits NEI’s ability to inhibit NFκB and reinforce cell–cell adhesions. Despite this, NEI upholds traditional leader–follower cell–cell adhesion gradients independent of substrate stiffness.</p><p>Beyond this established mechanism of epithelial reinforcement during NEI, we wanted to determine whether other traditionally epithelial markers were affected. We measured expression of the epithelial marker gene Phosphatase And Tensin Homolog (PTEN), and found that it was upregulated across substrate stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated an antagonistic interaction between NFκB activation and PTEN expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). We then examined whether NEI changed the integrity of tight junctions by measuring contiguous length of Tight Junction Protein 1 (ZO-1). We found that NEI significantly increased ZO-1 branch length across substrate stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Altogether, these findings of elevated nucleocytoplasmic IκBα ratio, increased protein expression of p120 and ZO-1, and upregulated PTEN gene expression indicate that NEI reinforces epithelial characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mechanoactivation during NEI evolves together with reinforced intercellular adhesion to promote a concurrent epithelial–mesenchymal state</title><p>Because NEI causes nuclear accumulation of the mechanoactivating protein YAP, together with multiple EMT-promoting proteins (i.e., SNAIL, SOX9, HIF2A), we wondered whether mechanoactive cellular characteristics would develop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To answer this question, we first validated that nuclear localization of YAP occurs during NEI across substrate stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, F</xref>). Confirmation of elevated nuclear YAP signified that mechanoactivation might be present independent of substrate triggers. Interestingly, we also found that the shift toward nuclear localization of YAP occurred in both leader and follower cells. Thus, while NEI preserved the intercellular adhesion gradients customary to leader and follower populations, the associated mechanoactivation gradients dissolved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mechanoactive and mesenchymal features develop in MCF10A epithelia during nuclear export inhibition (NEI).</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Relative gene expression for mesenchymal markers ZEB1, SNAIL1, and TWIST1 on 0.5, 2, and 50 kPa polyacrylamide gels.

During migration, we found, with high frequency, that NEI caused leader cells to protrude as thin extensions from the monolayer baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Comparatively, control leaders maintained more conventional fan-like shapes, even at high stiffnesses. Contributing to these morphological differences, the actin coherency of protruding cells was higher following NEI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>); meanwhile, pMLC expression was elevated universally in leaders and followers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Curiously, these results suggest that epithelial characteristics (e.g., reinforced intercellular adhesions) and mechanoactive features (e.g., higher cytoskeletal forces, front–back polarization) evolve together during NEI.</p><p>To assess whether these mechanoactive features extended to traditional mesenchymal markers, we surveyed expression of the EMT TFs, Zinc Finger E-Box Binding Homeobox 1 (ZEB1), Snail Family Transcriptional Repressor 1 (SNAIL1), and Twist Family BHLH Transcription Factor 1 (TWIST1). We also assessed changes in vimentin, which contributes to EMT by promoting cytoskeletal reorganization and focal adhesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, we measured cell traction, where higher tractions indicate mesenchymal-like function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mekhdjian et al., 2017</xref>). We found that NEI increased all these mesenchymal markers. ZEB1, SNAIL1, and TWIST1 were upregulated on 0.5 and 50 kPa polyacrylamide gels, while TWIST1 expression increased significantly on 2 kPa gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). Therefore, while prior studies found that ZEB1 and SNAIL1 negatively regulate PTEN expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fedorova et al., 2022</xref>), interestingly, these findings indicate that interference with NFκB, or other signaling changes due to NEI, enables simultaneous expression of all these factors. Vimentin expression increased on all substrate stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E</xref>); and while control monolayers exhibited the characteristic pattern of high traction at the leading edge and lower traction closer to the monolayer core, LMB empowered both leader and follower cells to generate high tractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result indicates that the changes in gene and protein expression after NEI support mesenchymal-like changes in cell function. All taken together, these results demonstrate that NEI elevates mesenchymal characteristics in concert with epithelial ones, indicating the presence of a concurrent epithelial–mesenchymal state.</p><p>To determine whether this concurrent E-M state was exclusive to our method of induced NEI (i.e., treatment with LMB), we examined epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics in WT MCF10A cells treated with Selinexor. Treatment with this NEI-promoting drug similarly fostered elevated epithelial and mesenchymal cellular traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that NEI may generally be capable of instituting concurrent E-M phenotypes. Meanwhile, to assess whether NEI could induce concurrent E-M states in other cell types, we examined epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics in MDCK I and MDCK II cells treated with LMB. MDCK I cells exhibited a more typical EMT response, with mesenchymal-like cells clearly separating from the collective group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). On the other hand, MDCK II findings were consistent with a mesenchymally shifted concurrent phenotype, where cells exhibited prominent mesenchymal characteristics while retaining more subtle epithelial ones. Overall, these results from MCF10A, MDCK I, and MDCK II cells indicate that NEI can foster a diverse range of cellular responses. While prior studies in cancer cells found only mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) after NEI, interestingly, our findings indicate the potential for a range of concurrent E-M phenotypes, as well as EMT. Ultimately, the capacity for NEI to drive such diverse cellular responses indicates that the phenotypic outcome may depend on the initial proteomic profile of the cells being studied.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NEI invariably leads to migratory disorder, but changes in migration speed depend on substrate stiffness</title><p>Because epithelial cells balance intercellular adhesion and mechanoactivation gradients to facilitate collective movement, we hypothesized that the disturbances observed in MCF10A cells could interfere with typical patterns of migration.

For 2 kPa, this decrease was mediated in initial stages by reduced cellular speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Meanwhile, the progressive loss of order and associated increase in cell backtracking exacerbated the overall velocity loss with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, N</xref>). For 50 kPa, early time points (0–6 hr) showed only slight decreases in net migration velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Higher cell backtracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>) accounted primarily for the net migration slowing, since cell speeds were only marginally lower compared to vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), and order was temporarily preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). Across time points, cell speeds on 50 kPa were comparable to vehicle. Therefore, 50 kPa results resemble 0.5 kPa, where, although speeds were higher, they remained similar to vehicle control. Overall, despite only marginal losses in cell speed on 50 kPa, backtracking together with rising disorder facilitates the observed decrease in collective velocity. Taken as a whole, these findings depict changes to the conventional patterns of collective migration during NEI, where disorder and cell backtracking escalate, independent of substrate stiffness. These results further uncover stiffness-dependent NEI outcomes, where, counter to reports of migration inhibition exclusively, NEI promotes migration on soft substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Disruption of Golgi polarization in leaders and global elevation of gm130 expression underlie NEI-induced disorder</title><p>The Golgi apparatus contributes to front–rear polarization by orienting in front of the nucleus in the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ravichandran et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the associated transport of proteins and nucleation of microtubules toward the front of migrating cells supports directed motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yadav et al., 2009</xref>). To determine whether changes in the Golgi influenced rising disorder during NEI, we analyzed Golgi Matrix Protein gm130, a Golgi marker that assists microtubule nucleation and the development of mesenchymal cellular phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rivero et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baschieri et al., 2014</xref>).

While leader cells customarily provide directional cues for followers, after NEI, the stiffness-dependent polarization of leaders disappeared. Moreover, leader polarization percentages dropped below those reported for control cells. This finding was consistent with the cyclic protrusion and retraction of leader cells observed during migration with NEI and presumably contributed to leading-edge instability. It also reflects previous reports where the rearward position of the Golgi emerged after transition to a mesenchymal cellular state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Natividad et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, the effect of NEI on follower polarization was more subtle and changed with substrate stiffness.</p><p>On 0.5 and 50 kPa, NEI increased follower polarization. This increased Golgi polarization appropriately corresponded to the higher junctional stability, velocities, speeds, order, and backtracking observed during migration. Congruently, the lower polarization on 2 kPa corresponded to reduced migration parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, while NEI’s impact on Golgi orientation changed with substrate stiffness, its effect on gm130 expression itself was consistent – displaying increased levels across stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Together, these results suggest that, in this system, gm130 expression may support the cytoskeletal rearrangement required for the front–back mesenchymal-like polarization observed in leaders, and Golgi orientation itself may contribute to the loss of order observed during NEI.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Leading-edge instability and combined epithelial–mesenchymal characteristics promote multicellular stream formation during NEI</title><p>Previous studies established that leading-edge instability, higher intercellular adhesion, localized mechanoactivation, and coordinated cellular velocities together support the formation of multicellular streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vishwakarma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarker et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we have shown that NEI destabilizes the leading edge, demonstrated via decreased leader polarization; reinforced intercellular adhesion, measured via increased junctional p120 and ZO-1; caused mechanoactivation, evidenced via higher YAP N:C ratio, pMLC expression, and F-actin coherency; and contributed invasive characteristics, shown through elevated expression of gm130 and vimentin. Therefore, despite the reduced overall coordination of velocity during NEI, reflected in low order parameter, we hypothesized that, at some level, NEI might encourage multicellular streaming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To investigate this hypothesis, as previously, we defined a cell stream as a protrusion of two or more cells in succession from the monolayer baseline, such that protrusion length was more than twice its width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarker et al., 2019</xref>). After examining migration time-lapses, we found that transient cell streams formed, even during migration with vehicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). However, these streams formed at relatively low frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>) and with few cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). The presence of streams in this control condition suggests that fluctuations in intercellular adhesion and mechanoactivation at the leading edge were sufficient to form small, transient streams. By contrast, streams during NEI were more exaggerated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), evolving at higher frequency and with more cells in each stream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I, J</xref>). Higher stream formation during NEI thus indicates that adhesion strength and mechanoactivation may stimulate brief periods of cell streaming, even in regions of high disorder. Therefore, while previous studies show that structural changes in the underlying matrix (e.g., collagen fiber orientation, topography) trigger cell streaming via adhesion-based signaling and consequent mechanoactive protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vishwakarma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarker et al., 2019</xref>), these results highlight that streaming can also arise from direct modifications to nuclear export.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>YAP silencing shifts NEI-affected cells toward an epithelial state by strengthening intercellular adhesion and attenuating mechanoactivation</title><p>NEI causes nuclear localization of YAP, which generally promotes mechanoactive phenotypes, such as that previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Consistent with this reduction in the cytoskeletal features required for mesenchymal presentation, YAP-silenced leaders formed much shorter protrusions at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), and multicellular streams were also inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that isolating YAP from affected cargos attenuates mesenchymal aspects of the combined E-M phenotype induced during NEI.</p><p>This shift in E-M state led to significant changes in collective migration. For NEI on 0.5 kPa, YAP-silenced cells exhibited sudden drops in net migration velocity beginning around 12 hr. Migration on 2 and 50 kPa exhibited similar drops, which preceded the complete arrest of net migration for all stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Moreover, at later time points, cells transiently reversed their direction of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Results suggest that changes in migration order prompted those changes in velocity. At 12 hr, the sudden drop in net velocity coincided with a sudden drop in migration order, and at later time points, migration velocity, and order parameter jointly oscillated about zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J, K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A–C, J–L</xref>). Interestingly, and contrary to WT, YAP-silenced cells exhibited non-monotonic increases in cell backtracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3E, G, I</xref>). Inflection points for backtracking coincided with inflection points for net velocity, order parameter, and speed. These points were present across substrate stiffnesses and reflected transient oscillations in order within the monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In general, the observed worsening of net velocity and order losses during NEI is consistent with previous findings of impersistent cell motility following YAP depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mason et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, while YAP contributes to mechanoactive features during NEI, it also provides crucial directional cues to assist collective migration.

Cells at the leading edge best epitomized mesenchymal characteristics, exhibiting more morphological polarization, aided by their separation from the cells behind. Cells residing closer to the monolayer center remained bunched due to contact inhibition. However, cell–cell adhesion there was still low. NEI generally caused re-epithelialization of α-cat KD cells, during which cells lost front–back polarity, formed discrete colonies, and dissolved leader–follower relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, D</xref>). However, while NEI caused a nearly three times increase in intercellular adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and promoted nuclear accumulation of IκBα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), p120 expression was markedly lower than WT for all conditions. These results suggest that interrupting force propagation through intercellular adhesions decreases the epithelial features of NEI’s concurrent E-M phenotype.</p><p>Without this cooperation between intercellular adhesions and intracellular forces intrinsic to migrating epithelia, cells treated with vehicle migrated as a mesenchymal collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Theveneau and Mayor, 2013</xref>). α-cat KD cells migrated with lower speed and order, exhibiting more backtracking and thus lower net velocity relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I, J</xref>). However, likely arising from contact inhibition, these cells developed order and net velocity over time. Meanwhile, in removing the cooperative force balance, data suggest we also severed the link required to sustain NEI’s concurrent E-M state. Without force propagation between cells, the effect of NEI on migration was time dependent across stiffnesses. Initially, NEI elevated net velocity. From 0–4 hr on 0.5 and 50 kPa, net velocities were higher than vehicle control. On 2 kPa, this initial phase extended to 8 hr. After that phase, velocities decreased and approached zero by 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Differences in order underlay the differences in velocity. During the initial time points, cells migrated with slightly higher order and speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>) and thus achieved higher collective velocity. However, while higher speeds endured for the time-lapse duration, there was progressive disarray and loss of net velocity. Cell backtracking mirrored these changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Overall, findings suggest that α-catenin knockdown exacerbates the loss of order during NEI to facilitate the arrest of net migration. In other words, intercellular adhesion reinforcement and YAP may jointly enhance cohesion to slow the loss of order during NEI. Outcomes from removing α-catenin further imply an unusual partnership paramount to the concurrent E-M phenotype, where stronger intercellular adhesion facilitates the propagation of higher forces through the collective to sustain the simultaneous E-M state.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Classically, epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) phenotypes exist along a single continuum, where cells traverse from E to M via the gradual loss of epithelial characteristics and the accompanying gain of mesenchymal ones. At the same time, it is understood that EMT is highly complex. The broad array of TFs and RNA regulators involved in EMT give rise to vast diversity in EMT programs. Given this diversity, it is accepted that some biological markers may appear in conflict with one another for simple EMT categorization. Acknowledging this, groups have emphasized that single biological markers are not sufficient to categorize cellular states and that functional cellular changes should take precedence for appropriate categorization of E-M phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). However, together, these statements pose a compelling question about the interaction between EMT-promoting and -inhibiting TFs during the development of cell phenotypes: do these proteins inherently compete, cooperate, or cancel? Here, we use LMB, a CRM1-based inhibitor of nuclear export, to explore this question. Our findings indicate that EMT-promoting and -inhibiting pathways can elevate epithelial and mesenchymal features simultaneously (indicating some degree of cooperation), but results also suggest that cell-level epithelial and mesenchymal features compete, which gives rise to disordered epithelia.</p><p>Across substrate stiffnesses, LMB-treated MCF10A collectives simultaneously elevate expression of epithelial and mesenchymal marker genes. Leader and follower cells exhibit intercellular adhesion strengthening, mediated by p120 and ZO-1. However, in spite of these stronger intercellular adhesions, leaders develop highly polarized morphology, and their protrusions contain more coherent actin filaments. Mechanoactivation markers: YAP, pMLC, vimentin, and gm130 expression globally increase, while follower cells generate stronger tractions. Ultimately, within the collective, cells manifest atypical E-M states, in which elements at opposite ends of the conventional spectrum coexist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Interestingly, these results suggest the classical view that epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes are purely antagonistic – and accordingly exist along a single continuum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.I) – could be incomplete.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary schematic depicting nuclear export inhibition (NEI) outcomes for WT MCF10A, shYAP MCF10A, α-catenin knockdown MCF10A, and MDCK II cells.</title><p>(A.I) Schematic depicting the current understanding of the epithelial–mesenchymal (E-M) continuum, which requires that cells must lose epithelial traits as they acquire mesenchymal ones.

Within such simultaneous states, we also demonstrate that epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics can individually vary. We show that excluding YAP from the NEI-affected cargos attenuates some mesenchymal phenotypic components while strengthening epithelial ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We also show that, in the absence of p120, MDCK II cells significantly increase mesenchymal characteristics in response to NEI, while adhesions are maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). The existing conceptual E-M model provides for the loss of epithelial traits precisely in step with the gain of mesenchymal ones (i.e., EMT), and for the reverse process (i.e., MET). However, it is unable to explain the concurrent states we observe. Therefore, our findings indicate that an expanded model may be necessary to fully capture the range of biological phenotypes. Here, we propose a model where epithelial and mesenchymal features can traverse separate continua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>.II). We allocate the terms epithelial and mesenchymal transducers to represent the collection of E-M proteins within the cell, and propose that they strongly drive their respective phenotype, indicated by thick links. Meanwhile the opposite transducer prevents the opposite phenotype only weakly, indicated by the thin links. Ultimately, this change to the model accommodates EMT phenotypes as they stand: epithelial, partial EMT, and mesenchymal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>.I–III), but allows for varying degrees of concurrent E-M features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>.IV–VII).</p><p>This model expansion may be needed to explain existing migratory phenomena. For example, one problem fundamental to collective migration is how follower cells maintain high adhesion to their neighbors while simultaneously extending cryptic protrusions to assist grouped migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu and Lu, 2021</xref>). Meanwhile, jointly elevated epithelial and mesenchymal signatures have been observed in chemo-resistant and aggressive cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xuan et al., 2020</xref>). Taking these phenomena as an example, investigating migratory phenotypes within a framework that allows for simultaneous enrichment of epithelial and mesenchymal features, like that we observed here, may provide a more complete understanding of key biological processes and assist the identification of appropriate therapeutic options.</p><p>Our results indicate that signaling pathways may cooperatively elevate epithelial and mesenchymal traits, but they also suggest that epithelial and mesenchymal traits are themselves antagonistic. It’s been shown that higher cell–cell adhesion predisposes cells to repolarization cues from neighbors and reduces the contribution of polarization stemming from mechanosensitive adhesion-based promotion of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Desai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). Typically, leader cells exhibit lower intercellular adhesion, which allows them to polarize front–back and generate most of the traction that propels the collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reffay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trepat and Sahai, 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, follower cells generally retain higher cell–cell adhesion and put forth lower traction. NEI jumbles these leader–follower phenotypes, fostering a collective where all cells have stronger intercellular adhesions, which makes them more subject to repolarization from their neighbors; and all cells generate high traction, which also allows them to more individually drive migration and contribute to repolarization of their neighbors. Across substrate stiffnesses, what results is progressively disordered cell migration during NEI. From a broader standpoint, these results emphasize that epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics can exist in high degrees concurrently but not necessarily cooperatively.</p><p>Results also suggest that the simultaneous presence of these competing characteristics may be facilitated by adherens junctions. Our experiments demonstrated that knockdown of α-catenin suspended the concurrent phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Given α-catenin’s role in recruiting F-actin to adherens junctions and instituting tension across cell–cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ladoux and Mège, 2017</xref>), this is perhaps not surprising. It indicates that concurrent E-M states require cooperation between intercellular adhesion and intracellular forces. On the other hand, MDCK cells without junctional p120 exhibited more mesenchymal-like states. Together, these results suggest that adherens junctions contain the components required to resist the concurrent phenotype’s collapse to both an epithelial state (i.e., α-catenin) and to classic EMT (i.e., E-cadherin). In conjunction, these results highlight the diversity of cellular outcomes, spanning broadened E-M spectra, following NEI.</p><p>Clinically, SINE-based NEI has potential to treat cancer – largely for its ability to re-localize escaped tumor suppressors to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashyap et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashyap et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galinski et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gravina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gravina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turner et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple studies investigating Selinexor have suggested that NEI causes EMT reversal in cancer cells, with inhibition of NFκB by IκBα playing a significant role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kashyap et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kashyap et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galinski et al., 2021</xref>). This finding is particularly interesting in light of our findings of mechanoactivation after Selinexor treatment. It may be that NEI differentially affects cells based on their distinct proteomic profiles, as we observed here in MCF10A and MDCK cells. Or, it is plausible that standard tissue culture plastic masks some of NEI’s mechanoactive outcomes because of changes in nuclear pore selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Elosegui-Artola et al., 2017</xref>). Comprehensively surveying mechanoactive and mesenchymal markers, and measuring cellular outcomes on substrates better approximating the stiffnesses of physiological tissues, would answer this question. Ultimately, whether concurrent E-M outcomes manifest in clinical implementations of NEI, and more pointedly, whether mechanoactivation could antagonize therapeutic effects remains to be seen.</p><p>To put these results in context, we acknowledge limitations of our study. Ultimately, our experiments sought to determine how EMT-promoting and -inhibiting proteins interact to enact cell phenotypes. We used NEI to implement the complex situation where competing EMT-related proteins were simultaneously maintained in the nucleus. However, CRM1 has ~241 cargos and therefore affects many proteins beyond EMT scope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Turner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). To account for this nonspecificity, we frame our conclusions as phenotypic outcomes of NEI. For more finely tuned phenotypic manipulations, the localization of E-M proteins would need to be controlled individually. Such future studies may reveal more detailed genomic and proteomic regulation of concurrent E-M phenotypes.</p><p>In sum, here we show that NEI promotes biological (gene, protein expression) and functional (morphological, migratory) changes that expand the traditional epithelial–mesenchymal continuum. We propose these changes constitute a concurrent E-M state in which highly epithelial and highly mesenchymal characteristics coexist. With MCF10A YAP knockdown and MDCK II cells, we demonstrate that the concurrent state has an adjustable range, where cells appear more epithelial or more mesenchymal, but retain prominent characteristics of both phenotypes. Meanwhile, results from MCF10A α-catenin knockdown cells indicate that the simultaneous phenotype hinges on cooperation between intercellular adhesion and intracellular force, with adherens junctions emerging as the operative link. Ultimately, this concurrent manifestation expands the classical interpretation of phenotypes, and indicates that epithelial and mesenchymal traits may exist on separate continua. These findings highlight an increasingly diverse range of epithelial–mesenchymal phenotypes and thus further encourage a more comprehensive assessment of E-M cellular features as a basis for phenotypic categorization. Overall, this expanded understanding of E-M states may help inform future studies involving epithelial mechanobiology and pathology.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation: <italic>competing forces</italic></title><p>At a basic level, the cohesion of epithelial collectives derives from a balance between intercellular adhesion strength and cell-generated traction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Trepat and Sahai, 2018</xref>). After NEI, the migratory order of epithelia was generally low; however, it appeared to exhibit a biphasic relationship with substrate stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed that cell–cell adhesion strength was lowest on 2 kPa and higher on both the softer and stiffer substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Meanwhile, mechanoactivation was high across stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). These distinct outcomes suggest that NEI may disrupt the balance between intercellular adhesion and cell traction required for collective cohesion. As an illustration of this idea, higher percentage losses in migration speed, velocity, order, and polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F–K</xref>) correlated with lower adhesion strength (i.e., 2 kPa). This biphasic trend across migration parameters extended to stream formation. The higher disorder on 2 kPa implied that epithelia could encounter greater leading-edge instability, and 2 kPa indeed coincided with a higher protrusion rate of multicellular streams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1J</xref>). However, despite this increase in stream formation, lower cell cohesion limited the number of cells that successfully coordinated their velocities to establish streams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Altogether, the balance between intercellular adhesion and mechanoactivation was most uneven on 2 kPa, and the disorder was worst there. Therefore, these findings suggest that, while NEI enhances both epithelial and mesenchymal traits, cells may not develop strong enough intercellular adhesions to balance cellular tractions, and this imbalance may ultimately contribute to the observed migratory disorder.</p><p>In contrast to the disordered migratory patterns of the concurrent phenotype observed after NEI, under normal conditions, follower cells sustain high cooperation between epithelial and mesenchymal features. In our experiments, epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics extended far from the phenotypic center point. However, typical follower cells maintain lower cell–cell adhesion and traction. Therefore, it is possible that the degree of cooperation during concurrent E-M may ultimately depend on the distance of either E-M component from the phenotypic center – that is, the magnitude difference between intercellular adhesive forces and cell-generated tractions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCF10A breast, epithelial</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #: CRL-10317</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">shYAP MCF10A breast, epithelial</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. Gregory Longmore<break/>Nasrollahi, S., Walter, C., Loza, A.

synthesis and collagen coating</title><p>Polyacrylamide gels were synthesized via free-radical polymerization, according to established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischer et al., 2012</xref>). Precursor solutions were formulated from acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, and ultrapure water. To yield gel stiffnesses of 0.5, 2, and 50 kPa, respective acrylamide and bis-acrylamide percentages of 4%/0.2%, 5%/0.228%, and 12%/0.6% were used. Gels were attached to glass coverslips for immunofluorescent analyses and to glass-bottomed plates for time-lapse imaging. To facilitate gel attachment, these glass surfaces were activated by treatment with plasma and bind silane solution (94.7% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, and 0.3% bind silane for 10 min). After treatment, surfaces were rinsed with ethanol and air-dried. Precursor polyacrylamide solutions were polymerized by adding 10% ammonium sulfate and <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>′,<italic>N</italic>′-tetramethylethylene (TEMED) at respective ratios of 1:200 and 1:2000 vol/vol. For immunofluorescent experiments, these final solutions were immediately dispensed onto Sigmacote-treated microscope slides and covered with plasma-activated glass coverslips; meanwhile, for time-lapse experiments, final solutions were dispensed onto plasma-activated glass-bottomed plates and covered with Sigmacote-treated glass coverslips. Solutions were allowed to polymerize for 30 min, then Sigmacote-treated surfaces were removed to expose one face of the formed gels. Gels were functionalized by 10-min incubation with Sulfo-SANPAH solution (50 mM HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer and 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-SANPAH in dH<sub>2</sub>O) under 365 nm UV. After rinsing, collagen type I solution (0.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) was applied, and gels were stored at 4°C overnight.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture and colony seeding</title><p>All cell lines were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. MCF10A cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM)/F12 1:1 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 100 ng/ml cholera toxin, 10 µg/ml insulin, and 0.2% Normocin. Culture media for MDCK I cells consisted of MEM supplemented with Earle’s salts, 2 mM glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 0.2% Normocin. Meanwhile, culture media for MDCK II cells consisted of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.2% Normocin. Media was changed every 3 days during cell expansion. Cell line identities were authenticated using STR profiling, and cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. To prepare for cell colony seeding, collagen-coated polyacrylamide gels were rinsed gently with PBS and allowed to dry for 20 min. A volume of 5 µl, containing 18,000 cells, was then seeded at the center of each gel. Seeded cells were incubated for 24 hr to facilitate attachment and acclimatization to gel stiffness. After this incubation period, cells were treated with 100 nM LMB (constituted in 100% ethanol), 500 nM Selinexor (SEL, constituted in 100% ethanol), or vehicle. Treated cell colonies were then used for immunofluorescent staining or time-lapse imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy</title><p>Treated cells were cultured for 24 hr, then were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Fixed cells were rinsed and stored at 4°C until immunostaining. For cell membrane permeabilization, wells were incubated with 0.3% Triton X-100 in 2% wt/vol bovine serum albumin (BSA) at room temperature for 10 min. Then wells were blocked using 2% BSA in PBS, with overnight incubation at 4°C. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4°C. After rinsing, secondary antibodies were also incubated overnight at 4°C. After secondary incubation, wells were rinsed and incubated with DAPI and phalloidin (if applicable) for 45 min. After final rinses, gels were coverslipped with mounting medium, and allowed to dry overnight. Immunostained cells were imaged at ×40 on a confocal microscope. To facilitate sample comparability, for all MCF10A ± LMB experiments, optimal capture settings were determined for each antigen based on the highest observed signals, then those settings were maintained for the duration of imaging. Imaging settings were changed to accommodate different signal intensities for MDCK cell lines and SINE experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Time-lapse microscopy</title><p>Time-lapse imaging was performed using a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope. Phase contrast images were acquired at 10-min intervals for a 24-hr period using a ×10 objective. For the duration of imaging, cell colonies were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> using an attached incubation chamber.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative image analysis</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, results for each condition (vehicle, LMB) reflect 8 FOVs from 2 biological replicates. Collected phase contrast time-lapse images were analyzed for the presence of multicellular streams. Inclusion criteria for streams were: (1) protrusion of 2 or more cells in succession from the monolayer baseline and (2) a protrusion length greater than twice its width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sarker et al., 2019</xref>). To account for differences in image orientation, the number of streams counted over 24 hr was normalized to the baseline length of the migrating cell colony. All protein expression was measured in ImageJ. Nucleocytoplasmic (N:C) ratio was calculated as the nuclear intensity integrated over the nuclear area divided by the cytoplasmic intensity integrated over the cytoplasmic area. For YAP, N:C ratio was measured in at least 55 leader cells and 220 follower cells per condition. p120 expression (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 39 leader cells and 55 follower cells from at least 6 FOVs reflecting 2 biological replicates per condition) was quantified as the average signal intensity integrated over a 10-µm line, where the line lay perpendicular to the junction and its midpoint rested at the junction center. Three measurements per cell–cell junction were averaged to define a single junction intensity. For α-cat KD, adhesions in cells treated with vehicle were mostly undetectable, so p120 expression was considered an unreliable measure. Instead, differences between groups were assessed via the number of visible adhesions. To measure ZO-1 expression, branch lengths were computed using the AnalyzeSkeleton plugin, where <italic>n</italic> reflected the number of branch measurements. Vimentin expression was measured as the integrated density within the monolayer region and normalized by the number of cells within the same region (<italic>n</italic> = 10 images per condition). pMLC and gm130 expression were measured as intensity within the monolayer, and were normalized to DAPI signal. Actin coherency was measured using the OrientationJ plugin, where <italic>n</italic> reflected the number of coherency measurements. Protrusions from the monolayer baseline were outlined manually, and the vector field was extracting using a grid size of 10 and an <italic>α</italic> value of 2. Because α-cat KD cells segregated into distinct colonies without clear polarization, coherency was measured for all cells. To assess Golgi orientation, the angle between the direction of migration and the line connecting a particular cell’s nuclear centroid to its Golgi centroid was measured (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 50 leader cells and 250 follower cells from at least 8 FOVs reflecting 2 biological replicates per condition). A polarized Golgi was considered to be one where this angle was less than 60°, as defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mason et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Particle image velocimetry</title><p>Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to extract spatiotemporal velocity profiles from time-lapse images of migrating cell colonies. This analysis was performed using the MATLAB PIVlab package. The velocity field was calculated using 3 passes, with decreasing window sizes of 64, 32, and 16 pixels. All migration characteristics and heat maps were computed using MATLAB code (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 6 FOV from 2 biological replicates per condition). The degree of cell cohesion was measured using order parameter, defined as the cosine of the angle between a single velocity vector and the average velocity vector for the respective time point. Meanwhile, when the value of that angle was greater or less than 90°, the vector was counted as backtracking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Traction force microscopy</title><p>To measure gel deformations, 1 µm fluorescent polystyrene beads were mixed with 0.5 kPa polyacrylamide solution at a concentration of 20 million beads per mL gel solution. Images of beads at the gel surface (&lt;10 µm depth) were captured during migration with vehicle or LMB. Three separate gels were analyzed per condition, with a total of 11 and 15 FOVs for vehicle and LMB-treated cells, respectively. An image of the relaxed beads, taken after cells were detached from gels using 0.5% trypsin, was used for reference to determine bead displacements. Bead displacements and cell-generated tractions were calculated using the Particle Image Velocimetry and Traction Force Microscopy ImageJ plugins, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tseng et al., 2012</xref>). A minimum threshold of 2 Pa was set to remove potential noise from the data. Heat maps were generated using MATLAB code.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction</title><p>The expression of EMT marker genes was measured using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), according to kit instructions. The extracted RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop Microvolume Spectrophotometer and was subsequently standardized to 2 ng/µl in nuclease free water. RNA was converted to cDNA using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems), according to kit instructions. qPCR was performed using TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to product instructions, with probes for PTEN, ZEB1, SNAIL1, TWIST1, GAPDH, and B2M. EMT genes were normalized to the GAPDH housekeeping gene to compare relative expression levels between groups (<italic>n</italic> = 12 wells from 4 biological replicates per condition).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Bar and line plots are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was determined using two-way analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc comparisons. For tractions and all measurements from MDCK I, II, and Selinexor experiments, significance was assessed using two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test. Differences were considered significant for *p &lt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

Previous work had shown that nuclear export inhibition (NEI), which is employed as a therapeutic strategy to treat cancer, traps several known regulators of epithelial-mesenchymal (E-M) phenotypes; however, how NEI alters the mechano-response and collective cell migration of healthy epithelia on substrates of varying stiffness was not described. The convincing new results show that NEI induces an intermediate E-M state where cells concurrently strengthen intercellular adhesions and develop mechano-active characteristics. Migration of epithelial monolayers becomes disordered and leads to multicellular streaming.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81048.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Michelot</surname><given-names>Alphee</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02me5cy06</institution-id><institution>Institut de Biologie du Développement</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bazellières</surname><given-names>Elsa</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02me5cy06</institution-id><institution>IBDM</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Nuclear export inhibition jumbles epithelial-mesenchymal states and gives rise to migratory disorder in healthy epithelia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, this work has many shortcomings that need to be addressed.</p><p>In this study, the work focuses on the impact of nuclear export inhibition (NEI) during the complex process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Over the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that CRM1-related NEI is capable of reversing the EMT process. Inhibition of CRM1 has been developed as a therapeutic strategy against cancer, as it has been shown that inhibition of the nuclear export receptor CRM1 is able to return oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins to the nucleus, thereby restoring cell cycle regulation. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still difficult to understand. To address this issue, the authors use MCF10A cells with the CRM1 inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB), and gels with different stiffnesses to completely inhibit nuclear export or to modulate nucleocytoplasmic transport dynamics respectively. The attractive conclusion is that NEI forces competition between cellular E-M states, which leads to disorded collective cell migration.</p><p>The proposed study by Krull et al. is interesting, but I am not convinced that the results presented have the potential significance, no mechanistic explanation and weak description of cellular features, with no good makers for epithelail or mesenchymal state, and robustness required. Many experimental aspects are not precise and therefore it is difficult to rely on the data presented (e.g. stainings are not convincing, a lack of explanation for quantifications, only 2 biological replicates, only one cell line…etc). In the current state of the study, we cannot raise the conclusion made in panel 1 event if it could be attractive.</p><p>The manuscript lacks also a second cell type, and an appropriate methodology to study EMT. The authors should also defend the choice of MCF10A as a model system, as these cells do not show clear EMT characteristics. The authors state otherwise but no reference is given (line 101). Alternatively, the authors may choose to focus on collective cell migration without emphasizing the EMT process. MCF10A seeding protocol: no EMT process, cells are seeded in small colonies and thus migrate directly. The set up of the experiment is in itself not adapted to the study of EMT.</p><p>Comments on the manuscript:</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>The authors did not comment on the impact of gel stiffnesses on cell and nuclear morphology. In the images, the density of cells on the 2kPa gel is low compared to the other conditions. MCF10A cells appear larger when seeded on 2kPa gels and the nuclei are larger, possibly because the cells are flatter. The opposite phenotype is observed when MCF10A cells are seeded on 50kPa gels (ETOH condition). Nuclear and cell morphology, but also cell density may have an impact on NC transport and should be described and quantified.</p><p>Comparisons between the different conditions could be biased if the seeding density is not correct on the 2kPa gels. In order to avoid biased and unreliable conclusions, this point needs to be clarified.</p><p>High lkBa level is detected in the cytoplasm of 0.5KPa gels and even more present in +LMB conditions, with less recruitment around cell-cell junctions. Can the authors comment on the fact that simply placing the cells in different rigidities affects the overall level of lkBa expression? How exactly did the authors quantify the ratio of LkBa? In the methods, it is not clear whether they measured the intensity per single cell or over the entire fields of view without segmenting each cell. The ratio should also be shown in the leader versus followers.</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>YAP panel: According to the literature, YAP is supposed to be translocated into nuclei on high stiffness gels (30kPa, Elosegui Artola, Cell 2017), which does not seem to be the case in Figure 3 panel B ETOH conditions.

They use a well recognized nuclear transport inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB) to reveal two distinct set of markers being regulated as a consequence of nuclear export inhibition (NEI) (a) soft substrates elevate collective migration and (b) while stiffer substrates reduce migration at all time points. Mechanistically, the authors focus on Yes associated protein YAP and α catenin. Knockdown studies reveal that the former could shifts affected cells toward an epithelial phenotype while the latter maintained intercellular adhesion.</p><p>Strengths of the paper include the parsing of two distinct subsets of targets for their role in morphology transition states upon NEI. Strengths also include detailed mechanistic studies deciphering the role of YAP and α catenin protein in the distinct mechano regulatory pathways during cell state transition.</p><p>In terms of weakness, the authors rely heavily on one nuclear protein export inhibitor leptomycin B. Additional positive controls are needed to strengthen the results.</p><p>Overall the results (even though with one inhibitor) are supportive of the hypothesis and are clearly presented.</p><p>The results provide a shift in our understanding of EMT which may not be in continuum rather, opposing transcriptional programs can collectively give rise to epithelial and highly mesenchymal characteristics that is being presented as a concurrent transition of epithelial to mesenchymal state.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1 is redundant and can be merged elsewhere.</p><p>Positive controls like selinexor, eltanexor or other XPO1/CRM1 inhibitors should be included in some of the experiments to support the overall conclusions.</p><p>Chemical inhibition results through LMB are really strong. However, were similar results obtained by biological inactivation of XPO1? What is the consequence on EMT state (both soft substrates and stiffer substrates) on XPO1 si/shRNA knockdown?</p><p>Leptomycin is a irreversible inhibitor while SINE compounds are slowly reversible inhibitors of CRM1/XPO1. Studies should check whether mode of NEI (permanent vs transient) impacts differently the transient process of E to M state transition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors have demonstrated that NEI maintains an atypical E-M state where it strengthens intercellular adhesions and develops mechanoactivation simultaneously. NEI augments collective migration only on soft substrates as opposed to stiffer substrates where the migration is reduced. Furthermore, the authors have shown that YAP1 depletion from NEI positions cells toward an epithelial phenotype whereas knockdown of α-catenin shifts the cells toward a mesenchymal state. Overall, the manuscript is (mostly) well written and their claims are well supported by their data. The data, however, relies on just one cell line and lacks validation in other cell-based models. The study would contribute significantly to basic and translational research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81048.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The Reviewers all agree that the central message of the manuscript is of strong potential interest to the community.

In this revision, we have addressed all reviewer concerns through several new experiments and revision of text, as necessary, all of which have improved the manuscript. With regards to essential revisions:</p><p>1) We have now added data for two additional epithelial cell lines, MDCK-I and MDCK-II, with and without LeptomycinB (LMB) treatment on soft (0.5kPa) hydrogels, which was the main control condition in original submission. Indeed, we found that nuclear export inhibition (NEI) alters their epithelial (E) and mesenchymal (M) states (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3). Specifically, NEI shifts both cell lines towards mesenchymal states while still maintaining multicellular structures in the form of collective streams. These additional results validate and strengthen our main finding that NEI jumbles E/M states of epithelial cells. We also discuss that the nature of such NEI-induced E/M changes is not expected to be identical across cell lines/types because they vary in their genetic and proteomic identities, especially in their epithelial/mesenchymal starting points. Inclusion of additional cell lines further shows that the effect of NEI on cells’ epithelial and mesenchymal states is a broad and robust response, which is currently underappreciated in literature.</p><p>2) We performed NEI using Selinexor on MCF10A cells on soft gels (control condition) and repeated our original measurements (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2). Indeed, Selinexor validates results from LMB treatment for otherwise same conditions (cell lines and hydrogel) and shows elevated epithelial and mesenchymal features.</p><p>3) We have now added qPCR and immunostaining (as applicable) measurements for additional epithelial markers (ZO-1 and PTEN) and mesenchymal markers (vimentin, ZEB1, TWIST1, SNAIL1). These measurements (revised Figure 2E-F, Figure 3A-E) confirm and solidify our original findings that both epithelial and mesenchymal markers were prominent after NEI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript could be of interest to the broad community of scientists working on collective cell migration and tumor processes.

In this revision, we have addressed all concerns through a variety of new experiments, analyses, explanations, and revised text. We have now added two cell lines (MDCK-I and MDCK-II) to show again that NEI alters E-M states. We have added mechanistic explanations in the revised Discussion section. Our cell seeding protocol is similar to many previous EMT studies, at least the ones that use hydrogels of tunable stiffness and not the unrealistically stiff tissue culture plastic (Lee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012; Leight <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012; Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; Wei <italic>et al.</italic>, 2015; Nasrollahi and Pathak, 2016; Matte <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Walter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Sarker <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019). In these studies, and in ours, epithelial clusters or colonies of consistent density are seeded and EMT markers are measured. We appreciate the reviewer point around cell density and its potential effect, which we address in this letter, as described below. We have also added several new EMT markers (ZO-1, PTEN, vimentin, ZEB1, TWIST1, SNAIL1) that show E/M changes according to cell/matrix/NEI conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on the manuscript:</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>The authors did not comment on the impact of gel stiffnesses on cell and nuclear morphology.

Any interpretations around actin and pMLC are separate points and thus co-localization would not provide additional insights, in our opinion, especially since merging of channels was not possible in all cases. We have corrected text around leader and follower cells, which was a qualitative observation. We decided not to quantify ‘follower’ cells because those vary quite a bit according to distance from the leading edge. Since leader cells are easier to define and distinguish (first row of cells touching the leading edge), we have included leader cell analyses wherever it was applicable. For YAP quantification and comparison, we have noted in Methods:</p><p>“Nucleocytoplasmic (N:C) ratio was calculated as the nuclear intensity integrated over the nuclear area divided by the cytoplasmic intensity integrated over the cytoplasmic area. Thus, unlike Elosegui Artola, Cell 2017, our calculation accounts for area, which explains values less than 1. The main purpose of this calculation was to compare WT against LMB and the same method was used for both, so any differences merely point to higher nuclear localization after LMB, which is also clear from images. Regarding the actin/pMLC imaging – since we are using hydrogels of varying stiffness, we are limited by the objective magnification. We tried 63x earlier but imaging was not as consistent as it is with 40x. Since hydrogels of different stiffnesses have different refractive indices (stiffer gels pass less light), pixel intensity can change. We kept the same laser intensity across samples for sake of uniform exposure. Thus, to account for potential changes in refractive index of gels, normalizing by DAPI in each image was a way to make consistent quantifications.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4:</p><p>In the text, the title of the paragraph should be changed because only velocity is shown, no data on cell adhesion enhancement is presented in the figure or supplementary data.</p><p>The conclusion should be reworded because the increased migration is only observed during the first few hours of experimentation.

We have now clarified that negative velocities refer to velocity vectors in directions away from leading-edge advancement. We have also ensured that methods describe velocity calculation. Since actin fiber orientation came from fixed imaging, it cannot be directly and legitimately correlated with collective cell migration order. We make a note of that.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5:</p><p>There is no experimental evidence at all that gm130 expression supports cytoskeletal rearrangement, like many of the findings in this study, this is overstated.

Indeed, for this reason we emphasized “migratory disorder” in the title of the manuscript.</p><p>We note that cytoskeleton rearrangement and golgi reorientation are both required if cells need to repolarize, which is the rationale behind using golgi imaging. For this very reason, many previous studies have imaged for golgi using gm130 and measured its polarization relative to cells’ front-rear polarity in collective and individual cells, without really performing western blot because net protein expression was not the main emphasis (Matsuzawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018; Mason <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019; Hino <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Rong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). We agree that immunostaining is not the best way to quantify gm130 expression, which was not the primary goal here. Instead, our intention with gm130 imaging was to quantify cell polarity, as previously done, which is not possible using a western blot. This also connects to our point about ‘disorder’, which reviewer also appreciated. After analyzing golgi polarization from gm130 images, we further used these immune-stained images to analyze gm130 expression and presented the somewhat surprising finding of increased gm130 expression that also supports increased vimentin expression after LMB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7:</p><p>The same comments as above can be made for this figure, so please report the comments for Figures 2, 3 and 4.</p><p>The control panels are missing in A, D, H, J, K, L, and M, making this figure unreliable. Can the authors show the raw data for the graphs as it appears that the values in the WT are the same as in the previous figure. An additional check with shYAP scrambling should be performed to avoid bias.</p><p>The punctate pattern of LkBa is not visible. To demonstrate that the protein is degraded, the degradation pathways must be blocked and a reversion of the phenotype must be obtained. The punctate motif can also be obtained by disrupting the anchoring of the protein, as YAP can affect the expression of many proteins.</p><p>Figure 8:</p><p>The same comments as above can be made for this figure, so please report the comments for Figures 2, 3 and 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Since control panels have already been provided in earlier figures, we thought it would be repetitive to include those here again, which could also constitute as padding the figure with already used data. Moreover, this figure is already quite full and repeating those data would make it overcrowded and hard to understand, in our opinion. Here, shYAP and αCat-KD are implemented in MCF10A and can be compared against WT MCF10A cells. Although scramble could add value, we don’t believe it would add significant new insights and thus decided not to pursue this in revision. So, instead, we focused our limited time and resources on more “essential revisions” and performed experiments and analyses that have bolstered our key message of NEI-induced E/M alterations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9:</p><p>A: To assert that there is competition between epithelial and mesenchymal features, much more precise and accurate analyses and experiments are needed. The authors should compare the localization of YAP in streams with the localization of YAP outside of streams. More epithelial markers are needed, such as Ecadherin staining, tight junction proteins, vinculin, laser ablation experiments…, and differences should be observed between cells in the streams and cells outside.</p><p>In the current state of the study, we cannot raise the conclusion made in panel 1 event if it might be attractive.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully note that our results with the loss of YAP and α-Catenin are indeed novel because no other study has reported what happens to EMT states on surfaces of varying stiffnesses after perturbations in these two proteins. Moreover, no other study has shown how these two proteins regulate NEI-induced E/M changes, which the reviewer has already noted. We have added numerous measurements of E/M markers, nucleocytoplasmic factors, and collective migration: ZO-1, PTEN, vimentin, ZEB1, TWIST1, SNAIL1, p120, IκΒα, YAP, Actin, pMLC, GM130, traction force microscopy, single cell and multicellular analyses of collectively migrating streams, 2 different NEI drugs, 5 different cell lines (including knockdowns), 3 different hydrogel stiffnesses, golgi polarization, and particle image velocimetry for temporal analyses of migration speed/order/backtracking. All measurements for these markers were indeed performed precisely and accurately to the best of our knowledge, as much as the existing methodology allows and consistent with many published studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this article Krull and colleagues evaluate the impact of nuclear export inhibition on epithelial to mesenchymal transition. They use a well recognized nuclear transport inhibitor Leptomycin B (LMB) to reveal two distinct set of markers being regulated as a consequence of nuclear export inhibition (NEI) (a) soft substrates elevate collective migration and (b) while stiffer substrates reduce migration at all time points. Mechanistically, the authors focus on Yes associated protein YAP and α catenin. Knockdown studies reveal that the former could shifts affected cells toward an epithelial phenotype while the latter maintained intercellular adhesion.</p><p>Strengths of the paper include the parsing of two distinct subsets of targets for their role in morphology transition states upon NEI. Strengths also include detailed mechanistic studies deciphering the role of YAP and α catenin protein in the distinct mechano regulatory pathways during cell state transition.</p><p>In terms of weakness, the authors rely heavily on one nuclear protein export inhibitor leptomycin B. Additional positive controls are needed to strengthen the results.</p><p>Overall the results (even though with one inhibitor) are supportive of the hypothesis and are clearly presented.</p><p>The results provide a shift in our understanding of EMT which may not be in continuum rather, opposing transcriptional programs can collectively give rise to epithelial and highly mesenchymal characteristics that is being presented as a concurrent transition of epithelial to mesenchymal state.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful summary of strengths of our paper and for providing valuable feedback. We agree that additional controls were needed, which we have included in this revision by validating key EMT phenotypes using another NEI drug.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Figure 1 is redundant and can be merged elsewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion, which we thoughtfully considered. However, considering the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, we thought it would be better to keep this figure to introduce our hypothesis around nuclear export and visualize experimental design. We kept the schematic in Figure 2, which shows one already established mechanism of NEI, shown in cancer cells. That said, we have removed the schematic in Figure 3, which somewhat captures some of these ideas and its placement in Figure 1 would be better for readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Positive controls like selinexor, eltanexor or other XPO1/CRM1 inhibitors should be included in some of the experiments to support the overall conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We repeated experiments with Selinexor, another NEI drug, and found similar elevation of both epithelial and mesenchymal traits, which is included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Chemical inhibition results through LMB are really strong. However, were similar results obtained by biological inactivation of XPO1? What is the consequence on EMT state (both soft substrates and stiffer substrates) on XPO1 si/shRNA knockdown?</p></disp-quote><p>Unlike LMB and Selinexor, biological inactivation of XPO1 would likely be much more cytotoxic and would complicate measurements of live cell migration and EMT. Thus, we instead relied on a given NEI method and instead focused on studying its functional outcomes in mechanosensitve collective cell migration and E-M states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Leptomycin is a irreversible inhibitor while SINE compounds are slowly reversible inhibitors of CRM1/XPO1. Studies should check whether mode of NEI (permanent vs transient) impacts differently the transient process of E to M state transition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included results after treatment with Selinexor, which is a reversible inhibitor nuclear export.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors have demonstrated that NEI maintains an atypical E-M state where it strengthens intercellular adhesions and develops mechanoactivation simultaneously. NEI augments collective migration only on soft substrates as opposed to stiffer substrates where the migration is reduced. Furthermore, the authors have shown that YAP1 depletion from NEI positions cells toward an epithelial phenotype whereas knockdown of α-catenin shifts the cells toward a mesenchymal state. Overall, the manuscript is (mostly) well written and their claims are well supported by their data. The data, however, relies on just one cell line and lacks validation in other cell-based models. The study would contribute significantly to basic and translational research.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for positive comments about this work. We agree that some validation in another cell line is needed. In this revision, we have added two variants of a popular epithelial cell line – MDCK-I and MDCK-II. In both these cell lines, NEI jumbles E-M states, which is consistent with the key finding of our original submission.</p><p>References:</p><p>Brown, AC, Fiore, VF, Sulchek, TA, and Barker, TH (2013).
