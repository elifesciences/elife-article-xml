Here, we report that COVID-19-induced oxidative stress inflicts structural damages to HSA and is linked with mortality outcome in critically ill patients. We recruited 39 patients who were followed up for a median of 12.5 days (1–35 days), among them 23 had died. Analyzing blood samples from patients and healthy individuals (n=11), we provide evidence that neutrophils are major sources of oxidative stress in blood and that hydrogen peroxide is highly accumulated in plasmas of non-survivors. We then analyzed electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of spin-labeled fatty acids (SLFAs) bound with HSA in whole blood of control, survivor, and non-survivor subjects (n=10–11). Non-survivors’ HSA showed dramatically reduced protein packing order parameter, faster SLFA correlational rotational time, and smaller S/W ratio (strong-binding/weak-binding sites within HSA), all reflecting remarkably fluid protein microenvironments. Following loading/unloading of 16-DSA, we show that the transport function of HSA may be impaired in severe patients. Stratified at the means, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that lower values of S/W ratio and accumulated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in plasma significantly predicted in-hospital mortality (S/W≤0.15, 81.8% (18/22) vs. S/W&gt;0.15, 18.2% (4/22), p=0.023; plasma [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]&gt;8.6 μM, 65.2% (15/23) vs. 34.8% (8/23), p=0.043). When we combined these two parameters as the ratio ((S/W)/[H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>]) to derive a risk score, the resultant risk score lower than the mean (&lt;0.019) predicted mortality with high fidelity (95.5% (21/22) vs. 4.5% (1/22), log-rank χ<sup>2</sup>=12.1, p=4.9×10<sup>−4</sup>). The derived parameters may provide a surrogate marker to assess new candidates for COVID-19 treatments targeting HSA replacements and/or oxidative stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>critically ill COVID-19 patients</kwd><kwd>COVID-19 mortality</kwd><kwd>neutrophils</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd><kwd>human serum albumin damage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Association of Friends of the National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COVID-SA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>Sameh Saad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SA-Start up</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>Sameh Saad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy quantitatively correlates structural damages of serum albumin with COVID-19 severity and mortality thus suggesting albumin replacement therapy as a strategy to rescue patients at risk of mortality.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>COVID-19 pandemic continues as a global health crisis while the underlying SARS-CoV-2 virus defies all attempted treatment strategies. While writing this report, there have been more than 135 million confirmed cases including around 3 million deaths worldwide according to the World Health Organization Coronavirus Disease Dashboard (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://covid19.who.int/">https://covid19.who.int/</ext-link>). Although 50% of cases are reported to be in the 25–64 age group, the percentage of deaths increases dramatically with age, and approximately 75% of deaths are in those aged 65 years and above (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-age.html">COVID-19 Hospitalization and Death by Age | CDC</ext-link>). People in the age groups 30–39 years, 40–49 years, and 50–64 years are 4, 10, and 30 times more likely to die from COVID-19 complications compared to the 18–29 years age group. Nevertheless, molecular and cellular factors contributing to mortality outcome in a homogeneous cohort of patients are not yet clear. Lack of diagnostic markers that predict mortality in COVID-19 patients impedes current efforts to siege the pandemic. It is thus critical to identify prognostic tests that can assess the risk of death in critically ill patients to guide clinical protocols and prioritize interventions. Furthermore, mechanistic clues for determining the underlying molecular factors contributing to the hypercoagulability, inflammation, and cytokine storm have been so far illusive. It is therefore imperative to intensify efforts focusing on understanding the molecular pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection and to identify prognostic markers to guide and prioritize clinical decisions.</p><p>Human serum albumin (HSA) is the most abundant constituent of soluble proteins in the circulatory system. HSA has been suggested and used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker of numerous diseases and conditions including ischemia, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, septic shock, among many others. In addition to its numerous physiological and pharmacological functions including the maintenance of blood/tissue osmotic balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh-Zocchi et al., 1999</xref>), blood pH, metal cation transport and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stewart et al., 2003</xref>), nutrients and drug shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fujiwara and Amisaki, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wishart et al., 2018</xref>), and toxin neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ascenzi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vorum and Honoré, 1996</xref>), HSA is suggested to be a major circulating antioxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha and Kim, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loban et al., 1997</xref>). HSA can remarkably bind with a diverse array of drugs and toxins thus controlling their bioavailability and pharmacologic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fasano et al., 2005</xref>). It has been previously shown that more than 70% of the free radical-trapping capacity of serum was due to HSA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roche et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, several reports indicated that inflammation enhances vascular permeability of various tissues to HSA apparently to confer antioxidant beneficial effects against reactive species released by activated neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halliwell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sitar et al., 2013</xref>). Although currently without direct experimental evidence, neutrophilia-mediated oxidative stress was implicated in the COVID-19 pathology and speculated to exacerbate the inflammatory immune response eventually causing multi-organ failure and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laforge et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that COVID-19-mediated oxidative stress may be differentially reflected in HSA’s structure and functions and employed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin labeling spectroscopy to explore HSA’s structural changes in correlation with severity and mortality of critically ill COVID-19 patients.</p><p>Spin-labeled fatty acids (SLFAs) are established probes to explore structural and functional changes in albumin by EPR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ge et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haeri et al., 2019</xref>). This approach relies on the well-studied ability of albumin to strongly and exclusively bind with fatty acids in blood. Albumin has at least seven different specific binding sites for long-chain fatty acids located in different domains within the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curry et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simard et al., 2006</xref>). Effectively, structural and functional changes in HSA may be assessed through the detection of parallel changes in mobility and binding affinity of SLFAs, in addition to the distribution of the spin labels on the albumin molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haeri et al., 2019</xref>). EPR spectra of spin labels bound to different domains of the protein provide information on the local fatty acids/protein interactions, which may probe changes in the overall structure of the protein under unfolding or damaging conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharya et al., 2000</xref>). Here, we compare changes that occur to the mobility, binding affinity, and distribution of the HSA-bound SLFA in whole blood and plasma from COVID-19 patients in critical care unit relative to those observed in normal healthy individuals.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Probing structual changes of serum albumin through spin labeling EPR spectroscopy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HSA crystal structure containing seven copies of stearic acid.

In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, we show and statistically compare laboratory results of survivors versus non-survivor COVID-19 groups. Although when comparing all parameters in the two COVID-19 groups, we observed changes following the same reported trends in the literature, means’ comparisons by Tukey test reported non-significant changes in all parameters except for a significant decrease in albumin level (p&lt;0.05) and a strong trend observed for C-reactive protein (CRP) (greater levels in Sev-D group, p=0.06). Nevertheless, non-survivors’ blood carried the frequently observed hallmarks of increased CRP, D-dimer, IL-6, ferritin, and the liver enzymes ALT and AST (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Singh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Velavan and Meyer, 2020</xref>). However, it is conceivable that the clinical severe category and the same ICU status of patients in the two groups in addition to relatively small sample sizes underlie the observed lack of robust statistical differences between these parameters.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Demographic and clinical characteristics of the studied

Our hypothesis implicates elevated oxidative stress as a major cause of HSA damage in severe COVID-19 patients. As a result, we started by following the dependence of clinical outcomes and mortality on ROS levels in blood cells. First, we used flow cytometry to assess percentages of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets in all patients as described in Materials and methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, we used the ROS-sensitive DCF dye to probe intracellular ROS levels in various cell populations in whole blood from all groups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows that while lymphocyte counts decrease, a parallel dramatic increase in neutrophil counts (% total) was observable when going from Control (40.78±14.0, n=9) to Sev-R (64.0±20.0, n=10) to Sev-D (76.4± 6.8, n=11) groups (overall ANOVA p=3.9×10<sup>–5</sup>). Similar trend was clearly seen in the heat map depicting parameters for all patients analyzed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). It is also clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B&amp;C</xref> that changes in DCF-positive neutrophils follow similar trend observed for neutrophil counts. To confirm this relation, we compared neutrophil counts with DCF-positive neutrophil counts and found that the two parameters were strongly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.8, p=3×10<sup>–7</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, both parameters individually showed statistically significant increases in both of the studied COVID-19 groups when compared with the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D&amp;E</xref>). These results suggest that neutrophils are major sources of elevated oxidative stress in critically ill patients. Note that the observed trends in platelets, lymphocyte, neutrophils, and NLR are similar to reported values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hematologic cellular counts and neutrophil-ROS levels reflect severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative flow cytometric diagrams comparing morphologic, hematologic, and ROS levels in control (representative of n=9; upper row), Sev-R (representative of n=10; middle row), and Sev-D (representative of n=11; lower row) groups.

Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable ROS and is highly stable under prolonged storage at low temperatures. We used a highly specific catalase-based assay that we developed and verified in our laboratory to quantify [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>] in plasma samples of all groups. The assay relies on high-resolution detection and quantification of released oxygen due to hydrogen peroxide decompostion by catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A&amp;B</xref>).

Both 5-DSA and 16-DSA were used to probe the degree of local interactions in sites where the SLFA is buried in the protein interior (high mobility, 16-DSA) and closer to the protein-aqueous interface (low mobility due to interactions with water molecules and polar amino acids, 5-DSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gantchev and Shopova, 1990</xref>). Indeed, 5-DSA reflected significantly greater S parameter values relative to 16-DSA both in plasma and in whole blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, independent of the spin probe and both in plasma and whole blood samples, the order parameter has been consistently lower in Sev-R which was further decreased in Sev-D patients relative to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Finally, similar trends have been observed for the S/W parameter which signifies contributions of the strongly and weakly bound components of 16-DSA in different fatty acids pockets. Taken together, these results indicate that COVID-19 pathology is associated with extensive structural changes in the HSA protein that imply the prevalence of malfunctional derivatives of this critical protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Hampered water accessibility into HSA/fatty acid pockets in whole blood of COVID-19 patients</title><p>We followed water accessibility toward deep pockets carrying the spin labels through kinetic analysis of the nitroxide radical EPR silencing by the water-soluble ascorbate anion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pavićević et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(G–J)</xref>). Under matching experimental conditions, 16-DSA and 5-DSA/HSA signals in whole blood of control subjects decayed remarkably faster when compared with both Sev-R and Sev-D (n=3 per group, p&lt;0.05). Weaker and slower disappearance of the EPR signal of COVID-19 patients by ascorbate suggests less accessible space toward the nitroxide moiety of the spin label within the protein. It is clear from these data that the HSA of COVID-19 patients is generally less water accessible relative to control ones. However, the core of the HSA of both COVID-19 groups was not significantly different in terms of water accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Defective transport function of HSA in critically ill COVID-19 patients</title><p>Restricted water/ascorbate accessibility in severe patients relative to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I&amp;J</xref>) along with the observed significant changes in the microenvironments surrounding SLFAs are generally viewed to implicate functional damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gantchev and Shopova, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pavićević et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Junk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muravsky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rehfeld et al., 1978</xref>). In this paradigm, changes in the SLFA’s lineshape are taken to indirectly display functional changes in the solution shape of albumin due to spatial rearrangements of paramagnetic centers in EPR-active, albumin-bound fatty acids. However, to confirm that the observed protein damages are indeed functional determinants for HSA, we performed additional experiments exploring albumin transport functions through loading/unloading of SLFA for representative sets of samples (n=3–5) from all of the studied groups. We argued that if the observed HSA structural damages are functionally relevant, they would affect the ability of HSA to load and dislodge fatty acids into and from their binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matthes et al., 2002</xref>). To follow the fatty acid loading efficacy, we followed the apparent kinetics of 16-DSA’s S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; strongly bound) and W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; weakly bound) peaks over 7 min immediately after mixing the spin label with identical plasma volumes from all groups. These results (n=3) demonstrate the hindered fatty acid uptake by HSA of critically ill patients relative to controls.</p><p>To investigate the dislodging function of HSA, we monitored the effect of exogenously added ethanol on S and W peaks’ proportions in all groups. Namely, we compared the amounts of exogenous ethanol needed to withdraw the weakly and strongly bound components of the HSA-bound SLFAs in whole blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D&amp;E</xref>). Under these conditions, the W peak envelops contributions from both weakly bound and the released SLFA. Redistributions of the fatty acid populations are noticeable through decreased S and increased W (includes signals of free fatty acid) peaks. This redistribution is remarkably pronounced in critically ill patients reflecting weaker association with, and easier release of fatty acids from HSA in those patients. These findings are taken to indicate impaired transport function of HSA in critically ill patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Association of EPR-determined HSA structural changes with neutrophil counts and measures of oxidative stress</title><p>In order to verify our proposed links between oxidative stress and albumin damage, we applied linear correlations between plasma levels of hydrogen peroxide and EPR-calculated parameters pertaining to protein packing order parameter (S), fatty acid mobility (τ<sub>c</sub>), and S/W ratio in all groups (n=19–26, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–D</xref>).

Closer to the context of COVID-19 pathophysiology, critical roles of HSA have been suggested as it acts as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inoue et al., 2018</xref>), anticoagulant agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doweiko and Nompleggi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ronit et al., 2020</xref>), inhibitor of oxidative stress-mediated clotting and platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basili et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2020</xref>), drug-dependent allosteric carrier and regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fanali et al., 2012</xref>), and a potent heme scavenger that may also exhibit globin-like reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ascenzi et al., 2015</xref>). In the light of these established functions, it is natural to suggest albumin as a frontline protection against COVID-19-associated lethality resulting from cytokine storm, oxidative stress, blood clotting, and the ensuing organ failure. Although hypoalbuminemia has been repeatedly reported as a predictor of mortality in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Violi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2020</xref>), low albumin levels may result from surgery, dialysis, abdominal infections, liver failure, pancreatitis, respiratory distress, bypass surgery, ovarian problems caused by fertility drugs, and many other conditions. High prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in numerous disease states and the age/sex-dependent wide dynamic range of this protein concentration limits its diagnostic utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levitt and Levitt, 2016</xref>). As a result, we investigated biophysical parameters pertaining to HSA protein structure in whole blood and plasma of all groups as reflectors of this critical protein functions.</p><p>We designed the present study to explore how COVID-19-caused mortality is related to oxidative stress and whether ROS-induced albumin damage can be used to predict such outcome. To avoid disparities related to clinical statuses and interventional protocols we restricted our subject recruitment to a homogeneous cohort of patients in terms of diseases severity, hospitalization, and interventions. Both sexes were represented in the overal COVID-19 subjects (40% females) and sex was not found to affect mortality. The mean age of the studied subjects was 66.7±8.9 years (42–81), and non-survivors were slightly orlder. No other clinical or demographic characteristic showed statistically significant difference between survivors and non-survivors which further indicates the homogeniety of the studied pool of subjects.</p><p>Our current data provide converging and novel evidence that neutrophils are major players in oxidative stress associating inflammation in critically ill COVID-19 patients, especially those that do not survive the infection. We detected increased neutrophil count, increased ROS-positive neutrophil population, increased intracellular ROS level in these neutrophils, and a remarkably elevated hydrogen peroxide residue in plasma of non-survivor COVID-19 patients relative to control and survivor groups. Moreover, these oxidative stress measures were found to strongly correlate with EPR-detected structural damages of HSA. We found that albumin levels were inversely associated with overall mortality, and that a biophysical measure of structural changes inflicted on albumin (S/W) can consistently predict overall mortality even with a relatively small n=38 sample size. Moreover, plasma levels of hydrogen peroxide were also found to predict in-ICU mortality (n=39). The current survival analysis reports event numbers in the range from 15 to 21 for various predictor parameters (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–J</xref>). This exceeds the current consensus that 10 or more events per predictor are sufficient to provide firm grounds for generalization of findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Courvoisier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kocak and Onar-Thomas, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogundimu et al., 2016</xref>). It is important to mention that the current work did not address important questions related to the enzymatic source of ROS and whether mitochondria contribute to the observed oxidative stress profiles in connection with infection severity and mortality.</p><p>Oxidative stress is commonly implicated in a plethora of diseases and was indeed suggested repeatedly; albeit with little experimental support, as the spearhead of inflammation leading to severe symptoms and sepsis-like fatal responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laforge et al., 2020</xref>). We suggest that HSA damage inflicted by neutrophil-mediated ROS bursts in those patients effectively contributes to the COVID-19 pathology. For instance, impairment of HSA ability to transport an extremely wide range of endogenous and exogenous ligands may affect the bioavailability of adminsitered drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Wu, 2015</xref>), distribution of anti-inflammatory molecules such as NO and prostaglandins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 2014</xref>), as well as affecting its anticoagulation and antiplatelet activation functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paar et al., 2017</xref>). Reduced and damaged HSA may also disturb the vascular oncotic pressure contributing to pulmonary edema and potentially to gastrointestinal symptoms that characterize recent waves of the infection. Collectively, these factors constitute major players in the pathology triggered by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Although hypoalbuminemia is suggested as a pivotal marker for the pathology of many infections (reviewed very recently in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wiedermann, 2021</xref>) including in COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Violi et al., 2020</xref>), albumin damage has not been directly implicated in infectious disease to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>We believe that the current data suggest that albumin-related changes are more robust predictors of mortality and severity than immune-related parameters, such as cytokine levels, CRP, D-dimer, and so on. These parameters were not statistically different when comparing survivors with non-survivors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) . Nevertheless, obtained biophysical and biochemical parameters correlated reasonably well with severity and mortality. Our current findings substantiate the utilization of the identified parameters as accurate mortality predictors of critically ill COVID-19 patients. Determining threshold values of these parameters can possibly help to identify patients in need of urgent medical attention, and may provide novel markers to assess new candidates for COVID-19 treatments targeting HSA replacements. We thus suggest the importance of studying the potential effects of albumin replacement therapy on clinical outcomes of Covid-19 patients. Our results also provide new mechanistic insights into pathways that could be targeted to help prevent critical COVID illness and death, for example, oxidative stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD-42b-PE- (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Beckman Coulter Life Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#IM1417URRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2893282">AB_2893282</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (1 µl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD14-PC7- (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Beckman Coulter Life Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#A22331RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10639528">AB_10639528</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (1 µl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD66b-APC-Alexa Fluor 750- (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Beckman Coulter Life Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#B08756RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2893284">AB_2893284</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (1 µl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CD3-ECD- (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Beckman Coulter Life Sciences</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#IM2705URRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:3850637">MGI:3850637</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (1 µl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#D6883</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Imaging (30 μM)FACS (20 μM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAPI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#62249</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Imaging (6.15 µg/ml)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2-(3-carboxypropyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-tridecyl-3-oxazolidinyloxy (5–130 doxyl-stearic acid, 5-DSA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#253618</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EPR (0.26 mm)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2-(14-carboxytetradecyl)-2-ethyl-4,4-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinyloxy (16–131 doxyl-stearic acid, 16-DSA)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat#253596</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EPR (0.26 mm)EPR/ethanol experiments (0.52 mm)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The present study aims to analyze HSA protein configuration statuses in the most severe cases of COVID-19 in comparison with control subjects.

Oxygen levels are monitored and recorded while 50 μl batches of plasma from control, Sev-R, and Sev-D subjects are sequentially infused into tightly air-controlled O2k chamber containing catalase (315 units/ml) in deoxygenated buffer. A continuous stream of pure nitrogen gas was blown over the chamber’s sealing cap to prevent oxygen diffusion into the working solution. In addition to the initial rise due to residual oxygen in the added plasma samples, the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in these samples produced oxygen in a quantitative manner, that is, decomposition of one mole of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced ½-mole O<sub>2</sub>. To verify the assay, we measured the released oxygen upon adding increasing concentrations of standard hydrogen peroxide solution in PBS buffer. Linear fitting of the plotted [O<sub>2</sub>] versus [H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>] relation yielded a slope=0.47±0.03 (Pearson’s r=0.994, p=5.6×10<sup>–4</sup>), which is very close to the theoretically expected value of 0.5.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Neutrophils’ isolation</title><p>Whole blood samples (10 ml) were collected on ACD tubes and transferred to 15 ml polypropylene conical tubes then centrifuged (300×<italic>g</italic>) for 15 min with reduced acceleration and no brakes.

Data outliers were identified graphically through box plots and were only removed when confirmed through Grubbs’s tests (OriginPro). For comparisons of means between three or more independent groups, Tukey test ANOVA for multiple comparison was performed. For correlation analysis, Spearman’s rank correlation was performed. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for measuring the association between variables of interest based on the method of covariance which also gives information about the magnitude of the association, or correlation, as well as the direction of the relationship. p-values&lt;0.05 for correlations or means’ comparisons were considered significant. Categorical variables are reported as counts and percentages while continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Differences between percentages were assessed by Pearson’s χ<sup>2</sup> tests or Fisher’s exact tests when the number of observations per group was less than 5. The χ<sup>2</sup> tests provided results that tested the hypothesis that the mortality and a given variable (e.g., sex or comorbidity) are independent. When p is less than the significant level of 0.05, there is significant evidence of association between mortality and the variable. Log-rank Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were carried out to estimate the probability of survival of COVID-19 patients in relation to cutoff thresholds arbitrarily stratified at mean values of various parameters. The log-rank test for trends reports a χ<sup>2</sup>-value and computes a p value testing the null hypothesis that there is no linear trend between column order and median survival.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Methodology, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Written informed consents were obtained from participants in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

Can the authors provide evidence that such modifications will result in ablation of normal HSA functions using orthogonal in vitro experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is indeed an important point and thus performed new set of experiments to explore the impact of COVID-19 on HSA transport function as reflected in rates of fatty acid uptake and release. Before describing these new results we would like to mention that the restricted water/ascorbate accessibility in severe patients relative to controls (Figure 4I and J) along with the observed significant changes in the microenvironments surrounding SLFAs are generally viewed to implicate functional damage [PMIDs: 213518,2155659,19540798,25152968,20886483]. In this paradigm changes in the SLFA’s lineshape are taken to indirectly display functional changes in the solution shape of albumin due to spatial rearrangements of paramagnetic centers in EPR-active, albumin-bound fatty acids.</p><p>However, to confirm that the observed protein damages are indeed functional determinants for HSA we performed additional experiments exploring albumin transport functions through loading/unloading of SLFA for representative sets of samples (n=3-5) from all of the studied groups. We argued that if the observed HSA structural damages are functionally relevant they would affect the ability of HSA to load and dislodge fatty acids into and from their binding sites [PMID: 12350048]. To follow the fatty acid loading efficacy, we followed the apparent kinetics of 16-DSA’s S (New Figure 5A; strongly bound) and W (New Figure 5B; weakly bound) peaks over 7 minutes immediately after mixing the spin label with identical plasma volumes from all groups. These results (N=3) demonstrate the hindered fatty acid uptake by HSA of critically-ill patients relative to controls.</p><p>To investigate the dislodging function of HSA we monitored the effect of exogenously added ethanol on S and W peaks’ proportions in all groups. Namely, we compared the amounts of exogenous ethanol needed to withdraw the weakly and strongly bound components of the HSA-bound SLFAs in whole blood (New Figure 5D and E). Under these conditions, the W peak envelops contributions from both weakly bound and the released SLFA. Redistributions of the fatty acid populations are noticeable through decreased S and increased W (includes signals of free fatty acid) peaks. This redistribution is remarkably pronounced in critically ill patients reflecting weaker association with, and easier release of fatty acids from HSA in those patients. These findings are taken to indicate impaired transport function of HSA in critically ill patients. The new data are added as an additional figure (Figure 5) in the resubmitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Although neutrophils can produce hydrogen peroxide via the NADPH oxidase-superoxide dismutase axis, mitochondria are even more ubiquitous and can produce hydrogen peroxide in higher amounts. Therefore, the role of mitochondria in adding to hydrogen peroxide pool in plasma should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Changes inflected by COVID-19 pathology on mitochondrial function including oxidative phosphorylation, calcium handling, and ROS production in platelets and neutrophils are described in a manuscript to be submitted soon. Results obtained through multiple experimental approaches including flowcytometry, fluorescence imaging, and fluorescence microscopy suggest that mitochondrial ROS are independent of severity and mortality outcomes. However, we added a few sentences to discuss the role of mitochondria as suggested (page 14; Lines: 309-312).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Reference for lysis of blood to isolate neutrophils for further use in DCF based ROS detection using FACs is missing. FACS lyse and erythrolyse solutions used for RBC can modify neutrophil membranes and enhance the DCF signal. The authors expose neutrophils to the lysis buffer for 15 minutes and this is enough to activate the neutrophils. This may have introduced false positives. Also, if this was a lyse-fix solution a similar issue of activation and a false positive signal may be encountered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have mentioned in the method’s section that “Citrate-anticoagulated whole peripheral blood was incubated with RBCs lysis buffer for 15 min. Lysed blood was then centrifuged at 500 X-g for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and then resuspended in PBS.”</p><p>We didn’t use FACS lyse and erythrolyse solutions in our experiments, for lysis of blood we used RBS lysis buffer that consists of: NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (ammonium chloride), NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (sodium bicarbonate) and EDTA (disodium). This lysis buffer is known to preserve viability of cells and is the buffer of choice for assessment of neutrophil respiratory burst using DCF (PMID:11260596). Moreover, we have suspended the obtained cells after lysis in PBS and we avoided the use of FACS as it contains FBS or BSA that may cause activation of neutrophils. Methods’ Section was modified to describe this {page 20, Lines 411-420}.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Has cellular viability been assessed for the neutrophils after the lysis? This information should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Cellular viability has always been checked for each sample by trypan blue and cells were not analysed unless it was more than 90% viable. Added in the resubmitted manuscript {page 22, lines: 460-461}.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Also, in Figure 3D, the nuclei of the control images have their characteristic polymorphonuclear appearance and appear as round.

As mentioned above, the utilized lysis buffer and conditions are known to preserve viability of neutrophil (PMID:11260596). Moreover, we have suspended the obtained cells after lysis in PBS and we avoided the use of FACS as it contains FBS or BSA that may cause activation of neutrophils. Cellular viability has always been checked for each sample by trypan blue and it was more than 90%.</p><p>• ROS species produced by neutrophils is comprised of hydrogen peroxide and the superoxide free radical. Can the authors discuss as to why only peroxide levels were chosen?</p><p>We agree that superoxide is as important as hydrogen peroxide in this context. However, we focused on hydrogen peroxide because:</p><p>1. Hydrogen peroxide is a direct product of superoxide dismutation (auto and enzymatic).</p><p>2. The superoxide radical anion is very short-lived and much harder to detect than hydrogen peroxide.</p><p>3. Hydrogen peroxide is the most stable ROS and is barely affected under prolonged storage at low temperatures.</p><p>4. The activities of all enzymatic sources of superoxide (e.g. NOXs) are time sensitive thus requiring to handle samples immediately, which was not always possible. In our accumulated experience, discrepancies in sample handling times are remarkable sources of experimental errors in detecting superoxide radicals.</p><p>5. Methods for the determination of superoxide radical are not quantitative while the described catalase-based assay determines hydrogen peroxide quantitatively.</p><p>6. Except for EPR spectroscopy, superoxide detection methods are non-specific and suffer from interferences especially in clinical samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• How were the neutrophils isolated and how many cells seeded used for the fluorescence imaging?</p></disp-quote><p>Here is the method followed to isolate neutrophils and the employed seeding density:</p><p>Whole blood samples (10ml) were collected on ACD tubes and transferred to 15 mL polypropylene conical tubes then centrifuged (300xg) for 15 minutes with reduced acceleration and no brakes. The upper layer (PRP) was transferred to a separate tube. The lower layer was layered over equal volume of Histopaque-1077. Then the tubes were centrifuged at 500xg for 35 minutes with reduced acceleration and no brakes. After centrifugation, the first three layers were discarded and the layer containing the neutrophils was collected and diluted to 10 mL with HBSS, centrifuged again at 350xg for 10 minutes. Supernatant was removed and the pellet was suspended in RBCs lysis buffer and incubated for 15 min at RT then centrifuged at 350xg for 10 minutes (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2021; PMID: 33402007). The supernatant was removed and the pellet was suspended in 100 µL of PBS. The count was obtained manually using a hemocytometer. For the fluorescence imaging using cytation 5, neutrophils were seeded in a flat clear bottom 96 well plate in a density of 100,000 neutrophils/ well. Added to the Methods’ Section {page 21, lines 449-460}.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is not enough information if the described structural changes are found in other infectious processes or if they are unique to COVID-19.</p></disp-quote><p>Although hypoalbuminemia is suggested as a pivotal marker for the pathology of many infections [reviewed very recently in 33925831] including in COVID-19 [ref 33], albumin damage has not been directly implicated in infectious disease to the best of our knowledge. Added in the Discussion section {page 14, lines 323-325}.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors need to elaborate more on the importance of the findings regarding pathogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following paragraph to the resubmitted manuscript {last paragraph on page 14}:</p><p>“Oxidative stress is commonly implicated in a plethora of diseases and was indeed suggested repeatedly; albeit with little experimental support, as the spearhead of inflammation leading to severe symptoms and sepsis-like fatal responses in critically ill COVID-19 patients (15). […] Collectively, these factors constitutes major players in the pathology triggered by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They cannot analyze for survival with only 25 patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now increased the number of subjects to be 39 instead of 25. The current survival analysis reports event numbers in the range from 15 to 21 for various predictor parameter (see new Figure 6G-J). This exceeds current consensus that 10 or more events per predictor are sufficient to provide firm grounds for generalization of findings [PMID: 21411281, 24115780, 26964707]. In fact, when we increased the number of subjects from 25 to 39 mean values of the studied parameters were marginally affected while maintaining their impact on survival outcomes. Added in the Discussion section {page 14, lines 306-309}.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• How was the study powered for?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the manuscript {pages 17, line 353-355}, no power analysis was done due to lack of reported effect size under matching or similar conditions. Sample size was based on sample availability and collection continued until a total of N=40 has been reached for COVID-19 patients diagnosed as severely infected with SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to the ICU during the period from 13 October 2020 to 21 February 2021. Nevertheless, and as explained in the previous point, our expanded survival analysis contains sufficiently powered sample size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Do albumin alteration associate with other immune changes of the patients?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in Figure 2B, neutrophil and ROS-positive neutrophil counts increased remarkably in association with severity and mortality. This increase was strongly correlated with parameters reflecting albumin damage (Figure 2C and 6A-F). Lymphocytes and platelets however showed the opposite trend thus potentiating the centrality of neutrophils in the COVID-19 triggered inflammation and oxidative stress. Detailed immune profiling of the studied patients was beyond the current study goals. However, we believe that this is an interesting suggestion that deserves more exploration provided that sample availability returns.</p><p>The current manuscript was more focused on the association of albumin damage with inflammatory markers. We believe that the current data suggest that albumin-related changes are more robust predictors of mortality and severity in the studied cohort. That is, all immune-related parameters such as cytokine levels, CRP, D-dimer, etc. were not statistically different when comparing survivors with non-survivors (Table 2). Nevertheless, obtained biophysical and biochemical parameters correlated reasonably well with severity and mortality. Added in the Discussion section {page 15, lines 326-329}.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Why are not other markers of oxidative damage measured like malondialdehyde and total antioxidant?</p></disp-quote><p>Because we reasoned that highly uncontrolled intake of antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and zinc by COVID-19 patients may lead to huge experimental variability and clinically irrelevant conclusions in case of the total antioxidant assessments. For other markers of oxidative stress such as malondialdehyde our plans were hampered by the lockdown and inability to import reagents in a timely manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors exaggerate by stating in the text as significant differences that are quoted as marginally different in the Figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this comment and have revised our manuscript to maintain a conservative descriptions of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In figure 2 the authors mention a population of neutrophils as 'NETosed'. Can the authors elaborate as to what this means? If they mean NET formation then they should mention what parameters were considered to define NET formation or exclude nomenclature from the figure as it is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this mistake. We masked the label in the resubmitted Figure 2 as it is irrelevant to the current manuscript.</p><p>• In Figure 3D depicting DCF in neutrophils, the Hoechst 332 staining in the merged control image looks extremely faint compared to the Sev-R and Sev-D merged images. Higher quality images should be provided for the panel.</p><p>We apologize for the bad quality of the formerly provided images. We have now included images with higher quality and clearer nuclear staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Could the authors validate the efficacy of the combined S/W/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> versus other established markers of mortality in COVID-19 such as D-dimer, Ferritin etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We couldn’t find statistically significant correlations with any of these parameters. It is worth mentioning that analyses of these markers were carried out in the ICU at times not necessarily matching the times when we collected samples for our analysis. We speculate that the time variability of these parameters renders such analysis inconclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure-2 A FACS plots should be labelled within the figure for the ease of reader.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid readers’ confusion and over-labeling of the figure we color-framed individual rows to distinguish Control, Sev-R, or Sev-D panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• DAPI mentioned in Figure 3 is equated to Hoechst 332 in the methods section.
