In this study, we examined how T cell responses against CNS-derived antigen develop in the context of infection. We found that meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the neurotropic parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> in mice, and we observed changes in the dendritic cell compartment of the dural meninges that may support this process. Indeed, we found that mice chronically, but not acutely, infected with <italic>T. gondii</italic> exhibited a significant expansion and activation of type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC) in the dural meninges. cDC1s and cDC2s were both capable of sampling cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-derived protein and were found to harbor processed CSF-derived protein in the draining deep cervical lymph nodes. Disrupting meningeal lymphatic drainage via ligation surgery led to a reduction in CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC1 and cDC2 number in the deep cervical lymph nodes and caused an impairment in cDC1 and cDC2 maturation. Concomitantly, lymphatic vessel ligation impaired CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation, proliferation, and IFN-γ production at this site. Surprisingly, however, parasite-specific T cell responses in the brain remained intact following ligation, which may be due to concurrent activation of T cells at non-CNS-draining sites during chronic infection. Collectively, our work reveals that CNS lymphatic drainage supports the development of peripheral T cell responses against <italic>T. gondii</italic> but remains dispensable for immune protection of the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>neuroimmunology</kwd><kwd>lymphatics</kwd><kwd>T

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the presence of T cells in the CNS can be pathological, T cells play an essential role in orchestrating host-protective immune responses in the CNS during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellwardt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Korn and Kallies, 2017</xref>). At present, the biological mechanisms that drive the formation of T cell responses in the CNS remain poorly defined. One well-studied brain-tropic pathogen is <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes chronic, lifelong infection in a wide range of mammalian hosts, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill and Dubey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pappas et al., 2009</xref>). Although the course of infection is typically asymptomatic in humans, severe neurologic disease can manifest in immunocompromised individuals, including HIV/AIDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luft and Remington, 1992</xref>). Consistent with this susceptibility, experimental studies have demonstrated that mice deficient in T cell responses are unable to protect the host from fatal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gazzinelli et al., 1992</xref>). For this reason, murine infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic> is a useful model for investigating how T cell responses develop in the CNS.</p><p>At homeostasis, the immunologically quiescent brain harbors very few T cells, but in response to <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, parasite-specific T cells are actively and continuously recruited to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2012</xref>). The process is tightly regulated, as circulating T cells that have been activated in the periphery can only persist within the brain when their cognate antigen is expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schaeffer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). Disrupting entry of newly activated T cells into the brain leads to impaired parasite restriction, indicating that ongoing T cell stimulation in the periphery is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>). However, because the brain parenchyma does not harbor lymphatic vessels, it remains poorly understood how peripheral T cells become alerted to the presence of microbial antigen in the brain.</p><p>In other organs, lymphatic vessels serve as conduits for the transport of tissue-derived antigen and dendritic cells to lymph nodes, where naive and memory T cells are optimally positioned for detection of their cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasteiger et al., 2016</xref>). The recent discovery of functional lymphatic vessels in the dura mater layer of meninges has prompted a significant reconsideration of how the CNS engages the peripheral immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Louveau et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aspelund et al., 2015</xref>). Meningeal lymphatic vessels are observed in rodents, primates, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absinta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albayram et al., 2022</xref>), and in experimental models of brain cancer and autoimmunity these vessels have been shown to play an integral role in regulating T cell responses in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>). Mouse studies have demonstrated that meningeal lymphatic vessels convey macromolecules and immune cells from the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the deep cervical lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>). Indeed, when model antigens like ovalbumin (OVA) are injected into the brain, these molecules travel from the brain interstitium into the CSF via glymphatic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iliff et al., 2012</xref>) and have the potential to be presented to T cells in the deep cervical lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In a murine model of acute brain infection, it was shown that meningeal lymphatic drainage contributes to the clearance of Japanese encephalitis virus from the brain and promotes host survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>). However, questions remain regarding how the meningeal lymphatic system affects T cell responses against brain-derived microbial antigen and the specific role that the meninges and meningeal lymphatic drainage play during chronic brain infection. In this study, we report an expansion of type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cell (cDC) populations in the dural meninges following infection with <italic>T. gondii</italic>. cDC2s in particular displayed broad upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class II, while both cDC1s and cDC2s were capable of sampling CSF-derived protein. Lymphatic vessel ligation experiments revealed that meningeal lymphatic drainage is required for dendritic cell responses in the deep cervical lymph nodes and promotes robust T cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production at this site. However, in contrast to the finding that meningeal lymphatic drainage is host-protective during acute viral infection of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2022</xref>), we observed that meningeal lymphatic drainage is dispensable for controlling <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection of the brain, with the T cell response in the brain remaining intact following surgical disruption of meningeal lymphatic outflow. Concurrent activation of T cells at alternative sites, including lymph nodes that do not drain the CNS, potentially explains the durability of the T cell response in the brain. Overall, our findings highlight the role of the dural meninges in the immune response to chronic brain infection, providing new evidence that meningeal lymphatic drainage promotes T cell responses against antigen expressed in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expansion of type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cell populations in the dural meninges during chronic brain infection</title><p>The dura mater layer of meninges has emerged as an important anatomic site for immune surveillance of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alves de Lima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rua and McGavern, 2018</xref>). Soluble brain- and CSF-derived molecules accumulate within the meninges around the dural sinuses and can be captured by local antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rustenhoven et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to the brain, which is devoid of lymphatic vessels, the dural meninges develop an extensive network of lymphatic vessels which directly transport soluble brain- and CSF-derived molecules to peripheral lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aspelund et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>). At homeostasis, a small number of APCs in the dural meninges surround these lymphatic vessels, and upon stimulation these cells can traffic to the deep cervical lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><p>Although CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHC II<sup>hi</sup> APCs accumulate in the brain during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">John et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2000</xref>), there is only limited evidence to suggest that, in the absence of local lymphatic vasculature, these cells are able to migrate out of the brain to transport antigen directly to peripheral lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarkson et al., 2017</xref>). By contrast, professional APCs in the dural meninges are uniquely positioned to sample CNS material and traffic through lymphatic vessels to lymph nodes for T cell activation. Supporting a role for these cells in the immune response to brain infection, we report a striking accumulation of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells in the dural meninges of <italic>CD11c<sup>YFP</sup></italic> reporter mice chronically infected with the ME49 strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells localized preferentially around the dural sinuses near meningeal lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), increasing local area coverage from 9% in naïve mice to 44% in chronically infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). This accumulation of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells around the sinuses was associated with a threefold increase in the number of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells co-localized to LYVE1<sup>+</sup> meningeal lymphatic vessels in infected mice compared to naïve mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–e</xref>). This observation suggests that dural APCs access lymphatic vessels in greater numbers in response to brain infection and is consistent with trafficking studies performed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conventional dendritic cells accumulate in the dural meninges during chronic brain infection and sample CSF-derived protein.</title><p>Mice were infected with 10 cysts of the ME49 strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> intraperitoneally (i.p.) and analyzed at 6 weeks post-infection.

Acute infection represents the period of time, lasting 2–3 weeks, when the parasite spreads systemically throughout the host’s peripheral tissues as fast-replicating tachyzoites. Once the parasite is cleared from peripheral tissues by a Th1-driven immune response, chronic infection takes hold and the parasite becomes largely confined to the CNS and skeletal muscle as slow-replicating, cyst-forming bradyzoites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saeij et al., 2005</xref>). Our analysis centered on cDC1s, which play a specialized role in the cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durai and Murphy, 2016</xref>) and are essential for generating early immunity against <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poncet et al., 2019</xref>), and cDC2s, which are important activators of CD4 +T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durai and Murphy, 2016</xref>) but whose role in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection remains unresolved. While there was no difference in the number of cDC1s (CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHC II<sup>hi</sup>CD64<sup>-</sup>CD26<sup>+</sup>XCR1<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>-</sup>) or cDC2s (CD45<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHC II<sup>hi</sup>CD64<sup>-</sup>CD26<sup>+</sup>XCR1<sup>-</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup>) in naive and acutely infected mice, by 6 weeks post-infection (wpi) there was a threefold increase in the number of cDC1s and sixfold increase in the number of cDC2s in the dural meninges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–g</xref>). Moreover, there was a shift in the proportion of cDC1s and cDC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a-e</xref>). At baseline, cDC2s made up only 20% of the CD26<sup>+</sup> cDC population in the dural meninges, but by 6 wpi cDC2s made up 40% of the CD26<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Intriguingly, the expansion of the dendritic cell compartment in the dural meninges during chronic infection tracked with increasing parasite burden in the brain, which was found to peak at 6 wpi by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>). By contrast, parasite could not be detected in the dural meninges at 6 wpi by either real-time PCR or immunostaining of PFA-fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). These data suggest that the accumulation of cDC1s and cDC2s in the dural meninges occurred independently of ongoing infection of the dural meninges. This finding reinforces an emerging view that immune cells at border tissues of the CNS, including the dural meninges, play a key role in responding to pathology within the brain parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alves de Lima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rua and McGavern, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rustenhoven et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cugurra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pulous et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the maturation status of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammer and Ma, 2013</xref>) in the dural meninges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i–k</xref>). Consistent with the increase in number of cDC1s and cDC2s at 6 wpi, upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and MHC class II occurred largely after progression to chronic brain infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i–k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e-g</xref>). Additionally, cDC2s displayed a much broader degree of activation compared to cDC1s, upregulating expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i–k</xref>). By contrast, cDC1s expressed minimal levels of CD80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>) and showed an increase in CD86 expression but not MHC class II expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j–k</xref>). These data suggest that chronic brain infection promotes maturation of dendritic cells in the dural meninges but has a greater effect on the activation status of cDC2s than cDC1s.</p><p>Because activated dendritic cells introduced into the CSF exit the CNS by accessing meningeal lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>), it is possible that some of the dendritic cells that we observed in the meninges of infected mice came from the CSF. Therefore, we performed flow cytometry on CSF pooled from 4 to 5 naive or chronically infected mice and saw that, in fact, a population of CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHC II<sup>hi</sup> APCs not present in naive mice emerged in the CSF of chronically infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a-b</xref>), expressing high levels of CD80 and CD86 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3c-e</xref>). Interestingly, the concentration of CSF-borne APCs was consistent with that reported by a study of human CSF samples isolated from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pashenkov et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to determine whether APCs in the dural meninges are able to transport CSF-derived protein during infection. CSF has been shown to function as a sink for brain-derived macromolecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plog and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>) and capturing CSF-borne protein represents a potential mechanism by which APCs in the dural meninges could sample brain-derived antigen and transport it to lymph nodes in the periphery. To address this question, soluble DQ-OVA was injected into the CSF of chronically infected mice via intra-cisterna magna (i.c.m.) injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>). DQ-OVA is a self-quenched conjugate of ovalbumin labeled with BODIPY dyes that only emits fluorescence after proteolytic cleavage. DQ-OVA has been commonly used to examine uptake and processing of soluble antigen by dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ling et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sixt et al., 2005</xref>). Within 2 hr of i.c.m. injection, we found that 30% of cDC1s and cDC2s in the dural meninges harbored DQ-OVA cleavage products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2h-j</xref>). After 24 hr, cleavage products were detected in ~5% of cDC1s and cDC2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2h-j</xref>), which may reflect egress of DQ-OVA +dendritic cells from the meninges or loss of the BODIPY fluorescent signal over time. Imaging of whole mount dural meninges revealed that DQ-OVA<sup>+</sup> cells were distributed along and within lymphatic vessels after 12 hr, suggesting that dural APCs capture and transport CSF-borne antigen during chronic brain infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1m</xref>). All together, these findings highlight significant changes in the APC compartment of the dural meninges in response to <italic>T. gondii</italic> brain infection. Type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cells increased in number in the dural meninges, displayed a more activated phenotype, and were able to sample CSF-borne protein in the vicinity of meningeal lymphatic vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>T cell responses in the deep cervical lymph nodes peak following progression to chronic brain infection</title><p>Initial studies in mice, and later in humans, have demonstrated that meningeal lymphatic vessels drain directly to the deep cervical lymph nodes (DCLN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albayram et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>). Even before the immunologic function of the meningeal lymphatic system started coming into focus, these lymph nodes were strongly implicated in regulating CNS immunity. For example, injection of antigen into rodent brains elicited strong humoral responses in the DCLNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harling-Berg et al., 1989</xref>), and surgical excision of the DCLNs contributed to a reduction in severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van Zwam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furtado, 2008</xref>). To date, few studies have examined the contribution of the deep cervical lymph nodes to immunity against CNS pathogens. To address the role of the DCLNs during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, we first confirmed that during chronic infection CSF-derived protein could be sampled by APCs within these lymph nodes. Upon i.c.m. injection of DQ-OVA into chronically infected mice, 3% of CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHC II<sup>hi</sup> APCs in the DCLNs were found to harbor digested protein products after 5 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>).

When C57BL/6 mice were infected with the ME49 strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, activated (CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup>) CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell number in the ILNs was greatest during acute infection (2 wpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), consistent with the broad distribution of parasite in peripheral tissues at this time point. Conversely, only a small number of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was detected in the DCLNs at 2 wpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>). Expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the DCLNs became more pronounced after progression to the chronic stage of infection, with the peak in number of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells occurring at 6–8 wpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>). To better understand the stage-dependent activation of T cells in the DCLNs, we used MHC class I tetramer to track a parasite epitope (SIINFEKL)-specific population of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells generated in response to infection with Pru-OVA, a recombinant type II strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> engineered to express a secreted, truncated form of the model antigen ovalbumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pepper et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Consistent with the polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response observed in response to ME49 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), the peak SIINFKEKL-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell response in the ILNs occurred during acute infection (2–3 wpi), when very few parasite-specific T cells were detectable in the DCLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). By contrast, expansion of parasite-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the DCLNs was greatest during chronic infection, increasing significantly between 3 and 6 wpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). These results likely reflect the distinct sources of antigen that each lymph node site drains during the different stages of infection. In support of this, we found that parasite-specific T cell responses in the DCLNs tracked with parasite burden in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), whereas parasite-specific T cell responses in the ILNs tracked with parasite burden in the ILNs. During acute infection, ILNs appear to drain parasite from infected peripheral tissues or become directly infected themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Notably, the DCLNs did not show high levels of parasite burden during acute infection, suggesting that hematogenous routes of dissemination did not provide significant access of the parasite to the DCLNs.</p><p>To understand how the quality of T cell responses generated in the DCLNs and brain change as infection progresses from the acute to chronic stage, we assessed expression of co-inhibitory molecules, which can become upregulated in the setting of persistent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Attanasio and Wherry, 2016</xref>), and markers that define the effector and memory T cell subsets during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Landrith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>).

Interestingly, restriction of meningeal lymphatic drainage by ligation had no effect on the total number of cDC1s and cDC2s in the DCLNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–c</xref>) but did result in a reduction in the frequency and number of CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC1 s and CD103<sup>+</sup> cDC2s at this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–i</xref>), consistent with a migratory function for this subset of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Merad et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mildner and Jung, 2014</xref>).

We then measured CellTrace Violet dilution in the DCLNs and ILNs 1 week after transfer. As expected, OT-I cells only accumulated in the brains of mice infected with Pru-OVA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f–g</xref>), and all of the OT-I cells detected in the brains of these mice had fully diluted their CellTrace Violet dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>), consistent with the notion that these cells undergo several rounds of proliferation prior to recruitment to the brain.</p><p>To understand where peripheral T cells undergo activation and proliferation, we started by measuring CellTrace Violet dilution in the CNS-draining deep cervical lymph nodes. Notably, 46% of OT-I cells displayed complete dilution in the DCLNs when mice were infected with Pru-OVA, compared to only 11% of OT-I cells when mice were infected with parental Pru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i–j</xref>). These data indicate that proliferation of SIINFEKL-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in CNS-draining lymph nodes is predominantly antigen-dependent, and only a limited degree of proliferation can be attributed to bystander activation. The OT-I cells used for adoptive transfer also expressed GFP under the control of the <italic>Nr4a1</italic> (Nur77) promoter, a reporter system that was originally developed as a tool to track antigen-dependent TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashouri and Weiss, 2017</xref>). However, we observed that GFP upregulation was equivalent in OT-I cells after infection with either Pru-OVA or parental Pru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a-d</xref>), even though OT-I cells proliferated to a significantly higher degree in the lymph nodes of mice infected with Pru-OVA compared to mice infected with parental Pru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i–l</xref>). To determine whether antigen-dependent T cell stimulation occurred in lymph nodes that drain non-CNS tissue during chronic infection, we measured CellTrace Violet dilution in the inguinal lymph nodes. Intriguingly, the degree of antigen-dependent T cell proliferation at this site was similar to that observed in the deep cervical lymph nodes, as 51% of OT-I cells fully diluted the tracer dye in mice infected with Pru-OVA compared to 8% of OT-I cells in mice infected with parental Pru (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k–l</xref>). These data lead us to conclude that antigenic stimulation of T cells occurs concurrently in CNS- and non-CNS-draining lymph nodes during chronic infection. What remains uncertain is the source of antigen eliciting T cell proliferation in the non-CNS-draining lymph nodes during chronic infection, though residual antigen persisting after acute infection seems a likely possibility due to the minimal presence of parasite in non-CNS tissues during the chronic stage of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).</p><p>In summary, these experiments reveal that both CNS-draining lymph nodes and non-CNS-draining lymph nodes are sources of newly activated parasite-specific T cells during the chronic stage of <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. Ongoing proliferation of T cells in lymph nodes that do not drain the CNS, such as the inguinal lymph nodes, may explain the durability of T cell responses in the brain when T cell responses in the deep cervical lymph nodes become impaired.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Due to the unique anatomic organization of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plog and Nedergaard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Louveau et al., 2015a</xref>), notably the absence of lymphatic vessels in the brain parenchyma, it has remained an open question how T cells outside the CNS detect and respond to microbial antigen expressed in the brain. The recent discovery of cerebrospinal fluid-draining lymphatic vessels in the dural meninges of mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Louveau et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absinta et al., 2017</xref>) has challenged previous frameworks for how foreign antigen exits the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Walter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weller et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we provide evidence that meningeal lymphatic drainage supports dendritic cell activation and peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against the brain-tropic pathogen <italic>T. gondii</italic>. We further demonstrate that meningeal lymphatic drainage is dispensable for T cell responses against the parasite in the brain, despite reports showing drainage to be essential for the development of CNS-directed T cell responses in models of brain cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The deep cervical lymph nodes have been strongly implicated in mediating immune responses to CNS antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harling-Berg et al., 1989</xref>). Consistent with this notion, infection with the Pru-OVA strain of <italic>T. gondii</italic> led to robust expansion of SIINFEKL-specific T cells in the deep cervical lymph nodes, and the magnitude of this response tracked with parasite burden in the brain as infection progressed. In peripheral organs, foreign antigen is transported directly from the site of infection to lymph nodes for immune cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liao and von der Weid, 2015</xref>). However, our data support a model in which antigen expressed in infected brain tissue must first reach the cerebrospinal fluid before it can be transported to lymph nodes for T cell activation. Indeed, parasite-specific T cell responses were significantly impaired in the DCLNs when lymphatic drainage of CSF components was restricted by surgical ligation. Future studies will be needed to more closely examine how CNS antigen is elaborated into the CSF.</p><p>In addition to the drainage of soluble antigen, lymphatic vessels promote the trafficking of dendritic cells from infected tissue after antigen uptake and phenotypic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Russo et al., 2013</xref>). Even though the dural meninges did not harbor active infection at 6 wpi, we observed a significant accumulation of type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC) at this site, with a large proportion of CD11c<sup>+</sup> antigen-presenting cells distributing specifically around the dural sinuses where they could sample CSF-derived protein. Interestingly, as infection progressed from the acute to chronic stage, there was a shift in the relative proportion of cDC1s and cDC2s, and cDC2s displayed a greater degree of activation. While it is well-established that cDC1s are critical for initiating Th1 immunity against <italic>T. gondii</italic> during acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Poncet et al., 2019</xref>), less is known about the role of cDC1s and cDC2s during chronic infection. It also remains to be determined what factors released in the brain, CSF, or meninges signal on cDC2s to induce maturation during infection. Likely candidates include IFN-γ and TNF-α, which become highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matta et al., 2021</xref>), as well as pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as the TLR11 agonist <italic>T. gondii</italic> profilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yarovinsky et al., 2005</xref>), or damage-associated molecular patterns, which can accumulate in the CSF during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Still et al., 2020</xref>). Even though CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> cells are observed to accumulate in the brain during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, it is unclear whether these cells are able to migrate to peripheral lymph nodes, a function that dural dendritic cells have been shown to exhibit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louveau et al., 2018b</xref>). Some studies have suggested that dendritic cells in the brain travel along the rostral migratory stream and exit by crawling along olfactory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohammad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaminski et al., 2012</xref>), but two-photon live imaging studies of <italic>T. gondii</italic>-infected mouse brains has revealed that CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells, including tissue-resident macrophages and dendritic cells, are largely immotile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">John et al., 2011</xref>). EAE studies suggest that the function of dendritic cells in the CNS may be to support local reactivation of T cells or promote T cell entry into the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goverman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D’Agostino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mundt et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, dendritic cells in the different anatomic compartments of the CNS likely play distinct roles in regulating immune responses to CNS antigen. Further studies are needed to clarify the function of dendritic cells at these sites, though challenges remain due to limitations in targeting cells within different compartments of the CNS.</p><p>Disrupting meningeal lymphatic drainage during chronic brain infection caused an impairment in parasite-specific T cell activation and proliferation in the DCLNs, but did not affect T cell responses in the brain. Because the T cell population in the brain requires continual replenishment by circulating T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>), these results suggest that alternative sources of antigen likely exist outside the CNS-draining lymph nodes during chronic infection. In fact, we observed significant antigen-dependent proliferation of OT-I cells in both the deep cervical lymph nodes and the inguinal lymph nodes six weeks after infection. The source of antigen in the inguinal lymph nodes is still not completely clear. However, considering the robust T cell responses and high levels of parasite gDNA observed in the inguinal lymph nodes during acute infection, it is possible that residual antigen persisting after clearance of acute infection contributed to the proliferation of OT-I cells at this site during chronic infection. In models of influenza or vesicular stomatitis virus infection, antigen depots were found to persist for weeks to months after viral clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Turner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zammit et al., 2006</xref>). It is also possible that low-grade infection of skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melchor et al., 2020</xref>) contributes to peripheral T cell responses during chronic infection, although parasite gDNA was not detected in skeletal muscle by real-time PCR 6 weeks after infection with Pru-OVA. Studies examining T cell responses against bradyzoite-specific antigens could help clarify two important points: (1) the degree to which T cell activation in lymph nodes that drain non-CNS tissues is a result of chronic infection of these tissues and (2) the potential importance of CNS lymphatic drainage in generating immune responses to antigens specifically expressed by the latent form of the parasite.</p><p>The presence of peripheral antigen during <italic>T. gondii</italic> brain infection is not surprising, as most CNS pathogens display varying degrees of tropism for multiple tissues and originate at a peripheral site prior to hematogenous dissemination to the brain, CSF, or meninges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cain et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, peripheral infection may serve to ‘immunize’ the host ahead of CNS infection, making the drainage of CNS antigen to the deep cervical lymph nodes more redundant. By contrast, when tumors originate within the CNS, meningeal lymphatic drainage was found to be indispensable for T cell-dependent immunity in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2020</xref>), likely because there were not alternative sources of antigen outside the CNS. Consistent with this idea, when tumor cells were injected into the flank of mice at the same time as intracranial engraftment, survival benefits of VEGF-C-enhanced meningeal lymphatic drainage were abrogated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Song et al., 2020</xref>). These results harken back to early studies performed by Medawar in the 1940s showing that skin grafts in the brain were rejected more quickly and at higher rates when also engrafted to the chest of rabbits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Medawar, 1948</xref>). For these reasons, we predict that meningeal lymphatic drainage may not be necessary to generate T cell responses against metastatic brain tumors, given the presence of early peripheral antigen prior to seeding of the brain.</p><p>To conclude, our study provides novel insight into how T cells respond to antigen expressed in the brain by a neurotropic pathogen. Our data shed new light on how the dural meninges promotes neuroimmune communication, while refining our understanding of how meningeal lymphatic drainage helps to preserve the health of the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were housed at University of Virginia specific pathogen-free facilities with a 12 hr light/dark cycle.

The sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscles were retracted and collecting lymphatic vessels afferent to the DCLNs were ligated using 9–0 nylon suture (Living Systems Instrumentation, THR-G). After bilateral ligation of the lymphatic vessels, the skin was closed using 5–0 nylon sutures and mice received s.c. injection of ketoprofen (2 mg/kg). Mice were then allowed to recover on a heating pad until awake. Sham operations were performed in a similar manner, except lymphatic vessels were not ligated after retraction of the SCM muscles and exposure of the DCLNs. In one experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), ligation of lymphatic vessels draining cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the superficial cervical lymph nodes (SCLN) was also performed. Because not all lymphatic vessels afferent to the SCLNs transport CSF, Evans blue tracer studies were completed to identify the six afferent lymphatic vessels (three on each side) that carry CSF to the SCLNs. These lymphatic vessels were bilaterally ligated using 9–0 nylon suture immediately after ligation of the lymphatic vessels afferent to the DCLNs and just prior to wound closure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cerebrospinal fluid tracer analysis</title><p>To assess the function of meningeal lymphatic drainage in mice that had received ligation surgery, tracers were injected into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and outflow to the deep cervical lymph nodes or superficial cervical lymph nodes was measured. For qualitative assessment, 5 μl of 10% Evans blue (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in artificial CSF (aCSF, Harvard Apparatus) was introduced into the subarachnoid space of ligated or sham-operated mice by intra-cisterna magna (i.c.m.) injection. One hour after injection, mice were sacrificed and drainage of the dye to the DCLNs was visualized under a S6D stereomicroscope (Leica). For quantitative assessment, 3 μl of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated ovalbumin (OVA-AF594, Thermo Fisher) or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated ovalbumin (OVA-AF488, Thermo Fisher) diluted in aCSF (2 mg/ml) was introduced into the subarachnoid space of ligated or sham-operated mice by i.c.m. injection. Two hours after injection, mice were sacrificed and the amount of OVA-AF594 or OVA-AF488 present in the DCLNs or SCLNs was determined by fluorescence spectroscopy. Briefly, DCLNs and SCLNs were harvested and enzymatically digested with Collagenase D (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by a 2 hr treatment in T-PER Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific) at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at &gt;10,000 rpm to remove cellular debris and the supernatant containing extracted protein was transferred to a black flat-bottom microwell plate (Millipore Sigma, M9685). Relative fluorescence intensity of each sample was measured on a SpectraMax iD3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices) using an excitation wavelength of 590 nm and emission wavelength of 630 nm for OVA-AF594 and an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm for OVA-AF488 before comparison to a standard curve to determine the total amount of tracer that drained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DQ-OVA analysis</title><p>The uptake and processing of CSF-derived protein by antigen-presenting cells outside the CNS was evaluated by injecting 3 μl of DQ-OVA (2 mg/ml, Invitrogen) into the CSF of chronically infected C57BL/6 mice by i.c.m. injection. The fluorescent signal of proteolytically cleaved DQ-OVA, with a peak excitation wavelength of 505 nm and peak emission wavelength of 515 nm, was then detected by flow cytometry or confocal microscopy. For flow cytometry studies, the dural meninges, deep cervical lymph nodes, and inguinal lymph nodes were harvested and prepared as single-cell suspensions for cell surface staining 2 hr, 5 hr, or 24 hr after i.c.m. injection of DQ-OVA. For flow acquisition, fluorescence emitted by processed DQ-OVA was detected using the FL1 sensor (525/40 nm) of a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) or using a Cytek Aurora Flow Cytometry System. For imaging studies, mice were sacrificed 12 h after injection of DQ-OVA, and whole-mount dural meninges were fixed, then immunostained using directly-conjugated antibodies targeting MHC class II (Super Bright 436, eBioscience) and LYVE1 (eFluor 660, eBioscience). Fluorescence emitted by processed DQ-OVA was detected using 488 nm laser excitation on a TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Image analysis was performed on dural meninges whole mounts or on sectioned brain tissue. After sacrifice, transcardiac perfusion of mice was performed using 20 ml of cold 1 X PBS. The dorsal aspect of the skull was removed and the dural meninges were fixed, while still attached to the skull bone, in 4% PFA for 6–8 hr at 4 °C. Then, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Louveau et al., 2018a</xref>), whole-mount dural meninges were carefully dissected and stored in 1 X PBS. To prepare brains for image analysis, mice were perfused with 20 ml of cold 4% PFA immediately after perfusion with 1 X PBS. Brains were bisected along the sagittal midline and post-fixed in cold 4% PFA for 24 hr. Brains were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 24 hr at 4 °C, embedded in OCT (Tissue Tek), and frozen on dry ice. 50-μm sections were then prepared using a CM 1950 cryostat (Leica) and stored in 1 X PBS as free-floating sections. To immunostain whole mount meninges or free-floating brain sections, the fixed tissues were first incubated in a blocking solution (2% normal donkey serum, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 1 X PBS) at room temperature for 45 min. Then, tissue was stained for 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with directly-conjugated primary antibodies. If a secondary antibody was used, then samples were washed three times in a solution of 0.05% Tween 20 (in 1 X PBS) and stained for 1 hr at room temperature. Finally, tissues were washed three times in a solution of 0.05% Tween 20 (in 1 X PBS), mounted onto glass slides using AquaMount (Fisher Scientific), and coverslipped. In some experiments, the tissue was counter-stained with DAPI (Thermo Scientific) and washed just before mounting onto slides. Primary antibodies (from eBioscience) included: MHC class II (I-A/I-E)-Super Bright 436 (62-5321-80), LYVE1-EF570 (41-0443-82), LYVE1-EF660 (50-0443-82), and anti-ME49 (gift from Fausto Araujo). Secondary antibody (used to stain ME49): donkey anti-rabbit-AF488 (Thermo Fisher). Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope and analyzed using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

For analysis of the dural meninges, the dorsal aspect of the skull was removed and the dural meninges were carefully dissected from the skull bone under a S6D stereomicroscope (Leica). The tissue was then digested in 1 X HBSS (without Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Gibco) with Collagenase D (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and Collagenase VIII (1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 30 min, before being passed through a 70 μm strainer (Corning). Cells were then pelleted, resuspended, and kept on ice. Deep cervical lymph nodes (DCLNs), which are positioned laterally to the trachea and underneath the sternocleidomastoid muscles, and inguinal lymph nodes (ILNs) were harvested bilaterally into cold complete RPMI media (cRPMI; 10% FBS [Gibco], 1% penicillin/streptomycin [Gibco], 1% sodium pyruvate [Gibco], 1% non-essential amino acids [Gibco], and 0.1% 2-Mercaptoethanol [Life Technologies]). Lymph nodes were mechanically homogenized and gently pressed through a 70 μm strainer (Corning). Cells were then pelleted, resuspended, and kept on ice. Brains were harvested into cold cRPMI, minced with a razor blade, and passed through an 18-gauge and 22-gauge needle for mechanical homogenization. Tissue was then digested in a solution containing collagenase/dispase (0.227 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and DNase (50 U/ml, Roche) at 37 °C for 45–60 min, before being passed through a 70 μm strainer (Corning) and washed with cRPMI. Myelin was separated from mononuclear cells by resuspending samples in 20 ml of 40% Percoll (Cytiva) and centrifuging at 650 g for 25 min. Myelin was aspirated and cell pellets were washed, resuspended, and kept on ice. Spleens were harvested into cold cRPMI, then mechanically homogenized and washed through a 40 μm strainer (Corning). Cells were resuspended in RBC lysis solution (0.16 M NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) for 2 min. Cells were then washed, resuspended, and kept on ice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cerebrospinal fluid collection for flow cytometry</title><p>Mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection of a solution containing ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) diluted in saline. An incision in the skin was made at the base of the skull and the muscle layers overlying the atlanto-occipital membrane were retracted. A pulled glass capillary (Sutter Instrument, BF100-50-10) was inserted through the membrane into the cisterna magna and 5–10 μl of CSF was collected per mouse. CSF from four to five mice was pooled, and a total of 25 μl of CSF per pooled sample was analyzed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Single-cell suspensions prepared from tissues or cerebrospinal fluid were pipetted into a 96-well plate and pelleted. Eight-color experiments were performed on a Gallios flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) and prepared as follows: Cells were treated with 50 μl of Fc block (0.1% rat gamma globulin [Jackson ImmunoResearch], 1 μg/ml of 2.4G2 [BioXCell]) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained for surface markers and incubated with a fixable live/dead viability dye for 30 min at 4 °C. In experiments where SIINFEKL-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were analyzed, cells were pre-incubated with PE-conjugated H-2K<sup>b</sup>/OVA (SIINFEKL) tetramer (NIH Tetramer Core Facility) for 15 min at room temperature prior to cell surface staining. After surface staining, cells were washed with FACS buffer (0.2% BSA and 2 mM EDTA in 1 X PBS) and, if intracellular staining was performed, cells were treated with a fixation/permeabilization solution (eBioscience, 00-5123-43 and 00-5223-56) overnight then stained for intracellular markers in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience, 00-8333-56) for 30 min at 4 °C. Finally, samples were resuspended in FACS buffer and acquired. Fourteen-color experiments were performed using a Cytek Aurora Flow Cytometry System (spectral flow cytometry) and prepared as follows: Cells were stained with a Live/Dead Fixable Red Dead Cell Stain (Thermo Fisher, L34971) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed and then treated with 50 μl of Fc block (as above) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained for surface markers for 30 min at 4 °C.

Finally, samples were resuspended in FACS buffer and acquired after spectral unmixing using single-color controls. Samples acquired on the Gallios flow cytometer and Cytek Aurora Flow Cytometry System were analyzed using FlowJo software v.10. For cerebrospinal fluid, cell counts were determined using absolute counting beads (Life Technologies, C36950) pipetted into samples just prior to acquisition.

In Figure 1, DC are quantified using CD11cYFP reporter, or CD11c gating strategy (which by the way is not very clean in several figures), which is not sufficient to prove that those are DCs (for instance, activated macrophages can upregulate Cd11c in infectious settings). A better gating strategy (migDC, cDC1, cDC2) in the dura and the dCLN should be provided if the authors want to show that those DC are important for antigen transfer in the dCLN. Is there a correlation between DC number in the meninges and parasite load in the brain?</p><p>2. The time course of both the WT strain and the attenuated strain loads (gDNA<sup>+</sup> cysts number) should be given in the brain, meninges, and peripheral tissues over time, to better understand in each model when and where the infection and thus the priming occurs. This should be part of Figure 1, to explain the model.</p><p>3. Fig1m is misleading, because there are more DCs around the sinuses in general after infection, not particularly around/in the lymphatics. If the authors were to quantify DC number in Lyve-1 negative area, they would still find an increase. So this does not prove that DCs are going through the lymphatics. As this has already been shown anyway by Kipnis group, they should refer to their study.</p><p>4. From Fig1p, it's unclear how the uptake is calculated to be 40% (it looks like 90% to me).</p><p>5. In Fig1q, MHC-II stain is everywhere and blurry, so it's hard to see colocalization.</p><p>6. It's unclear why the authors looked at DC in the CSF and how they envision the role of CSF DC versus dural DC in priming?</p><p>7. In Figure 2, why were 5 hours time point chosen? It seems too fast to have a full picture of migrating DCs (I think in their seminal study, Kipnis used 24h), and too long to only look at soluble antigen drainage.</p><p>8. T cell activation is sometimes looked at using IFNγ, or CD44/CD62L strategy, or CD69 (which by the way is not convincing in Figure 3-Supp2). It's unclear why, and this makes the comparison more difficult. It would be interesting to have the total number of CD4 and CD8 also, independently of their activation status.</p><p>9. It's convincing that there is a defect in T cell activation in the dCLN upon ligation (Ki67, IFNγ, TNFa which by the way should be in the same figure). Visudyne treatment to locally delete meningeal lymphatics would have been a plus, to prove that this is through dural drainage.</p><p>10. In Figure 4, I guess there are no changes neither in CD69+ or CD62L- T cells but have the authors checked? More importantly, what about exhausted and resident CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells?</p><p>11. It would have been expected that because of the ligation, T cells would get stuck in the meninges. Have the authors quantified T cell accumulation in the meninges at 6w?</p><p>12. In Figure 5, it's interesting to show that even in the chronic phase, T cells are still primed as antigen is still available. What is the contribution of these newly generated OT1 cells in the pool of brain T cells (I guess it should be low, otherwise there would be a phenotype when they are not generated)? And what is the phenotype (activation/exhaustion/residence) of those OT1 generated in the chronic phase when they reach the brain? This would be relevant in the cancer field too.</p><p>13. Are CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells the main drivers of parasite clearance (is the brain load higher upon CD4 or CD8 depletion?).</p><p>14. The fact that T cells activated in the dCLN do not contribute substantially to the pool of brain T cells in the chronic phase could be expected, as the infection is given i.p. and as other organs seem chronically infected in the periphery. However, it would be interesting to address this question when the pathogen is mainly replicating in the CNS. Could the authors use icv injection of T.g.?</p><p>15. It would also be interesting to look at experimental settings in which, during the chronic phase, only the brain is releasing antigen (maybe give a treatment that does not cross the BBB? Or surgically remove/exchange the peripheral organ that is a parasite reservoir). The impact of those chronically primed T cells in the dCLN, if they are the only ones that can be generated, should be very interesting.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript convincingly shows that drainage to the dCLN is required to activate dCLN T cells in the chronic phase, but those T cells do not seem to substantially contribute to the pool of brain T cells at this stage. However, some very interesting data could emerge from this model, by looking at the becoming of OT1 generated in the chronic versus acute phase. More importantly, it would be really interesting and impactful to address the role of those dCLN-generated T cells in the acute and chronic phases, in models where the CNS is the main source of antigen, in the acute or chronic phase. These new data would really bring novelty and impact to this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The gating strategy shown in Figure 1 Suppl1 is for Cd11c+ MHCII+ APCs but does not allow to identify DCs. The MHCII staining looks a bit funky too. There's no real negative population. Can the authors comment on that? Can the authors also show MHCII vs dump?</p><p>– In general, there hasn't been used a DC-specific marker combination to identify, characterise and distinguish DCs from other CD11c+ MHCII+ phagocytes (i.e. MdCs or BAMs). The authors should either stick to calling the cells dural APCs throughout the manuscript or perform additional experiments to characterise these cells better and more accurately (for example with an FC panel including CD26 to identify DCs and CD88 to discriminate from MdCs and XCR1 to distinguish cDC1s from cDC2s).</p><p>– The authors show an increase in CD11c+ APCs in chronically infected mice, is coincident with chronic infection and increased parasite burden on the brain(?). What happens in the acute stage, e.g. 2 weeks after infection? (Figure 1c)</p><p>– Independence of direct infection of the dura: Although, this finding is not central to the main message of the paper it would have been nice if that was supported by a second approach, e.g. microscopy, to exclude the presence of <italic>T. gondii</italic> cysts in the dura mater (Figure 1d)</p><p>– In Figures 1k and m there seem to be a lot of Cd11c-YFP cells in naïve mice which can not be seen in Figure 1b. Can the authors comment on that?</p><p>– DQ-OVA experiments are nice and convincing but such experiments have been performed previously. Can the authors provide additional information, for instance on the composition of APCs that have sampled Ag in the CNS and enter the lymphatic vessels in the dura mater?</p><p>– The CSF data are really intriguing. I was just wondering about the CD80 and Cd86 expression and the FMO data. Was this gated on DCs (Cd11c+ MHCII+) minus CD80 in Figure 1-sup 2, c and Cd11c+ MHCII+ minus CD86 in Figure 1-sup 2, d, respectively? Can the authors show the raw data here? Also, the expression of Cd80 and Cd86 should be shown as MFI and not in frequency since you don't have an isolated population of CD80/86+ cells but rather a shift in the total cells.</p><p>– Again, is it possible to distinguish and characterize DQ_OVA+ cells in the DCLNs? Are the CD11cMHCII cDC1s and/or cDC2s? Are there DQ-OVA+ B cells? (Figure 2)</p><p>– Is it possible to track OVA specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well? (Figure 2) (if not you can transfer of OT-I and OT-II cells for example and characterize their activation – cytokine response and proliferation (CTV dilution), etc.).</p><p>– line 208-9 &quot;deep cervical lymph nodes play a distinct role from other lymph nodes in supporting T cells responses …&quot; – That's probably a bit misleading. The data rather suggest/confirm that there are distinct disease stages with the temporal change of the primary site of infection during chronification. The increased T cell responses in the DCLN at later stages just reflect the increased parasite load in the brain. The &quot;role&quot; of the LNs in supporting T cell responses is probably the same though (as stated correctly in 222-24).</p><p>– The authors claim that dendritic cells number in the DCLNs are dramatically reduced after blockage of CNS Ag drainage (Figure 3b). As mentioned above the use of Cd11c and MHCII is not sufficient to identify DCs. Are other cells also reduced? B cells for instance? Is there a cell type that is not reduced (negative control)?</p><p>– The authors report a decreased activation of DCLNs DCs upon ligation of the lymphatic vessels. However, if they block the influx of activated DCs from the brain it is to be expected that there are fewer CD80/86 expressing cells in the LN (Figure 3c,d). Hence the reduced frequency of CD80/86 expressing cells likely just reflects the reduction in activated APCs rather than a change of the phenotype. Can the authors show the raw data here too?</p><p>I would expect that also here it's not possible to gate on CD80/86 positive cells but rather report a change in the MFI. This experiment doesn't really add much information but ok to show in the suppl. data.</p><p>– I wouldn't call the decrease of CD69+ T cells in the DCLNs &quot;striking&quot; (line 252). It is rather moderate, particularly for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which is ok.</p><p>– Similar to CD80/86 data for DCs, the phenotypic change of T cells in the DCLNs upon ligation is not surprising as the authors already showed that the influx of activated T cells is reduced. Nevertheless, it confirms the general message that CNS Ag drainage is required for anti-<italic>T. gondii</italic> T cell immunity in the DCLNs. Unfortunately, the IFNγ data do not look very convincing (in particular in Figure 3o). Can the authors include a noninfected control mouse a s well as an unstimulated sample? Maybe also use PMA/ionomycin stimulation as a positive control.</p><p>– Can the authors transfer OT-I and OT-II cells and determine the impact of lymphatic vessel ligation on Ag-specific proliferation and cytokine production during infection with the Pru-OVA strain? (please also take the in the brain) (add to figure 3)</p><p>– The time point of the ligation seems a bit arbitrary. What's the exact working hypothesis? Some thoughts: The parasite finds its way to the brain despite the presence of a functional T cell response. It is possible that without CNS drainage there would be more parasite load (which is not the case in the present experimental setup). Could the ligation during the infection phase have interfered with the seeding of the brain by itself and &quot;dilute&quot; the effect on parasite load by interfering with T cell responses in the DCLNs? Is it not also possible that reducing Ag drainage would result in a reactivation of the parasite? Can that happen at a later time point? Could the authors block Ag drainage during the chronic phase and look for T cell responses and parasite load at later time points? (e.g. ligation at 6-8 weeks and readout 3 and 6 weeks later?). Is the control of the parasite tachyzoites different from that of bradyzoites? Could the authors check for that (e.g. by qPCR for Bag1 and Sag1 or sth similar or maybe even by histology)?</p><p>– The explanation that T cell priming in the periphery is sufficient to lead to T-Gondii specific T cells responses in the CNS is plausible. Does the ligation affect the drainage of CNS Ag to other LNs? Are DC numbers and T cell activation affected by it? The explanation that peripheral Ag is sufficient to induce <italic>T. gondii</italic> T cell which enter the brain to control <italic>T. gondii</italic> seems logical, however, the narrative seemed a bit surprising since the inguinal lymph nodes were introduced as a &quot;negative control&quot; for T cell responses at later time points (during chronic infection). Can the authors show a naïve control of the Nur77GFP experiment (Figure 5 Suppl. 1)</p><p>– The discussion seems a bit long and could be a bit more focussed (e.g. remove glymphatic flow part?)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80775.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>We all agree that the study warrants publication pending adequate revision.</p><p>Please find below the key revision points that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) A better gating strategy to quantify DC subsets with kinetics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this critical suggestion, and we have addressed this concern by providing a more refined analysis of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells using specific markers of type 1 and type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s and cDC2s, respectively). We developed a gating strategy using a framework defined by Guilliams et al. (2016) and consistent with well-established dendritic cell lineage markers (Merad, Sathe et al. 2013). This gating strategy is provided in Figure 1 Supp 1. Briefly, we used a lineage dump gate to exclude T cells (CD3<sup>+</sup>), B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup>), NK cells (NK1.1<sup>+</sup>), neutrophils (Ly6G<sup>+</sup>), and erythroid cells (TER-119<sup>+</sup>) from our CD45<sup>+</sup> population of interest. We then gated on the CD64<sup>-</sup> subset of CD11c<sup>hi</sup>MHCII<sup>hi</sup> cells to exclude macrophages (CD64<sup>+</sup>) that upregulated CD11c in the setting of inflammation. Next, we gated on CD26<sup>+</sup> cells, which defines FLT3-dependent conventional dendritic cells (Nakano, Moran et al. 2015). Finally, we gated on XCR1<sup>+</sup>SIRPα<sup>-</sup> cDC1s and XCR1<sup>-</sup>SIRPα<sup>+</sup> cDC2s, markers that reliably track with expression of the cDC1 and cDC2 lineage-defining transcription factors IRF8 and IRF4, respectively (Guilliams, Dutertre et al. 2016). This gating strategy was employed for analysis of dendritic cells in the dural meninges (Figure 1f-k, Figure 1 Supp 2) and for analysis of DQ-OVA<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells in the DCLNs (Figure 2 Supp 1).</p><p>To understand the kinetics of dendritic cell accumulation in the dural meninges, we quantified cDC1 and cDC2 number and frequency in naïve, acutely infected (2 wpi), and chronically infected (6 wpi) mice (Figure 1f-g, Figure 1 Supp 2a-c). We additionally examined the kinetics of dendritic cell activation by measuring cDC1 and cDC2 expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II (Figure 1i-k, Figure 1 Supp 2e-g). Interestingly, we did not observe a difference in cDC1 or cDC2 number or frequency between naïve and acutely infected mice. However, in chronically infected mice, there was a striking increase in cDC1 and cDC2 number and a shift in frequency of the two populations. Additionally, expression of co-stimulatory molecules peaked at 6 wpi. We also measured parasite burden in the brain and dural meninges at these same time points in order to determine whether there was a relationship between dendritic cell accumulation/activation and parasite burden in either tissue (Figure 1h). In fact, expansion and activation of the cDC1 and cDC2 populations in the dural meninges corresponded to increased parasite burden in the brain at 6 wpi and not to parasite burden in the dural meninges. Indeed, the dural meninges lacked evidence of direct infection at 6 wpi both by real-time PCR and by fluorescent immunohistochemistry (Figure 1h, Figure 1 Supp 2d).</p><p>In order to understand the functional capacity of cDC1s and cDC2s both in the dural meninges and in the draining deep cervical lymph nodes (DCLNs), we quantified the frequency of cDC1s and cDC2s at 6 wpi that harbored processed DQ-OVA either 2 h or 24 h after injection into the CSF (Figure 1 Supp 2h-j, Figure 2 Supp 1). We chose these timepoints because soluble CSF-borne protein can be detected in the DCLNs within 2 h of i.c.m. injection in infected mice (Figure 3 Supp 1b) and previous experiments have revealed that dendritic cells from the dural meninges traffic to the DCLNs by 24 h (Louveau, Herz et al. 2018). Our studies demonstrated that cDC1s and cDC2s were equally capable of capturing CSF-derived protein during chronic brain infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A better definition of T cell responses with kinetics and fate of OT1/ dCLN generated T cell generated in the chronic versus acute phase.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to characterize the phenotype of OT-Is generated in the DCLN and OT-Is that trafficked to the brain, we designed an experiment in which OT-I cells (CD45.1 congenic) were adoptively transferred to C57BL/6 mice either during acute infection (at 10 days post-infection) or during chronic infection (at 5 weeks post-infection) (Figure 2 Supp 3a). Seven days later, we measured expression of relevant markers in the DCLNs and brain, including PD-1, TIM-3, and LAG-3, and markers that have been shown to define effector and memory-like T cells during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, including Trm-like cells (Chu, Chan et al. 2016, Landrith, Sureshchandra et al. 2017). We examined the phenotype of both the transferred CD45.1<sup>+</sup> T cell population and the endogenous CD45.1<sup>-</sup> SIINFEKL-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell population. Briefly, we observed low expression of co-inhibitory molecules on both the endogenous and transferred populations and, as expected, saw an increase in the memory subsets of endogenous parasite-specific T cells during chronic infection. The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 2 Supp 3 and Figure 2 Supp 4. We also examined expression of these markers on the polyclonal CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations in sham or ligated mice, as shown in Figure 4 Supp 2, Figure 5 Supp 2, and Figure 5 Supp 3. From these experiments, we can conclude that there is a reduction in expression of co-inhibitory molecules in the DCLNs after ligation, consistent with a reduction in T cell activation, and no differences in co-inhibitory molecule expression or memory status in the brain after ligation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Kinetics of parasite replication in the periphery (e.g. in tissue draining to ILN) and in the dural meninges, for WT and/or Pru-OVA strains to provide a better context to understand the localization of T cell priming in chronic and acute phases.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that this is an essential experiment. Therefore, following infection with Pru-OVA, we measured parasite burden by real-time PCR in several CNS and peripheral compartments at 7 days post-infection (dpi), 2 wpi, 3 wpi, and 6 wpi. These data are provided in Figure 2f, in order to provide context to the analysis of parasite-specific T cell responses in the deep cervical lymph nodes (DCLN) and inguinal lymph nodes (ILN) over the course of acute and chronic infection. Parasite burden was measured in the brain and dural meninges, as these sites are drained by the DCLNs, and in the subcutaneous tissue underlying the skin of the flank, as this site drains to the ILNs. Parasite burden was also measured in the DCLNs and ILNs themselves, which may be direct sites of infection themselves. Finally, parasite burden was measured in the quadriceps femoris skeletal muscle, as it has been reported that <italic>T. gondii</italic> persists in skeletal muscle during chronic infection, although detection by real-time PCR has demonstrated levels to be low or undetectable (Jin, Blair et al. 2017, Melchor, Hatter et al. 2020).</p><p>We find that parasite burden is highest, among the tissues studied, in the inguinal lymph nodes during acute infection (7 dpi) and undetectable in the brain and dural meninges. By contrast, as infection progressed into the chronic stage, parasite burden increased in the brain and by 6 wpi was detectable only at this site. These results suggest that during acute infection, parasite (and <italic>T. gondii</italic> antigen) is greatest in lymph nodes that drain peripheral tissues, such as the ILNs. The high levels of parasite gDNA in the ILNs likely reflects drainage of parasite or infected cells from infected peripheral tissues or direct infection of the lymph nodes themselves. During chronic infection, parasite could be detected only in the brain, and not in the dural meninges or skeletal muscle. These data explain the robust T cell responses in the DCLNs observed at 6 wpi (Figure 2c-e) and suggest that the antigen-dependent T cell responses observed in the ILNs during chronic infection (Figure 6) may result from residual antigen in the ILNs persisting after the resolution of acute infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Is there a correlation between DC number in the meninges and parasite load in the brain?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an important point, and we have addressed this concern by providing a more refined analysis of CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells by spectral flow cytometry, using very specific markers of cDC1s and cDC2s. Our new gating strategy is discussed above (Editor’s Essential Revisions, Point 1). Like the reviewer, we were also interested in the question of whether DC number in the meninges tracked with parasite load in the brain or meninges. For this reason, we measured cDC1 and cDC2 number in naïve, acutely infected (2 wpi), and chronically infected (6 wpi) mice (Figure 1f-g) and, in a separate cohort of mice, measured parasite burden by real-time PCR in the brain and dural meninges at these same time points (Figure 1h). Interestingly, cDC1 and cDC2 accumulation in the dural meninges (as well as activation of cDC1s and cDC2s, as measured by CD80, CD86, and MHC class II expression, Figure 1i-k, Figure 1 Supp 2e-g) corresponded to increased parasite burden in the brain and not the dural meninges. In fact, parasite gDNA was not detected in the dural meninges of any mice at 6 wpi and could only be detected in 4/7 mice at 2 wpi (Figure 1h).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have changed our language in the text to make the rationale for this experiment more clear. In short, seminal studies by the Kipnis lab demonstrated that dendritic cells injected into the CSF exit the CNS through meningeal lymphatic vessels (Louveau, Herz et al. 2018). Because we observed an increase in the number of CD11c+ cells in the area of the meninges around the lymphatic vessels, we sought to determine whether dendritic cells were present in the CSF. Though this experiment does not directly address the different functions of CSF and dural APCs, we believe our findings represent a valuable first step towards understanding the distinct functions of APCs in the different compartments of the CNS and CNS border tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 2, why were 5 hours time point chosen? It seems too fast to have a full picture of migrating DCs (I think in their seminal study, Kipnis used 24h), and too long to only look at soluble antigen drainage.</p></disp-quote><p>The 5-hour time point was selected based on a pilot experiment used to identify when emission of digested DQ-OVA products becomes detectable in the dural meninges. We agree with the reviewer’s criticism that this time point limits our ability to discriminate between drainage of soluble antigen and transport of antigen by migratory DCs, although the gold standard would be to design an experiment using photoconvertible dendritic cells, as was already performed by Louveau et al. in naïve animals (2018). Nonetheless, in order to achieve a preliminary understanding of whether DQ-OVA emission in the DCLNs is dependent on drainage of soluble antigen or transport via migratory DCs, we performed a new set of experiments examining the presence of CSF-derived DQ-OVA within cDC1s and cDC2s at 2 h and 24 h after i.c.m. injection (Figure 1 Supp 2h-j, Figure 2 Supp 1). However, because the frequency of DQ-OVA<sup>+</sup> cDC1s and cDC2s decreased from 30% at 2 h to 5% at 24 h in the dural meninges but did not change in the DCLNs, it remains unclear whether a large portion of DQ-OVA<sup>+</sup> cells migrated from the dura or if the fluorescent signal produced by DQ-OVA cleavage products declines over time with additional processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. T cell activation is sometimes looked at using IFNγ, or CD44/CD62L strategy, or CD69 (which by the way is not convincing in Figure 3-Supp2). It's unclear why, and this makes the comparison more difficult. It would be interesting to have the total number of CD4 and CD8 also, independently of their activation status.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that the rationale for these parameters was not clear. The decision to assess activation status of T cells using CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> or CD69 was based on the kinetics of upregulation of these molecules on activated T cells. Because antigen-experienced CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> T cells continue to exhibit this phenotype after activation, measuring the total number of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> T cells provided insight into how the overall magnitude of the T cell response evolves in the DCLNs and ILNs over the course of infection. For the ligation studies, however, we were interested in identifying changes in activation that occurred in a short window of time (in the three week interval of ligation), and measuring CD69 proved to be a more sensitive read-out for this because CD69 is upregulated only on the most recently activated T cells (Simms and Ellis 1996). The reason for examining proliferation and cytokine expression was to understand how restriction of meningeal lymphatic outflow affected not just markers of T cell activation but also functional read-outs of T cell activation and T cell effector capacity. As suggested, we included the total number of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the DCLNs after ligation (Figure 4 Supp 1a-b).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. It's convincing that there is a defect in T cell activation in the dCLN upon ligation (Ki67, IFNγ, TNFa which by the way should be in the same figure).

Following ligation, we did not observe differences in the activation status of T cells in the brain, and we have included these data in Figure 5 Supp 1. We also examined markers of T cell exhaustion (PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3) and report decreased expression of these molecules in the DCLNs (Figure 4 Supp 2) and no differences in expression of these molecules in the brain (Figure 5 Supp 2) following ligation.

What's the exact working hypothesis? Some thoughts: The parasite finds its way to the brain despite the presence of a functional T cell response.

Could the ligation during the infection phase have interfered with the seeding of the brain by itself and &quot;dilute&quot; the effect on parasite load by interfering with T cell responses in the DCLNs? Is it not also possible that reducing Ag drainage would result in a reactivation of the parasite? Can that happen at a later time point? Could the authors block Ag drainage during the chronic phase and look for T cell responses and parasite load at later time points? (e.g. ligation at 6-8 weeks and readout 3 and 6 weeks later?).

We demonstrated that ligation effectively blocks CSF outflow to the DCLNs for three weeks (Figure 3 Supp 1a-b). With this interval in mind, we decided to perform ligation at three weeks post-infection when T cells begin to display a response against the parasite in the DCLNs (Figure 2), a point we have made more clear in the text. We do not believe that ligation would have a major impact on parasite seeding of the brain because parasite burden in the blood peaks between 7-10 dpi and parasite has been cleared from peripheral tissues by 3 wpi (Saeij, Boyle et al. 2005, Djurkovic-Djakovic, Djokic et al. 2012). To assess whether ligation affected control of tachyzoites or bradyzoites differentially, we measured total parasite gDNA by real-time PCR (Figure 5f) and cyst count by microscopy (Figure 5 Supp 1e).

Other groups have shown that the superficial cervical lymph nodes (SCLNs) also drain components of the CSF (Ma, Ineichen et al. 2017). As suggested, we tested whether ligation of the lymphatic vessels afferent to the DCLNs affects drainage of CSF-derived antigen to the SCLNs or T cell responses in these nodes. Indeed, we observed no change in outflow (Figure 3 Supp 1c) and no change in CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation (Figure 4 Supp 1g-l). Because the SCLNs represent another outflow site, we also tested whether blocking drainage to both the DCLNs and SCLNs would have an impact on the T cell response in the brain (Figure 5 Supp 4). However, there was no difference in CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell number in the brain (Figure 5 Supp 4c-d), providing additional support to the conclusion that meningeal lymphatic drainage is dispensable for T cell responses in the brain, and that T cell responses at peripheral sites are likely playing an important role in sustaining T cell responses in the brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The discussion seems a bit long and could be a bit more focussed (e.g. remove glymphatic flow part?)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have removed the discussion of glymphatic flow to be more focused.</p><p>References</p><p>Blum, K.
