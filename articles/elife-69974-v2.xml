identical cells is a pervasive feature of signaling networks and has been suggested to allow organisms to hedge their ‘bets’ in uncertain conditions. In the galactose-utilization (GAL) pathway of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, gene induction is unimodal or bimodal depending on natural genetic variation and pre-induction conditions. Here, we find that this variation in modality arises from regulation of two features of the pathway response: the fraction of cells that show induction and their level of expression. GAL3, the galactose sensor, controls the fraction of induced cells, and titrating its expression is sufficient to control modality; moreover, all the observed differences in modality between different pre-induction conditions and among natural isolates can be explained by changes in GAL3’s regulation and activity. The ability to switch modality by tuning the activity of a single protein may allow rapid adaptation of bet hedging to maximize fitness in complex environments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phenotypic variation</kwd><kwd>nutrient signaling</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1349248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jue</given-names></name><name><surname>Springer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM120122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palme</surname><given-names>Julius</given-names></name><name><surname>Springer</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE1144152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yeast cells can tune the modality of a nutrient response on physiological and evolutionary timescales by adapting the expression and sequence of a sensor protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-genetic heterogeneity is a pervasive feature of gene expression and cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kærn et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balázsi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>). Bimodal responses, where cells in an isogenic population adopt one of two distinct states, are particularly important for microbes coping with fluctuating environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grimbergen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Veening et al., 2008</xref>) and cells of multicellular organisms differentiating into discrete types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xiong and Ferrell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">MacArthur et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The galactose-utilization (GAL) pathway in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is a well-characterized bimodal response and a classic model of microbial decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnston, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat, 2008</xref>). Bimodality of GAL gene expression has been attributed to bistability arising from positive feedback through the Gal1p kinase and the Gal3p transducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Venturelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2005</xref>). Perturbations of many of the components of the GAL pathway such as the Gal2p permease, the Gal4p activator, and the Gal80p repressor have been found to affect quantitative features of the GAL response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hawkins and Smolke, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>) and in principle could modify the feedback in the system and thus affect whether the response is bimodal or unimodal. However, only changes in Gal1p and Gal3p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Venturelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acar et al., 2005</xref> have been shown to affect modality.</p><p>Our existing insight into modality in the GAL system comes almost entirely from measuring one pathway phenotype, the induced fraction, under one environmental perturbation, galactose titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Venturelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Venturelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). The few studies that have deviated from this experimental approach have resulted in observations that raise new questions. For example, the GAL response was found to be unimodal or bimodal depending on the carbon source prior to encountering galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biggar and Crabtree, 2001</xref>); the molecular basis of this behavior is unknown. In our own previous work that focused on differences in GAL genes induction in mixtures of glucose and galactose between natural isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), we noted that some strains showed a bimodal response while others had a unimodal response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). These differences provide an opportunity to dissect the genetic basis underlying the differences in modality.</p><p>In this work, we confirm and expand the observation that the pattern of GAL pathway induction can be either unimodal or bimodal depending on genetic background and pre-induction conditions. A phenomenological model of GAL induction led us to a conceptual framework for variation in modality that identified the relative thresholds of induced fraction and expression level regulation as the two critical factors. Using this simple framework, we can explain the variation in modality we observed and predict how new perturbations would affect modality. Finally, we show that both natural variation and pre-induction conditions achieve changes in modality by tuning the expression and activity of a single signaling protein in the GAL pathway. These results reveal a simple evolutionary mechanism by which organisms can shape their responses to the environment, and suggest that modality is a highly adaptable feature of a signaling response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic and environmental factors affect the modality of the GAL response</title><p>To study what causes the GAL response to be unimodal in some strain backgrounds and bimodal in other strain backgrounds, we measured the expression of a <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter driving YFP (GAL1pr-YFP) in 30 geographically and ecologically diverse yeast strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cromie et al., 2013</xref>) grown in different combinations of glucose and galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Both unimodal and bimodal population distributions were stable even when cells were kept in the same environment for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the difference in modality is a steady-state phenomenon. In addition, we studied what causes the modality of the GAL response to change based on growth history. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biggar and Crabtree, 2001</xref>, previously showed that populations of the laboratory strain S288C had a unimodal GAL induction when grown with raffinose as a carbon source prior to encountering mixtures of glucose and galactose, but a bimodal response when mannose was used as the initial carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast to our results when titrating galactose in the presence of glucose, all 30 of our natural isolates showed bimodal responses when we titrated the galactose concentration in the absence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). These observations suggest that glucose plays a critical role as a second input to the bistable GAL pathway that can cause a qualitative change in the modality of GAL pathway induction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic and environmental factors change galactose-utilization (GAL) modality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental workflow.

In the presence of galactose, Gal3p binds Gal80p, releasing Gal4p from the Gal80p-Gal4p complex, and allowing Gal4p to drive the transcription of a number of GAL genes. The initiation of transcription of the galactose sensors Gal1p and Gal3p by Gal4p creates a positive feedback loop, and this is believed to be the mechanism underlying the bistability of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Venturelli et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While glucose can completely inhibit the GAL response, its role in determining the modality of the response has been poorly explored. Glucose has two inhibitory effects on the GAL pathway. (1) It indirectly decreases the intracellular concentration of galactose through competition for binding to transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Escalante-Chong et al., 2015</xref>). This in turn decreases the amount of active Gal3p and thereby affects the fraction of cells that induce the GAL pathway (induced fraction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ricci-Tam et al., 2021</xref>). (2) It directly increases the activity of the transcriptional repressor Mig1p which regulates <italic>GAL4</italic> expression and thereby decreases the expression of GAL genes (induction level) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ricci-Tam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Because the system is bimodal in pure galactose, glucose cannot drive unimodality solely through the transporter-dependent indirect effect, leading us to suspect that the Mig1p-dependent mechanism is responsible.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phenomenological modeling of galactose-utilization (GAL) induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic description of the GAL pathway with indirect or direct inhibition by glucose.

Based on our measurements of the pathway response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ricci-Tam et al., 2021</xref>), we mathematically described the indirect and direct effects of glucose as Hill functions that decrease with increasing glucose concentration, with the final induction profiles being a simple product of these composite functions. To simulate a range of population induction profiles, we generated population distributions for the induced fraction and induced level from a normal distribution whose standard deviation is derived from GAL gene expression measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; Materials and methods). We then varied the glucose threshold for the induced level while keeping the glucose threshold for the induced fraction constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) or the glucose threshold for the induced fraction while keeping the glucose threshold for the expression level constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Indeed, changing either can switch the population behavior between unimodal and bimodal. In both cases, the pathway is bimodal when the glucose inhibition threshold for the induction level is less than the glucose inhibition threshold for the induced fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differences in induction and expression level regulation predict the modality of natural isolates</title><p>To analyze whether natural genetic variation could change modality by altering the induced fraction or induction level, we analyzed these features in our 30 natural yeast isolates. First, we determined the induced and uninduced subpopulations by comparing GAL reporter distributions to the distribution of an uninduced sample (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Peng et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). From these two subpopulations, we then calculated two summary metrics for each strain’s behavior: E<sub>10</sub> (‘expression level threshold’), the glucose concentration where the GAL1 expression level of the induced subpopulation reaches 10% of its level in pure galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and F<sub>90</sub> (‘induced fraction threshold’), the glucose concentration where 90% of cells are in the induced subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Our modeling suggests that determining the E<sub>10</sub> and F<sub>90</sub> should be sufficient to predict whether the induction behavior is bimodal or unimodal. To test this hypothesis, we used the measured E<sub>10</sub> and F<sub>90</sub> as inputs into phenomenological model and computed modality. Overall, for both bimodal and unimodal strains, the experiments and models are in good agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). One minor discrepancy is that metrics from unimodal strains often predict a narrow range of bimodality in our model. We believe there are two factors that might explain the difference between the experimental data and the model predictions. First, to measure the F<sub>90</sub>, there must be measurable gene induction. Therefore, the calculated F<sub>90</sub> is a lower bound for the actual value of F<sub>90</sub> in unimodal strains; in many cases, the calculated F<sub>90</sub> will be higher than the actual F<sub>90</sub>. If the calculated F<sub>90</sub> for simulations of unimodal strains is increased by even a factor of 2, the discrepancy between the behaviors disappears (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Second, the slopes of the induced fraction curves could also be subject to variation and this could affect modality. Increasing the steepness of the induced fraction curve or induced level curves by increasing the Hill coefficients in our models can make simulations more unimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Indeed, some natural isolates appear to have steeper induction curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).

The modality of the natural isolates agrees well with their predicted modality in the phase diagram, supporting our hypothesis that the E<sub>10</sub> and F<sub>90</sub> measurements capture the important biological features that determine the modality of a strain.</p><p>Our phenomenological model gives us a potential molecular explanation for unimodality: Mig1p activity leads to unimodality by inhibiting <italic>GAL4</italic> expression in the regime where Gal3p activation is still strongly dependent on glucose and galactose. Therefore, a strong prediction of the model is that removing Mig1p regulation should restore bimodality in unimodal strains. To test this prediction, we analyzed the induction profile of a <italic>mig1</italic>Δ strain. Deleting <italic>MIG1</italic> removes the glucose dependent regulation of <italic>GAL4</italic> expression level and thus the E<sub>10</sub> of the deletion strain is increased compared to the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). As predicted, deleting <italic>MIG1</italic> converts the strain from unimodal to bimodal. In addition, the observed F<sub>90</sub> value for the bimodal <italic>mig1</italic>Δ strain is higher than that for the unimodal wild type. This supports our hypothesis that Mig1p-dependent repression conceals the actual F<sub>90</sub> value of unimodal strains and that the observed F<sub>90</sub> value of unimodal strains is a lower bound for the actual F<sub>90</sub> value.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differences in induction regulation explain the history dependence in modality</title><p>It has previously been reported that pre-induction growth conditions can affect the modality of GAL induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biggar and Crabtree, 2001</xref>). This offers another opportunity to test the predictions from our modeling framework. To see how metabolic history affects F<sub>90</sub> and E<sub>10</sub>, we grew 13 natural isolate strains in mannose, raffinose, acetate, or glycerol prior to transferring them into mixtures of glucose and galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). A range of different behaviors were observed, which could be broken into two categories of responses. The first category is strains that are unimodal in some pre-induction conditions but bimodal in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). The second category is strains that do not change modality based on the tested pre-induction conditions; the strains are always bimodal or always unimodal in all pre-induction carbon sources tested here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

We therefore analyzed the regulation of <italic>GAL3</italic> by a range of pre-induction carbon sources in nine natural isolates using a transcriptional reporter for the <italic>GAL3</italic><sup>S288C</sup> promoter. We found that in each strain the <italic>GAL3</italic> expression level in a pre-induction conditions generally correlates with the modality observed later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>To test if <italic>GAL3</italic> expression prior to induction is the key determinant of modality, we used a tetracycline-inducible promoter to control the expression of <italic>GAL3</italic> directly. We predicted that forcing a change in <italic>GAL3</italic> expression while keeping the pre-induction carbon the same should change modality. Conversely, changing the pre-induction carbon without changing <italic>GAL3</italic> expression should not change modality.</p><p>Indeed, we found that the pre-induction level of Gal3p, not the pre-induction carbon, is critical for setting modality. For the laboratory strain S288C, pre-induction growth in mannose leads to low <italic>GAL3</italic> expression and a bimodal induction profile, while pre-induction growth in raffinose leads to higher <italic>GAL3</italic> expression and a unimodal induction profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). When we overexpressed <italic>GAL3</italic> during pre-induction growth in mannose using tetracycline induction, we saw an increase in the induced fraction and a loss of bimodality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, the <italic>GAL3</italic> concentration pre-induction is sufficient to set the modality in this strain background. Similarly, artificially setting the <italic>GAL3</italic> level of mannose pre-induction cultures to that of a raffinose pre-induction culture converted the induction profiles to one similar to a raffinose pre-induction culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,II</xref> and IV). In addition to showing unimodal induction after raffinose pre-induction, this strain also shows unimodal behavior after pre-induction in acetate or glycerol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, we titrated <italic>GAL3</italic> in a strain where the endogenous <italic>GAL3</italic> gene was deleted to allow for constant <italic>GAL3</italic> expression below the wild-type level. As predicted, when pre-induction <italic>GAL3</italic> expression in these sugars was low, we saw bimodal induction almost identical to that seen with mannose pre-induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Pre-induction <italic>GAL3</italic> concentrations also set the induced fraction with almost no dependence on the pre-induction carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We conclude that regulation of <italic>GAL3</italic> expression in pre-induction conditions is the major driver of history dependence in the modality of GAL induction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Natural variation in <italic>GAL3</italic> alleles underlies the genetic changes in modality</title><p>The central role of <italic>GAL3</italic> expression in setting the modality of induction suggests that natural variation in <italic>GAL3</italic> alleles could be responsible for the observed differences in modality between isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Previously, we showed that polymorphisms in the <italic>GAL3</italic> gene explain most of the natural variation in the decision to induce the GAL pathway (i.e. the F<sub>90</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that allele swaps of the <italic>GAL3</italic> ORF should alter the F<sub>90</sub> of the strain, which in some cases would be enough to switch the modality of induction. To test this prediction, we determined the modality of a set of 30 allele swap strains comprised of 10 <italic>GAL3</italic> alleles in three genetic backgrounds. The experimentally determined modality of all allele swap strains agrees with the expected modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, replacing the <italic>GAL3</italic> allele of two unimodal strains, BC187 and S288C, with the <italic>GAL3</italic> allele of any of the bimodal strains is sufficient to change the induction profiles from unimodal to bimodal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). In agreement with our model, the F<sub>90</sub> in these strains decreases sufficiently to convert strains from unimodal to bimodal. Replacing the <italic>GAL3</italic> gene of the bimodal strain YJM978 with the alleles of unimodal strains does not change the modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This is also in agreement with the model which predicts that the magnitude of the increase in F<sub>90</sub> caused by allele swaps in the YJM978 strain background is insufficient to change modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The mechanisms by which promoter and CDS changes are able to change the modality will be the subject of future work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In mixtures of glucose and galactose, the response of the GAL pathway in a population of yeast cells can be either unimodal or bimodal depending on their evolutionary history and their current environmental conditions. Here, we show that the modality of GAL induction in different strains depends on the relationship between the glucose effects on the induced fraction and the expression level. Glucose inhibits the expression of GAL genes, preventing the positive feedback that is crucial for bistability. In general, any input to a pathway that can conditionally create or eliminate feedback has the potential to modulate bistability. Since many signaling responses are controlled by multiple inputs, our findings imply that other unimodal responses could be bimodal in different conditions and vice versa.</p><p>Bimodality in the GAL response is considered a bet-hedging strategy where a fraction of the population prepares for glucose depletion by inducing the GAL pathway while other cells maximize their current growth and do not induce the pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Venturelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). This heterogeneity helps populations deal with uncertain, fluctuating environments. Bet-hedging is advantageous in the GAL system when the switching rate between glucose and galactose environments is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acar et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, cells evolve bimodality in MAL gene expression when they are continuously switched between glucose and maltose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">New et al., 2014</xref>). Because cells can sometimes be in environments with a high switching rate and other times in environments with a low switching rate, a strategy that allows the extent of bet-hedging to be tuned could be optimal. In this work, we show strains can tune the amount of bimodality both physiologically, based on their metabolic history, and genetically, presumably based on the environmental statistics that different natural isolates have faced in their evolutionary history. Further work will be needed to determine the evolutionary consequences of tunable bimodal responses such as the ones we characterize here.</p><p>Previous work on cell-to-cell heterogeneity has typically emphasized the complex genetic architecture of the pathways involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ansel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, the physiological and genetic variation in modality in the GAL pathway can be explained by changes in the behavior of a single gene. Swapping the <italic>GAL3</italic> alleles of natural isolates can turn a unimodal strain into a bimodal strain. We show that the environment tunes the expression level of <italic>GAL3</italic>, and this tuning is sufficient to change the modality of GAL induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Circuit designs such as these, where a single gene controls modality, may have been selected in evolution, since they allow cells to easily adapt their behavior on both physiological and evolutionary timescales.</p><p>The control of GAL pathway modality by mannose, raffinose, glycerol, and acetate suggests an additional layer of metabolic regulation that has been largely missed in previous analyses of this pathway. These findings show that factors other than canonical glucose catabolite repression can be important in determining the inducibility of GAL genes, consistent with our findings that many mutants outside the GAL pathway can have a significant effect on GAL response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hua and Springer, 2018</xref>). The fact that pre-induction carbon sources mostly affect F<sub>90</sub>, just as <italic>GAL3</italic> allele swaps do, suggests that the <italic>GAL3</italic> positive feedback loop may be a nexus of regulation of GAL genes by multiple signals in the cell. In future studies, understanding the metabolic regulation of this well-studied system could give insight into the connections between metabolism and metabolic signaling in a variety of systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>Strains were obtained as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang et al., 2015</xref>. An initial set of 36 strains were assayed in a glucose gradient (1–0.0039%) with a constant background of 0.25% galactose. Strains DBVPG6765, CLIB324, L-1528, M22, W303, YIIC17-E5 were excluded from downstream analysis due to poor growth in our media conditions. Strain 378604X was also excluded due to a high basal expression phenotype that was an outlier in our collection. The genetic basis of this behavior is likely an interesting topic for follow-up studies. All experiments were performed in synthetic minimal medium (‘S’), which contains 1.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base (YNB) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and 5 g/L ammonium sulfate (EMD). In addition, D-glucose (EMD, Darmstadt, Germany), D-galactose (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, MO), mannose (MilliporeSigma), glycerol (EMD), acetate (MilliporeSigma), and/or raffinose (MilliporeSigma) were added as a carbon source.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Variation in the modality of a yeast signaling pathway is mediated by a single regulator&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Here is the consensus review:</p><p>This paper continues the lab's study of GAL1 induction in natural and laboratory strains of budding yeast. As previously shown, whether the induction is bimodal or unimodal depends upon the strain and the pre-induction carbon source. As the authors acknowledge in the Discussion section, we don't yet know the physiological significance of the phenomenon – i.e., is a unimodal response better under some environmental conditions and a bimodal response better under others – but still, working out how it arises is a nice test of our understanding of the system.</p><p>Here they present more data on the effects of strain background and pre-induction carbon source on the uni/bimodal nature of the response. They also present an ODE model of bistability and a much simpler phenomenological model that can account for many of the responses. This simpler model is based on Hill function (monostable) response curves with different thresholds for induced fraction and expression level of pathway output. And finally, they do gene swap experiments that argue that the uni vs. bimodal nature of a strain's response is largely determined by the sequence of the Gal3 gene.</p><p>This work could well be an interesting exercise in quantitative biology, but the reviewers found it so hard to understand what the authors were saying and showing that we are not really sure. For example, is the GAL system bistable (which is how the ODE model behaves) or not (as the phenomenological model assumes)? The reviewers were left confused about what the authors are concluding about the mechanism underpinning the phenomena they are describing.</p><p>We aim to publish work if revisions can be carried out in a couple of months. While required changes to the current work are too extensive to invite revision, we would likely be interested in a better-analyzed and better-presented take on this subject. It would be treated as a new submission, but we would try to recruit the same reviewers for evaluation.</p><p>Here are some specific aspects of the paper we had trouble with.</p><p>Data interpretation:</p><p>1. One of the core findings is that while all isolates are bimodal when galactose is titrated (in a background of raffinose), some are unimodal when glucose is titrated (in a background of an intermediate galactose (0.25%) + raffinose). One thing they did not mention, but can be seen comparing Figure S1 and Figure S2 is that some strains become more bimodal (in the sense that there is wide range of Glu/Gal mixtures in which two populations can clearly be detected). See for example the WashU strains or YJM981. (Does the ODE model also reproduce this?).</p><p>In general, this raises the question as to what is really going on. In my opinion, there might be a sort of misinterpretation of the data. Most strains seem to me to stay bimodal (comparing Figure S1 with S2), even if the statistical analysis they perform says otherwise. Let's take the case of the lab strain S288C as an example. The authors find that it is unimodal in Glu/Gal: however, what I see is that a group of uninduced cells persists as one moves from right to left (Figure S2), at the same time that the induced group starts to be induced in a graded fashion (again from right to left). So, in my view, that is a bimodal behavior: one mode corresponds to the group of uninduced yeast, and the other mode to the group of inducible cells, whose induction (or repression by glucose) is graded. The same behavior may be observed in other strains. My conclusion, comparing the galactose titration vs the glucose titration, is that the change in modality is (at least in most cases, maybe in all) apparent, not real; there is a change from a switch-like response to gradual induction (or repression) for those yeast that get induced, all in the context of a bimodal behavior. Thus, glucose is affecting only the inducible group.</p><p>In summary: the dose response to galactose (Figure S1) is switch-like (and bimodal), and the dose-response to glucose (Figure S2) (in a background of galactose) is graded (and bimodal).</p><p>If my interpretation is correct, the data in all the manuscript might need an overall change in interpretation.</p><p>Controls:</p><p>2. The Gal3 swap experiments are arguably the most interesting part of the paper (although, curiously, they are not mentioned in the abstract). And Gal3 was chosen for the swap for a good reason. However, it is quite possible that the other major regulators also affect strain behavior, and they could well be correlated with the allelic form of Gal3. As the authors know, previous work showed that simultaneous removal of the Gal3 and Gal1 positive feedbacks was required to truly eliminate bimodality. I wonder then what is the role of Gal1 and also Gal4 in strain to strain differences, since all these molecules have co-evolved in these strains. Thus, I think it would be important to show (a), considering that Gal1 serves a role very similar to Gal3, that Gal1 alleles are not important factors; (b) the result of a swap experiment using the Gal4 alleles, at least for a few interesting strains. Combining a joint swap of Gal3 and Gal4 and comparing with just Gal3 (already done with just Gal4). It would be important to see if the effect is reversed, or enhanced.</p><p>3. The authors need to present more than 'representative examples of at least two independent repeats'. Some assessment of experiment-to-experiment variability needs to be included.</p><p>The ODE model:</p><p>4. The ODE model needs to be written out. There is a parameter table, but without knowing what the rate equations are, the parameters are of little use. And as it is a reader can't really see what assumptions go into the model (e.g. Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which assume that the substrate is in huge excess over the enzyme?).</p><p>5. If I understand the ODE model correctly, it is a single-cell model; the authors are not trying to account for the cell-to-cell variability that makes the population level responses (sometimes) be bimodal. Why is this consideration included in the phenomenological model but not in the ODE model?</p><p>6. Finally, what is being measured is GAL1pr-YFP expression. What is being modeled in Figure 2 is various aspects of Gal4p and Gal3p. This is confusing.</p><p>The phenomenological model:</p><p>7. As mentioned above, this simpler model is based on Hill function (monostable) response curves (not bistable response curves, although I'm not sure how many readers will understand that the way this is written) with different thresholds for induced fraction and expression level of pathway output. And it accounts for much of the observed behavior. What does this mean? Is the point that the system is not bistable after all; or that the system may be bistable but you don't need bistability to account for the observed phenomena; or something else?</p><p>Clarity:</p><p>8. The authors need a more detailed cartoon than that shown in Figure 2A to give the uninitiated an idea of how the system works, and the scheme should include GAL1. The scheme also needs to be explained better.</p><p>9. If the authors are going to use the same figure panel more than once (e.g. Figure 7EF), the repetitions must be explicitly acknowledged.</p><p>10. Are the panels in Figure 6B flipped?</p><p>11. Throughout: Is it possible that 8 hours is too little to actually reach steady state after switching from pre-induced conditions? Could that explain the differences in strains? Maybe longer waiting needs to be tested.</p><p>12. Why are the GAL1pr-YFP fluorescence measurements normalized by dividing by SSC (a measure of cell texture) rather than FSC (a measure of cell size)?</p><p>13. Figure 2: Both Figure 2C and 2D are glucose titrations with constant galactose, so the labeling is confusing.</p><p>14. Line 171: '…determine whether a strain is bimodal' – bimodality is shown in many figures to depend on the pre-incubation conditions, not just the strain's identity. So what is meant by 'a strain is bimodal' – bimodal some of the time, all of the time, under some specific conditions compared across strains?</p><p>15. p. 9: The authors need to better explain why the fraction of active Gal3p should determine the fraction of cells in the induced state, whereas the amount of free Gal4p determines level of GAL1 induction in the induced cells. The logic is not apparent from Figure 2A. On p. 11 the authors do mention that they &quot;previously showed that induced fraction and expression level are regulated by galactose/glucose ratio or the glucose concentration, respectively&quot;, but if &quot;Pathway activation&quot; is determined by Gal4p (Figure 2A) it is not clear how Gal3p and Gal4p could be determining different aspects of the response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69974.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We have made substantial changes to the manuscript in order to improve clarity. We will address how bistability in the GAL pathway relates to the phenomenological model in our response to point 7.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers’ conclusion was that the manuscript could be ‘an interesting exercise in quantitative biology’, but the reviewers found it ‘hard to understand what the authors were saying and showing’. We believe that most of the confusion stems from our use in the original manuscript of two different types of models (mechanistic and phenomenological), and a lack of clarity in our explanation of how they relate to each other. Since we believe that the phenomenological model can capture the crucial features of variation in modality on its own, in the revised manuscript we have decided to remove the mechanistic model entirely. Instead, we significantly expanded and improved our explanation of the phenomenological model. We want to emphasize that the phenomenological model is on a solid mechanistic footing even in the absence of a formal ODE model, as we have described the mechanisms by which the features of the phenomenological model are regulated in another manuscript (see lines 87-95 in the manuscript and our response to point 15 for a description of these findings). We believe that these changes significantly improve the clarity of the modeling section while still providing a description of the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>In addition, the reviewers pointed out several additional control experiments such as additional allele swaps and extended incubation periods. We have included all the experiments in the revised manuscript and found that the results do not change the conclusions of the paper. Overall, we believe that the revised manuscript is a substantial improvement over the initial submission and hope that you find this revised version suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.

We would argue that the population distribution of responses of the following strains in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is clearly unimodal regardless of criteria: Bb32, BC187, CLIB215, FL100, I14, NC-02, T7, YJM653, YPS163, YPS606, and YPS1009. There are additional strains that are highly likely to be unimodal but there is some ambiguity caused by dead/dying cells (cells that don’t induce regardless of carbon ratio): IL-01 and YPS128.</p><p>The crux of the comment is about when to call a population distribution of response unimodal or bimodal. From a mathematical standpoint, the distinction between monostable and bistable is unambiguous. But here we are discussing unimodal and bimodal curves in the presence of experimental noise. While these results can hint at underlying stability they do not strictly correlate and hence there is no strict criteria by which to call something unimodal or bimodal. For example, if one in a billion cells behaved differently, the system is technically bimodal but the physiological relevance is unclear, the cell might not be detected, and the rare cell could even be an artifact. Because of this we are forced to pick metrics (cut-offs) which capture and stratify the range of behaviors. The reviewer’s comment highlighted one of the most ambiguous induction behaviors, S288C after pre-induction growth in raffinose, which we agree is on the borderline of a unimodal versus bimodal call. For the analysis in this manuscript, we decided that an appreciable fraction of the population (15%) must be in the smaller subpopulation (in any condition) for a population distribution to be called bimodal. To address the concerns presented here, we tested a range of cut-offs and our results were largely unaffected (Figure 3—figure supplement 8). S288C is in the minority of strains that can be affected by reasonable changes in metrics; switching the modality call for this strain does not significantly affect the results of this manuscript.</p><p>To improve clarity, we have included histograms of intermediate GAL induction in unimodal vs bimodal induction profiles in Figure 1B. Further, we included histograms of all analyzed conditions for the glucose titrations from Figure 1 in a new panel in Figure 1—figure supplement 4. These plots clearly show that some induction profiles never display bimodal GAL induction. We hope that the new plots better illustrate the difference between bimodal and unimodal behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Controls:</p><p>2.

In Figures 1—figure supplement 5, 4—figure supplement 3 and 6—figure supplement 4, we plot the induced fraction and induced mean of replicate measurements as a function of the glucose concentration.
