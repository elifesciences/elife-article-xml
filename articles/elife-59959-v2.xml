have revealed that synonymous, non-synonymous and intronic mutations frequently alter the inclusion levels of alternatively spliced exons, consistent with the concept that altered splicing might be a common mechanism by which mutations cause disease. However, most exons expressed in any cell are highly-included in mature mRNAs. Here, by performing deep mutagenesis of highly-included exons and by analysing the association between genome sequence variation and exon inclusion across the transcriptome, we report that mutations only very rarely alter the inclusion of highly-included exons. This is true for both exonic and intronic mutations as well as for perturbations in trans. Therefore, mutations that affect splicing are not evenly distributed across primary transcripts but are focussed in and around alternatively spliced exons with intermediate inclusion levels. These results provide a resource for prioritising synonymous and other variants as disease-causing mutations.</p></abstract><kwd-group

expression in which introns are removed from primary transcripts and exons are joined together to form mature mRNAs that are subsequently exported to the cytoplasm for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braunschweig et al., 2013</xref>). To carry out the splicing reaction, exon-intron boundaries in the pre-mRNA must be correctly identified. These boundaries consist of highly-conserved splice site sequences including intronic and exonic nucleotides. Apart from the splice sites, pre-mRNAs contain exonic and intronic sequences that interact with different splicing factors to regulate how often each exon is included in the final transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang and Burge, 2008</xref>). If this process is not properly defined, transcripts encoding altered amino acid sequences or premature stop codons can be produced. Depending on the location of the premature stop codon, this results in destruction of the mRNA by nonsense- mediated mRNA decay or production of a truncated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindeboom et al., 2019</xref>). mRNA degradation, truncated protein expression, abnormal protein sequences and altered isoform ratios can all disrupt cellular functions and cause disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anna and Monika, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scotti and Swanson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sterne-Weiler and Sanford, 2014</xref>). Alterations in splicing contribute to diseases ranging from autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agrebi et al., 2017</xref>) to neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonnal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rahman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rhine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Supek et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, in one analysis a third of disease-causing mutations were predicted to result in aberrant splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2011</xref>) and in another 10% of 4964 disease-causing missense mutations altered the inclusion of cassette exons when tested in an episomal mini-gene construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Soemedi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate how often random mutations alter the inclusion of exons, several groups have recently subjected exons in mini-gene constructs to deep mutational scanning (DMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinney and McCandlish, 2019</xref>). In these DMS experiments, the effects of hundreds or thousands of mutations in or around an exon are quantified in parallel by selection and sequencing. Exons subjected to DMS include <italic>FAS</italic> exon 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Julien et al., 2016</xref>), whose inclusion is altered in autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Mustapha et al., 2018</xref>); <italic>RON</italic> exon 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2018</xref>), whose skipping can promote oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collesi et al., 1996</xref>); and <italic>WT1</italic> exon 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ke et al., 2018</xref>), whose inclusion in leukemic cells confers resistance to chemotherapy drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2007</xref>). These studies revealed that 60–70% of all single-nucleotide substitutions and mutations in over 90% of exon positions alter exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Julien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ke et al., 2018</xref>). One study where the flanking introns were also mutagenized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2018</xref>) further revealed that mutations in ~80% of intronic positions flanking <italic>RON</italic> exon 11 also affect its inclusion.</p><p>However, these DMS experiments were performed on exons with intermediate or low inclusion levels: in the assayed conditions, wild-type (WT) <italic>FAS</italic> exon six had a percent spliced in (PSI, the percentage of mature transcripts that include the exon) of ~50%, <italic>RON</italic> exon 11 had a PSI of ~60%, and the different versions of <italic>WT1</italic> exon five had PSI values ranging between ~0 and~70%. In contrast, in any given human tissue, most of the expressed exons are highly-included, for example ~60% of exons with a PSI &gt; 10% actually have a PSI &gt; 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notice that although a large fraction of exons in the human genome are included at very low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), these often correspond to pseudoexons or exons that are not usually expressed and may therefore be less physiologically relevant compared to other exons.</p><p>An alternative approach to random mutagenesis is to introduce a small number of mutations into an exon but in all possible combinations. For example, we recently quantified the effects on inclusion of all 3072 possible combinations of the 12 substitutions that accumulated in <italic>FAS</italic> exon six during its evolution from a constitutive exon in the last common ancestor of primates to an alternatively spliced exon in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Centurion et al., 2019</xref>). This allowed us to quantify how the effect of each of these 12 mutations changes when it is made in different closely-related versions of exon six and revealed that the effects of mutations on exon inclusion ‘scale’ non-monotonically as the inclusion of an exon is increased. Specifically, as the PSI of an exon increases from 0 to 100%, the effect of a mutation increases to a maximum and then decreases again (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consistent with an underlying sigmoidal relationship between an additive trait affected by mutations and the inclusion level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Centurion et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Scaling of mutation effects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mutation-induced changes in exon inclusion (ΔPSI) depend on the initial inclusion levels (starting PSI or PSI<sub>s</sub>), but the underlying additive effect (A, which can also be interpreted as the change in splicing efficiency) of a mutation is independent of the starting PSI. The relationship between ΔPSI and A is given by precise mathematical equations and if the additive effect A of a mutation is known, its ΔPSI at any starting PSI can be calculated. (<bold>B</bold>) Previous deep mutagenesis experiments in three alternative exons. The <italic>FAS</italic> exon six experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Julien et al., 2016</xref>) involved systematically mutating all positions in the cassette exon. The <italic>RON</italic> exon 11 experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2018</xref>) involved the mutagenesis of the entire minigene. The <italic>WT1</italic> exon five experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ke et al., 2018</xref>) involved systematic mutagenesis of exonic positions except for splice sites. (<bold>C</bold>) The ΔPSI distributions generated by mutations in the experiments described in B can be converted to distributions of the underlying additive effects (using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> shown in A). These distributions can be used to predict the distribution of ΔPSI values at any starting inclusion levels (using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> shown in A), allowing us to scale a distribution of ΔPSI mutation effects for any starting PSI.

Here we first test this prediction by performing mutational scans of two exons with high inclusion levels. We find that, consistent with the scaling of mutational effects, mutations rarely substantially alter the inclusion of these exons. Analyses of additional mutagenesis datasets and human genetic variation strongly support this conclusion and show that exonic and intronic mutations – except those affecting the splice sites themselves – only rarely alter the splicing of exons with high PSI values. Mutations that alter exon inclusion are therefore very non-uniformly distributed across the human transcriptome and are focussed in and around alternative exons with intermediate inclusion levels. This provides an important framework for prioritising synonymous and other variants as candidate disease-causing mutations and for predicting from sequence when a change in splicing is – or is not – likely to be the causal molecular mechanism linking a genetic variant to a human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutational scaling predicts very few mutations will alter the splicing of highly-included exons</title><p>Our previous work indicated that the effects of mutations on exon inclusion can be small if the mutated exon is included at very high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Centurion et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, the relationship between the effect of a mutation on splicing (that depends on the initial exon inclusion levels) and its biophysical effect (which is not dependent on the starting levels of inclusion) is given by an equation (derived in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Centurion et al., 2019</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>100</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where A is a parameter describing the change in splicing efficiency introduced by a mutation (its biophysical effect, equivalent -for example- to the loss or gain of binding affinity of one or more splicing regulatory factors), ΔPSI is the change in exon inclusion level caused by the mutation and PSIs is the starting PSI at which the ΔPSI is observed. Multiplying some of the terms by 100 ensures that mutation effects are calculated for an exon whose inclusion level can range from 0 to 100%. Therefore, this equation allows us to predict the PSI changes induced by a mutation at any starting PSI provided we already know its parameter A.

We can then combine these distributions to obtain an estimate of the distribution of effects for all possible mutations in all exons in the human genome in each tissue. To do this, we rescaled the distribution of mutational effects from the alternative exon DMS datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) to the inclusion level of every exon in every tissue, resulting in a ΔPSI distribution for mutations in each exon (and each tissue) in the human genome.

The SRE library was built twice with different flanking introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheung et al., 2019</xref>). Since changing an intron could be considered an extreme case of intronic mutation, we compared the inclusion levels of every allele in this library between the two intron contexts.

The predicted distributions were similar to the ΔPSI distribution of common intronic alternative alleles: most mutations have little or no impact on exon inclusion and 8.7% of all proximal intronic mutations are predicted to change exon inclusion by more than 10 PSI units, compared to 7–13% of common alternative alleles across human tissues analysed by GTEx. However, focussing on intronic alternative alleles near exons whose inclusion levels range between 10 and 90% reveals that 21–31% (depending on the tissue) of common alternative alleles near these exons affect splicing by at least 10 PSI units.</p><p>Therefore, proximal intronic and exonic mutations have a similar effect on inclusion, with most proximal intronic mutations having very small or no effects on the inclusion of neighbouring exons except for the subset of exons with intermediate inclusion levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Changes in trans also have stronger effects on the inclusion of exons with intermediate inclusion levels</title><p>The inclusion levels of exons can be affected by proximal mutations in cis but also by perturbations in trans, for example mutations or changes in the expression of other genes.

However, alternative exons are sometimes included at very high levels (depending on the tissue). We therefore asked if mutations have a stronger effect on inclusion in alternative exons (exons that are sometimes but not always highly-included) than in constitutive exons (exons that are always highly-included across cell types) under conditions in which both types of exon are included at similar levels. To test this, we defined constitutive exons as those with a PSI of at least 90% in all 30 GTEx human tissues, and alternative exons as those with a PSI under 90% in at least one tissue.</p><p>Candidate skipping-promoting alleles (alternative alleles in the GTEx population associated with lower levels of exon inclusion) have stronger effects on the inclusion of alternative exons.

Right: a mutation in the ESE of a constitutive exon might disrupt the ESE, but might activate another ESE instead, compensating for the loss of the original ESE.

ESE robustness was defined as the number of ESE sequences accessible, from an existing ESE, via one nucleotide substitution. This definition allowed us to group all ESE sequences into 18 groups ranging from 1 (least robust) to 18 (most robust). For each group, we calculated the average number of ESEs per nucleotide in constitutive and alternative exons, and calculated the relative enrichment of sequences in constitutive over alternative exons by taking the ratio of these two numbers.

ESEs are exonic sequences recognized and bound by splicing factor proteins that promote exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blencowe, 2000</xref>). We downloaded a list of 1182 putative ESE hexamer sequences from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ke et al., 2011</xref> and confirmed that constitutive exons in our dataset have a higher ESE density than alternative exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Limiting our analysis to highly-included alternative exons, we find that they are still enriched among exons with the fewest ESEs (by comparing constitutive exons against alternative exons with a PSI &gt; 90% in at least one tissue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>; or by comparing constitutive exons in a given tissue against alternative exons with a PSI &gt; 90% in that same tissue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>). These results hold true even if we fine-tune our analysis to include only those exons with very strong or very weak splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">Figure 7—figure supplement 6</xref>). Therefore, one reason why mutations have smaller effects in constitutive exons may be due to enhancer redundancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similarly, exonic splicing silencers (ESSs) are enriched among alternative exons although ESSs are not found in alternative exons that are included with a PSI of 90% in at least one tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s7">Figure 7—figure supplement 7</xref>). One possibility that explains this observation is that, while alternative exons included at intermediate levels make frequent use of ESSs to modulate their levels, those with high inclusion levels in some tissues establish their ‘extreme’ phenotypes (very high inclusion/high skipping) through other mechanisms.</p><p>We next compared, across both types of exon, the density of sequences that differ from any one ESE by only one nucleotide substitution (hereafter, ‘suboptimal ESEs’ – note that suboptimal ESEs also include ESE sequences that are one substitution away from each other). Alternative exons were enriched among exons with the smallest numbers of suboptimal ESEs, and this is also true after restricting our analysis to highly-included alternative exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7—figure supplement 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s9">Figure 7—figure supplement 9</xref>). Because suboptimal ESEs are one substitution away from an ESE, a mutation is more likely to create a new ESE sequence in a constitutive exon than in an alternative exon. This suggests two additional hypotheses that could explain why, at the same initial inclusion level, mutations have stronger effects in alternative exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). First, ESEs in constitutive exons might be more robust to the effects of mutations than ESEs in alternative exons. Second, constitutive exons might contain many cryptic ESEs that could be activated by mutations that disrupt existing ESEs.</p><p>To test the first hypothesis, we split all 1182 ESE hexamers into different groups, depending on the number of suboptimal ESEs they contain (how many substitutions result in another ESE). In an ESE that is 100% robust to single-nucleotide substitutions, every possible substitution produces another ESE hexamer. Conversely, in a hexamer that is susceptible to mutations, few substitutions should result in an ESE. Robust ESEs were over-represented in constitutive exons, with the most robust hexamers being almost twice as likely to be found in constitutive as in alternative exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). This is true even after limiting our analysis to highly-included alternative exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s10">Figure 7—figure supplement 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s11">Figure 7—figure supplement 11</xref>). The least robust ESE hexamers are generally over-represented in alternative exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s10">Figure 7—figure supplement 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s11">Figure 7—figure supplement 11</xref>), and this is especially the case among exons surrounded by strong splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s12">Figure 7—figure supplement 12</xref>). However, considering only those exons surrounded by weak splice sites, the least robust ESEs are also enriched among constitutive exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s12">Figure 7—figure supplement 12</xref>), suggesting that alternative exons contain weak ESEs preferentially in combination with strong splice sites.</p><p>To test the second hypothesis, we counted how many ESEs were gained or lost in every exon after introducing a point mutation in each of its ESEs (not allowing the mutations to create another ESE that spans the same six nucleotides). Constitutive exons were not more likely than alternative exons to create new ESEs after inactivating an existing ESE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Instead, constitutive exons were slightly more likely to destroy multiple sites at once, suggesting the presence of overlapping motifs in these exons which can be simultaneously deactivated by a single point mutation. Indeed, an analysis of overlapping ESE motifs reveals that these occur slightly more commonly in constitutive than in alternative exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s13">Figure 7—figure supplement 13</xref>). However, alternative exons are not more likely than constitutive exons to create an ESS motif after inactivating an existing ESE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s14">Figure 7—figure supplement 14</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results reveal that, even at the same inclusion level, mutations have a stronger effect on the splicing of alternative exons than on the splicing of constitutive exons, and that this could be due to the higher density of ESEs in constitutive exons, as well as ESEs in constitutive exons being more robust to the effects of mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Splice site mutations do frequently alter the inclusion of highly-included exons</title><p>Exon-intron boundaries are defined by splice site sequences that are recognized by spliceosomal components before initiating the splicing reaction.

Regardless of the starting PSI, mutations in the ‘invariant’ dinucleotides had stronger effects than mutations elsewhere in an intron (100%, 53.8% and 80% of invariant dinucleotide positions in the bin with the highest- included exons in the Vex-seq, SRE and SNV multiplexed assays, respectively, had an effect greater than 10 PSI units compared with 1.8%, 11.1% and 1.4% in the rest of the intron, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C–E</xref>). Similarly, mutating the first or last exonic bases had a stronger effect than mutating any other exonic base. 36.1% (SNV dataset) of substitutions in the last position and 9.5% of substitutions in the first exonic position in the bin with the highest-included exons altered splicing by more than 10 PSI units compared with 0.5% elsewhere in the exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–G</xref>).</p><p>These results are in agreement with many previously-published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GTEx Consortium et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and are consistent with the last exonic base having a greater information content in the donor splice site motif than the first exonic base has in the acceptor splice site motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yeo and Burge, 2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Systematic mutagenesis of three different alternatively spliced exons with intermediate inclusion levels has revealed that mutations at most positions in exons can have substantial effects on their inclusion levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Braun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Julien et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ke et al., 2018</xref>). Considered in isolation, this finding might suggest that changes in splicing could be one of the major mechanisms by which exonic mutations cause phenotypic variation and human disease. However, the effects of mutations on inclusion levels have recently been proposed to scale with the level of inclusion, predicting mutations will only rarely have large effects on the inclusion levels of highly-included exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Centurion et al., 2019</xref>). Since highly-included exons make up most of the expressed exons in the genome in any cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen, 2014</xref>), this leads to the prediction that exonic mutations will actually only rarely change exon inclusion and that mutations having large effects on splicing correspond to the minority of exons included at intermediate levels in a cell type.</p><p>To test these predictions, we performed deep mutagenesis of two highly-included exons. With the exception of mutations in canonical splice sites, we found that mutations generally had little influence on the inclusion of highly-included exons. Deep mutagenesis of a third exon supports this conclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Souček et al., 2019</xref>) as do the effects of thousands of mutations in libraries spanning thousands of different exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>) and the associations between common human genetic variation and changes in inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Analyses of mutations in introns suggest that the same conclusion applies to intronic mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>) and further analyses suggest that it is also true for <italic>trans</italic> perturbations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The vast majority of single-nucleotide mutations in human exons and introns should therefore be expected to have negligible effects on exon inclusion.</p><p>Our conclusions may appear to be in conflict with previous reports of exonic splicing enhancers (exonic sequences that promote higher inclusion) in highly included exons. However, we do not think this is actually the case. In these studies, enhancers were often identified by deleting or substituting entire exonic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watakabe et al., 1993</xref>) or by using antisense oligonucleotides to block binding to an entire domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aartsma-Rus et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, studies reporting strong effects of single-nucleotide changes generally involved in vitro experiments in which the splicing reaction occurs less efficiently compared to in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hicks et al., 2005</xref>), so the mutated exons were never highly included. Additionally, exons were often sensitized to the effects of perturbations by surrounding these exons with the genomic sequences of less included exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaal and Maniatis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shiga et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tanaka et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Watakabe et al., 1993</xref>). In agreement with our conclusions, a previous study showed that single and double nucleotide substitutions had little effect on enhancer activity compared with more complex mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schaal and Maniatis, 1999</xref>). Highly-included exons have been shown to have a higher density of enhancers when compared with alternative exons, which presumably contributes to their high inclusion levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). However, this does not mean that individual point mutations in these elements will produce large changes in inclusion. Indeed, our results revealed that, at the same inclusion level, mutations have a stronger effect in alternative exons than in constitutive exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This may be, in part, precisely due to the higher density of enhancer elements in constitutive exons, which produces sequence redundancy in these exons.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2005</xref> have argued against enhancer redundancy, proposing instead that most or all of the existing enhancers in a given exon are necessary to reach the inclusion levels of a constitutive exon. Indeed, individual cases of single-nucleotide substitutions able to disrupt the splicing of highly-included exons have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Boer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>) and also exist in our systematic mutagenesis datasets. However, systematic experiments and genetic analyses argue that these effects are not prevalent. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> provides a possible rationale to reconcile these observations. Under most conditions, the high levels of inclusion of constitutive exons create, through the scaling of mutational effects, an apparent redundancy between individual elements, ‘locking’ the exon in a state of nearly 100% inclusion. When the same exons are included at lower levels, for example due to a change in conditions, the redundancy effect disappears and individual mutations display stronger effects.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The scaling of mutational effects can create what appears to be sequence ‘redundancy’ as the exon inclusion level approaches 100 or 0%.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two exons can be included at nearly 100%, but be spliced with very different efficiencies. (<bold>B</bold>) A mutation that decreases the efficiency of splicing will have a strong effect on the inclusion of the exon with lower splicing efficiency (pink), but almost no effect on the inclusion of the exon with higher splicing efficiency, even though the starting inclusion level was almost the same.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59959-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The exception to this is mutations that affect splice sites, which can change the inclusion of even highly-included exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our results reveal that splice site mutations in exons that are mostly skipped can also have an inclusion-promoting effect stronger than that of mutations elsewhere in the transcript. Therefore, the activation of a cryptic splice site (a sequence that resembles a splice site but which is not recognized as such) could be a common mechanism by which distal intronic mutations affect splicing. This is often the case with Alu elements (retrotransposons that make up over 10% of the human genome). When inserted in an antisense orientation, an Alu element contains a number of sequences resembling splice sites (and are therefore cryptic splice sites). Such an Alu element could therefore be thought of as an exon included at 0%. Mutations in these cryptic splice sites have been shown to activate them, resulting in the insertion of a new exon in the mature transcript and causing disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ule, 2013</xref>). Other distal intronic mutations have been shown to cause disease using a similar mechanism. For example, a mutation that strengthens a cryptic splice site was shown to activate a silent exon in the <italic>CAPN3</italic> gene, resulting in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blázquez et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, the activation of cryptic splice sites is one of the most common mechanisms by which distal intronic mutations affect splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vaz-Drago et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The small effects of mutations in highly-included exons have implications for the evolution of alternative splicing. The evolution of lower inclusion levels is likely to involve multiple mutations with each of these mutations individually seeming to have no or little effect. This suggests that the evolution of alternative splicing is often likely to initially involve neutral drift until the splicing efficiency of an exon drops enough for mutations to have a noticeable effect on inclusion, allowing skipping-promoting mutations to be selected for or against, if they have a fitness impact. For example, in our recent study a single mutation was never sufficient to decrease the inclusion of the ancestral <italic>FAS</italic> exon six to the inclusion levels of the human exon. Indeed only 8% of double mutants, 11% of triple mutants and 19% of genotypes containing 10 mutations reached the inclusion levels of the human exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Centurion et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Sequencing clinical samples frequently returns novel alternative alleles in known or candidate disease genes whose effects on disease are unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">ClinGen et al., 2015</xref>). A major challenge in human genetics is to determine whether such variants of unknown significance (VUS) are disease-causing mutations. A second challenge is to understand the mechanisms by which alternative alleles cause disease. Our results suggest that VUS are most likely to alter exon inclusion, and therefore be candidate disease-causing alleles by this mechanism, if they are located in or close to an alternative exon with intermediate levels of inclusion, or in a splice site.</p><p>In summary, our results show that very few mutations in both exons and proximal intronic regions typically alter the inclusion of highly-included exons and even fewer impact the inclusion of constitutive exons. Indeed, the distribution of inclusion-altering mutations will be very non-uniform across the genome, focussed around alternatively spliced exons with intermediate levels of inclusion. The exception to this is mutations in splice sites, which can have large effects on inclusion even in highly-included exons. Exons with intermediate inclusion levels make up a minority of expressed exons in any human cell type. Thus, considering the entire human genome, most mutations in exons and introns will actually have negligible effects on exon inclusion. We therefore propose as a general rule to prioritise, as candidate causal disease mechanisms, mutations in canonical splice sites and mutations in and surrounding alternative exons with intermediate levels of inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ancestral <italic>FAS</italic> exon six doped library design and synthesis</title><p>Library oligonucleotides were designed to include the sequence of the ancestral <italic>FAS</italic> exon 6, doped at each position with 1.2% of each of the three non-reference nucleotides, flanked by invariant sequences corresponding to 22 nucleotides of the 3′ end of the human intron 5 and 50 nucleotides of 5′ end of the human intron 6:</p><p>5'-TGT CCA ATG TTC CAA CCT ACA G<bold>GA TCC AGA TCT AAC TTG CTG TGG TTG TGT CTC CTG CTT CTC CCG ATT CTA GTA ATT GTT TGG G</bold>GT AAG TTC TTG CTT TGT TCA AAC TGC AGA TTG AAA TAA CTT GGG AAG TAG −3'.</p><p>Letters in bold indicate the doped exonic sequence.

Some exons in this library were never mutated. Since we were interested in analysing the effects of mutations on exon inclusion, we excluded these exons from the dataset. To study the effects of exonic mutations, we selected mutations belonging to one of the following categories: ‘clst_Ke2011_ESE’, ‘rmv_Ke2011_ESE’, ‘clst_Ke2011_ESS’, ‘rmv_Ke2011_ESS’, ‘rnd_exon_1nt’, ‘rnd_exon_2nt’, ‘rnd_exon_3nt’, ‘rnd_exon_5nt’, ‘aggr_exon’. The effect of a mutation was calculated by subtracting the PSI of the exon with the mutation from the PSI without the mutation. The same exon was sometimes mutated more than once. In those cases, we calculated their median effect to ensure that all exons had an equal weight in the final ΔPSI distribution.

The model’s intercept term was used as an estimate of the exon PSI without the exonic variant (i.e. the ‘starting PSI’ condition). Although we could simply take the average PSI among all samples lacking a specific variant, some variants were never absent (i.e. all samples had either one or two copies of the variant). Therefore, this method allows us to estimate (extrapolate) what the PSI would be in the absence of the sQTL, even if the data are not available.

a general expectation that genetic variants commonly have large effects on exon inclusion levels and that these will often explain disease risk or trait variation.

The study resolves this issue at depth (across all PSI values) using extensive genetic data sets.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mutations primarily alter the inclusion of alternatively spliced exons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nuno L Barbosa-Morais (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an extensive and generally carefully executed study of existing mutagenesis data, human data from GTEx, and some novel mutagenesis data. Results represent the most in-depth, genome-wide comparative examination of the impact of sequence variation on splicing of exons over the spectrum of PSI levels. The authors show that exons of intermediate inclusion levels are much more easily affected by genetic effects on splicing, with high included/excluded exons being much more robust to genetic effects. This represents an important and potentially clinically useful observation. Furthermore, via an analysis of exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), they add some mechanistic interpretability to this general finding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The GTEx analysis needs to account for linkage disequilibrium in order to account for non-independent tests. The approach using a simple effect size cutoff (&quot;only 14% of which are associated with changes in inclusion greater than 10%&quot;) is insufficient because it leads to issues with multi-counting data and some difficulties in biological interpretation. Including each variant-exon pair in the downstream analysis pools data from different tissues and introduces massive non-independence in the data. The data should be filtered to have each exon represented only once by either: (a) performing sQTL mapping and then choosing the variant with the best p-value to represent a given variant association to splicing (or fine-mapping analysis), or (b) simply merging the intronic/exonic analyses (or only analyze e.g. exons) because – as you argue – the GTEx variants that you analyze are not necessarily the causal exonic or intronic variants that you seek to study. Our preference is (a).</p><p>2) Your study would be more insightful if you could investigate, at greater detail, determinants underlying the effects of mutations that have the greatest impact on PSIs of constitutive/highly included exons. In addition to examining relative splice site strength, such an analysis could also take into account the frequency at which mutations result in the creation of predicted exonic splicing silencers. Your ESE analysis should take account of both splice site strength and ESE frequency/content and go beyond previous analyses, e.g. Fairbrother, Burge and colleagues, Science 2002, because of the richer data set.

The approach using a simple effect size cutoff (&quot;only 14% of which are associated with changes in inclusion greater than 10%&quot;) is insufficient because it leads to issues with multi-counting data and some difficulties in biological interpretation. Including each variant-exon pair in the downstream analysis pools data from different tissues and introduces massive non-independence in the data. The data should be filtered to have each exon represented only once by either: (a) performing sQTL mapping and then choosing the variant with the best p-value to represent a given variant association to splicing (or fine-mapping analysis), or (b) simply merging the intronic/exonic analyses (or only analyze e.g. exons) because – as you argue – the GTEx variants that you analyze are not necessarily the causal exonic or intronic variants that you seek to study. Our preference is (a).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out, and we have corrected our analyses accordingly. To account for non-independent tests, we have now repeated the GTEx analysis in a tissue-specific manner. To account for linkage disequilibrium, for each splicing decision we now consider only the strongest associated variant (the one with the smallest p-value). If the strongest associated variant is inside the exon, this splicing event was not included in the intronic analysis. Conversely, if the strongest associated variant is located in the surrounding introns, we did not include this splicing event in the exon analysis. The new results, shown in Figures 4 and 7, confirm that common alternative alleles have stronger effects on the inclusion of exons that display intermediate exon inclusion levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Your study would be more insightful if you could investigate, at greater detail, determinants underlying the effects of mutations that have the greatest impact on PSIs of constitutive/highly included exons. In addition to examining relative splice site strength, such an analysis could also take into account the frequency at which mutations result in the creation of predicted exonic splicing silencers. Your ESE analysis should take account of both splice site strength and ESE frequency/content and go beyond previous analyses, e.g. Fairbrother, Burge and colleagues, Science 2002, because of the richer data set. For example, what is the relative impact of mutations on constitutive exons with weaker vs. stronger 5' and or 3' splice sites? Does a higher frequency of ESEs in constitutive exons confer robustness to effects of mutations even when the flanking splice sites are relatively weak?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their suggestions. We have now included an analysis of predicted exonic splicing silencers (ESS) including the density of ESS sequences as well as suboptimal ESS sequences (sequences that are one Hamming distance away from an ESS sequence) in alternative and constitutive exons (Figure 7—figure supplement 7). The results argue that, in contrast to ESEs, ESSs are enriched in alternatively spliced exons compared to constitutive exons, although ESSs are not found in alternative exons which are highly included in at least one tissue. In addition to this, we now analyze the relationship between splice site strength and ESE density (Figure 7—figure supplement 6), ESS density (Figure 7—figure supplement 7) and ESE robustness (Figure 7—figure supplement 12) and find that the conclusions about differential enrichment of ESEs and ESSs hold true regardless of splice site strength, although as expected, constitutive exons are enriched in the subset of the data containing the strongest splice sites, and alternative exons in the subset of the data containing the weakest splice sites. Finally, we now study how often ESS sequences are created after disrupting an already existing ESE (Figure 7—figure supplement 14). Our conclusion is that there is no correlation between the number of ESS sites created and the classification of exons into constitutive and alternative exons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors refer to the potential significance of the results when interpreting variant effects in disease studies, yet should provide an analysis that does this.

Unfortunately, there are only 33 synonymous mutations classified as ‘pathological’ in ClinVar, located in 15 different exons, which are insufficient to provide the statistical power necessary to perform such an analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
