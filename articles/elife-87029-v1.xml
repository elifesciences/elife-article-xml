investigating such attachments. We developed an automated whole-brain mapping pipeline to identify brain circuits underlying pair-bonding behavior. We identified bonding-related c-Fos induction in 68 brain regions clustered in seven major brain-wide neuronal circuits. These circuits include known regulators of bonding, such as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular hypothalamus, ventral pallidum, and prefrontal cortex. They also include brain regions previously unknown to shape bonding, such as ventromedial hypothalamus, medial preoptic area, and the medial amygdala, but that play essential roles in bonding-relevant processes, such as sexual behavior, social reward, and territorial aggression. Contrary to some hypotheses, we found that circuits active during mating and bonding were largely sexually monomorphic. Moreover, c-Fos induction across regions was strikingly consistent between members of a pair, with activity best predicted by rates of ejaculation. A novel cluster of regions centered in the amygdala remained coordinated after bonds had formed, suggesting novel substrates for bond maintenance. Our tools and results provide an unprecedented resource for elucidating the networks that translate sexual experience into an enduring bond.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prairie vole</kwd><kwd><italic>Microtus ochrogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>pair bond</kwd><kwd>iDISCO</kwd><kwd>immediate early gene</kwd><kwd>c-Fos</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH115267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phelps</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name><name><surname>Osten</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99MH126164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gustison</surname><given-names>Morgan L</given-names></name><name><surname>Phelps</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A brain-wide map of neural activation reveals how sexual experience becomes a pair bond in the monogamous prairie vole.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bonds are essential to the social lives of many species, enabling individuals to coordinate parental care, territorial defense, or other shared activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Emlen and Oring, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marlowe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trivers, 1972</xref>). Among humans, friendships, and a happy marriage protect against a wide range of stressors and their sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumeister and Leary, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010</xref>), while social integration is one of the strongest predictors of reduced morbidity and mortality risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Snyder-Mackler et al., 2020</xref>). Recent evidence suggests social buffering against stress-related disease can be found in many other mammals as well, including species of nonhuman primates, rodents, ungulates, and hyrax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Snyder-Mackler et al., 2020</xref>). Nonhuman animals offer unique insights into the mechanisms of social attachment and their consequences.</p><p>The neurobiology of bonding is most studied in the prairie vole, a socially monogamous rodent in which females and males form bonds, share a nest, and raise young together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>). In prairie voles, as in many pair-bonding species, bonds form in response to courtship and repeated mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Getz et al., 1993</xref>); indeed, copulation itself is regarded as a form of courtship that allows mutual assessment and coordinates reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dewsbury, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eberhard, 1996</xref>). Because of these characteristics, prairie voles have become an excellent model species to study neural circuits that underpin affiliative behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kenkel et al., 2021</xref>). Classic studies emphasized the roles of neuropeptides in reward circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>), work that has been refined to reveal that neural ensembles in the nucleus accumbens encode approach behavior between mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scribner et al., 2020</xref>), and the strength of functional connections between nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex predicts social contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>). Mated prairie voles exhibit empathy-like consolation behavior that reduces markers of distress in both members of a pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>). In one common neuroanatomical model, some 18 different brain regions shape aspects of memory, reward, and approach that are essential to bond formation and its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). Despite this extraordinary work, we still have an incomplete understanding of the circuits that enable the experience of mating to become an enduring bond. Building upon this foundation will require a shift from a piece-meal to systems-wide perspective.</p><p>In several species, including wasps, fish, bats, mice, and humans, researchers using a variety of biological measures find that social interactions are accompanied by coordinated neural states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kingsbury et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kinreich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Yartsev, 2019</xref>). In fighting fish (<italic>Betta splendens</italic>) and paper wasps (<italic>Polistes fuscatus</italic>), shared brain-transcriptomic signatures occur in individuals immediately after competitive interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Uy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vu et al., 2020</xref>). In Egyptian fruit bats (<italic>Rousettus aegyptiacus</italic>) and lab mice, freely interacting individuals have correlated neural activity in the frontal cortex, and increases in inter-brain correlations predict whether subsequent interactions occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kingsbury et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Yartsev, 2019</xref>). In humans, inter-brain EEG recordings become synchronized in a variety of interactive contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasson et al., 2012</xref>), such as during social gaze and positive affect in couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kinreich et al., 2017</xref>). Such data have led to the inference that closely interacting dyads, including bonded individuals, coordinate aspects of their physiological and neural states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the emphasis on shared brain states, sex differences in neuroendocrine mechanisms mean that not only are behaviors often sexually dimorphic, but even if the sexes exhibit similar behaviors, a baseline difference in brain function may require distinct behavioral mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Vries, 2004</xref>). In the monogamous oldfield mouse, <italic>Peromyscus polionotus</italic>, for example, genome-wide association studies implicate different mechanisms in the regulation of female and male parental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bendesky et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, the ‘dual function hypothesis’ has suggested that dimorphic mechanisms may underlie bonding or parental behaviors more generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Vries, 2004</xref>). To understand attachment, it is essential to examine neural function across the entire brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">López-Gutiérrez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yee et al., 2016</xref>), and to explore individual and sex differences in such circuits as bonds form.</p><p>To systematically examine the mechanisms of pair-bond formation, we developed a whole-brain imaging and computational analysis pipeline that includes the first 3D histological atlas of the prairie vole brain. This atlas and analysis pipeline enables the high-throughput, automated counting of cell markers throughout the prairie vole brain. We used this tool to test for sexual dimorphism in the structure of prairie vole brains, and to compare the gross anatomy of the prairie vole brain to the laboratory mouse. In order to map regions and circuits active during bonding, we next quantified immediate early gene (IEG) induction in 824 brain regions at key times in bond formation. This represents the first unbiased identification of circuits active during bonding. Doing so allowed us to examine how the experience of mating finds its way into bonding circuits. It also allowed us to rigorously test two alternative hypotheses: that mating and bonding promote coordinated changes in the brains of mated pairs; and conversely, that sexually dimorphic circuits underlie bonding in females and males.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel whole-brain imaging pipeline for the prairie vole</title><p>We began by generating a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the prairie vole brain by iteratively averaging tissue autofluorescence from 190 brains imaged using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

We used these data to test whether pairing involved a coordinated change in neural activation across brain regions.

We find no evidence of anatomical sexual dimorphism, and only modest evidence of dimorphic function. Our whole-brain mapping of pair-bond formation implicates 68 unique brain regions, including 18 regions that are within the primary brain network proposed for prairie vole bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). The 68 identified regions are more strongly anatomically connected to one another than predicted by chance, and so can be interpreted as circuits active during pairing.</p><p>Although the majority of regions identified have not been linked directly to bonding, many are logical components of a pair-bonding network. For example, the strongest effects of pairing were detected within a cluster containing multiple compartments of the posterior part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalus (BST), as well as the posterodorsal preoptic nucleus (PD), core medial preoptic nucleus (MPNc), and anteroventral periventricular nucleus (‘BST’ purple cluster, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). While this cluster exhibited the strongest response to pairing, only the BST has been previously implicated in prairie vole bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cushing and Wynne-Edwards, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lei et al., 2010</xref>). The cluster as a whole, however, precisely matches the neural circuitry of male ejaculation previously mapped in rats, gerbils, and hamsters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coolen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heeb and Yahr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heeb and Yahr, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfaus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simmons and Yahr, 2002</xref>). The posterior BST projects to both the medial preoptic nucleus (MPN) and the paraventricular nucleus (PVH), major contributors to two other clusters (‘POA-VMH’, blue; ‘PVH’, light blue), regions that also exhibit strong responses to pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cushing et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Insel and Young, 2001</xref>). The paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, moreover, is a major source of the neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin, known modulators of pair bonding in the prairie vole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>).</p><p>A fourth cluster (‘PFC’, green) is composed of prelimbic, infralimbic, and olfactory cortex; activity in the vole prefrontal cortex is known to be modulated by hypothalamic oxytocin, and to shape bonding through projections to the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Horie et al., 2020</xref>). The pattern of activity in this cluster, however, indicates that it was due in part to differences between the isolated animals (0 hr) and other timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because animals in the isolated condition were in a compartment adjacent to either an opposite sexed individual or a familiar former cagemate, we cannot rule out that olfactory or auditory cues may have made animals aware of the presence of a potential social partner. Indeed, we interpret this dimension as capturing appetitive aspects of behaviors associated with investigation of the animal isolated from the subject by the barrier.</p><p>Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and other olfactory cortical areas formed a cluster, we did not find widespread c-Fos induction throughout the cortex in response to pairing. It seems likely that sensory and motor areas were important for social processes related to both pair-bonding and reunion with same-sex cagemates, such as investigation and recognition. Our study design, however, highlights differences between treatments, and in order to detect such effects, it might be necessary to compare mating and bonding pairs to animals left in complete isolation. Moreover, several cortical regions that did not survive corrections for multiple tests may have been identified in a less stringent analysis. Several subregions within the isocortex, hippocampal formation, and cortical subplate had statistical models that approached significance (i.e., p-values &lt;0.1) prior to multiple test corrections. These subregions were found within primary somatosensory area, primary auditory area, dorsal and ventral auditory areas, primary visual area, anteromedial visual area, agranular insular area, temporal association areas, ectorhinal area, postsubiculum, and basomedial amygdala. Frontal cortex subregions were within the agranular insular area and orbital area, as well as additional subregions in prelimbic and infralimbic areas of the PFC.</p><p>In addition to its effects in the PFC, pairing drove increased c-Fos induction in the ventral pallidum, a major node in reward circuity, as well as in the paraventricular nucleus and the medial preoptic area, modulators of reward. This is consistent with a large body of work implicating neuropeptide actions on reward circuits in the formation of bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>). Conspicuously missing from our list, however, is significant pairing-induced c-Fos induction in the nucleus accumbens. The absence of significant accumbens IEG induction may reflect the limitations of using c-Fos and other IEGs as indicators of neural activity. It is known that some neuronal populations can be active without expressing c-Fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheng and Greenberg, 1990</xref>). Indeed, although a variety of studies implicate the accumbens in bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scribner et al., 2020</xref>), previous work finds only weak c-Fos induction in the prairie vole accumbens during bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Curtis and Wang, 2003</xref>). Another possibility is that there was heterogeneous activation in the accumbens that was not captured by the precision of our atlas. Consistent with this interpretation, we found that the accumbens was significant in univariate tests, as well as in voxel-level analyses. Overall, our results do not conflict with pharmacological, electrophysiological, and calcium-imaging data on the role of the nucleus accumbens in prairie vole bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scribner et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, the absence of significant effects at the level of the entire nucleus accumbens, together with the presence of anatomically restricted voxel-level significance, suggests substantial anatomical heterogeneity in the contributions of the nucleus accumbens to bond formation.</p><p>Our data suggest that pairing-related c-Fos immunoreactivity is shared across sexes, and that much of the pairing-related neural activity is driven by mating behavior. The strongest signal of pairing status was in the BSTpr, a region important in male ejaculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Insel and Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfaus, 2009</xref>). We found that both sexes exhibited the strongest signal of pairing status in BSTpr. This finding supports recent work in mice showing that different neural populations in BSTpr, aromatase+ and Vgat+ neurons, respond to ejaculation in both males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayless et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, we found a surprisingly strong relationship between ejaculation rates and brain-wide activity patterns across the putative pair-bonding circuit. The concordance between sexes was surprising, but is consistent with IEG studies of ejaculation and related circuitry in male and female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coolen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfaus, 2009</xref>). These data are also consistent with the interpretation that copulation enables coordination and assessment during bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dewsbury, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eberhard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Getz et al., 1993</xref>). Our findings, along with this previous work, support the hypothesis that sexual behavior plays a key role in driving pair-bond strength. However, the current study focused on animals that were screened for sexual receptivity, which may have limited variation in sexual behavior across pairs. An intriguing direction for future research will be to test how this variation contributes to bond strength.</p><p>The tight coupling of widespread neural activity adds to the growing number of examples – including fish, mice, bats, and humans – that demonstrate correlated neural function across socially interacting individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hasson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kingsbury et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kinreich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Long et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang and Yartsev, 2019</xref>). Although widespread differences among mated pairs seem to be driven by ejaculation rates during mating and bonding, a smaller subset of circuits – specifically connections between the hypothalamus and amygdala – remain correlated after pairing. The similarity of this post-pairing pattern to non-sexual affiliative mechanisms recently documented in lab mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2021</xref>), and to correlations we observe among sibling pairs, suggests these regions play a role in both reproductive and non-reproductive attachment. These brain regions, and especially the amygdala, will be important candidates for future research on neural regulation of pair-bond maintenance.</p><p>Before offering a synthesis of our findings, it would be useful to acknowledge or reiterate a few caveats. First, as noted above, IEG induction does not capture all relevant neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sheng and Greenberg, 1990</xref>). Second, the design of our experiment, which controlled for social interaction, likely excluded many circuits important to both pair bonding and sibling social interactions. Third, c-Fos induction within a given brain region may nevertheless rely on distinct cell types, and so the absence of sex differences in c-Fos immunoreactivity does not definitively rule out the sexually dimorphic circuits hypothesized in the ‘dual function hypothesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Vries, 2004</xref>). Lastly, the current study focused on animals that were screened for sexual receptivity, which may have limited the variation in sexual behavior across opposite-sex pairs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>This brain-wide map of IEG induction provides a uniquely comprehensive perspective on the circuits that enable sexual behavior to become a bond. To help organize this enormous dataset, we looked to existing literature to compare the implicated circuits to those related to sociosexual behaviors in other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>).

Behaviorally, this difference mapped strongly onto mating behavior, and in particular to rates of male ejaculation. The neural circuits of rodent sexual behavior in general, and of male ejaculation in particular, have been well studied in rats, hamsters, and laboratory mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayless et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfaus and Heeb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Veening et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Veening and Coolen, 2014</xref>). In this context, chemosensory signals are thought to drive activity in medial amygdala (MeA), medial preoptic area (MPO), and PVH. Copulation drives activity in ventromedial hypthalamus (VMH), MPN, PD, and BST. We found that elevated c-Fos induction levels occur in these areas early on in the bonding time course and then decline. Such findings support the idea that these core circuits orchestrate early social interactions that enable individuals to process chemosensory signals and then initiate lordosis, mounting, and ejaculation. Our study also revealed a set of regions that have yet to be emphasized in sociosexual circuits, including lateral hypothalamic area and lateral preoptic area. While research on these regions emphasize non-social functions, a number of studies suggest that these regions play a role in social behaviors, or participate in goal-directed behavior and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nieh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Petzold et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, one anomaly from the literature on sexual behavior circuits is that females also show IEG induction associated with male ejaculation – a finding evident in both rats and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pfaus and Heeb, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Veening et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, recent work in female laboratory mice demonstrate that Vgat+ neurons in the BSTpr exhibit responses to male ejaculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayless et al., 2019</xref>). The extraordinary pattern of coordination we observe between members of a pair across nearly 70 brain regions, and its prediction by male ejaculation, suggest that both females and males are experiencing similar and profound affective states. Moreover, the fact that repeated copulation is necessary for bonding is consistent with work in a variety of taxa suggesting that repeated copulation is a means of partner assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dewsbury, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eberhard, 1996</xref>); in prairie voles, we suggest that both females and males are assessing the ability of a male to monopolize a female, a trait that would predict male paternity and ability to defend a nest against conspecifics in the field. Pfaus et al. have argued that females of other species, including laboratory rodents, exhibit orgasm-like responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Georgiadis et al., 2012</xref>). Although our current data are unable to address this claim directly, the hypothesis offers a parsimonious interpretation of our data, and the topic merits further scrutiny.</p><p>In this circuitry, the ‘extended amygdala’ regions of the BST and MeA stand out for their extensive projections to and from the hypothalamus, and for their known roles in individual recognition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dumais et al., 2016</xref>, for example, have documented that the BST of the rat is essential to individual recognition; in parallel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Knoedler et al., 2022</xref> find that estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) in the BST coordinates sex recognition in laboratory mice. Most directly, Cushing et al. have shown that ERa in the BST is essential to the formation of pair bonds in prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lei et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, oxytocin actions in the MeA are known to govern social recognition in lab mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferguson et al., 2001</xref>). We hypothesize that IEG induction in response to mating allows the identity of a mate to get access to the modulation of hormonal and behavioral states by the hypothalamus. Such identity representations may coordinate partner-specific patterns of neuropeptide release (PVN), selective aggression (ventrolateral VMH [VMHvl]), selective mating (VMHvl, MPO), and social reward (MPO).</p><p>After bond formation and stabilization, we find that that mated pairs are similar to co-housed siblings in terms of brain-wide IEG induction patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). More remarkable, is that after 22 hr both co-housed siblings and mated pairs show strong correlations in amygdala IEG induction, particularly in the MeApd. We propose that this correlated activity reflects a sensitivity to the behavioral state of a partner that emerges as a function of bonding. Recent work has revealed that in laboratory mice, tachykinin + GABAergic neurons project from the posterodorsal MeA (MeApd) to the MPO, where they contribute to both consolation grooming and social reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). These projections have not been implicated in pair bonding, but our current data suggest that this circuit may play a broader role in the ongoing function of relationships in both mates and siblings. Since prairie voles often live in larger family groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Getz et al., 1993</xref>), particularly over winter, a common mechanism for the maintenance of familial and sexual bonds would be consistent with their ecology. In addition, the strong correlation of activity across a variety of related amygdala and associated regions suggest this circuit may be anatomically much broader than the interactions between MeApd and MPO documented in laboratory mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, our data survey the brain to identify circuits active as mating produces a pair bond.

We confirm the activity of known regulators of mating and bonding such as reward circuits, the paraventricular nucleus, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coolen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Insel and Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lei et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pfaus, 2009</xref>); we map a path by which sexual activity finds its way to known regulators of bonding, and identify a variety of novel regions and circuits whose roles in bonding remain to be examined. Our results suggest a novel model in which the BST is a key node connecting sexual experience to the neuroendocrine functions of the hypothalamus and preoptic area, and that coupling between the preoptic area and the amygdala may play an unappreciated role in the maintenance of established bonds.

The colony room was maintained at a controlled temperature (20–23°C), and the photoperiod was on a 12:12 light:dark cycle (lights on: 0600, lights off: 1800). Housing arrangements allowed animals to receive visual and olfactory cues, but not tactile contact, with conspecifics. Mice used for anatomical research were housed with ad libitum access to food and water in a controlled temperature (21–22°C) and light (12:12 light/dark cycle) room. All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the University of Texas at Austin (protocols #2016-00247 and #2019-00228) and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (protocol #18-15-12-09-12).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Brain tissue sample preparation and processing</title><p>Prairie voles underwent intracardiac perfusion ~20 min (mean = 21 min, range = 10–40 min) after the behavioral observation endpoints (2 hr acclimation or 2 hr acclimation in addition to 2.5, 6, or 22 hr cohabitation). Animals were anesthetized with open-drop isoflurane exposure, exsanguinated with 0.9% saline (2 min 30 s at 13 ml/min), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (PB; 5 min 30 s at 13 ml/min).

For the construction of the prairie vole reference atlas, the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) was initially used as a template.

In order to enhance image registration, both brain images and reference brains were pre-processed to reduce the impact of imaging artifacts during the computation of mutual information (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

For voxel analysis, the inverse transformation output was used to move all c-Fos centroids onto the reference brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Experiment design</title><p>Study subjects were 8–12 week old sexually naive prairie voles. There were eight treatments that varied based on partner type and cohabitation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Subjects were partnered with a familiar same-sex cage mate (siblings) or an opposite-sex individual (mates) for 0, 2.5, 6, or 22 hr. The 0 hr timepoint represents a baseline state before pairing takes place, the 2.5 hr timepoint is ~2 hr after the first mating bout, the 6 hr timepoint is when an unstable partner preference is established, and the 22 hr timepoint is when pair bonding becomes stable (i.e., after overnight mating) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeVries and Carter, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Williams et al., 1992</xref>). It is important to note that the opaque divider in the acclimation period prevented physical interactions, but it is possible that animal pairs may have detected each other through olfactory or auditory cues. The experiment was run in six testing blocks. Each block was composed of eight testing days spread across 2 weeks, with two adjacent testing days per cohabitation timepoint (0, 2.5, 6, and 22 hr). Two pair sets were tested in a day, either female siblings and male siblings or two mating pairs. The order of partner type (adjacent days per timepoint) and order of cohabitation timepoints (four per block) were counterbalanced across blocks. Individuals were randomly assigned to the partner type condition.</p><p>There were 12 sibling pairs and 12 mating pairs tested for each cohabitation timepoint, for a total of 96 female and 96 male study subjects. Of this total, 190 voles were used for behavioral analyses, and 189 voles were used for IEG analyses. A mating pair from the 0 hr timepoint group lacked behavioral data due to a camera malfunction (audio was unaffected). Three brain samples were not used in IEG analyses: one male sibling from the 6 hr timepoint group, one female mate from the 0 hr timepoint, and one female mate from the 6 hr timepoint. The first sample was not stained for c-Fos due to major issues with the perfusion. The latter two samples were identified as outliers by a Rosner’s test (EnvStats R package; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Millard, 2013</xref>); their whole-brain c-Fos+ cell counts were higher than the rest of the samples (<italic>R</italic> = 4.61 and 5.504, p &lt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Estrus induction and animal selection</title><p>Voles were housed in new home cages, isolated from their sibling cage mates, 4–5 days prior to testing. During this isolation period, all females were induced into estrus with daily 0.1 ml subcutaneous injections of 2 μg estradiol benzoate dissolved in sesame oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carter et al., 1988</xref>). Voles were screened for mating capacity on the third day of isolation. This screening involved a brief exposure (&lt;10 min) to an opposite-sex vole until the first mount. Voles that did not show a mating attempt in the first exposure were retested with a different animal. We used this mating assay to restrict study subjects to voles that showed lordosis (females) or mounting behavior (males). By selecting voles who showed sexual behavior, we could control the estrus state and timing of mating across the 0, 2.5, 6, and 22 hr study groups. This selection process also ensured that animals assigned to the same-sex sibling pair and opposite-sex mating pair groups had similar sexual motivation and experience.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Behavioral procedures</title><p>Behavioral testing began in the morning after lights-on between 8:00 and 10:15 (mean = 8:44 am). Subjects were fitted with colored collars (pipe cleaner attached to a miniature cable tie) for identification and automated video tracking. Then, subjects were placed on opposite sides of a custom made acrylic testing arena (12″ × 24″ × 12″), separated by an opaque divider, for a 2 hr acclimation period. The testing arenas were outfitted with fresh bedding and ad libitum access to food and water. The arenas were housed within an enclosed experiment box (42″ × 34″ × 24″) constructed from expanded PVC. These experiment boxes had controlled white:red lighting (Phillips Hue light strips) on the same photoperiod cycle as the colony room. For the 0 hr timepoint, subjects only underwent a 2 hr acclimation period. Otherwise, the divider was removed at the end of acclimation so that subjects could interact freely for 2.5, 6, or 22 hr. After this acclimation (0 hr group) or cohabitation (2.5, 6, and 22 hr groups), subjects were promptly removed from the arena and perfused. Arenas were cleaned with 70% ethanol between tests.</p><p>Video and audio data were recorded from Basler Ace-IMX174 cameras (1920 × 1200, 2 MP resolution, Basler AG, PA) and Ultramic 364K BLE microphones (Dodotronic, Italy) suspended above each testing arena. Cameras were outfitted with a 16-mm lens and 46-mm linear polarizer. Video data were recorded with Pylon viewer (v 5.1.0.12681, Basler AG, PA) at 25 fps with white balance set to ~1.93 and exposure levels between 15 and 25 ms. Audio was recorded with SeaPro2 software (v 2.0j, CIBRA) at a 192-kHz sampling rate and saved in 30 min WAV files (starting on the hour and every half hour). With this setup, ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) could be detected per pair, but not localized to specific individuals. Recording equipment was connected directly to a Windows 10 PC. The start of both video and audio recordings were timestamped with PC system time, which enabled the synchronization of audio and video data on a second-by-second timescale.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Video and audio processing</title><p>Behaviors were measured during observation windows that corresponded to peaks in c-Fos induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renier et al., 2016</xref>), specifically 60–120 min before each pair’s perfusion (i.e., midpoint between exsanguination times of each vole pair). Both automated and manual methods were used to characterize vole behavior.</p><p>Automated scoring of movement and proximity behaviors was done with Ethovision (v 10.1). Individual collars were tracked during white light periods, with detection settings set for each video and optimized for collar color (blue/green, mean ± standard deviation [SD]: huemin = 97.0 ± 1.4/63.1 ± 2.5, huemax = 113.0 ± 1.4/79.2 ± 2.6, saturationmin = 113.3 ± 11.8/85.4 ± 10.5, saturationmax = 255.0 ± 0.2/254.9 ± 0.7, brightnessmin = 84.1 ± 10.5/70.2 ± 8.9, brightnessmax = 254.0 ± 4.6/254.7 ± 1.6, marker size = 50). Body area was recorded across both white light and red light periods with the grayscaling method (white/red light: detectionmin = 0, detectionmax = 108.7 ± 3.3/5.96 ± 0.8, pixel sizemin = 3000, pixel sizemax = 125,000, contour erosion = 1, contour dilation = 1). The largest body area was recorded when animals were in physical contact. Overall activity (% pixel change between frames) also was recorded for white light and red light periods separately (white/red light: threshold = 1, background = 10, compression = ‘on’ for all 24 overnight videos/‘on’ for 18 overnight videos). Individual tracking, body area, and activity were recorded at 12.5 samples/s, down sampled to 1/s, and used to compute an array of behavioral measures across entire recording sessions and the 1 hr observation windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Manual scoring of mating, investigative, grooming, and contact behaviors was done with BORIS (v 7.9.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friard et al., 2016</xref>).

Self-grooming during acclimation videos (0 hr group) was labeled by one of the trained observers. Inter-observer reliability was assessed with Pearson correlations. For dyadic behaviors (e.g., mounting and huddling), reliability was assessed across vole pairs. For individual behaviors (e.g., anogenital sniffing and self-grooming), reliability was assessed separately for individuals with blue collars and green collars.

To initially label USVs, the ‘AllShortCalls’ network was used along with the following detection settings: frequency range of 20–90 kHz, overlap of 0.1 s, 5 s chunk length, and a high precision recall. Then, a trained observer revisited all USVs labels during the 1 hr behavior observation windows. Using the DeepSqueak interface, the observer removed labels of background noise (e.g., water bottle sounds) and adjusted USV label boundaries to exclude noise. This trained observer was blind to the partner condition, caller sex, and behavioral context. The start and stop times of all USV labels were exported and the times were adjusted to align with the video frame timestamps.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Absolute and relative volumes of brain regions were compared across species (mouse vs. vole) and sexes (male voles vs. female voles) with negative binomial regression models.

Pearson correlations were used to make associations between behavioral measures and ROI c-Fos+ cell counts.</p><p>To identify brain regions that are sensitive to pairing status, we used a model comparison approach. For each voxel or ROI, two general linear regression models (‘GLMs’; a quasi-Poisson link function was used to model over-dispersed count data) were used to predict IEG c-Fos expression across all individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 189) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). These models differed in whether the partner condition (sibling vs. mate) was a part of the formula. The ‘null’ model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>) included main effects of sex [S], timepoint [T], and experiment block [B]. The hypothesized ‘bonding’ model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>) included the same predictor terms in addition to a main effect of partner type [P] and interactions between partner with sex or timepoint. In these models, sex was a categorical factor (males vs. females). Timepoint was an ordinal variable from 1 to 4 (0, 2.5, 6, and 22 hr) and was included as a polynomial term to account for both linear and quadratic (i.e., 0/22 vs. 2.5/6 hr) effects. Block was an ordinal variable from 1 to 6. Partner was a categorical variable (mates vs. siblings).

First, we refined a matrix of ROI–ROI ipsilateral normalized connection densities to align with our list of chosen ROIs. Some of our chosen ROIs did not align with this matrix because they represented subregions of the ROIs in the matrix. In those cases, we used data from the next inclusive ROI that was available (e.g., BST data used for BSTpr). Then, for each cluster, we found the mean normalized connection density between the regions. We excluded data from the matrix diagonals (e.g., BST to BST) to emphasize connections between, rather than within, regions. We took an average of these cluster densities values to capture the overall connection density based on our cluster assignments. A permutation test was used to assess whether this connection density was higher than expected by chance. The rows of the connectivity matrix (rows = origin ROIs, columns = target ROIs) were randomly shuffled prior to computing the mean cluster density, and this was done 10,000 times to construct a null distribution. This null distribution was then compared to the observed density to estimate its probability.</p><p>We used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to investigate the relationships between behavioral variables and IEG induction patterns in chosen ROIs. CCA is an unsupervised method that finds linear combinations of two variable sets with the strongest correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">González et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">R Development Core Team, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This approach enabled us to isolate discrete canonical correlates (CC), where each individual animal is assigned scores for each variable set per CC factor. We used correlations between individual behavior/ROI measures and their CC scores to interpret CC factors and identify specific behaviors and ROIs with the strongest associations. Wilk’s lambda test statistic was used to confirm which CC factors represented a significant association between the two variable sets.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>P.O. is a co-founder, shareholder and Director at Certerra, Inc and co-founder, shareholder and President at Certego Therapeutics, Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the University of Texas at Austin (protocols #2016-00247 and #2019-00228) and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (protocol #18-15-12-09-12).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical comparisons of absolute and relative brain area volumes between prairie voles and mice.</title><p>Absolute and relative area volumes (normalized to total brain volume) are compared between prairie voles (<italic>n</italic> = 190 voles, 94 males and 96 females) and male mice (<italic>n</italic> = 108) with negative binomial regression models.

This species has a suite of social behaviors that are difficult or impossible to study in conventional rodents, and has attracted a large community of researchers. The atlas is impressive and will be a fantastic resource. The authors use this atlas to examine brain-wide c-fos expression in prairie voles that were paired with same sex or opposite sex vole across multiple timepoints. In some sense the design resembles PET studies done in primates that take whole brain scans after an important behavioral experience. The authors observed increased c-fos expression across a network of brain regions that largely corresponds with the previous literature. The study design captured several novel observations including that c-fos expression in some regions correlate strongly between males and females during pair bond formation and mating, suggesting synchrony in neural activity. The authors address an important caveat that c-fos provides a snapshot of neural activity and that important populations of neurons could be active and not express c-fos. Thus observed correlations are likely to be robust, but that the absence of differences (in say accumbens) may just reflect the limits of c-fos estimation of neural activity. Similarly, highly coordinated neural activity between males and females might still be driven by different mechanisms if different cell types were activated within a specific region. The creation of this resource and it's use in a well designed study is an important accomplishment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87029.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript, Gustison et al., describe the development of an automated whole-brain mapping pipeline, including the first 3D histological atlas of the prairie vole, and then use that pipeline to quantify Fos immunohistochemistry as a measure of neural activity during mating and pair bonding in male and female prairie voles. Prairie voles have become a useful animal model for examining the neural bases of social bonding due to their socially monogamous mating strategy. Prior studies have focused on identifying the role of a few neuromodulators (oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine) acting in limited number of brain regions. The authors use this unbiased approach to determine which areas become activated during mating, cohabitation, and pair bonding in both sexes to identify 68 brain regions clustered in seven brain-wide neuronal circuits that are activated over the course of pair bonding. This is an important study because (i) it generates a valuable tool and analysis pipeline for other investigators in the prairie vole research community and (ii) it highlights potential involvement of many brain regions in regulating sexual behavior, social engagement and pair bonding that have not been previously investigated.</p><p>Strengths of the study include the unbiased assessment of neural activity using the automated whole brain activity mapped onto the 3D histological atlas. The design of the behavioral aspect of study is also a strength. Brains were collected at baseline and 2.5, 6 and 22 hrs after cohabitation with either a sibling or opposite sex partner. These times were strategically chosen to correspond to milestones in pair bond development. Behavior was also quantified during epochs over the 22 hr period providing useful information on the progression of behaviors (e.g. mating) during pair bonding and relating Fos activation to specific behaviors (e.g. sex vs bonding). The sibling co-housed group provided an important control, enabling identification of areas specifically activated by sex and bond formation. The analyses of the data were rigorous, resulting in convincing conclusions. While there was nothing particularly surprising in terms of the structures that were identified to be active during the mating and cohabitation, the statistical analysis revealed interesting relationships in terms of interactions of the various clusters, and also some level of synchrony in brain activation between partners. Furthermore, ejaculation was found to be the strongest predictor of Fos activation in both males and females. The sex differences identified in the study was subtle and less than the authors expected, which is interesting.</p><p>While the study provides a potentially useful tool and approach that may be general use to the prairie vole community and identifies in an anatomically precise manner areas that may be important for mating or pair bond formation, there are some weaknesses as well. The study is largely descriptive. It is impossible to determine whether the activated areas are simply involved in sex or in the pair bond process itself. In other words, the authors did not use the Fos data to inform functional testing of circuits in pair bonding or mating behaviors. However, that is likely beyond the scope of this paper in which the goal was more to describe the automated, unbiased approach. This weakness is offset by the value of the comprehensive and detailed analysis of the Fos activation data providing temporal and precise anatomical relationships between brain clusters and in relation to behavior. The manuscript concludes with some speculative interpretations of the data, but these speculations may be valuable for guiding future investigations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87029.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gustison</surname><given-names>Morgan L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Western University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Muñoz Castañeda</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cold Spring Harbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Osten</surname><given-names>Pavel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cold Spring Harbor</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Phelps</surname><given-names>Steven M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Texas at Austin</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Austin</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The importance of the role of sexual behavior, specifically ejaculation rates, is worth emphasizing for the formation of pair bonds in prairie voles.

Perhaps it has been overly emphasized in the past, but there are strong results from other studies pointing to the importance of reward circuitry.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. There is a section in the Results that analyses accumbens in more detail than other brain regions. Accumbens did not survive our corrections for multiple statistical tests, however it was significant at early timepoint without these corrections. This Results paragraph states the following:</p><p>“Although the nucleus accumbens did not survive multiple test corrections in our ROI analysis (q=0.17), it was significant in univariate analysis (p=0.03), particularly when focused on the 2.5 and 6h timepoints (two sample t-test: t=2.53, p=0.01, Video 2). Furthermore, voxel-level comparisons revealed significant sites within the ventral striatum and the posterior nucleus accumbens (Figure 2A, Figure Supplement 1b-c, Video 2).”</p><p>We added Supplementary File 4, which contains model comparison results for accumbens and all other ROIs. We also added more detail on nucleus accumbens to the Discussion:</p><p>“Pairing drove increased c-Fos expression in the ventral pallidum, a major node in reward circuity, as well as in the paraventricular nucleus and the medial preoptic area, modulators of reward. This is consistent with a large body of work implicating neuropeptide actions on reward circuits in the formation of bonds (Walum &amp; Young, 2018; Young &amp; Wang, 2004). Conspicuously missing from our list, however, is significant pairing induced c-Fos induction in the nucleus accumbens. One possibility is that an absence of significant accumbens IEG induction reflects the limitations of using c-Fos and other immediate early genes as indicators of neural activity. It is known that some neuronal populations can be active without expressing c-Fos (Sheng &amp; Greenberg, 1990). Indeed, although a variety of studies implicate the accumbens in bond formation (Amadei et al., 2017; Aragona et al., 2006; Scribner et al., 2020), previous work finds only weak c-Fos induction in the prairie vole accumbens during bonding (Curtis &amp; Wang, 2003). Another possibility is that there was heterogeneous activation in the accumbens that was not captured by the precision of our atlas. Consistent with this interpretation, found that the accumbens was significant in univariate tests, as well as in voxel-level analyses. Overall, our results do not conflict with pharmacological, electrophysiological, and calcium-imaging data on the role of the nucleus accumbens in prairie vole bonding (Amadei et al., 2017; Aragona et al., 2006; Scribner et al., 2020). Instead, the absence of significant effects at the level of the entire nucleus accumbens together with the presence of anatomically restricted voxel-level significance suggests substantial anatomical heterogeneity in the contributions of the nucleus accumbens to bond formation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please discuss the consequences of creating the behavioral data for pair bond formation by subtracting same-sex pairs interactions from the opposite-sex interactions. What sources of information are removed by using this approach?</p></disp-quote><p>One limitation of our study’s approach is that we are unable to fully separate information related to social novelty from mating experience. Thank you for pointing out that we should touch on this sort of caveat in the paper. We added several sentences to the Discussion:</p><p>“It seems likely that sensory and motor areas were important for social processes related to both pair-bonding and reunion with same-sex cagemates, such as investigation and recognition. Our study design, however, highlights differences between treatments, and in order to detect such effects, it might be necessary to compare mating and bonding pairs to animals left in complete isolation.”</p><p>We reiterate the point in a new paragraph we added to the Discussion to explicitly provide caveats regarding our data:</p><p>“Before offering a synthesis of our findings, it would be useful to acknowledge a few caveats. First, as noted above, IEG induction does not capture all relevant neural activity. Second, the design of our experiment, which controlled for social interaction, likely excluded many circuits important to both pair bonding and sibling social interactions. Third, c-Fos activity within a given brain region may nevertheless rely on distinct cell types, and so the absence of sex differences in c-Fos immunoreactivity does not definitively rule out the sexually dimorphic circuits hypothesized in the “dual function hypothesis” (de Vries, 2004). Lastly, the current study focused on animals that were screened for sexual receptivity, which may have limited the variation in sexual behavior across opposite-sex pairs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Time 0 is when the barrier is removed after a two-hour exposure. Please speculate on what is going on during the two-hour exposure. Time zero is potentially more than the time of mating. Is it possible that aggression is being decreased during this timepoint that represents mating? Could it also be a measure of the outcome of an initial compatibility assessment by the male and female?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this interesting observation. While the opaque divider prevented physical social interactions, it is possible that animals picked up on auditory or olfactory cues. We did not detect group differences in movement patterns and vocalization rates from the 0 h timepoint group (Figure 2). These findings suggest that potential partner detection and assessment occurred in a similar way for both experiment groups. It is unlikely that this period represents a decrease in aggression, since unbonded prairie voles are not known to be aggressive towards conspecifics. However, the idea that animals may potentially use olfactory or auditory cues to assess each other is an interesting idea, and one that we cannot rule out. We added a brief statement to the Methods “Experiment Design” section about the possibility that the two hours prior to divider removal (0 h timepoint) could represent more than an acclimation period:</p><p>“It is important to note that the opaque divider in the acclimation period prevented physical interactions, but it is possible that animal pairs may have detected each other through olfactory or auditory cues.”</p><p>We also mention this in the revised Discussion in the context of the PFC cluster, which not only differed between mating and non-mating groups, but also showed differences between isolated (0h) and socially interacting animals (sibs and mates, 2.5h-22h):</p><p>“A fourth cluster (“PFC,” green) is composed of prelimbic, infralimbic and olfactory cortex; activity in the vole prefrontal cortex is known to be modulated by hypothalamic oxytocin, and to shape bonding through projections to the nucleus accumbens (Amadei et al., 2017; Burkett et al., 2016; Horie et al., 2020). The pattern of activity in this cluster, however, indicates that it was due in part to differences between the isolated animals (0h) and other time points (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Because animals in the isolated condition were in a compartment adjacent to either an opposite sexed individual or a familiar former cagemate, we cannot rule out that olfactory or auditory cues may have made animals aware of the presence of a potential social partner. Indeed, we interpret this dimension as capturing appetitive aspects of behaviors associated with investigation of the animal isolated from the subject by the barrier.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>An important caveat to this study not mentioned by the authors is that c-fos provides a snapshot of neural activity and that important populations of neurons could be active and not express c-fos.

We went through the manuscript and added in sample sizes to statistical reporting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>It is surprising that the cortex was not more extensively identified as being involved in pair bonding, but perhaps this is because the emphasis for choosing brain areas in the cortical region is biased towards olfactory regions. Please discuss. It may also be worth noting that brain regions associated with perception may be important in all of these processes, but selected out because of the design.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this observation. We agree that some cortical regions may not have been identified due to the study design. For example, social processes related to both pair bonding and cagemate recognition likely rely on overlapping circuits. It is also important to note here that our analysis approach identified the “most” significant regions. This means that several candidate regions did not survive the statistical threshold used to select regions. We now discuss the cortex in more detail in the Discussion, where we also identify the regions that approached significance but did not survive multiple test corrections:</p><p>“Although the PFC and other olfactory cortical areas formed a cluster, we did not find widespread c-Fos induction throughout the cortex in response to pairing. It seems likely that sensory and motor areas were important for social processes related to both pair-bonding and reunion with same-sex cagemates, such as investigation and recognition. Our study design, however, highlights differences between treatments, and in order to detect such effects, it might be necessary to compare mating and bonding pairs to animals left in complete isolation. Moreover, several cortical regions that did not survive corrections for multiple tests may have been identified in a less stringent analysis. Several subregions within the isocortex, hippocampal formation, and cortical subplate had statistical models that approached significance (i.e., p-values &lt; 0.1) prior to multiple test corrections. These subregions were found within primary somatosensory area, primary auditory area, dorsal and ventral auditory areas, primary visual area, anteromedial visual area, agranular insular area, temporal association areas, ectorhinal area, postsubiculum, and basomedial amygdala. Frontal cortex subregions were within the agranular insular area and orbital area, as well as additional subregions in prelimbic and infralimbic areas of the PFC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Same-sex siblings were isolated for 4-5 days and then repaired. This is a creative way of dealing with this, but was any aggression displayed in the same-sex pairs? Are there bonds or preferences among same-sex individuals? Could the isolation have set the stage for neural changes associated with migrating from the natal group? 4-5 days of isolation is not trivial.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these questions. We did not witness aggression between same-sex pairs. We had recorded ‘aggression’ events (lunges and chases) during the 1 h behavioral observation epochs and found that these rates were nearly zero for all sibling timepoint groups (events/h per focal animal in mean ± sd: 2.5 h group = 0.58 ± 1.53, 6 h group = 0.17 ± 0.48, 22 h group = 0.25 ± 0.44).</p><p>The question about peer relationships is a good one. Previous literature does suggest that prairie voles can develop preferences for familiar same-sex individuals (e.g., Beery et al. 2018 Front. Behav. Neuro., Lee et al. 2019 Front. Behav. Neuro). Thus, we want to reiterate here that our study design tests for differences between these baseline levels of affiliation with pair bonding in a reproductive context.</p><p>It is possible that the period of isolation prior to experiments may have set the stage for neural changes associated with migration from the natal group. Testing this possibility is outside the scope of the current study. We want to point out here that animals were separated from their natal groups several weeks prior to the experiment. Animals were weaned at 21 days and put into same-sex cages, and then experiments occurred between 8-12 weeks of age. All experiment groups went through the same weaning and co-housing conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pg 26, Line 655: &quot;better&quot; is listed twice in the sentence and only one is needed</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching this typo.

The authors need to state how voles were brought into estrus.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We explained estrus induction in the Methods, but this explanation could be missed because it was within the “Behavioral procedures” section. We put the paragraph about estrus induction into a new section called “Estrus induction and animal selection”. We also elaborated on the final sentences of this paragraph to provide a clearer rationale:</p><p>“We used this mating assay to restrict study subjects to voles that showed lordosis (females) or mounting behavior (males). By selecting voles who showed sexual behavior, we could control the estrus state and timing of mating across the 0, 2.5, 6 and 22 h study groups. This selection process also ensured that animals assigned to the same-sex sibling pair and opposite-sex mating pair groups had similar sexual motivation and experience.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I assume in the final manuscript the authors will release the availability of the atlas? Making the atlas public seems to be in the spirit of the eLife publishing model.</p></disp-quote><p>The prairie vole reference brain, atlas, and atlas annotation labels, are now included on the Figshare repository site. We updated the Data and code availability section to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Please clarify in the Methods if same-sex sibling females were also estrogen primed.

We refined the Methods section “Estrus induction and animal selection” to make this part of the study design clearer. We edited one of the sentences to say “During this isolation period, all females were induced into estrus[...]” We also added a couple sentences at the end of this paragraph:</p><p>“By selecting voles who showed sexual behavior, we could control the estrus state and timing of mating across the 0, 2.5, 6 and 22 h study groups. This selection process also ensured that animals assigned to the same-sex sibling pair and opposite-sex mating pair groups had similar sexual motivation and experience.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
