predicting the impact of a new variant; it can also illuminate biological mechanisms including those underlying the emergence of variants of concern. Recently, Lan et al. reported a model of SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure and its underlying dimethyl sulfate reactivity data (Lan et al., 2022). I investigated whether base reactivities and secondary structure models derived from them can explain some variability in the frequency of observing different nucleotide substitutions across millions of patient sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree. Nucleotide basepairing was compared to the estimated ‘mutational fitness’ of substitutions, a measurement of the difference between a substitution’s observed and expected frequency that is correlated with other estimates of viral fitness (Bloom and Neher, 2023). This comparison revealed that secondary structure is often predictive of substitution frequency, with significant decreases in substitution frequencies at basepaired positions. Focusing on the mutational fitness of C→U, the most common type of substitution, I describe C→U substitutions at basepaired positions that characterize major SARS-CoV-2 variants; such mutations may have a greater impact on fitness than appreciated when considering substitution frequency alone.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tracking and characterizing mutations in a fast-evolving virus such as SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, are valuable for an effective public health response and for developing treatments and vaccines that work well against mutated viruses. Mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome happen when errors are made as the RNA genetic material is copied.</p><p>The SARS-CoV-2 genome is made of an RNA chain consisting of four units called nucleotides, known as A, C, G, and U. Unlike DNA, where all nucleotides of one strand are paired with the other strand, RNA usually consists of a single strand. However, the SARS-CoV-2 genome folds into a compact and dynamic structure where some RNA nucleotides form pairs with others within the same strand, similar to the double-stranded DNA molecules.</p><p>Many mutations have no effect, but some can increase the ability of the virus to spread from person to person. This increased ‘viral fitness’ is difficult to predict, but understanding which mutations are more likely to occur can help scientists estimate risks. For example, a common type of mutation causes one RNA nucleotide – A, U, C or G – to be replaced by another. In SARS-CoV-2, the most common mutations involve C being replaced by U.</p><p>To find out if the pairing of RNA nucleotides affects how likely it is for a mutation to occur, Hensel looked at the rates of tens of thousands of different mutations, previously estimated from millions of publicly available sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. He analyzed how often different types of mutations happen in paired versus unpaired RNA nucleotides. Only mutations that change the nucleotide sequence and not the protein sequences (so-called ‘neutral’ mutations) were considered in this analysis.</p><p>Hensel observed that C to U and G to U mutations are about four times more likely in unpaired nucleotides compared to paired ones. Other types of ‘neutral’ mutations, like A to G, were found to be equally likely, regardless of being paired or unpaired. Understanding that certain unpaired nucleotides mutate more often can help explain why some mutations are much more common than others. This should be considered in future models of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and other RNA viruses. A better understanding of mutation rates will also inform vaccine development and improve our estimates of viral fitness, potentially improving future public health responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>secondary structure</kwd><kwd>mutation frequency</kwd><kwd>viral evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.54499/UIDB/04612/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hensel</surname><given-names>Zach</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.54499/UIDP/04612/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hensel</surname><given-names>Zach</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.54499/LA/P/0087/2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hensel</surname><given-names>Zach</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure shapes mutation frequencies, constraining viral evolution models predicting fitness can benefit from integrating secondary structure data.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While investigating the significance of the substitution C29095U, detected in a familial cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2020</xref>), I hypothesized that this synonymous substitution reflected the high frequency of C→U substitution during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Maio et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically, frequent C29095U substitution had previously complicated attempts to infer recombinant genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">VanInsberghe et al., 2021</xref>). Preliminary investigation revealed that C29095U was the fourth most frequent C→U substitution, occurring almost seven times as often as a typical C→U substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Neher, 2023</xref>). While there was no clear reason for selection of this synonymous substitution, C29095 was found to be unpaired in a secondary structure model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). The 5′ context of C29095 is UC, and additional SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure models that I consulted (see below) agree that C29095 occurs as a single unpaired base in an asymmetrical internal loop, opposite three unpaired bases. Although one study found that exogenous expression of APOBEC3A accelerated C→U substitution in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells in the UC context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Nakata et al., 2023</xref>), the most frequently mutated positions were in the context of larger unpaired regions.</p><p>I hypothesized that non-enzymatic deamination may be more frequent for unpaired cytosine residues, which was supported by a previous analysis with a resolution of approximately 300 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2023</xref>) and by a comparison of sequence diversity in early SARS-CoV-2 genomes to an RNA folding prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Simmonds, 2020</xref>). However, these studies differed in their interpretations of relatively high C→U substitution frequencies at unpaired positions, leaving it unresolved whether this was primarily driven by higher mutation rates at unpaired positions or fitness costs of mutations disrupting secondary structure. To determine whether secondary structure was in fact correlated with mutation frequency at single-nucleotide resolution and to extend this analysis beyond C→U substitutions, the dataset reported by Lan et al. was compared to the mutational fitness estimates reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Neher, 2023</xref>. Note that ‘mutational fitness’ is not a measurement of viral fitness per se; rather, it is an estimate made assuming that the expected frequencies of neutral mutations are determined only by the type of substitution (with C→U being much more frequent than all other types of substitutions).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There was a significant increase in synonymous substitution frequencies at unpaired positions for C→U, G→U, C→A, and U→C, but not for A→G or G→A (p&lt;0.05; Tukey’s range test with Bonferroni correction; A→U, G→C, and C→G were also significant in an unplanned analysis of all substitution types). For all substitution types with significant differences, unpaired substitution frequencies were higher than basepaired substitution frequencies. The largest effects were observed for C→U and G→U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In this secondary structure model, there is basepairing for 60% and 73% of C and G positions, respectively (limited to those covered in the mutational fitness analysis). The largest impacts on median estimated mutational fitness were observed for synonymous C→U and G→U mutations, with apparent fitness higher at unpaired positions than at paired positions by 1.44 and 1.25, respectively. Expressed in terms of substitution frequency rather than mutational fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the frequency of synonymous C→U and G→U substitutions was about four times higher at unpaired positions than at basepaired positions.

One study identified a basepairing dependence for C→U substitutions during serial passage of different SARS-CoV-2 variants and considered mutational fitness estimates from Bloom and Neher for more rare substitution types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gout et al., 2024</xref>). In another analysis that analyzed recurrent substitutions in multiple lineages, little difference was observed overall for C→U substitutions in different 5′ and 3′ contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Simmonds, 2024</xref>). It was observed that only the few C→U substitutions that appeared with the highest frequencies had a strong preference for 5′ U context. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that the degree of this 5′ U preference becomes more clear when limiting analysis to synonymous substitutions and separately analyzing basepaired positions (which show no 5′ preference) and unpaired positions. At unpaired positions, synonymous C→U substitutions with 5′ U context have a higher apparent fitness (0.83 [0.79, 0.89], 95% CI from 1000 bootstrapped samples) than with 5′ G (0.15 [0.01, 0.50]), 5′A (0.55 [0.45, 0.68]), or 5′ C (0.57 [0.33, 0.69]). Conversely, synonymous C→U substitution rates with 3′ G context were elevated at both unpaired and paired positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting some CpG suppression with little dependence on basepairing. Notably, the previously mentioned C29095 is both unpaired and appears in the context UCG.</p><p>Basepairing in the secondary structure model appeared to be more predictive of estimated mutational fitness than average dimethyl sulfate (DMS) reactivity, with correlation coefficients of 0.59 [0.55, 0.62] and 0.45 [0.40, 0.49], respectively, for synonymous C→U substitutions (point biserial and Spearman correlation coefficients; 95% CIs from 1000 bootstrapped samples). However, DMS reactivity was more strongly correlated with estimated mutational fitness than basepairing when analysis was limited to positions with detectable DMS reactivity (0.77 [0.74, 0.79], excluding the sites plotted at the minimum measured value of 0.00012). This suggests that considering structural heterogeneity captured in base reactivity datasets could improve predictions of substitution rates. Correlation coefficients remained significant, but were reduced (0.17 [0.14, 0.20] and 0.13 [0.09, 0.16]) when considering nonsynonymous C→U substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, left), consistent with larger and often negative effects of nonsynonymous mutations on viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Neher, 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Estimated mutational fitness correlates with secondary structure for nonsynonymous C→U substitutions.</title><p>Scatter plots compare mutational fitness to average dimethyl sulfate (DMS) reactivity for positions with potential nonsynonymous C→U substitutions.

In light of this, secondary structure models derived from two DMS reactivity datasets (from SARS-CoV-2 isolate WA1 infection of Huh7 and Vero cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lan et al., 2022</xref>) and two SHAPE reactivity datasets (SARS-CoV-2 isolates WA1 and Leiden0002 infection of Huh7.5 and Vero cells, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huston et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>) were compared by degree of correlation with estimated mutational fitness. Correlations between basepairing and synonymous C→U substitution rates were highest for models derived from DMS data (0.59 [0.55, 0.62] and 0.63 [0.60, 0.67] for Huh7 and Vero datasets, respectively). Models derived from SHAPE data had modestly lower correlations (0.55 [0.50, 0.59] and 0.50 [0.46, 0.54] for Huh7 and Vero datasets, respectively). However, the methods used to construct each of these four models have difference beyond base reactivity probes, cell type, and viral isolate, so small differences in correlation cannot be attributed to a single factor.</p><p>Thus, the high mutation rate of C29095U could be more accurately estimated by considering DMS reactivity than basepairing alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) since it is in the 99th percentile of DMS activity for positions with synonymous C→U substitutions. No major difference in this trend was observed across the SARS-CoV-2 genome. As a first-order approximation, two constants were calculated to equalize median mutational fitness for synonymous substitutions at basepaired, unpaired, and all positions. An ‘adjusted mutational fitness’ can then be calculated for C→U substitutions by incrementing mutational fitness by +0.32 at basepaired position and by -1.13 at unpaired positions (results were similar when considering fourfold degenerate positions rather than all synonymous substitutions). Scatter plots compare DMS reactivity to estimated mutational fitness at positions with nonsynonymous C→U substitutions before and after applying this coarse adjustment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, left and right).</p><p>This adjustment equalizes median mutational fitness for synonymous C→U substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), and remaining correlation between ‘adjusted mutational fitness’ and DMS reactivity (0.18 [0.13, 0.22]) shows that this coarse adjustment could be improved with more complex analysis. However, a binary model of basepairing alone is sufficient to capture much of the variation in synonymous substitution rates and could be extended to other substitution types with rates depending on substitution types that lack reactivity data.</p><p>For a preliminary estimate of whether nonsynonymous C→U substitutions at basepaired positions are prone to underestimation of mutational fitness, I tested the hypothesis that C→U having highly ranked fitness at basepaired positions would be mutations that characterize significant SARS-CoV-2 lineages (arbitrarily defined as having 5% prevalence in the 1-week average of global sequences on the CoV-Spectrum website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2022</xref>] at any time during the pandemic). This was the case for 6 of the top 15 C→U substitutions at basepaired positions; their encoded mutations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Top-ranked mutations characterize Omicron lineages BA.1, one of the first recognized recombinant lineages XB, Gamma P.1, and lineage JN.1.7, which had over 20% global prevalence in spring 2024. Half of these mutations have relatively high DMS reactivity for basepaired positions and half have very low DMS reactivity. By comparison, the synonymous substitution C29095U at an unpaired position has very high estimated mutational fitness and DMS reactivity. Despite having a higher median estimated mutational fitness (1.41 vs 1.10), only 3 of the top 15 nonsynonymous C→U at unpaired positions define major lineages (BQ.1.1, JN.1.8.1, and BA.2.86.1).</p><p>Of particular note is C22227T at a basepaired position encoding the spike A222V mutation. This was one of the mutations that characterized the B.1.177 lineage. This lineage, also known as EU1, characterized a majority of sequences in Spain in summer 2020 and eventually in several other countries in Europe prior to the emergence of the Alpha variant. However, it was unclear whether this lineage had higher fitness than other lineages or if A222V specifically conferred a fitness advantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hodcroft et al., 2021</xref>). Further investigation as well as its recurrence in the major Delta sublineage AY.4.2 provided additional evidence of an increase in viral fitness and suggested molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ginex et al., 2022</xref>). Here, I focus on C→U substitutions for comparison to DMS reactivity data, but I also note that top-ranked G→U substitutions at basepaired positions are rich in mutations to ORF3a and also include mutations that characterize variants of concern, such as nucleocapsid D377Y in Delta. Lastly, note that, following the coarse adjustment for basepairing inferred from synonymous substitutions, nonsynonymous C→U substitutions characterizing major variants now have some of the highest estimated mutational fitness for C→U substitutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, right).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This analysis shows that it is informative to combine apparent viral fitness, inferred from millions of patient SARS-CoV-2 sequences published during the pandemic, with accurate secondary structure measurements. It is important to remember that apparent ‘mutational fitness’ results from a combination of the rates at which diversity is generated and the subsequent selection processes. Importantly, genome secondary structure can impact both. However, even the unprecedented density of sampling SARS-CoV-2 genomes has been insufficient to reliably infer fitness impacts of single mutations more directly from dynamics subsequent to occurrences in the SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Neher, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Richard et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Further investigation into phenomena reported here, such as the lack of apparent secondary structure dependence for A→G and G→A substitutions, could inform investigation of underlying mutation and selection mechanisms. An analysis focused on basepairing dependence of C→U substitution frequencies considered that this may be driven by conservation of secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gout et al., 2024</xref>). However, the lack of basepairing dependence for A→G and G→A substitutions supports the hypothesis that this effect, on average, arises from differences in chemical reaction rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Nonetheless, future analyses could consider whether substitution rates have different basepairing dependencies in regions in which synonymous mutations exhibit fitness reductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Neher, 2023</xref>). The extents of enzymatic and non-enzymatic mutation processes driving differences in substitution rates remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Simmonds, 2024</xref>). Comparing the degree to which rates depend on secondary structure could provide insight to support different mutation mechanisms. A recent in vitro study suggested that oxidation of guanine can give rise to G→U substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akagawa et al., 2024</xref>), which, like C→U substitutions, are both very common in human SARS-CoV-2 infections and exhibit strong basepairing dependence.</p><p>I suggest that secondary structure, along with other data correlating with substitution frequency, can be used to refine estimates of mutational fitness both for future SARS-CoV-2 variants and for other viruses. More sophisticated analysis can incorporate structural heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lan et al., 2022</xref>) as well as local sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lamb et al., 2024</xref>).<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows how the coarse adjustment described in this article does not capture all information available in DMS reactivity data, and DMS interrogates adenine and cytosine basepairing while SHAPE reagents can be used to investigate backbone flexibility for all nucleotides. Clearly, datasets from different experiments using different chemical probes can be combined to produce more accurate estimates of apparent mutational fitness. Furthermore, additional measurements of secondary structure for genomes of new variants or modeling may reveal significant changes to secondary structure since 2020. This could be evident in in vitro substitution rates for different SARS-CoV-2 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gout et al., 2024</xref>). Lastly, secondary structures determined from in vitro chemical probing experiments may differ from secondary structures in vivo. For the spike protein, the correlation between estimated mutational fitness and pseudovirus entry quantified by deep mutational scanning serves as one metric that can be used to optimize models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lamb et al., 2024</xref>). However, it is critical to evaluate uncertainty in any model estimating fitness of a new variant. Initial estimates can be refined by rapid in vitro characterization and continued genomic surveillance, helping shed light on which mutations contribute to viral fitness for potential variants of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carabelli et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The data compared in this study consisted of estimated mutational fitness for the SARS-CoV-2 genome as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Neher, 2023</xref> (supplementary data: <monospace>ntmut_fitness_all.csv</monospace>; November 2024 dataset) as well as population-averaged DMS reactivities for SARS-CoV-2-infected Huh7 cells and the corresponding secondary structure model reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lan et al., 2022</xref> (supplementary data 7 and 8). Two other secondary structure models based upon SHAPE reactivity data were also used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huston et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Manfredonia et al., 2020</xref>). Note that the estimated mutational fitness is logarithmically related to the ratio of the observed and expected number of occurrences of a nucleotide substitution, with large and asymmetric differences in the frequencies of different types of synonymous substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Maio et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, note that DMS data was obtained in experiments using the WA1 strain in Lineage A, which differs from the more common Lineage B at three positions and could have different secondary structure. Furthermore, mutational fitness is estimated from the phylogenetic tree of published sequences (the public UShER tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Turakhia et al., 2021</xref>] additionally curated to filter likely artifacts such as branches with numerous reversions) that are typically far more divergent and subsequently will have somewhat different secondary structures. Since the dataset used for mutational fitness aggregates data across viral clades, my analysis will not capture secondary structure variation between clades or indels and masked sites that were not considered in that analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bloom and Neher, 2023</xref>). I focused on the most common types of nucleotide substitutions: those comprising approximately 5% or more of total substitutions.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98102-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data analyzed in this manuscript and a Python notebook to reproduce analysis and figures in this manuscript are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/smmlab/SARS2-fitness-secondary-structure">https://github.com/smmlab/SARS2-fitness-secondary-structure</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">smmlab, 2024</xref>).

I found that the 5′ context of unpaired, but not paired basepairs influences apparent mutational fitness (preference for 5′ U), and that the is also . Additionally, there is a 3′ preference for G, indicating some CpG suppression. This contrasts to some degree with another analysis based on counting lineage frequencies that may have lacked power to detect relatively small effects (Simmonds <italic>mBio</italic> 2024).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1 Author recommendations:</bold></p><p>There are at least 5 publications describing the mapping/prediction of SARS-CoV-2 RNA secondary structure from 2022-2023 and their predictions are not entirely consistent. Why did the authors only refer to the Lan et al. paper?</p></disp-quote><p>I have added comparisons when the Lan et al secondary structure model is replaced by one of two others derived from SHAPE data (Results lines 110–122). Unsurprisingly, similar secondary structure models give similar results and performance is modestly higher for the models from Lan <italic>et al</italic>. This is consistent with their observations that DMS reactivities performed better as classifiers of SL5 and ORF1 secondary structure (the reason I compared to this secondary structure model and reactivity data set rather than others), but I did not go into detail on this in the revision since there are many differences in methods beyond class of reactivity probe. For example, somewhat stronger correlation for the Vero than the Huh7 dataset in Lan <italic>et al</italic> could arise from combining data from two replicates, from cell type, or from differences in data analysis methods. It’s also a small difference and cannot be confidently distinguished from noise.</p><p>I conducted a preliminary comparison of the performance of DMS and SHAPE data for predicting mutations where DMS data is available, but I opted against including this analysis in the manuscript for the same reasons. Instead, I included in results and discussion comments on how, in general, reactivity data contains information that is predictive of substitution rates that is not captured by binary secondary structure models. I also discuss how multiple data sources can potentially be integrated to more accurately predict the impact of a substitution on fitness (Discussion lines 195–201).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific substitutions are referred to as C-&gt;T and C29085T for example, but as the genome of SARS-CoV-2 is RNA, and T should be a U.</p></disp-quote><p>I agree and I have changed all “T” to “U” in the paper and analysis scripts. The choice of “T” was motivated by what seemed to appear most frequently in papers on SARS-CoV-2 mutational spectra, but “U” is nearly universal in papers on secondary structure and mutation mechanisms, so I agree it makes more sense in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The C29085T substitution is somewhat non-canonical as it is a single base bulge in a longer duplex section of dsRNA, very unlike the favoured sites for mutation in the Nakata et al paper.</p></disp-quote><p>I have added a discussion of Nakata <italic>et al</italic> (NAR 2023) (Introduction lines 29–32). I did not go into this depth in the revision, but the analysis of ~2M patient sequences in Nakata <italic>et al</italic> also noted a high rate of UUC→UUU substitution, so the UUUC context of C29095 (shared by 3 of the 10 positions highlighted in Nakata <italic>et al</italic> that had high mutation frequencies with exogenous APOBEC3A expression) could be interesting to investigate further.</p><p>High C29095U substitution frequency is indeed somewhat at odds with the results in that work, which found that UC→UU substitutions to be elevated in longer single-stranded regions than the context of C29095U in SARS-CoV-2 secondary structure models (a single unpaired base opposing three unpaired bases in an asymmetric internal loop).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm not sure why DMS reactivity is considered a separate variable from pairing likelihood as one informs the other.</p></disp-quote><p>The intent here, which was not clear, was to show that a binary basepairing model that uses DMS reactivities as constraints does not capture all of the information available. I have clarified this in as described above discussing information in different reactivy datasets.</p><p>The C29095U substitution is also relavent to the consideration of DMS reactivity in addition to the resulting secondary structure model. These are not considered as separate predictors and the reason for showing both is mentioned in the paper: “DMS reactivity was more strongly correlated with estimated mutational fitness than basepairing when analysis was limited to positions with detectable DMS reactivity.” I have clarified this in the revised manuscript and also it is relevant to the discussion of a potential model integrating all available datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2 Public Review:</bold></p><p>Hensel investigated the implications of SARS-CoV-2 RNA secondary structure in synonymous and nonsynonymous mutation frequency.

My intent is to propose an improved, but still likely incorrect, estimate by utilizing in vitro data to refine baseline mutation rates in order to obtain improved, but only coarsely adjusted, estimates of mutational fitness. I added a note in the discussion that in vitro reactivities (and, consequently, secondary structure models) may not reflect secondary structures in vivo (Discussion lines 204–205). I did not go into detail regarding the specific technical considerations mentioned here because they are outside the scope of my expertise.</p><p>I am not sure that top-ranked non-synonymous C→U positions have particularly high DMS values after coarse adjustment for basepairing (labeled amino acid mutations in Figure 2). Of the six common mutations used as examples, three have minimum values in the dataset considered (which is processed normalized/filtered data rather than raw data) and three do not have very high DMS reactivity.</p><p>However, there is clearly information in base reactivity that is not captured by a binary basepairing model, which is indicated by residual positive correlation between DMS reactivity and mutational fitness after adjustment. I now include a figure demonstrating this for synonymous C→U substitutions as Figure S3, and I have tried to clarify the language throughout the manuscript to make it clear that a more accurate adjustment is possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, like all such RNA probing experiments within cells, it remains difficult to deconvolve DMS/SHAPE low reactivity with RNA accessibility (e.g. from protein binding).</p></disp-quote><p>I agree, and in revising this manuscript it was interesting to see that Nakata <italic>et al</italic> (discussed above) identified relatively large single-stranded regions with enhanced UC→UU substitution frequencies with exogenous APOBEC3A expression, while C29095U, for example, is a single unpaired base with high DMS reactivity and high empirical C→U substitution frequency (discussed briefly in the introduction of the revised manuscript). Future analyses could consider heterogeneity in secondary structure as well as secondary structures with low heterogeneity where strained conformations could have higher reactivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This work presents clear methods and an easy-to-access bioinformatic pipeline, which can be applied to other RNA viruses.

Since a result of the paper is that secondary structure correlates with synonymous substitution rates, this is an observation that can be used to retrospectively compare the quality of secondary structure models in this respect. I updated the manuscript to include such a comparison, and did not find a large difference between secondary structure models (Results lines 110–122). I added a discussion of how multiple data sources can potentially be integrated to more accurately predict the impact of a substitution of viral fitness.</p><p>I have also added a brief discussion of constraints on how much we can confidently infer from these experiments given limitations of the experimental approach. I note that DMS and SHAPE data provide information that can be combined to make a stronger model, and that predictions can be rapidly tested given observations by Gout (Symonds?) et al that in vitro substitution rates correlate with those observed during the pandemic (Discussion lines 195–201).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mutational fitness from Bloom &amp; Neher was derived throughout the pandemic, much of which came from a period with the most active surveillance (Delta / Omicron waves).

This lineage, also known as EU1, characterized a majority of sequences in Spain in summer 2020 and eventually in several other countries in Europe prior to the emergence of the Alpha variant.
