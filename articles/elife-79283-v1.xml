Fascin is also overexpressed in most solid tumours where it supports invasion through control of F-actin structures at the periphery and nuclear envelope. Recently, fascin has been identified in the nucleus of a broad range of cell types but the contributions of nuclear fascin to cancer cell behaviour remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that fascin bundles F-actin within the nucleus to support chromatin organisation and efficient DDR. Fascin associates directly with phosphorylated Histone H3 leading to regulated levels of nuclear fascin to support these phenotypes. Forcing nuclear fascin accumulation through the expression of nuclear-targeted fascin-specific nanobodies or inhibition of Histone H3 kinases results in enhanced and sustained nuclear F-actin bundling leading to reduced invasion, viability, and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis. These findings represent an additional important route through which fascin can support tumourigenesis and provide insight into potential pathways for targeted fascin-dependent cancer cell killing.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fascin</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>nucleus</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R008264/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parsons</surname><given-names>Maddy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C7893/A31530</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parsons</surname><given-names>Maddy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nuclear fascin accumulation occurs upon inhibition of Histone H3 kinases and results in enhanced and sustained nuclear F-actin bundling leading to reduced cancer cell invasion, viability, and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fascin is an F-actin-binding protein that promotes the parallel bundling of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vignjevic et al., 2006a</xref>). These actin bundles can take the form of filopodia (extending beyond the plasma membrane), or microspikes (within lamellae of migrating cells or neuronal growth cones) and are involved in numerous biological processes and pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wood and Martin, 2002</xref>), including promoting cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams, 2004</xref>) and during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zanet et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, fascin expression is very low or absent in normal adult epithelia, and a dramatic up-regulation at both gene and protein levels has been reported in the majority of human carcinomas studied to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hashimoto et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, fascin is emerging as a key prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for metastatic disease. The migration and invasion of carcinoma cells are highly coordinated processes that depend largely on both alterations to cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion and to the signalling events responsible for organisation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo and Giancotti, 2004</xref>). Cancer cells migrating in 3D ECM and in tissue assemble membrane protrusions and ECM-degrading adhesions termed invadopodia to enable tunnelling through matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Condeelis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedl and Wolf, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Across a range of cell types, loss of fascin function results in reduced migration and invasion in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hashimoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jayo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zanet et al., 2012</xref>). Fascin control of filopodia is in part coordinated spatially by formins that nucleate assembly of F-actin structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfisterer et al., 2020</xref>). Fascin expression promotes increased cytoskeletal dynamics, migratory capacity, and thereby the potential for metastasis.</p><p>Fascin is made up of four β-trefoil (βt) repeats separated by short flexible linker regions. Biochemical and modelling data have identified N- and C-terminal actin-binding sites in fascin that enable efficient bundling activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jansen et al., 2011</xref>). We and other groups have previously demonstrated that protein kinase C (α/γ) phosphorylates the highly conserved S39 site within βt1 of fascin and this negatively regulates actin bundling, cell protrusion assembly, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anilkumar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hashimoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parsons and Adams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vignjevic et al., 2006b</xref>). We also identified S274 as a second conserved phosphorylated site that lies within the C-terminal actin-binding site that contributes to actin bundling and plays an additional role in the control of microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Villari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zanet et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that fascin is localised to the nuclear envelope (NE) where it binds directly to the nucleo-cytoplasmic linker protein nesprin-2 and regulates nuclear plasticity leading to enhanced cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jayo et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, we have demonstrated that fascin is located within the nucleus where it can bundle F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groen et al., 2015</xref>), but the role for nuclear-localised fascin and the potential impact on cancer cell behaviour remain unknown. Moreover, the general and distinct mechanisms that control these dynamic changes in fascin-binding partners, localisation, and function remain poorly understood.</p><p>The nucleus contains high levels of actin, both monomeric and filamentous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pederson, 2008</xref>), with actin filaments being shorter in length than those found in the cytoplasm. Our data have shown that fascin is required for endogenous nuclear actin bundles to form, and depletion of fascin from <italic>Drosophila</italic> nurse cells increases the size and number of nucleoli, suggesting a role in maintaining nuclear actin organisation and compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groen et al., 2015</xref>). Several other actin-binding proteins, whose functions have been extensively investigated in the cytoplasm, are also present in the nucleus, including cofilin (suggested to be important for actin monomer import and accumulation in the nucleus) and profilin (partly responsible for actin nuclear export; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Falahzadeh et al., 2015</xref>). Transient actin filaments, detected in nuclei upon serum stimulation or cell spreading, are reported to regulate MAL (MRTF or MKL1) transcription factor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Plessner et al., 2015</xref>). However, their effects on general transcription and chromatin remodelling are poorly understood. As high amounts of fascin are only present in certain stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> follicle development and in growing human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groen et al., 2015</xref>), it is plausible that fascin import and export into and out of the nucleus is also tightly regulated depending on cell cycle, stress, or environmental influences. Thus, the identification of regulatory signals controlling dynamic movement of fascin within different subcellular compartments represents an important and unexplored area that may lead to new therapeutic avenues in cancer treatment.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate that fascin is actively transported into the nucleus where it supports post-mitotic F-actin bundling, efficient DNA damage response (DDR), and cancer cell survival. Using high-content phenotypic imaging, we identify key upstream regulatory pathways that promote nuclear fascin and F-actin levels and demonstrate that forcing sustained nuclear fascin reduces cell invasion and promotes apoptosis. We further uncover roles for upstream kinases controlling Histone H3 phosphorylation in mediating fascin-dependent nuclear-DNA tethering and in controlling subsequent apoptotic responses. Our findings highlight the importance of dynamic nuclear fascin recruitment for tumour cell survival and provide new targets to explore for targeted cancer cell killing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nuclear fascin contributes to efficient nuclear F-actin bundling</title><p>We have previously reported that fascin is localised to the nucleus in a range of cell types in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Groen et al., 2015</xref>). We further verified localisation of endogenous fascin to the nucleus in two human cancer cell lines, HeLa and MDA-MB-231 (used throughout this study), and validated specificity of staining using stable fascin knockdown (KD) cells in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then analysed the sequence of fascin to determine whether any potential nuclear localisation (NLS) or nuclear export signal (NES) sequences existed that may mediate this nuclear transport. Our in silico analysis identified putative bipartite NLS and NES sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We mutated these sequences and performed biochemical fractionation analysis that demonstrated a clear nuclear accumulation of the NES mutant but not the NLS mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), indicating that fascin is actively transported into and out of the nucleus. Moreover, treatment of cells with leptomycin B, which inhibits nuclear export through blocking exportin 1, also resulted in accumulation of nuclear fascin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). It is notable that another group have identified the same NLS in fascin but suggested that removal of this sequence did not alter F-actin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saad et al., 2016</xref>). In our hands, however, deletion or mutation of any of the NLS residues led to loss of F-actin binding (not shown), which is perhaps unsurprising given the very close proximity to the crucial S39 residue required for actin bundling. While this proximity to S39 is interesting in terms of fascin regulation, we chose not to use the NLS mutants for further functional analysis due to our concerns regarding loss of function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear fascin contributes to F-actin bundling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative western blot of fascin knockdown (KD) HeLa cells expressing specified GFP-fascin constructs subjected to biochemical fractionation.

Images demonstrated a striking loss of endogenous nuclear F-actin in fascin-depleted cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We next sought to determine whether nuclear fascin induces nuclear F-actin bundles. Expression of actin fused to an NLS and FLAG epitope tag (actin-NLS) revealed long, crosslinked F-actin bundles decorated with endogenous fascin in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, GFP-fascin expressed in fascin KD HeLa cells also colocalised with nuclear actin-NLS-tagged filaments and assembly of these filaments was markedly reduced in fascin KD cells within the same field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Further confirmation of the requirement for fascin-dependent nuclear F-actin assembly was demonstrated by data showing that S39A fascin, which constitutively bundles F-actin, could induce nuclear F-actin bundles, but the non-bundling mutant S39D could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ratios of WT, S39A, and S39D fascin in nuclear vs. cytoplasmic fractions were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), indicating the differences in nuclear F-actin assembly were not due to variation in nuclear abundance of these proteins. These data demonstrate that fascin is required for efficient nuclear F-actin bundling and this activity requires the N-terminal actin-binding site.</p><p>We next assessed how fascin contributed to dynamic assembly of nuclear F-actin. Previous studies have shown nuclear F-actin assembles in nuclei in re-spreading, post-mitotic cells to support nuclear expansion in early G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baarlink et al., 2017</xref>). To assess whether fascin play a role in this process, we expressed a nanobody that recognises F-actin tagged with both an NLS and iRFP (iRFP-nAC) in HeLa cells stably depleted of fascin and re-expressing GFP-fascin or GFP only. Live imaging of GFP-fascin cells identified that fascin transiently localised to the nucleus following cytokinesis. In agreement with previous reports, nuclear F-actin was also found to transiently assemble post-mitosis in these cells. However, F-actin assembly was visibly impaired in fascin-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Quantification confirmed a significant reduction in the duration of nuclear F-actin assembly post-mitosis in fascin KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To quantify F-actin structure, we developed an automated analysis pipeline that enables segmentation and analysis of the structure of nuclear F-actin marked by iRFP-nAC. Higher values from this automated analysis indicate more highly organised and contiguous nuclear F-actin; lower values indicate short or no nuclear actin filaments. Quantification of iRFP-nAC from post-mitotic cells revealed a significant reduction in nuclear F-actin organisation in fascin-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This data collectively demonstrates a requirement for nuclear fascin to support efficient nuclear F-actin assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Nuclear fascin directly associates with Histone H3</title><p>To explore potential nuclear fascin-binding partners other than F-actin, we adapted previously characterised fascin-specific GFP- or mCherry-tagged expressible nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van Audenhove et al., 2014</xref>) by inserting NLS or NES sequences, which enabled movement of endogenous fascin to the nucleus or cytoplasm, respectively. GFP or mCherry alone and GFP- or mCherry-fascin nanobody (Nb2) were used as controls. Notably, Nb2 has previously been shown not to affect fascin function when expressed in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Van Audenhove et al., 2014</xref>). We verified successful expression and expected relocation of endogenous fascin in cells expressing NLS and NES mCherry-Nb2 plasmids, with no change seen in endogenous fascin localisation in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Biochemical fractionation experiments further confirmed the enrichment of nuclear fascin in cells expressing Nb2-NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Cells expressing GFP-Nb2 plasmids were subjected to GFP-Trap to immunoprecipitate Nb2, and selected associated complexes were then identified by proteomic analysis. The resulting data were analysed and prioritised based on those hits with highest numbers of unique peptides identified in Nb2-NLS but not Nb2-NES complexes. Data revealed actin as the top hit across all Nb2 samples, with Histones H3 and H4 the most highly represented proteins in the Nb2-NLS samples only (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). We chose to pursue Histone H3 for further validation to determine whether this protein is a nuclear-binding partner for fascin. Repeat GFP-Trap experiments verified the association of Histone H3 with Nb2-NLS but not Nb2-NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata3">Figure 2—source data 3</xref>) and co-staining of cells for endogenous proteins revealed partial colocalisation within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To determine whether the fascin-Histone H3 association was direct, we co-expressed GFP-Histone H3 and mCherry-Nb2-NLS in cells and analysed binding using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). A range of FRET efficiencies were seen within a population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>), demonstrating that fascin and Histone H3 can directly associate and suggesting Histone H3 may act as a nuclear tether for fascin, contributing to fascin-dependent functions within this compartment. To further explore the relationship between fascin-F-actin bundling and fascin-Histone H3 binding, we co-expressed RFP-WT, S39A, and S39D fascin with GFP-Nb2-NLS followed by GFP-Trap to enrich for nuclear fascin species. Subsequent probing of these complexes revealed a loss of Histone H3 binding to S39A fascin compared to WT or S39D fascin, indicating that fascin-dependent F-actin bundling reduces the interaction of fascin with Histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata4">Figure 2—source data 4</xref>). Taken together these findings demonstrate that nuclear fascin binds to Histone H3 when not associated with F-actin and suggests a dynamic exchange of fascin within the nucleus that may act to coordinate nuclear organisation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Nuclear fascin directly associates with Histone H3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal images of fascin knockdown (KD) MDA-MB-231 cells expressing GFP-fascin (green) and specified mCherry-Nb2 constructs (magenta) fixed and stained with DAPI (blue).

To determine whether nuclear fascin contributed to these functions, fascin KD HeLa cells expressing GFP or GFP-fascin were treated with neocarzinostatin (NCS), an ionising radiation mimetic, to directly induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), and levels of the key DDR factor γH2AX were then analysed by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, as we also demonstrated that forced and sustained nuclear fascin can selectively drive apoptosis, we reasoned that identification of pathways that can control nuclear fascin may provide a foundation for therapies directed at tumour cell killing. To explore the pathways controlling nuclear fascin, we performed unbiased, imaging-based high-content phenotypic screening using fascin KD cells expressing mScarlet-fascin and the iRFP-nAC nuclear F-actin probe. Cells were treated with a library of ~13,000 annotated compounds, targeting multiple signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Parafati et al., 2020</xref>), at a single concentration (5 µm) or neutral or positive (leptomycin B) controls for 24 hr, followed by fixation and imaging using high-content spinning disk confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Resulting data were analysed using automated pipelines to define levels of nuclear fascin normalised to neutral and positive controls. The mean RZ’ of the neutral and positive controls in this screen was 0.5017, indicating excellent assay robustness. This approach identified compounds with a range of activities including those that increased or decreased nuclear fascin relative to the neutral controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> for full dataset).

Following quality control checks (e.g., to exclude images with very few cells), 231 compounds were identified as hits. These compounds were taken forward for a repeat screen using the same cells to generate dose-response curves for each hit and control for any off-target or false positive findings. Data were analysed as for the primary screen (mean RZ’=0.5607) and nuclear fascin plotted as a function of compound concentration to identify AC50 values for each compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref> for full dataset).

The most highly represented pathways that were targeted by these compounds were cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK).

Treatment of cells with these three inhibitors revealed a total loss of pT3-Histone H3 phosphorylation in cells treated with haspin inhibitor for 4 hr and a reduction following treatment with IRAK4 inhibitor for 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). CDK2 inhibition after 4 hr did not appear to directly alter Histone H3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). To determine whether these effects led to altered fascin-Histone H3 association, we performed GFP-Trap analysis of GFP-Nb2-NLS (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) following treatment with each inhibitor and probed for Histone H3. Data revealed a striking reduction in fascin-Histone H3 association in cells treated with both IRAK4 and haspin inhibitors, but not with the CDK2 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata4">Figure 7—source data 4</xref>). Analysis of immunoprecipitated GFP-fascin showed no change in fascin phosphorylation upon treatment with these inhibitors, suggesting these kinases do not act directly to post-translationally modify fascin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata4">Figure 7—source data 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7s1sdata1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). Further analysis revealed partial colocalisation between nuclear fascin and pT3-Histone H3 in untreated cells, coincident with assembly of nuclear F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). To explore the relationship between fascin, nuclear F-actin, and Histone H3 upon haspin inhibition, cells co-expressing GFP-Histone H3, iRFP-nAC, and mScarlet-fascin were subjected to confocal time-lapse imaging in the presence or absence of haspin inhibitor. Haspin inhibition caused increased nuclear fascin, coupled with a strong induction of nuclear F-actin assembly that resulted in reorganisation of Histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Treatment of control cells with haspin inhibitor also resulted in increased DDR as evidenced by γH2AX induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>), which correlated significantly with nuclear fascin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). These data collectively demonstrate that phosphorylation of Histone H3 promotes Histone H3-fascin binding and that a dynamic cycle of pT3-Histone H3 is required for fascin nuclear transport and efficient DDR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Fascin has been widely studied as an important regulator of F-actin bundling leading to enhanced filopodia assembly and invasion in cancer cells. Our study provides insight into a new role for fascin in bundling F-actin within the nucleus to support chromatin organisation and efficient DDR, representing additional important routes through which fascin can support tumourigenesis. We reveal that fascin associates directly with phosphorylated Histone H3 leading to regulated levels of nuclear fascin to support these phenotypes. Forcing nuclear fascin accumulation through the expression of nuclear-targeted fascin-specific nanobodies or inhibition of kinases that promote Histone H3 phosphorylation results in enhanced and sustained F-actin bundling leading to reduced invasion, viability, and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis.</p><p>We found that fascin bundles F-actin in the nucleus. Fascin therefore joins several other actin-associated proteins, including cofilin and profilin, that have been shown to localise to the nucleus and regulate nuclear F-actin assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caridi et al., 2019</xref>). Cofilin is actively imported into the nucleus in complex with actin monomers by importin 9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dopie et al., 2012</xref>), whereas profilin binds to actin during nuclear export by exportin 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stüven et al., 2003</xref>). The exact mechanism through which fascin is imported and exported from the nucleus remains unclear, but we have established that fascin contains an NLS and NES and is blocked from nuclear export by leptomycin B, an inhibitor of exportin 1. Interestingly, our screen for nuclear fascin regulators identified two other exportin 1 inhibitors that also promoted nuclear fascin, selinexor and KPT-276, providing further evidence that exportin 1 may be involved in export of nuclear fascin. However, further studies would be required to verify whether this is a direct or indirect effect. We have previously identified that fascin localises to the NE and binds directly to the NE protein nesprin-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jayo et al., 2016</xref>). It would be of interest to determine whether this interaction serves as a pool of fascin for nuclear import in response to DDR or other external stress, including mechanical triggers. Another NE-associated protein, ATR, has a well-established role in DDR and regulates chromatin compaction in response to mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, ATR has also been recently shown to associate with nesprin at the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kidiyoor et al., 2020</xref>). Examining the potential co-operation between fascin and ATR in mediating DDR would be an interesting avenue to pursue in future studies.</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism through which fascin is imported and exported to the nucleus, temporal regulation is vital to the homeostatic nuclear function of fascin. Following cytokinesis, fascin transiently localises to the nucleus, where it bundles F-actin. Nuclear F-actin has previously been shown to be involved in chromatin decondensation during nuclear expansion in G1, in a process that is terminated by the actin depolymerising protein cofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baarlink et al., 2017</xref>). Given that basal levels of chromatin compaction were elevated in fascin-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), our data indicate that fascin is responsible for initiating F-actin-dependent chromatin decompaction. Following nuclear F-actin assembly, fascin is exported from the nucleus, and the importance of this shuttling is highlighted by our finding that forced and sustained nuclear fascin leads to apoptosis.</p><p>Histone H3 appears to play an important role in the spatiotemporal regulation of nuclear fascin. Fascin has previously been found to colocalise with Histone H3 Lys4 trimethylation by ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saad et al., 2016</xref>) and our data indicate that fascin directly interacts with Histone H3. The association of fascin with Histone H3 appears to be dependent on Histone H3 phosphorylation. It is possible that phosphorylation may alter the conformation of Histone H3 to allow fascin to bind. The binding site of fascin to Histone H3 is unknown, but if Histone H3 binding acts as a scaffold for F-actin bundling by fascin, this would suggest that the binding site on fascin is distinct from the two F-actin bundling sites (S39 and S274). However, we found that inhibition of Histone H3 phosphorylation led to enhanced fascin nuclear accumulation and F-actin assembly, indicating that the bundling of nuclear F-actin by fascin is not necessarily dependent on phospho-Histone H3. It is possible that fascin-dependent F-actin bundling requires an initial scaffold on Histone H3 but becomes disrupted and assembles elsewhere in the nucleus under non-homeostatic conditions. One possibility is that F-actin binding could block access to the C-terminal NES of fascin resulting in the nuclear retention of fascin and perpetuation of F-actin bundles.</p><p>In addition to regulating chromatin decondensation post-mitosis, nuclear F-actin has also shown by others to reorganise chromatin for effective DDR. We observed that DDR was impaired in fascin KD cells, indicating that the function of F-actin in DDR is dependent on bundling by fascin. Presumably, F-actin must disassemble and fascin be exported from the nucleus upon successful resolution of DNA damage. Hence, if fascin is forced into the nucleus, the resultant perpetuation of nuclear F-actin may prevent DDR from being efficiently resolved. This would likely lead to growth inhibition and cell cycle defects and could explain why nanobodies or inhibitors that target fascin to the nucleus cause cell death.</p><p>Our high-content imaging screen identified pathways that are involved in regulating nuclear fascin accumulation. Haspin inhibition was particularly effective in driving nuclear accumulation of fascin and F-actin and driving fascin-dependent apoptosis. Haspin mediates Histone H3 phosphorylation prior to mitosis in response to activation by cyclin B/CDK1 and has been implicated in tumourigenesis. Haspin is required for chromosomal stability; hence, treatment with the haspin inhibitor CHR-6494 has been identified to induce apoptosis in cancer cells by inducing genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quadri et al., 2022</xref>). Our data suggest that prolonged nuclear accumulation of fascin in response to haspin inhibition may also contribute to these phenotypes.</p><p>Other pathways that we identified to regulate nuclear fascin and F-actin in our high-content imaging screen include cyclins, CDKs, and GSK3. Since we have established that fascin and F-actin transiently accumulate in the nucleus post-mitosis, it is logical to expect that their activities are dynamically controlled by cell cycle regulators such as cyclins and CDKs. However, it is also likely that any inhibitors that induce cell cycle arrest in G1 would also be identified as hits non-specifically, as fascin and F-actin are elevated at this cell cycle stage by default. Further experiments will therefore be required to verify whether these compounds affect fascin directly or indirectly and to establish their exact mechanisms of action.</p><p>The pathways that contribute to nuclear F-actin bundling have previously been shown to involve factors such as GPCRs and calcium signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to the fascin-dependent F-actin bundling pathways that we have described, we also identified multiple other inhibitors that either promoted or inhibited nuclear F-actin bundling. Similarly, although we focussed on targets that promoted nuclear fascin in this study, our screen also identified multiple compounds that inhibited nuclear fascin accumulation. Hence, further studies investigating the mechanism of action of these compounds could shed further light on the pathways that regulate both nuclear fascin and F-actin in the nucleus.</p><p>In summary, our study provides insight into a new role for fascin in controlling nuclear F-actin bundling to support tumour cell viability. Given the broad overexpression of fascin reported in solid tumours, this molecule is an interesting therapeutic target but has yet to be convincingly blocked directly using small molecules or other modalities. We propose that promoting fascin nuclear accumulation using targeted inhibitors such as those against haspin or IRAK4 may provide means to drive nuclear F-actin accumulation in these cells and initiate apoptosis. This would provide an alternative, albeit less direct, approach to target fascin function both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and suppress invasion while simultaneously driving nuclear F-actin accumulation, and thereby prevent tumour growth and metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following antibodies were used: fascin (55K2; MAB3582), FLAG (M2; F3165), GFP (11814460001), and pT3 Histone H3 (07-424) were from Merck; Actin (ab6276) and Lamin A/C (ab8984) were from Abcam; Histone H3 (2128A; MAB9448) and ɣH2AX (NB100-384) were from Novus; cleaved Caspase-3 (5A1E; 9664) and pS10 Histone H3 (9701) were from Cell Signaling Technology; GAPDH (6C5; GTX28245) was from GeneTex; and HSC70 (sc-7298) was from Santa Cruz.

Nuclear actin structures were analysed using a custom MATLAB script with the aim quantifying the degree to which nuclear actin was organised in filaments as opposed to more diffuse aggregate structures. Individual nuclei were selected from the fluorescence image by a rectangular ROI. For each cropped ROI the background level was estimated by histogramming the pixel intensities and finding the turning point. Pixel intensities below this threshold were judged to be background and set to zero. The foreground structure was then identified by a process of constrained grey-scale erosion. A 3×3 kernel was rastered through the image identifying the lowest intensity non-zero pixel which was then removed (set to zero) provided it wound not result in fewer than 3 remaining non-zero pixels in a constrained positional relationship in the 3×3 region. The process was repeated several times until no further removal of foreground pixels was possible without breaking this condition. The positional constraint enabled the removal of one more pixel from the foreground in the 3×3 patch if the three formed an angle of less than 90° including the centre pixel, this biases the detection of foreground to more linear structures such as fibres over sparse clusters. The resultant image was then binarised and subjected to one round of dilation and erosion (morphological closing) representing the extracted foreground structure. The degree to which the foreground consisted of linear fibres was parameterised by measuring the proportion of foreground pixels removed by a subsequent skeletonisation operation. The more the foreground was made of linear structures, the lower the proportion removed by this operation.

Otherwise, data not following normal distributions were analysed with non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test. Correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) was performed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis in GraphPad Prism (used to interpret the confidence interval of r and the p value testing the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the two variables and any correlation observed is a consequence of random sampling).

authors concluding that it contributes to multiple aspects of cancer cell regulation and behaviour. The authors used a combination of methodologies, including biochemistry, excellent cell and actin imaging, controlled nanobody-mediated targeting of fascin to the nucleus (when endogenous fascin has been suppressed), proteomics, cancer cell biological assays, and high-content phenotypic screening to identify potential regulators, and function, of nuclear fascin, and the consequences of maintaining too high levels of fascin in the nucleus. Fascin is an important protein in cancer cell behaviour, and this work provides novel information on dynamic active transport in and out of the nucleus, on its role in nuclear actin bundling, its binding to histone-H3, and its contribution to the DNA damage response (DDR; monitored by gammaH2AX foci accumulation), chromatin compaction, cell migration, and cancer cell invasion in an in vitro assay; moreover, dynamic regulation of nuclear fascin is important because too much triggers apoptosis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79283.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Frame</surname><given-names>Margaret C</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01nrxwf90</institution-id><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Frame</surname><given-names>Margaret C</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01nrxwf90</institution-id><institution>University of Edinburgh</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bakal</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043jzw605</institution-id><institution>Institute of Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Byron</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/027m9bs27</institution-id><institution>University of Manchester</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.17.496538">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.17.496538v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Margaret C Frame as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Chris Bakal (Reviewer #2); Adam Byron (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Recommendations for authors:</p><p>We would support publication after improvements as outlined below.</p><p>There are three main areas that would benefit from further data, statistics, and clarifications.</p><p>Can additional controls be provided to demonstrate evidence for direct interaction between Histone H3 and fascin using FRET? Minimally quantification of each fluor (GFP, cherry) when co-expressed and when individually expressed (to account for bleed through), a positive control, and negative control. Would a useful negative control to include for the FRET in Figure 2F be the mCh-Nb2-NES?</p><p>The role of fascin in the DDR warrants further exploration. Given the obvious variability in the data, are box and whisker plots the most appropriate (see specific points to authors, point 5)? Could the use of additional damaging agents, reporters, and live cell assays be considered to help in figuring out the role of fascin in the DDR?</p><p>Can the authors provide further validation of the mechanistic hypothesis that Haspin is promoting fascin-dependent nuclear actin polymerization, DNA damage, and decreased viability via effects on histone H3? Could the authors show clearer images of fascin relocalisation and actin polymerization? Are there experiments that could causally link nuclear fascin and actin to induction of DNA damage and/or demonstrate a role for histone H3 in this? What is being quantified in Figures 7G and H? Is this recruitment of γH2X to nuclear foci (under conditions of no other nuclear damaging agent)?</p><p>Details of analyses to include and consider:</p><p>1. The quantification of nuclear F-actin fibre organisation (Figure 1E) would benefit from some explanation in the Results section. We appreciate this is detailed in the methods section, but a brief high-level description of what is being quantified would help the reader interpret the results.</p><p>2. Could the authors provide some additional reporting information for the proteomics methods?</p><p>a. Version/release of the human database searched.</p><p>b. Variable and fixed modifications used in the database search.</p><p>c. Enzyme specificity and number of permitted missed cleavages set in the database search.</p><p>d. Minimum number of unique peptides specified in the database search.</p><p>e. Number of biological and/or technical replicates conducted.</p><p>f. Any normalisation of the MS data (e.g. to bait).</p><p>g. Any statistical analyses of the MS data performed (e.g. to threshold prioritised hits).</p><p>3. Further annotation/detail would improve the presentation of the MS data in Supplementary Table 1.</p><p>a. From where were the cellular component term headers derived?</p><p>b. What do the final four columns (Z-AC) represent?</p><p>c. Two hidden rows of data (32-33) should be unhidden from the table.</p><p>d. Column A suggests 238 proteins were identified, but only 59 are shown. Ideally, all identified proteins should be presented in a supplementary table, and prioritised hits (based on an appropriate set of criteria) can be presented in another supplementary table.</p><p>e. Protein names (column A) should be separated from the appended database-derived controlled vocabulary to improve clarity.</p><p>f. For discussion of the MS data, was fascin itself identified in the proteomics experiments?</p><p>4. Will the authors deposit the MS data in a suitable repository, such as those in the ProteomeXchange Consortium, to ensure accessibility and reusability of the data?</p><p>5. Some statistical analyses might be clarified.</p><p>a. Can the authors confirm what statistical test was used in Figure 3B?</p><p>b. For Figure 3F, did the authors test for a significant difference between fascin KD and fascin KD + NCS, which is stated to be unchanged in the text?</p><p>c. For experiments with more variable data (e.g. the DDR experiments), the authors should consider presenting charts with individual data points as a violin plot or as a histogram.</p><p>6. Why do the 0-μm images for the collagen invasion assay (Figure 4D) show much higher cell densities for the Nb2-NLS and fascin KD conditions compared to the other conditions? The image stacks look left-shifted for these two conditions. Are these z-stacks correctly positioned, and how was the &quot;starting&quot; slice determined representatively?</p><p>7. For Figure 7H, the correlation is said to be 'significant'. What statistical test was used here?</p><p>8. The final sentence of the legends for Figures1-4 should read min/mix (not &quot;mix/max&quot;).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79283.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for authors:</p><p>We would support publication after improvements as outlined below.</p><p>There are three main areas that would benefit from further data, statistics, and clarifications.</p><p>Can additional controls be provided to demonstrate evidence for direct interaction between Histone H3 and fascin using FRET?

We would like to clarify that we used Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) to measure FRET in our manuscript. FLIM (unlike other ratiometric or sensitised emission techniques) measure the inherent fluorescence lifetime of the donor molecule (in this instance, GFP) and as such, is entirely independent from fluorophore concentrations and is not subject to bleed through. All FRET efficiencies from FLIM datasets are calculated as a function of GFP alone donor lifetime (~2.3ns, an example of which we showed in our original submission Figure 2F). However, as requested we have included two additional control datasets in our revised manuscript: GFP-H3 + mCherry alone and as very helpfully suggested by the reviewers, GFP-H3 + mCh-Nb2-NES. The data from these experiments shows no FRET occurring between either control donor: acceptor pair and is included in Figure 2G of our revised manuscript. This data further supports the conclusions from our experiments that nuclear fascin directly associates with Histone H3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of fascin in the DDR warrants further exploration.

We agree that the precise mechanisms by which fascin-Histone H3 binding and nuclear F-actin lead to DDR regulation are not fully delineated in our study, although we would note that unpicking this entire mechanistic pathway would likely need to be the focus of a separate study. However, we have performed 3 additional sets of experiments to try and further validate our proposed model.</p><p>Firstly, we expressed WT, S39A (constitutive actin bundling) or S39D (non-actin bundling) RFP-fascin in fascin KD cells and co-expressed the fascin GFP-Nb2-NLS nanobody, followed by GFP-Nb2-NLS immunoprecipitation and re-probing for Histone H3. These experiments were designed to test whether nuclear fascin:F-actin binding is mutually exclusive with fascin:Histone H3 binding (as we hypothesise). Indeed, our data demonstrate that nuclear fascin-S39A does not associate with Histone H3, whereas WT and fascin-S39D do, supporting the idea that fascin associates with (likely de-phosphorylated as our other data suggests) Histone H3 when not bound to F-actin. This data is included as Figure 2H of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Secondly, we have performed live imaging experiments of fascin KD cells expressing mScarlet-fascin, GFP-Histone H3 and iRFP-nAC +/- haspin inhibitor to gain further insight into temporal fascin-dependent changes to nuclear F-actin and histone organisation and dependence upon Histone H3 phosphorylation. The resulting data demonstrate that in untreated cells in interphase, nuclear fascin levels are low, nuclear F-actin structures are absent or limited and Histone H3 appears as punctate structures (similar to the pHistone H3 images we show in Figure 7F). However, addition of the haspin inhibitor leads to higher nuclear fascin (as we already demonstrated using multiple approaches), highly bundled, stable F-actin structures in the nucleus that appear to result in scaffolding or reorganisation of Histone H3. This data is included as Figure 7G of the revised manuscript. We note that we have spent a considerable amount of time trying to optimise conditions to perform STORM super-resolution imaging of nuclear fascin and actin (along with other targets of interest) to better understand the nature of organisation of these molecules. However, retrieving super-resolved information in multiple channels from nuclear compartments has proven to be exceptionally challenging and whilst we plan to try and overcome the technical hurdles to undertake such analysis, we anticipate this will likely need considerable additional time commitment to achieve.</p><p>Finally, as suggested we have included cisplatin treatment of cells as an alternative mechanistic driver of DDR (and widely used as standard of care chemotherapy in the clinic). The data from these experiments mirror those seen with NCS treatment and further confirms that efficient induction of DDR requires fascin. This data is now included as Figure 3C of our revised manuscript.</p><p>We note we have already performed fixed time course experiments using endogenous markers of DDR to demonstrate a requirement for nuclear fascin in the temporal induction and resolution of damage (shown in Figure 3B). Whilst we appreciate that live imaging of DDR might provide additional insight into this process, published fluorescent reporters of this process largely rely on overexpression which comes with caveats of disturbing the balance of DDR response, likely leading to artefacts (as noted by the field in recent reviews on this matter, e.g.: PMID: 34589495). Given the limited reliable and interpretable tools available for such analysis, and the rather limited additional insight we feel this might bring, we did not feel such experiments would meaningfully add to our current manuscript. As we outline in the discussion, the exact molecular mechanisms driving efficient DDR upon fascin disengagement from Histone H3, and assembly of bundled nuclear F-actin remain undefined. However, given the previous studies indicating a role for F-actin in DDR, and our own data presented here showing that fascin-dependent nuclear F-actin is required for efficient DDR and chromatin organisation, we believe our data supports fascin-dependent nuclear F-actin acting as a scaffold for DDR protein recruitment. Further studies will be required to define how this occurs through precise alterations to (for example) chromatin structure or accessibility.</p><p>We have re-plotted the DDR data in Figure 3B and the FRET data in Figure 3F as violin plots with all datapoints shown as requested (noting DDR data in Figure 7 was already plotted in this way).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is being quantified in Figures 7G and H? Is this recruitment of γH2X to nuclear foci (under conditions of no other nuclear damaging agent)?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise if this was unclear. Figures 7G and 7H (now Figures 7H and 7I, respectively) show levels of γH2AX recruited to nuclear DNA damage foci in cells treated only with DMSO or the Haspin inhibitor (7H) and this data was then plotted as a function of nuclear fascin from those images (7I, nuclear fascin on x-axis and γH2AX on y-axis), showing correlation between nuclear fascin and DDR. The data indicates that inhibition of Haspin leads to increased γH2AX levels (as another recent study has also shown; PMID:31882401) and that this correlates with enhanced retention of nuclear fascin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Details of analyses to include and consider:</p><p>1. The quantification of nuclear F-actin fibre organisation (Figure 1E) would benefit from some explanation in the Results section. We appreciate this is detailed in the methods section, but a brief high-level description of what is being quantified would help the reader interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and have added additional explanation of this analysis approach into the results text for Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Could the authors provide some additional reporting information for the proteomics methods?</p><p>a. Version/release of the human database searched.</p><p>b. Variable and fixed modifications used in the database search.</p><p>c. Enzyme specificity and number of permitted missed cleavages set in the database search.</p><p>d. Minimum number of unique peptides specified in the database search.</p><p>e. Number of biological and/or technical replicates conducted.</p><p>f. Any normalisation of the MS data (e.g. to bait).</p><p>g. Any statistical analyses of the MS data performed (e.g. to threshold prioritised hits).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for these omissions; the information requested in a-e has now been included in the revised Figure 2-Source Data 2 file as a separate tab and referred to in the methods section. We did not perform normalisation (values provided in Supplementary table 1 are unique peptide counts) and we conducted n=2 samples per IP (both datasets provided in the Supp table), so statistical analysis was not possible. However (and see below for further discussion), we would note this was not a full proteome analysis, but (as we describe in the methods section) was rather conducted on excised bands from silver-stained immunoprecipitations where differential levels of proteins were observable between NES and NLS Nb IPs. The experiment was not performed to statistically identify full proteome changes, rather to define indicative targets that were consistently different between NLS and NES samples and thus may represent differential nuclear fascin-binding proteins. Prioritisation was performed on this basis, and we have clarified this point in the revised methods section. Validation of identified targets was used to ascertain specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Further annotation/detail would improve the presentation of the MS data in Supplementary Table 1.</p><p>a. From where were the cellular component term headers derived?</p><p>b. What do the final four columns (Z-AC) represent?</p><p>c. Two hidden rows of data (32-33) should be unhidden from the table.</p><p>d. Column A suggests 238 proteins were identified, but only 59 are shown. Ideally, all identified proteins should be presented in a supplementary table, and prioritised hits (based on an appropriate set of criteria) can be presented in another supplementary table.</p><p>e. Protein names (column A) should be separated from the appended database-derived controlled vocabulary to improve clarity.</p><p>f. For discussion of the MS data, was fascin itself identified in the proteomics experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the missing information requested in points a-d, which is now provided in the revised Figure 2-Source Data 2 file. We have fixed moved protein classifiers to the far right of the spreadsheets to focus on the protein names as suggested. As per our above explanation, fascin was not identified in the datasets as the analysed samples were excised bands from silver-stained gels not the full proteomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Will the authors deposit the MS data in a suitable repository, such as those in the ProteomeXchange Consortium, to ensure accessibility and reusability of the data?</p></disp-quote><p>As per our above explanations, this was not a full proteome analysis and as such, we did not feel that this represents a useful dataset for community re-use given it was performed on selected regions of silver-stained gels. However, as requested, the full dataset is provided in the revised Figure 2-Source Data 2 file (as a separate tab) such that all identified proteins are present.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Some statistical analyses might be clarified.</p><p>a. Can the authors confirm what statistical test was used in Figure 3B?</p><p>b. For Figure 3F, did the authors test for a significant difference between fascin KD and fascin KD + NCS, which is stated to be unchanged in the text?</p><p>c. For experiments with more variable data (e.g. the DDR experiments), the authors should consider presenting charts with individual data points as a violin plot or as a histogram.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies if these points were unclear. Data in Figure 3B were analysed using 2-way ANOVA followed by Dunnet’s multiple comparison test (as stated in the methods section); we present what we deemed to be the most biologically relevant statistics on this graph. We did perform statistical analysis on fascinKD+/-NCS in Figure 3F and found no significant difference as stated in the results text (p=0.1549). We have re-plotted the DDR data in Figure 3B and the FRET data in Figure 3F as violin plots with all datapoints shown as suggested (noting DDR data in Figure 7 was already plotted in this way).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Why do the 0-μm images for the collagen invasion assay (Figure 4D) show much higher cell densities for the Nb2-NLS and fascin KD conditions compared to the other conditions? The image stacks look left-shifted for these two conditions. Are these z-stacks correctly positioned, and how was the &quot;starting&quot; slice determined representatively?</p></disp-quote><p>The 0 mm images for Nb2-NLS and Fascin KD cells do indeed show higher cell densities as these cells invade significantly less than other cells, meaning more cells remain at the base of the inverted invasion assay. As we stated in the methods, the 0 mm images are taken as the first Z-stack at which more than 5 whole nuclei are visible using identical imaging parameters, and all subsequent invasive depth measurements calculated from that point. We have clarified both points (in the results and methods text respectively) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. For Figure 7H, the correlation is said to be 'significant'. What statistical test was used here?</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies for the omission; we used Pearson’s correlation coefficient analysis in GraphPad Prism to test this data, used to interpret the confidence interval of r and the P value testing the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between the two variables and any correlation observed is a consequence of random sampling. We have added this into the methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.
