These vital cellular activities are referred to as “core biological processes” and include energy production, DNA replication, transcription, translation, cell division, and cell wall synthesis, among others. These processes are executed by multiprotein complexes, which require the coordinated action of multiple essential proteins to function properly. In the absence of these proteins, the complexes cannot work, with the consequent loss of cell viability. Therefore, understanding the essential protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is critical to understand how core biological processes are regulated and how they contribute to the cell’s overall function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koonin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carro, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cossar et al., 2020</xref>). By investigating these pathways and their associated proteins, we can gain insight into bacterial growth and survival mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Groot et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gómez Borrego and Torrent Burgas, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Proteomic techniques such as yeast two-hybrid and tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry have identified millions of PPIs. However, the high number of false positives in high-throughput screenings makes the results less reliable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). A useful way to deal with false positives in interatomic data is to consider the three-dimensional structure of proteins, which provides insights into their function and architecture. The scientific community has experimentally determined thousands of protein structures at atomic resolution using X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-EM. However, most protein complexes have not yet been determined. Recently, novel deep-learning models such as AlphaFold2 (AF2) and RosettaFold have outperformed previous methods in predicting protein structures, providing results with similar precision to experimental methods in successful cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baek et al., 2021</xref>). AF2 can fold protein monomers and protein complexes, outperforming standard docking approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we posit that AF2 can effectively differentiate between genuine interactions and false positive cases.</p><p>The topological analysis of pathogen interactomes is a powerful method for exploring the function of interacting proteins, uncovering the evolutionary conservation of protein interactions, or identifying essential hubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Crua Asensio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Macho Rendón et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, developing a complete map of the essential interactome is a powerful strategy to study the functional organization of proteins and to identify new targets for discovering new antibiotics. Here, we used AF2 to predict the Gram-negative and Gram-positive essential interactomes, comprising a total of 1402 interactions, which include the global confidence scores of the binary complexes predicted by AF2. We also discuss how these structures can provide insight into new mechanisms of action and identify intereting PPIs to target for discovering novel antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The average bacterial proteome is composed of ~4000–5000 proteins, which means that the interactome could potentially span around 20 million interactions. Based on recent estimates, there are approximately 12,000 physical interactions in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, which indicates that only about 0.1% of potential interactions may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rajagopala et al., 2014</xref>). However, not all these interactions are expected to be essential for bacterial survival. If we were to selectively disrupt each interaction without impacting any other factors, only a small subset of interactions would likely be classified as essential. How can we identify these essential interactions without the paramount effort of performing all these experiments? We reasoned that a given interaction would only be essential if and only if both proteins forming the complex are essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). While this simple approximation does not give us the exact answer, it does provide an upper bound for the essential interactome.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of essential binary complexes predicted by AlphaFold2 (AF2).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Representation of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) based on their essentiality.

Next, we retrieved all PPIs with experimental evidence (experimental score &gt;0.15) and/or high-confidence PPIs (score &gt;0.7) between these proteins from the STRING database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Szklarczyk et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, we incorporated all of the synthetically lethal interactions identified in <italic>E. coli-K12-BW25113</italic>, as recorded in the Mslar database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhu et al., 2023a</xref>) to capture interactions between non-essential proteins that become essential in combination. We filtered out interactions that include ribosomal subunits and tRNA ligases. Using this pipeline, we modeled 722 unique Gram-negative essential PPIs (involving 216 proteins), 680 essential Gram-positive PPIs (involving 167 proteins), and 28 synthetically lethal PPIs (involving 45 proteins) using AF2-Multimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 2021</xref>). To assess the confidence of the predictions, we used the ipTM scores to classify the models, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mackay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bryant et al., 2022a</xref>). Concurrently, we modeled 722 Gram-negative and 680 Gram-positive negative PPIs, generated by random pairing among the selected proteins, to evaluate the ability of AF2 to distinguish between correct and incorrect models. To define an appropriate ipTM score cutoff, we calculated the cumulative distribution function of the ipTM scores for the selected and random complexes. The analysis revealed a significant difference between the two distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Based on these results, we classified the models into three categories: unlikely (ipTM&lt;0.4), plausible (0.4≤ipTM≥0.6), and high confidence (ipTM&gt;0.6). Of the 722 Gram-negative PPIs, 549 (76.04%) were classified as unlikely, 74 (10.25%) as plausible, and 99 (13.71%) as high accuracy. For the 680 Gram-positive PPIs, 576 (84.70%) were classified as unlikely, 57 (8.48%) as plausible, and 47 (6.91%) as high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). We also validated our predicted models using crosslinking data that were available for 14 complexes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). The distance restraints identified (crosslinked lysines are ~15–20 Å apart) are compatible with our models in 93% of the cases. Hence, despite the limited overlap between the crosslinking datasets and our list of validated interactions, for the complexes that did match, our models were consistent with the experimental data. These findings support the notion that AF2 is capable of distinguishing between incorrect and high-accuracy models, which is consistent with previous observations in other applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mackay et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that many of the essential PPIs retrieved from databases could be false positives, likely due to the high number of false positives found in large-scale screening experiments, which may include indirect interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhu et al., 2023b</xref>). We also compared ipTM scores with both pDockQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akdel et al., 2022</xref>) and pDockQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bryant et al., 2022b</xref>). The correlation between ipTM and pDockQ was low (R=0.328), but a stronger correlation was obtained between ipTM and pDockQ2 (R=0.649, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, some complexes with high ipTM values (&gt;0.8) had minimal pDockQ2 scores, some of them virtually 0. However, these interactions showed improved pDockQ2 scores when modeled alongside accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting a better recall performance for ipTM. We conclude that pDockQ2 is a very accurate but restrictive metric. Therefore, we selected ipTM for assessing predicted interactions. Nonetheless, pDockQ and pDockQ2 scores for all predicted complexes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>.</p><p>To test AF’s predictive capabilities in bacterial complexes, we conducted a thorough validation of 140 bacterial protein-protein complexes from the PDB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This dataset encompasses structures published after the latest release of AF, sharing less than 30% sequence homology with all other complexes in the PDB. According to our criteria (ipTM&gt;0.6), we observed that 81% (113 out of 140) of these structures were accurately predicted by AF2. From all models generated, 83% (116 out of 140) were almost identical to the native structures in terms of correct folding (TM-score&gt;0.8). Most interestingly, 72% (101 out of 140) of the predicted structures were similar in terms of root mean square deviation at the interaction interface (i-RMSD&lt;4 Å) and 56% (79 out of 140) of the interfaces were virtually identical to the real structures (i-RMSD&lt;2 Å), highlighting the excellent prediction power of AF2.</p><p>The interface solvent accessible surface area (SASA) of our selected models showed moderate correlation with the ipTM score, suggesting that larger interfaces were more likely to have better model accuracies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Additionally, we considered the conservation of the interface residues, which is frequently used as a proxy to identify protein-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guharoy and Chakrabarti, 2010</xref>). As expected, the residues in the interface were significantly more conserved than those located at the surface, suggesting that the predicted models are reliable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). We also analyzed the residue types of the interface in high-confidence models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>, 4.5 Å distance cutoff). The most abundant interface residues were involved in electrostatic interactions, particularly between arginines and negatively charged residues. There was also a significant contribution of hydrophobic interactions, with a high relevance of leucine and isoleucine residues, as well as between the hydrophobic moiety of the arginine side chain and the last two residues.</p><p>In summary, we assembled a high-accuracy essential interactome for both Gram-negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and Gram-positive bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) that will enable us to identify protein hubs and investigate the importance of these interactions.

a crucial process for membrane biosynthesis and plays a pivotal role in related processes, such as the biosynthesis of lipid A, lipoic acid, and phosphatidic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yao and Rock, 2013</xref>). The initial step in FA biosynthesis involves the transfer of biotin from the biotin protein ligase (BPL) BirA to the Acc complex via AccB. This is followed by the generation of malonyl-CoA through the catalytic action of the Acc complex. The resulting malonyl-CoA is then transferred to AcpP, which couples to each step of the elongation cycle catalyzed by the Fab family of proteins, ultimately resulting in the production of FA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chan and Vogel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Core enzymes in fatty acid (FA) synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) FA synthesis pathway.

Hence, our model provides valuable functional insights into this complex. We show that the BPL catalytic domain of BirA aligns with the biotinyl-binding (BB) domain of AccB. Within the structure of the complex, two BirA loops play a significant role: the first loop, spanning residues 218–226, interacts with the substrate, while the second loop, consisting of residues 116–121, is enriched in arginine and aids in stabilizing the substrate’s negative charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Based on our model, we propose that these loops act together to encapsulate the biotin moiety within the catalytic pocket of BirA, creating a closed state. Upon interaction with AccB, BirA engages with two specific AccB loops: the β-hairpin loop, that contains the important residue Lys122, and the “thumb motif”, comprising residues 94–102. The presence of Lys122 near the substrate leads to electrostatic repulsion of the arginine-rich loop, creating an open state. Then, the biotin molecule can covalently attach to the Lys122 residue of AccB, presenting itself to the essential Acc complex. Our model is compatible with mutagenesis studies performed in BirA where mutations M310L and P143T were found to induce a superrepressor phenotype, i.e., BirA lacks the capacity to biotinylate AccB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chakravartty and Cronan, 2012</xref>). The effect of these mutations, that do not significantly affect the BirA active site, can be explained by the destabilization of the BirA-AccB interface.</p><p>The Acc complex, composed of four subunits, is responsible for catalyzing two half-reactions. First, AccC carboxylates the biotin group attached to Lys122 of AccB. In the second step, the AccAD complex transfers the carboxyl group from Lys122-carboxybiotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). While crystal structures of all the monomeric subunits have been solved (accAD: 2F9Y, accB: 1BDO, accC: 3RV4), the full structure of the Acc complex remains unknown. The accepted stoichiometry for the Acc complex is AccB<sub>4</sub>C<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub>D<sub>2</sub>, although a dimeric form of AccB has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chakravartty and Cronan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cronan, 2021</xref>). When testing various AccBC stoichiometries, we found that the dimeric form of AccB led to higher accuracies. Our predicted models suggest that the BB domain of AccB can interact with the catalytic pockets of AccA and AccC, while the N-terminal domain can only be attached to AccC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Additionally, the essential AccB ‘thumb motif’ interacts with the N-terminus of AccA and the loop comprising residues 192–195 of AccC, in agreement with previous mutational and structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tong, 2005</xref>). These studies concluded that the thumb region is critical for identifying Acc proteins, as only biotin-dependent enzymes involved in the synthesis of malonyl-CoA contain thumb domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tong, 2005</xref>). Other studies also suggest that the thumb domain may act as a mobile lid that tightly fits into AccC and AccA active sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cronan, 2001</xref>). While the heterotetrameric AccAD has already been crystallized, we identified a new, unsolved, high-accuracy interaction between AccC and AccD, which is consistent with coevolutionary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Broussard et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesize that this interaction is crucial for maintaining AccBC close in space with AccAD, allowing the BB domain of AccB to dynamically shuttle from AccC to AccA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The binding affinity of the BB domain to either AccC or AccA can be influenced by the carboxylation state of the biotin moiety. The introduction of a negative charge to biotin through carboxylation may decrease the affinity for AccC, leading to the binding of the BB domain to AccA. The structural information obtained from these interfaces is consistent with the bi-substrate ping-pong mechanism followed by the Acc complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cronan, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The malonyl-CoA produced by the Acc complex is then loaded onto AcpP by FabD, initiating the FA synthesis through the catalytic reaction of FabH. The FA elongation process is cyclic and requires several Fab proteins, adding two carbons to the FA intermediate in each cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cong et al., 2019</xref>). The interaction of AcpP to each Fab protein is essential for the cycle to proceed, as FA intermediates are tethered and transported by AcpP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yao and Rock, 2015</xref>). In these lines, many AcpP-Fab protein complexes have been solved (AcpP-FabD: 6UOJ, AcpP-FabF: 7L4E, AcpP-FabB: 6OKC, AcpP-FabA: 4KEH, AcpP-FabI: 2FHS, AcpP-FabZ: 4ZJB) but the structure of the complex AcpP-FabG remains unknown, despite the similarity between FabG and FabI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartholow et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dodge et al., 2019</xref>). Both FabG and FabI contain Rossmann folds composed of twisted β-sheets surrounded by α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Masoudi et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate these interactions, we generated models of homodimeric FabG and FabI and analyzed their interactions with AcpP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The interfaces between the Fab homodimers exhibited a high degree of similarity, but the interaction between AcpP and the Fab partner displayed some distinct features. In both cases, Ser36 of AcpP was positioned near the active site of the FabG/FabI pocket where the catalytic activity takes place. However, the exact binding location of AcpP appeared to differ, possibly due to the presence of FabI’s C-terminal region, which also interacts with the catalytic site and is absent in FabG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is worth noting that the crystallized structure of the FabI-AcpP complex does not show AcpP’s Ser36 facing the catalytic site, whereas in our model, Ser36 is positioned in the correct orientation. These findings provide valuable insights into the selectivity of AcpP for different Fab protein pairs, particularly for the uncharacterized AcpP-FabG complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Complexes involved in LPS synthesis</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a crucial molecule that forms the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative outer membrane (OM).

The OM is an asymmetric lipid bilayer, with LPS making up the outer leaflet and phospholipids forming the inner leaflet.

The lipid A-core region of LPS is synthesized in the cytoplasm and transported to the periplasmic face of the IM using the MsbA flippase. The O-antigen is then ligated to the lipid A-core by the WaaL ligase to form the LPS molecule. Subsequently, the LPS is carried from the IM to the OM by the lipoprotein transport protein complex (LptA-G), which plays a vital role in cellular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Olsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hicks and Jia, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Putker et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To extract the LPS from the IM, the LptB<sub>2</sub>FG complex, an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, hydrolyzes ATP to induce conformational changes in the transmembrane (TM) LptFG complex.

Additionally, the exact number of LptA molecules that make up the periplasmic bridge is still unknown, although previous research suggests that LptA molecules in isolation can form polymers of up to eight subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Malojčić et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merten et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, we have successfully generated a high-accuracy model of the periplasmic bridge by computationally predicting the structure of the LptCAD complex. Our model supports the formation of a head-to-tail LptCAD complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) and suggests that the presence of a single LptA monomer is enough to form a bridge spanning approximately 15 nm, which corresponds to the average thickness of the periplasm in <italic>E. coli</italic>. It should be noted that the width of the periplasmic space can vary depending on environmental conditions, contracting or expanding during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Santambrogio et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, the oligomeric state of LptA may adapt to these changes, allowing the formation of larger bridges. By modeling different LptA oligomers (such as LptA<sub>2</sub> and LptA<sub>3</sub>), we were able to generate models consistent with previously reported structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Merten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sochacki et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that LptA can transiently oligomerize in the periplasm, facilitating the formation of extended bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Furthermore, under certain conditions, the periplasmic space can significantly shrink (approximately 10 nm), consistently with the loss of a single LptA molecule. In our analysis, we identified a high-accuracy interaction between LptC and LptD, which involves the interface region of their βJR domains, analogous to previously characterized complexes, suggesting that the formation of the complex without LptA is also feasible.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Complexes involved in OMP transport</title><p>Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are β-barrel proteins that are synthesized in the cytoplasm and require translocases to be transported to the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suits et al., 2008</xref>).

The cryo-EM structure shows close contacts between SecF and YidC, constraining the complex and preventing the formation of the central cavity. In contrast, our model shows weak interaction between SecF and YidC’s N-terminal helix. In addition, SecF is distant from the TM and periplasmic domains, being SecD positioned between both subunits. Furthermore, the crystal structures of SecDF and YidC closely resemble our model but exhibit poor alignment with the cryo-EM structure (RMSDs for YidC and SecDF: 0.512 Å and 3.552 Å in our model; 14.060 Å and 15.336 Å in the cryo-EM structure).</p><p>The subunit organization in our model is consistent with a proposed mechanism in which the preprotein infiltrates into the pocket of SecY, displaces the plug domain, and is subsequently released through the exit lateral gate, with the dynamic periplasmic domains coordinating its release into the periplasm.

It is noteworthy that when SecA attaches to SecY, the central cavity is not formed, and the N-terminal helix of YidC is positioned near the lateral exit gate of SecY, which supports earlier research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Botte et al., 2016</xref>).

LolC and LolE share an identical overall fold, except for a β-hairpin located in the interface. The β-hairpin loop in LolC is smaller and can be easily accommodated within the β-barrel of LolA. Instead, the loop in LolE is larger and cannot be placed inside the β-barrel. This comparison indicates that the β-hairpin loop may be responsible for the specific interaction between LolA and LolC.</p><p>After the lipoprotein is loaded into LolA, the lipoprotein-LolA complex travels across the periplasm to interact with LolB, which accepts the lipoprotein and incorporates it into the OM. LolA and LolB also contain a β-barrel domain, however, the latter also accommodates a helix inside the β-barrel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kaplan et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, the LolAB crystal structure remains unsolved. Our LolAB model shows strikingly similar interfaces with LolAC, as both show the protruding β-hairpin loop contained inside the β-barrel hydrophobic cavity, evidencing that both complexes share a similar mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, top). Moreover, the critical Leu68 of LolB, which is crucial to receive and localize lipoproteins to the OM, is located at the interface region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takeda et al., 2003</xref>).

Unfortunately, our attempts to predict the interfaces between FtsEX and FtsA/FtsZ were unsuccessful.

The SPOR domain of FtsN does not participate in protein interactions. In addition, we acquired an FtsQLBN model with poor precision, suggesting that FtsN would bind exclusively to FtsWI. Notably, we observed that the SPOR domain of FtsN (present in the FtsWIN model) shares the same interaction site as FtsLB when joining with FtsWI (as seen in the FtsQLBWI model) by overlapping the FtsWIN and FtsQLBWI structures. Therefore, we suggest that PG synthesis occurs when FtsQLB binds to FtsWI, displacing the SPOR domain so that it can attach to PG, facilitating the transport of the complex to regions where PG is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Complexes involved in cell elongation</title><p>The elongasome is formed when the actin-like MreB protein polymerizes and attracts various proteins from the Mre and Rod families, which are critical for maintaining the shape of rod-shaped bacteria, such as <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sjodt et al., 2020</xref>). In these bacteria, the elongation and cell division are closely coordinated, to avoid changes in shape that may impact cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Teeseling, 2021</xref>). The elongasome and divisome share important similarities: both involve the polymerization of an actin-like protein that signals the assembly of membrane-associated protein complexes anchored in the IM, such as FtsA and MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Teeseling, 2021</xref>). These proteins form dynamic filaments with an actin-like nucleotide-binding domain that hydrolyzes ATP to initiate polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Teeseling, 2021</xref>). Both complexes also have specific GTase-TPase sub-complexes which polymerize and cross-like glycan chains: FtsWI in the divisome and MrdAB in the elongasome. However, while MrdAB is mainly found in the lateral wall and midcell, FtsWI is localized in the division septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Szwedziak and Löwe, 2013</xref>). Despite their similarities, the structure of the two complexes differs in several ways. The divisome comprises the tubulin-like FtsZ protein which assembles in a ring-like complex and recruits several Fts proteins such as FtsWI, FtsEX, FtsQLB, FtsK, and FtsN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, the elongasome contains the actin-like MreB-forming patches attached to the membrane and interacts with proteins such as RodZ, MreBCD, and MrdAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Graham et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, while MreB is undoubtedly an essential component of the elongasome, its specific function remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sjodt et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Based on biochemical and interaction studies and the confidence of the binary complexes, we modeled the elongasome incorporating MreBCD and MrdAB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Graham et al., 2021</xref>). Several studies have revealed connections between MrdC and MreD, MrdA and MrdB, and MreB and MreC, emphasizing the central role of MreB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Graham et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banzhaf et al., 2012</xref>), which forms filament-like oligomers in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the IM and recruits elongasome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pichoff et al., 2019</xref>).

Additionally, the model incorporates the MreCD-RodZ sub-complex, which is crucial for maintaining bacterial morphology. The cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of RodZ, characterized by a helix-turn-helix motif, likely contributes to protein-protein interactions with MreB, while the C-terminal domain may interact with periplasmic proteins to regulate bacterial morphology. The two sub-complexes are expected to interact with each other through the TM domains, likely facilitated by MrdB and MreD, as well as through the periplasmic domains of MrdA and MreC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). These findings suggest that the cytoplasmic regions of MreB initially recruit the MrdAB GTase-TPase sub-complex, followed by the binding of MreCD-RodZ to MrdAB. Interestingly, the overall arrangement of the elongasome model exhibits similarities to the divisome sub-complex FtsQLBWI. For instance, the connections between the periplasmic domains of MreC and MrdB in the elongasome resemble the interactions between FtsB and FtsI in the divisome. Additionally, the binding between the TM domains of MreCD and MrdA may serve a comparable role to the interactions of FtsQLB and FtsW in the divisome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Complexes involved in DNA replication</title><p>DNA replication involves the duplication of DNA during cell division to pass it on to the next generation.

Despite these inherent limitations, we identified an intriguing unresolved complex involving the interaction between the sliding clamp DnaN and DNA polymerase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>). The existence of this interaction suggests that DnaN may serve as a recruiter for DNA polymerase I at the replication fork, facilitating its attachment to the DNA.

When aligning our model with the FolP crystal structure bound to its substrate (1AJ0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>, bottom), we observed a significant difference in the loop region spanning residues 22–36. In our model, this loop obstructs the catalytic site, whereas in the experimentally resolved structure, the pocket is accessible. This rearrangement of the loop, likely induced by the presence of the substrate, may be crucial in facilitating its interaction with GyrA while impeding its interaction with GyrB.

This PPI is absent in Gram-negative bacteria, as they lack a DnaI homolog and follow a different mechanism for replication initiation regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hooper and Jacoby, 2016</xref>). In certain Gram-positive bacteria, DnaI interacts with DnaB, thereby aiding in the coordination of DNA replication initiation with the activities of the replication machinery. The predicted interface reveals close contacts between the N-terminal region of DnaI and the C-terminal domain of DnaB, resembling the structure of DnaBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). Furthermore, our analysis predicts highly reliable binary interactions involved in DNA synthesis (nrdEF) and DNA transcription (rpoCZ, rpoC-greA, and rpoC-sigA). While the subunits of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase have been extensively characterized, with cryo-EM structures available at good resolutions, a high-resolution binary complex of the two components of the ribonucleotide reductase enzyme (NrdEF) remains unresolved.

In addition, UbiF seems to interact only with UbiI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b and c</xref>). Additionally, the accessory proteins UbiJ and UbiK adopt a coiled-coil structure, which suggests their association with the membrane to facilitate the delivery of ubiquinone.

Our model further suggests that the presence of two α-hairpin domains in UbiJ facilitates its interaction with UbiK, with the loops assisting the movement of the SCP2 domain between different subunits.

Interestingly, the initial reaction involves a hydroxylase, succeeded by a methyltransferase, and this process is reiterated once, ultimately concluding with another hydroxylase. Additionally, the three hydroxylases share a very similar structure, and likewise, the two methyltransferases also display structural homology.

Developing comprehensive interactomes holds great promise in identifying potential targets for the discovery of novel antibiotics. By combining deep-learning model confidence scores with interactome data, we can address the issue of high false positive rates. The structural insights presented in this study shed light on the underlying mechanisms of crucial biological processes in prokaryotes. Many of the discussed complexes lacked prior structural characterization, making the findings valuable for structural-based drug discovery approaches. To further enrich our interactomes, we can incorporate protein interaction data from other species or include information about the quaternary structure of the complexes. We hope that with the continuous training of deep-learning models using larger datasets, we will generate more accurate and confident protein complex models in the near future.</p><p>It is also crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the methodology employed in this study. First, the interpretation of protein essentiality can be influenced by the culturing conditions of bacteria. The essential proteins mentioned in the literature have been identified in bacteria cultured under rich medium conditions. However, it is important to recognize that protein complexes are dynamic entities that can rearrange in response to changing conditions and cellular stress. Therefore, it is necessary to understand these interactions within the appropriate biological context. Second, studying isolated binary complexes may result in inaccurate representations of the complete architecture due to the absence of accessory proteins or the omission of the correct stoichiometry. Finally, the performance of the AF-Multimer algorithm tends to decrease with a higher number of chains and in the case of heteromeric complexes. This is because homomeric structures typically possess internal symmetry, resulting in identical interfaces between chains and consistent interface quality. Heteromeric complexes, on the other hand, are more susceptible to variations in confidence scores due to irregularities in interface regions. Despite these constrains, AF2 showed remarkable predictive accuracy in modeling bacterial protein-protein complexes, generating high-confidence models for almost 90% of the complexes tested. Nevertheless, our results present an initial description of the essential interactome, which can assist researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamental processes within bacterial cells. As additional data becomes available in the coming years and new methods are developed to enhance the accuracy of protein multimer prediction, structural biology will deeply improve our understanding of the cell interactome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Compilation of essential proteins and processing the data</title><p>First, we compiled from previous studies the essential proteins for four Gram-negative (<italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baba et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gerdes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Goodall, 2018</xref>), <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ramage et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liberati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gallagher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Poulsen et al., 2019</xref>) and four Gram-positive species (<italic>Bacillus subtillis,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Commichau et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dembek et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ji et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chaudhuri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Santiago et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">7</xref>).

Per-residue conservation scores were computed using VESPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cantalapiedra et al., 2021</xref>), whose scores range from 1 (most variable) to 9 (most conserved). SASA was computed using FreeSASA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mitternacht, 2016</xref>). Python module. Statistical data analyses were carried out using R v4.2.1 and Python v3.9. Molecular graphics were performed with PyMol.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s4"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of validated bacterial complexes.</title><p>The listed complexes were not included in the training dataset of AF and share &lt;30% sequence identity with all models deposited in the PDB.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-94919-supp1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-94919-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Essential protein annotations and protein-protein interactions (PPIs) scores provided by AlphaFold2 (AF2).</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-94919-data1-v2.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>All models described in this paper are available on ModelArchive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://modelarchive.org">https://modelarchive.org</ext-link>, dataset ID: ma-sysbio-bei) with accession codes in Table 1.

These models have been predicted by AlphaFold2 and in some of the models, information from existing experimental structures is utilized. The predicted models have been calculated based on standard workflow procedures which are explained in detail and can be reproduced by others. The figures are informative and clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer's insightful comments, which have significantly contributed to improve our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions for improvement:</p><p>a. The PDB accession codes of the experimental structures should be provided</p><p>b. A comparison of the predicted models with the experimental structures should be provided (e.g., same orientation, superposition). In Figure 6 for example, a figure with superposition or use of the same orientation would be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have included a new table (Table 1) listing all experimental structures discussed in the main text, with the corresponding PDB codes. All predictions are listed in Source data 1. For instances with available PDB codes, we compared the predicted structures to the experimental ones (new Figure 2—figure supplement 1). In Figure 6, the structures were difficult to superimpose because the subunits in the complexes have different relative orientations. To help comparing both models, we have added a schematic representation (new Figure 6c).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper will certainly generate many hypotheses based on the predicted models. In this respect, it would be useful for a wide audience in the bioscience field. However, the discussed models will need experimental verification by various techniques, such as X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, SAXS, and structural proteomics. A more thorough analysis of the literature may help to improve the paper in this respect.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that we may have under-emphasized this aspect in our manuscript and understand the need of validating the predictions to determine the general validity of our AlphaFold (AF2) models. To address this issue, we conducted a thorough validation of 140 bacterial protein-protein complexes from the PDB. This dataset contains all structures published after the last release of AF2 that share less than 30% sequence homology with all other complexes deposited in the PDB. Hence, this dataset serves as the strongest test possible for AF2's prediction accuracy in bacterial complexes. We found that 81% (113 out of 140) of these structures were accurately predicted by AF2 according to our criterion (ipTM&gt;0.6). From all models generated, 83% (116 out of 140) were almost identical to the actual structures in terms of correct folding (TM-score &gt; 0.8). Most interestingly, 72% (101 out of 140) of the predicted structures were acceptable in terms of root mean square deviation at the interaction interface (i-RMSD &lt; 4 Å) and 56% (79 out of 140) were virtually identical to the real structures (i-RMSD &lt; 2Å), highlighting the excellent prediction power of AF2. This high precision likely reflects the vast number of bacterial sequences available in databases, from which coevolutionary relationships among protein residues can be inferred with great accuracy. These results provide strong support for our findings. We have included all this new data in a revised version of our manuscript, both in the main text (Results and Discussion, page 3) and Supplementary file 1, that contains all the results.</p><p>Also, we investigated whether our complexes have known crosslinks in the xlinkdb database (https://xlinkdb.gs.washington.edu/xlinkdb/). We also revisited the literature for more datasets that include crosslinking data and found an additional study that was potentially useful to validate our results (Lenz et al., Nat. Comm., 2021). Overall, we found information for 14 bacterial complexes. In all cases but one, the distance restraints identified (crosslinked lysines are ~15-20Å apart) are compatible with our models. Hence, although the overlap between the datasets and our list of validated interactions was not extensive, for the complexes that did match, our models were consistent with the experimental data. We have incorporated these results in the main text (Results and Discussion, page 3) and Source data 1, that contains all the results.</p><p>Finally, we identified several mutations in BirA, documented in the literature, that affect its interaction with AccB. In BirA mutations M310L and P143T were found to induce a superrepressor phenotype (BirA lacks the capacity to biotinylate AccB). These mutations do not significantly affect the BirA active site but can destabilize the BirA-AccB interface (Chakravarti et al., J. Baceriol., 2012), supporting our results. We have added this information in the main text (page 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2</p><p>This study attempts to identify the 'essential interactome' through combining information in presence/absence genomics across bacteria, information in the STRING database, and predictions from α-fold.

It is clear why understanding which interactions are present are important. But even as the authors suggest, interactions are dynamic and there are plenty of other tools that people could use to find interactions (including AA Coev that the authors themselves cite). The counter argument the authors bring up is the high false positive rate of interactions that is solved by this method. While true, the stringency criteria for what constitutes an interaction in this paper is remarkably high: each protein within the interaction needs to be essential, and needs to have a high confidence score in STRING, and then there is a hyperparameter that dictates the level at which AlphaFold 2 is providing confident answers. In this sense, this is less about an 'essential' interactome, and more about an interactome that is present with the highest true positive rate (trading off with the ability to discover new interactions at a reasonable breadth).</p></disp-quote><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insights concerning the stringency criteria for defining interactions. Here, we provide a detailed justification for our selection criteria and show how it aligns with our goal of identifying high-confidence interactions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Protein essentiality: In our model, interactions are considered essential if, and only if, both proteins involved are essential, providing a conservative estimate for the essential interactome. In our revised manuscript, we explored the possibility for two non-essential proteins to form an essential interaction by investigating synthetically lethal interactions. Out of all synthetic lethal interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic>, only 28 interactions were identified, and only two could be modeled with an ipTM score &gt; 0.6. Likely, these non-essential proteins operate in parallel or compensatory pathways instead of interacting directly. These findings lend support to our hypothesis and suggest that our interactome encompasses most essential interactions. These results were included in the revised manuscript.</p></list-item></list><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94919-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Performance of state-of-the-art PPI prediction methods (Huang et al., 2023).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Methods</th><th>AUPRC<sup><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="appR3table1fn1">*</xref></sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SGPPI</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.422</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Profppikernel</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.359</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PIPR</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.342</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">PIPE2</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.220</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">SigProd</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.264</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="appR3table1fn1"><label>*</label><p>AUPRC denotes the average AUPRC value of 10-fold cross-validation.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>It is clear from the data that such methods are not mature enough to be used as confident predictors. Hence, we decided to resort to validated interactions in the String database, which is one of the most comprehensive PPI databases. In this revised version, we have expanded our data set to include all experimentally abelled interactions in the String database, even those with a low probability (experimental score &gt; 0.15). The addition of these new interactions increased the total number of interactions tested from 1089 to 1402 and generated 38 new models for Gram-negative species (13 with high accuracy) and 275 new models for Gram-positive bacteria (18 with high accuracy). All interactions are now included in the Source data 1 and high accuracy models will be deposited on Model Archive after acceptance.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Alphafold (AF2) criterion for complex prediction. Although AF2 has its limitations, its accuracy in predicting bacterial complexes is consistently high. Additionally, as extensively detailed in the response to Reviewer 1, we conducted a thorough validation of 140 bacterial protein-protein complexes from the PDB, whose structure was published after the last release of AF2. Our results show that AF2 was able to predict 81% of these complexes, with high accuracy, in line with other reported studies (Evans et al., Yin et al., 2022). While there might be some minor deviations, AF2 can largely capture the bacterial essential interactome accurately. In the revised version, we compare pDockQ and pDockQ2 metrics with our ipTM criterion to define confident models. We observed that both pDockQ and pDockQ2 metrics were capable of identifying highly reliable complexes, but also disregarded actual complexes (Figure 1—figure supplements 1-2). Thus, we decided to retain our initial criterion, based on ipTM scores, which is consistent with other authors who used similar ipTM thresholds to model bacterial interactions (e.g., O’Reilly et al., 2023).</p></list-item></list><p>In summary, although our methodology has inherent limitations, we believe that our approach is sound and can give a comprehensive and realistic view of the bacterial essential interactome. We hope that these new insights further substantiate our approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don’t know of too many studies that use AlphaFold 2 in this way. This was clever. However, there are plenty of studies that use phylogenomic information to infer interactions. In this sense, the core idea of the paper is not intrinsically novel.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for valuing our approach. Although other methods have been used to predict interactomes, our study, to the best of our knowledge, provides the first high-quality essential interactome for bacteria. We used experimental data (analysis of single deletion mutants) to define the essential interactions in bacteria. Other methods, either using phylogenomic information and/or deep learning tools to infer interactions, have a poor performance, as illustrated in the preceding table. Often, these methods yield a high number of interactions and, in many cases, show a bias towards overrepresented entries in the positive databases used to train the predictors (Macho Rendón et al., 2022). Also, while other methods lack detailed structural insights into the interactions, we offer structural models for every interaction tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I do feel this would be worth publishing as an expose of AF2 is capable of. I'm not sure of the impact it will have on researchers, however.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's positive feedback on our manuscript. Using AF2, we identified key interactions using only gene deletion mutant data. This manuscript reveals new insights into the assembly of essential bacterial complexes, providing specific structural details to understand their stability and function. Additionally, our work seeks to establish a methodology applicable to all bacterial species, guiding future research in this field. The approach taken in this study may expand drug targeting opportunities and accelerate the development of more effective antibiotics aimed to disrupt these essential interactions. In conclusion, the impact of the paper lies in its novel use of Alphafold2 to understand essential bacterial protein interactions, providing key insights into assembly mechanisms, and identifying new potential drug targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Response to Reviewer #3</p><p>The selection of &quot;essential&quot; interactions is a bit arbitrary, given that their main criterion for selection is that both proteins are essential. Unfortunately, it's not always clear where the essential protein data is coming from. Authors cite Mateus et al. (ref 15) as source for <italic>E. coli</italic>, but I don't see an explicit list of essential genes in this paper (nor its supplement). For Pseudomonas the citation doesn't contain author information and for Acinetobacter essentiality only seems to refer to &quot;essentiality&quot; in the lung.</p><p>As a minimum, the author should provide a table with summary statistics for the essential proteins they are using, as this is the basis for the whole paper. Such a table should include the names of the species, the number of genes that are considered as essential, a very brief characterization of how essentiality was determined and the source for this information. For instance, are the genes listed in the Supplementary File congruent with the genes in the Database of Essential Genes (DEG) for these organisms? Finally, authors should indicate in that table which (essential) protein pairs are conserved across species, as this is another one of their selection criteria. Conservation is not necessary for an essential interaction, but it certainly makes it more likely.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer's concerns regarding the selection of essential interactions and the need for a more thorough description of the sources of essential protein data. To address these concerns in the revised manuscript:</p><p>We included a clear explanation of the sources for essential protein data, including proper citations for each organism in Source data 1. The selected studies were primarily sourced from the DEG database. If data was unavailable, we revised the literature for relevant studies. The DEG database's most recent update was on September 1, 2020. A graphical summary of the datasets has been included in Figure 1—figure supplements 6-7, that shows the overlapping between the different studies.</p><p>Also, the reviewer was right in pointing out that for <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, the study was conducted in the lung, which may bias the results as all other studies were performed in the test tube. To solve this, we replaced this study for Bai et al., 2021, that was performed in rich medium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Author should also state whether they have verified that none of the random pairs are in the positive set.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We certainly checked that none of the random pairs was present in the positive dataset. This clarification has now been added to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is also relevant because authors &quot;retrieved all high-confidence PPIs between these proteins from the STRING database&quot; which provides compound scores for interactions but that has often little to do with physical interactions (given that the scores factor in co-expression and several other criteria). In fact, I find STRING scores difficult to interpret for that very reason.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment to the use of combined interaction scores from the STRING database. We agree with the reviewer that STRING combined scores are somehow difficult to interpret because they combine different evidence of interaction. We decided to use the STRING combined scores to include interactions that may not have direct experimental evidence but are probable to interact according to other information (e.g., co-expression). However, to further examine the interactome we have also included in the revised version all interactions with experimental evidence in String to complete our interactome. As mentioned in the response to Reviewer 1, we expanded the tested interactions from 1089 to 1402. This resulted in 38 new models for Gram-negative species, with 13 being highly accurate, and 275 for Gram-positive bacteria, of which 18 were highly accurate. All interactions are now included in the Source data 1 and high accuracy models will be deposited on the Model Archive after acceptance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors &quot;reasoned that a given interaction would only be essential if and only if both proteins forming the complex are essential&quot; – this sounds reasonable but doesn't capture synthetically lethal (genetic) interactions, that is, interactions between two proteins that are both non-essential but are essential in combination. Admittedly, I don't have a number of how many such cases exist, but there are such cases in the literature (e.g. Hannum et al. 2009, PLoS Genet 5[12]: e1000782, for yeast).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point into discussion. We acknowledge that our reasoning does not capture synthetic lethality, which occurs when the loss of one of two individual genes has no effect on cell survival, but the simultaneous loss of both leads to cell death. In this case, the two genes or proteins are non-essential individually but become essential in combination. To cover synthetic lethality, we retrieved all synthetically lethal interactions found <italic>in Escherichia coli</italic>, strain K12-BW25113 from the Mlsar database and included them in our pipeline. We identified 28 synthetically lethal PPIs (involving 45 proteins) and we modeled them with AF2. Only two interactions displayed an ipTM score &gt; 0.6 (nadA-pncB and nuoG-purA). Hence, the number of interactions due to synthetic lethality seems to contribute low to the overall interactome. We believe that synthetic lethal partners often function in parallel or compensatory pathways, rather than directly interacting with each other. For example, in yeast, the genes RAD9 and RAD24 are synthetic lethal. RAD9 is involved in cell cycle checkpoints, while RAD24 is involved in DNA damage response. They function in related pathways but do not encode proteins that directly interact with each other. Hence, finding specific examples of proteins that are both synthetic lethal and directly interact might be challenging as the synthetic lethal relationship often reveals functional rather than physical interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Apart from that, one could question the selection method more generally, given that for a biological process always essential and non-essential proteins work together, so I wonder why the authors didn't include additional proteins known to be involved in specific processes as this could make their predictions much more biologically meaningful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that accessory proteins are important to understand the biological context of interactions. In fact, in several sections of our manuscript, we included accessory proteins to fully describe the essential complexes. For example, in the cell division complex, we incorporated proteins like MreCD-RodZ from the elongasome to enhance the structural context of the interactions. However, a comprehensive explanation of all identified interactions and accessory proteins would extend beyond the scope of this manuscript and further lengthen an already extensive document. In our study, we sought to describe the fundamental interactions for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. We anticipate that our findings will prompt additional research to confirm our hypotheses and enhance knowledge of these protein complexes within the proper cellular context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In any case, to understand their choice better, authors should provide a table (in the main text) summarizing the proteins they actually analyze and discuss in more detail in their models. This would allow a reader to see which proteins are considered essential and which ones are missing. I would organize this by function / pathway / process, so these proteins are listed in a functional context.</p></disp-quote><p>We added Table 1 in the main text, listing all interactions described in the text. Table 1 includes the proteins involved in each complex, the ipTM score of the interaction, whether a PDB code is available for comparison and the functional classification of the interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regard to docking, please also discuss why you focus on iPTM, as there are other derived metrics from AF2 scores, such as pdockq based on if_plddt (e. g. Bryant et al., 2022), as well as external metrics to AF2 (physics-based methods such as Rosetta). Another option may be a modified versions of AF2 multimer, such as AFSample, which produces a greater diversity of models, allowing for more &quot;shots on goal&quot; and ultimately a higher success rate, assuming one has a reliable QC filter (I wonder how those compares to iPTM).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use AFsample because is a very expensive computational approach that would require too many resources for the batch prediction of more than 2.000 complexes. Afsample generates 240x models, and including the extra recycles, the overall timing is around 1,000x more costly than the baseline. However, we acknowledge that using other metrics can be useful to further evaluate our models. Hence, we investigated how pDockQ and pDockQ2 metrics compare with ipTM score. We observed that pDockQ hardly correlates with ipTM (R = 0.328) whereas the improved metric pDockQ2 correlates much better (R = 0.649). All complexes described in the manuscript, which have an ipTM score higher than our threshold (0.6), have also a pDockQ2 score higher than 0.23, except for six interactions that have a lower pDockQ2 score. However, these scores improve when the interactions are modeled with accessory proteins in the complex. This somehow suggests that the IpTM metric better captures binary interactions when these are excluded from their context. It is possible however, that pDockQ scores are better in discriminating false positive interactions than ipTM scores. Based on the strong correlation between the two metrics and the observation that ipTM may better capture binary interactions, we decided to keep our method in the manuscript. Other authors have employed analogous ipTM thresholds to model bacterial interactions (e.g., O’Reilly et al., 2023). Notwithstanding, we also included pDockQ and pDockQ2 metrics in Source data 1, so readers can evaluate complexes based on these metrics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P. 1, third last line: “the essential interactome is a potentially powerful strategy to […] identify new targets for discovering new antibiotics”</p><p>Figures and figure legends need to be explicit which species is represented (ideally with a Uniprot ID) and which structure was predicted by alphafold and which one has an experimental structure.

We have addressed all these comments as follows:</p><p>The statement on page 1 was revised as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main significance of this study is its potential use for a better understanding of the protein complexes described in more detail (and the fact that alphafold can be applied in a similar fashion to many other complexes). This is why the individual sections need to be evaluated to process-specific experts (disclaimer: I have only worked on some of the complexes, but I am not an expert on any of them). I wonder if it would make more sense to break out some of the sections on individual complexes into separate papers, and then discuss them in more detail and with more context from previous studies. Complexes such as the divisome have a huge body of literature and it may be worth reviewing which structures are known and which ones are not. However, the dynamic and labile nature of these complexes have made it difficult for both crystallography as well as odelling to get a good structural understanding, but some of the models proposed here may be useful for overcoming some of these hurdles.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. While we acknowledge the complexity of some of the individual complexes, such as the divisome, and the wealth of existing literature, we believe that the current manuscript provides a valuable comprehensive view on how AF2 can be used to predict essential protein complexes in bacteria. In our opinion, dividing the manuscript in separate pieces might dilute its scope. Nonetheless, we are exploring in our laboratory the interactions detailed in the manuscript, aiming to further expand the knowledge on these important complexes and their potential as targets for new antimicrobials.</p><p>References:</p><p>Bai J, Dai Y, Farinha A, et al.
