growth and development in plants. Using the model plant Arabidopsis, we identified a novel signalling pathway downstream of the far-red light-sensing phytochrome, phyA, that depends on the highly conserved CCR4-NOT complex. CCR4-NOT is integral to RNA metabolism in yeast and animals, but its function in plants is largely unknown. NOT9B, an Arabidopsis homologue of human CNOT9, is a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, and acts as negative regulator of phyA-specific light signalling when bound to NOT1, the scaffold protein of the complex. Light-activated phyA interacts with and displaces NOT9B from NOT1, suggesting a potential mechanism for light signalling through CCR4-NOT. ARGONAUTE 1 and proteins involved in splicing associate with NOT9B and we show that NOT9B is required for specific phyA-dependent alternative splicing events. Furthermore, association with nuclear localised ARGONAUTE 1 raises the possibility that NOT9B and CCR4-NOT are involved in phyA-modulated gene expression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Place a seedling on a windowsill, and soon you will notice the fragile stem bending towards the glass to soak in the sun and optimize its growth. Plants can ‘sense’ light thanks to specialized photoreceptor molecules: for instance, the phytochrome A is responsible for detecting weak and ‘far-red’ light from the very edge of the visible spectrum. Once the phytochrome has been activated, this message is relayed to the rest of the plant through an intricate process that requires other molecules.</p><p>The CCR4-NOT protein complex is vital for all plants, animals and fungi, suggesting that it was already present in early life forms. Here, Schwenk et al. examine whether CCR4-NOT could have acquired a new role in plants to help them respond to far-red light.</p><p>Scanning the genetic information of the plant model <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> revealed that the gene encoding the NOT9 subunit of CCR4-NOT had been duplicated in plants during evolution. NOT9B, the protein that the new copy codes for, has a docking site that can attach to both phytochrome A and CCR4-NOT. When NOT9B binds phytochrome A, it is released from the CCR4-NOT complex: this could trigger a cascade of reactions that ultimately changes how <italic>A. thaliana</italic> responds to far-red light. Plants that had not enough or too much NOT9B were respectively more or less responsive to that type of light, showing that the duplication of the gene coding for this subunit had helped plants respond to certain types of light.</p><p>The findings by Schwenk et al. illustrate how existing structures can be repurposed during evolution to carry new roles. They also provide a deeper understanding of how plants optimize their growth, a useful piece of information in a world where most people rely on crops as their main source of nutrients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>light signalling</kwd><kwd>photomorphogenesis</kwd><kwd>phytochrome</kwd><kwd>CCR4-NOT complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

plants constantly monitor their surrounding and adapt growth and development to changes in the ambient environment. Light is a key factor for plants that promotes, for instance, seed germination, early seedling development, and transition to flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paik and Huq, 2019</xref>). To sense the spectral composition and measure the light intensity in the environment, plants have evolved a set of photoreceptors sensitive to wavelengths in the UV-B, blue (B), red (R), and far-red (FR) light range of the spectrum. Phytochromes are receptors for R and FR light. They are synthesised in the inactive Pr state and convert to the physiologically active Pfr state upon absorbing light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Legris et al., 2019</xref>). Pfr can then revert to the Pr state either by absorption of light or by thermal relaxation. This toggle-switch like behaviour enables phytochromes to sense the red:far-red light ratio in the environment, which is key to distinguish sunlight from canopy shade.</p><p>PhyA and phyB are the primary phytochromes in seed plants. PhyB has a dominant function as R light receptor, while responses induced by FR light depend on phyA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Legris et al., 2019</xref>). Phytochromes are located to the cytosol in the inactive state and translocate into the nucleus upon conversion to the active Pfr state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klose et al., 2015</xref>). Two comparably well-characterised signalling pathways link light-activation of phytochromes to regulation of gene expression. The PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) are bHLH transcription factors that suppress photomorphogenesis, and in parallel the CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1/SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (COP1/SPA) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex targets positive factors of light signalling for degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Legris et al., 2019</xref>). Light-activated phytochromes inhibit PIF and COP1/SPA action, and thereby regulate gene expression in response to light. In addition to these well-established light signalling components, also factors involved in splicing or microRNA biogenesis modulate light responses.</p><p>Mutants with reduced activity of DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1), SERRATE (SE), and ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1), or lacking functional HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) or HUA ENHANCER 1 (HEN1) are hypersensitive to light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achkar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorin et al., 2005</xref>) and functional interactions with the classical light signalling components COP1, HY5, and PIF4 have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Mutants with defects in miRNA biogenesis or action often have pleiotropic phenotypes.</p><p>Several components of light signalling pathways and the circadian clock are subject to alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tognacca et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mancini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shikata et al., 2014</xref>). SPLICING FACTOR FOR PHYTOCHROME SIGNALLING (SFPS) and REDUCED RED-LIGHT RESPONSES IN CRY1 CRY2 BACKGROUND (RRC1) are related to the human splicing factor SR140 and SPF45, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shikata et al., 2012</xref>). They interact with each other, directly bind phyB and also associate with pre-mRNAs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xin et al., 2017</xref>). RRC1 regulates thousands of splicing events. Therefore, it is not surprising that <italic>rrc1</italic> loss-of-function mutants are lethal; mutants lacking functional SFPS are viable but show altered splicing of hundreds of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xin et al., 2019</xref>). Both <italic>sfps</italic> and hypomorphic <italic>rrc1</italic> mutants have general defects in light signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shikata et al., 2012</xref>). Light conditions that do not activate photosynthesis, such as monochromatic FR light or short light pulses, can modulate alternative splicing through photosensory photoreceptors, including phytochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mancini et al., 2016</xref>). However, many light-regulated splicing events are not affected in photoreceptor mutants and can be induced by exogenous sugar supply, indicating that they are connected to photosynthetic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mancini et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent findings describe the CARBON CATABOLITE REPRESSION 4-NEGATIVE ON TATA-LESS (CCR4-NOT) complex as a major player in mRNA metabolism in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collart, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ukleja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Villanyi and Collart, 2015</xref>). The complex consists of several evolutionary conserved subunits that assemble with the scaffold protein NOT1. These subunits have deadenylase (CCR4 ASSOCIATED FACTOR 1 [CAF1] and CCR4) or E3 ubiquitin ligase (NOT4) activity, or are transcriptionally active (NOT2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collart and Panasenko, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ukleja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Villanyi and Collart, 2016</xref>). Another highly conserved subunit of the complex is NOT9 (also called REQUIRED FOR CELL DIFFERENTIATION 1 [RQCD1], CAF40, CNOT9), which in animals spans the bridge between the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and CCR4-NOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>). The CCR4-NOT complex controls gene expression at all steps from transcription in the nucleus to translation and mRNA degradation in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collart, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although extensively studied in yeast and animals, the CCR4-NOT complex was only recently shown to exist in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arae et al., 2019</xref>). The full complex regulates RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>), and the two NOT2 homologues, NOT2A and NOT2B, promote polymerase II-dependent transcription and contribute to miRNA biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). Similar to the CCR4-CAF1 module in yeast and animals, Arabidopsis homologues of CCR4-CAF1 have mRNA deadenlyase activity and play a role as integrators of environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suzuki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liang et al., 2009</xref>). However, the function of other components of the complex and their relevance for specific signalling pathways is largely unknown. Mutants lacking the scaffold protein NOT1 are lethal in plants, animals, and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Motomura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeBella et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maillet et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>There are two close homologues of CNOT9/CAF40/RQCD1 in Arabidopsis, NOT9A and NOT9B, and a more distantly related protein, NOT9C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this study, we show that NOT9B binds to light activated phyA and acts as repressor of early seedling development during the dark-to-light transition.

Irrespective of whether phyA was in the active Pfr or inactive Pr state, we found interaction with NOT9B in yeast, while FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 1 (FHY1), a control protein known to specifically interact with light-activated phyA in the Y2H system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hiltbrunner et al., 2005</xref>), only bound phyA Pfr but not Pr. Further Y2H experiments revealed that the N-terminal 406 amino acids of phyA are sufficient for binding NOT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). NOT9A, the closest homologue of NOT9B in Arabidopsis, and the more distantly related NOT9C did not interact with phyA in the Y2H system under high stringency conditions and were therefore not further tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3A and B</xref>).

We could co-precipitate phyA-NLS-3×HA with HA-YFP-NOT9B using anti-GFP traps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, YFP fluorescence lifetime was significantly reduced in FRET/FLIM experiments with transiently transformed leek cells co-expressing HA-YFP-NOT9B and phyA-NLS-tagRFP compared to cells expressing HA-YFP-NOT9B and tagRFP only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we used stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing <italic>p35S:HA-YFP-NOT9B</italic> in Col-0 background for CoIP assays to verify the phyA/NOT9B interaction and test for Pfr dependence. Seedlings were exposed to FR light for 5 hr to facilitate nuclear import of phyA and subsequently treated for 5 min with either R light (660 nm) or long-wavelength FR light (760 nm) to convert phyA predominantly to the Pfr or Pr state, respectively. The amount of phyA that co-purified with NOT9B was substantially higher when it was in the active Pfr state compared to the inactive Pr state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For unknown reasons, the interaction in the Y2H system was not affected by the Pr/Pfr state of phyA, however we have previously observed that the Pfr-dependency of phyA interactions can be less pronounced in the Y2H system than in CoIP assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enderle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheerin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Light-activated phyA translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus and forms subnuclear structures termed photobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klose et al., 2015</xref>).

Structural analyses have shown that TNRC6, a GW-repeat containing protein, binds to CNOT9 through a Trp-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>), which is conserved in NOT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The NOT9B ΔGWB mutant (deficient in <underline>GW</underline>-<underline>b</underline>inding; NOT9B R217D A220D R256E A260L) contains amino acid substitutions at positions that are critical for the interaction of human CNOT9 and TNRC6. This mutant is not affected in binding NOT1 and phyA in Y2H assays, which we confirmed by CoIPs from transiently transformed tobacco leaves and stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref>). However, p-body localisation of HA-YFP-NOT9B ΔGWB in Arabidopsis is strongly reduced compared to NOT9Box, suggesting that proteins associating with NOT9B through the Trp-binding pocket promote assembly of NOT9B into p-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The dual localisation of NOT9B raises the question whether the nuclear or the cytoplasmic fraction is causing the effect on phyA signalling. Therefore, we generated an Arabidopsis line expressing exclusively nuclear localised NOT9B by adding the strong SV40 NLS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Using CoIP assays, we found that phyA co-precipitates with NLS-YFP-NOT9B in a Pfr dependent manner, indicating that the nuclear localised fraction of NOT9B interacts with light-activated phyA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Seedlings overexpressing constitutively nuclear localised NOT9B are equally hyposensitive to FR light with regard to inhibition of hypocotyl growth as seedlings overexpressing YFP-tagged wildtype NOT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J–L</xref>).

The CNOT1 interaction interface is conserved in Arabidopsis NOT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), and Y2H growth assays show that NOT9B containing H70A V72A A77Y V85Y substitutions is unable to bind NOT1 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which we validated by CoIP from transiently transformed tobacco leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>).

Thus, if there is competition for binding to NOT9B, we expect that high expression of NOT1 would hinder recruitment of NOT9B into photobodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In tobacco leaves transiently expressing NLS-YFP-NOT9B and phyA-NLS-CFP, co-expression of a NOT1 fragment impaired in binding NOT9B (FLAG-myc-mCherry-NLS-NOT1 MIF4G-mCherry) had no effect on recruitment of NOT9B into photobodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In contrast, co-expression of FLAG-myc-mCherry-NLS-NOT1 M, which includes the NOT9B binding site of NOT1, almost fully abolished assembly of NOT9B into photobodies whilst not affecting phyA photobody formation. This finding is consistent with competition of phyA and NOT1 for binding NOT9B in planta. To further investigate this notion, we generated stable transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing <italic>p35S:FLAG-myc-mCherry-NLS-NOT1 M</italic> either in Col-0 or NOT9Box backgrounds. FLAG-myc-mCherry-NLS-NOT1 M co-purified with HA-YFP-NOT9B in CoIPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which is in agreement with data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C,D</xref>. Interestingly, the amount of phyA Pfr co-precipitating with HA-YFP-NOT9B appeared to be lower in CoIPs from seedlings co-expressing FLAG-myc-mCherry-NLS-NOT1 M than from seedlings not expressing NOT1 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Quantification of three independent CoIP experiments analysed on the same membrane showed that the amount of phyA bound to NOT9B is significantly reduced when NOT1 M is coexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). This finding supports the idea that binding of phyA and NOT1 to NOT9B is mutually exclusive and they compete for binding NOT9B in planta. Therefore, increasing the levels of one of the proteins binding to the PNB site of NOT9B would decrease binding of the other protein interacting with this site. Since phyA levels in the nucleus are likely much higher and more dynamic than levels of NOT1, the impact of phyA on NOT1/NOT9B would be of greater importance in planta than the effect of NOT1 on the NOT9B/phyA interaction. Such competition-based regulation of NOT1/NOT9B interaction by phyA is favoured by phyA levels that are higher than NOT9B levels, and therefore we compared the luciferase activity in a <italic>phyA-211 pPHYA:PHYA-LUC</italic> complementation line and <italic>not9b-2</italic> complemented with <italic>pNOT9B:LUC-NOT9B</italic>. Quantification of the luciferase signal showed that levels of phyA are several orders of magnitude higher than the levels of NOT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Consequently, based on the phenotype of <italic>not9b</italic> mutants and NOT9Box lines, we propose that CCR4-NOT complexes containing NOT9B (CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup>) repress phyA signalling. In seedlings exposed to FR light, phyA is transported into the nucleus and competition for binding NOT9B could then displace NOT9B from CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), thereby relieving repression of light signalling. A potential explanation for the NOT9Box phenotype is that phyA levels are not high enough to fully prevent NOT9B from binding NOT1 when NOT9B is overexpressed. If so, blocking the PNB site in NOT9B by overexpression of NOT1 M should alleviate the NOT9Box phenotype. In line with this reasoning, the negative effect of NOT9Box on both inhibition of hypocotyl growth in FR light and expression of FR light-induced genes such as <italic>EARLY LIGHT INUDCIBLE PROTEIN 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> (<italic>EPLI1/2</italic>) and <italic>CHS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harari-Steinberg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2005</xref>) is partially suppressed by co-expression of FLAG-myc-mCherry-NLS-NOT1 M without affecting NOT9B protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>AP-MS analysis of NOT9B interactome</title><p>Recent AP-MS approaches to characterise the CCR4-NOT complex in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arae et al., 2019</xref>) and data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> support the notion that a complex similar to the CCR4-NOT complex from yeast and animals also exists in plants. We propose that phyA prevents the assembly of NOT9B into the CCR4-NOT complex, which offers a potential explanation for regulation of CCR4-NOT by FR light. A wide range of functions in control of RNA stability and metabolism have been described for yeast and animal CCR4-NOT but it is still unknown how CCR4-NOT modulates phyA mediated light responses in plants. Therefore, we investigated the NOT9B interactome in the NOT9Box line. Silver staining of GFP-trap purified proteins revealed several proteins co-precipitating with HA-YFP-NOT9B but not with YFP-HA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

This includes the known NOT9B interactors NOT1 and phyA, and most components of the CCR4-NOT complex. We did not find NOT9A, the closest homologue of NOT9B, and the more distantly related NOT9C. Interestingly, AGO1 and proteins with a function in miRNA biogenesis and/or splicing were among NOT9B-associated proteins. Highly enriched GO terms among NOT9B-associated proteins were rRNA binding, mRNA binding, RNA binding, and translation elongation factor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), supporting a conserved role of the CCR4-NOT complex in mRNA metabolism in eukaryotes, including plants.

The lack of functional ternary complexes would lead to partial derepression of light signalling in dark-grown seedlings. (<bold>E</bold>) In NOT9Box seedlings, NOT9B protein levels might exceed the optimal concentration of the bridge protein, resulting in high levels of non-functional CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> and NOT9B-protein X dimeric complexes, but reduced levels of the functional CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup>-protein X ternary complex.

This is in stark contrast to many other mutants with defects in complexes or pathways of general function, such as splicing and miRNA biogenesis. Several of these mutants show altered responses to light but they are not wavelength-specific, and often these mutants have highly pleiotropic phenotypes with loss-of-function alleles being lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shikata et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laubinger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sorin et al., 2005</xref>). While <italic>CAF40</italic>/<italic>CNOT9</italic> are single copy genes in humans and yeast, plants generally contain two or more genes coding for proteins with similarity to CAF40/CNOT9, including <italic>NOT9A</italic>, <italic>NOT9B</italic>, and <italic>NOT9C</italic> in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arae et al., 2019</xref>). Residues required for recruitment into p-bodies are conserved in all NOT9 proteins, including the more distantly related NOT9C, and consistently, we found that all Arabidopsis NOT9 proteins form p-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3C</xref>). The region corresponding to the PNB site of NOT9B is more variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). NOT9C is most divergent and did not interact with phyA and NOT1 nor did it co-purify with CCR4-NOT in previous AP-MS approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arae et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, NOT9A and NOT9B both bind NOT1 but we only observed interaction of phyA and NOT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). We hypothesise that residues in NOT9A and NOT9B that correspond to the residues mutated in NOT9B ΔPNB possibly contribute to specify the NOT9A/B interaction profile. Y2H and CoIP from HEK293T cells show that no additional plant-specific proteins are required for NOT9B/phyA complex formation but we cannot formally rule out the possibility that components of the CCR4-NOT complex conserved in animals, yeast, and plants bridge between NOT9B and phyA in these assays. Yet, if phyA would bind indirectly to NOT9B through other components of the CCR4-NOT complex, we would also expect complex formation for phyA and both NOT9A and NOT1 in the Y2H assay and recruitment of NOT9A and NOT1 into phyA-dependent photobodies. However, we did not observe either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and therefore favour a model in which phyA directly binds NOT9B.</p><p>NOT9A and NOT9B co-precipitated with NOT1, NOT3, and CCR4b in previous AP-MS approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arae et al., 2019</xref>) but we did not find NOT9A among NOT9B associated proteins in our AP-MS experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, two pools of CCR4-NOT complexes, CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9A</sup> and CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup>, may exist that contain either NOT9A or NOT9B. Whether they differ regarding functionality is still unknown, but we expect that CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9A</sup> and CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> are different in terms of regulation by light, since phyA binds NOT9B but not NOT9A.</p><p>PhyA and NOT1 bind to the PNB site of NOT9B and several approaches provide evidence that binding to NOT9B is mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Increasing the levels of one PNB binding protein will therefore reduce interaction of NOT9B with the other PNB binding protein. PhyA is several orders of magnitude more abundant than NOT9B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>), and it is also expected to be more abundant and more dynamic than NOT1. Under such conditions, phyA likely has a greater impact on the regulation of the NOT9B-NOT1 interaction, than NOT1 on the phyA-NOT9B interaction. Nuclear localised NOT9B is sufficient for modulation of phyA mediated light signalling, which therefore does not depend on p-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–L</xref>). We propose that upon transport into the nucleus, phyA binds NOT9B and thereby displaces NOT9B from the CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Based on physiological and gene expression data, we propose a NOT1/phyA competition model and assume that CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> is the active unit that represses light signalling while the complex without NOT9B does not affect light responses. Both the light-dependence of phyA nuclear transport and the preferential interaction of NOT9B with phyA in the active Pfr state would contribute to disassembly of CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> specifically in FR light, which could explain the phyA- and FR light-specific phenotype of <italic>not9b</italic> mutant and NOT9Box seedlings. In an alternative phyA repression model, NOT9B could bind phyA and repress phyA activity. In contrast to the NOT1/phyA competition model, the effect of NOT9B on light signalling would be independent of the CCR4-NOT complex in the phyA repression model. However, we favour the NOT1/phyA competition model over the phyA repression model for three reasons. First of all, levels of endogenous NOT9B are much lower than levels of phyA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Under such conditions, efficient competition between NOT1 and phyA for binding NOT9B is possible for which we have experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, it appears unlikely that NOT9B levels, that are orders of magnitude lower than phyA levels, can efficiently repress phyA activity. Further insight could be gained by affinity measurements using heterologously expressed proteins, which also could support the notion that the phyA-NOT9B interaction is direct. Secondly, dark-grown <italic>not9b</italic> mutant seedlings show a partial <italic>constitutively photomorphogenic</italic> (<italic>cop</italic>) phenotype and are unable to fully suppress photomorphogenesis in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A</xref>). This finding is consistent with the NOT1/phyA competition model, whereas dark-grown <italic>not9b</italic> seedling should be fully etiolated in the phyA repression model. Lastly, if the phyA repression model were true, we would expect all phyA-regulated responses to be increased in the <italic>not9b</italic> mutant, which is not the case (i.e. cotyledon unfolding in FR light is reduced in <italic>not9b</italic>).</p><p>In general, <italic>not9b</italic> mutant and NOT9Box seedlings have opposite phenotypes. However, we observed that both <italic>not9b</italic> and NOT9Box seedlings are hyposensitive to light with regard to cotyledon opening and both show increased expression of a subset of light-induced genes in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A</xref>). A possible explanation for this seemingly counterintuitive observation is that NOT9B is part of a multimeric complex and could act as a linker protein between CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> and other proteins bound to NOT9B. In contrast to a dimeric complex, where increasing the level of one component does not have a negative effect on complex formation, there is an optimal concentration of the bridge protein at which a ternary complex is most abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douglass et al., 2013</xref>). For a hypothetical NOT1-NOT9B-protein X ternary complex, in which NOT9B is the bridge protein, increasing NOT9B levels above the optimal concentration would predominantly result in formation of NOT1-NOT9B and NOT9B-protein X dimeric complexes at the expense of the NOT1-NOT9B-protein X ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). Thus, if only the ternary complex is functional, <italic>not9b</italic> and NOT9Box seedlings can have the same phenotype. Different protein Xs may exist (protein X<sub>A</sub> and X<sub>B</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and associate with NOT9B to regulate light responses in a context-specific manner. The optimal concentration of NOT9B leading to highest levels of NOT1-NOT9B-protein X complexes depends on the concentration of protein X<sub>A</sub> and X<sub>B</sub> and their affinity for NOT9B. Therefore, overexpression of NOT9B may increase NOT9B levels to concentrations that favour the formation of ternary complexes with one protein X (protein X<sub>B</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1F</xref>), while the same NOT9B levels may exceed this optimal concentration for the assembly of ternary complexes with another protein X (protein X<sub>A</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1F</xref>). As a consequence, for some responses, NOT9Box lines and <italic>not9b</italic> mutants may show the same phenotype (responses depending on NOT1-NOT9B-protein X<sub>A</sub> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1F</xref>), while the phenotype of the mutant and the overexpression line may be opposite for other responses (responses depending on NOT1-NOT9B-protein X<sub>B</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, this hypothesis is difficult to test at the moment for three reasons: firstly, the concentrations of NOT1, NOT9B, and protein Xs in planta are unknown and they may vary depending on tissue and developmental stage, secondly, binding affinities for NOT1/NOT9B and NOT9B/protein Xs are unknown, and lastly, protein Xs themselves are unknown.</p><p>A potential approach to identify candidates for protein X is to use a line expressing exclusively nuclear localised NOT9B ΔPNB for AP-MS. In such an approach, we would expect to find nuclear localised proteins that associate with NOT9B through binding sites other than the PNB site. Potential candidates for X might directly or indirectly interact with NOT9B through the GWB motif but binding to yet unknown sites is also possible.</p><p>We found that AGO1 associates, possibly indirectly, with NOT9B and therefore AGO1 could be part of a protein complex that comprises a protein X. The GWB site in NOT9B corresponds to the binding site of TNRC6/GW182 proteins in the human NOT9B homologue CNOT9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mathys et al., 2014</xref>), and AGO proteins bind to GW-repeats in TNRC6/GW182 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lazzaretti et al., 2009</xref>). Plants lack sequence homologues of TNRC6/GW182 but they contain proteins with GW-repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pfaff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karlowski et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that a still unknown GW-repeat containing protein could bind NOT9B at the GWB site and link it to AGO1. A potential function of AGO1 in a CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup>-AGO1 complex could be to recruit CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> to specific sites in the genome. Target sites of such complexes could be defined by small RNAs bound by AGO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2018</xref>), while activities linked to CCR4-NOT could affect the transcription at the target site. Potential small RNAs in complex with CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup>-AGO1 could be identified by immunoprecipitation on an NLS-YFP-NOT9B expressing line followed by smallRNAseq.</p><p>Interestingly, we found that phyA-dependent regulation of splice site selection is disturbed in the <italic>not9b</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and several proteins involved in splicing co-purified with NOT9B in the AP-MS approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Ago2, an AGO protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was shown to regulate alternative splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Rio, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taliaferro et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that nuclear localised AGO1 in complex with CCR4-NOT<sup>NOT9B</sup> could play a role in splice site selection in Arabidopsis and that NOT9B through its specific interaction with phyA could put this event under FR light control.</p><p>In this study, we identified NOT9B as novel phyA interacting protein providing a potential link between light signalling and the evolutionary conserved CCR4-NOT complex. We show that NOT9B is involved in light-dependent development of plants, and suggest a competition-based mode of action that depends on displacement of NOT9B from the CCR4-NOT complex by light-activated phyA. These findings can provide a basis for understanding of how light signalling in plants could feed into central processes common to all eukaryotes, such as mRNA metabolism. Future research will need to reveal the molecular mechanisms that connect the evolutionary ancient CCR4-NOT complex to gene expression in plants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>NOT9B</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">AT5G12980</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>PHYA</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">AT1G09570</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>NOT1</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">AT1G02080</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>AGO1</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">AT1G48410</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293T</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.atcc.org/">https://www.atcc.org/</ext-link></td><td valign="top">293T (ATCC CRL-3216)</td><td valign="top">Cell line maintained by Core Facility Signalling Factory, University of Freiburg,</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>not9b-1</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sessions et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="top">SAIL_584_D02/NASC N824896</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>not9b-2</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso, 2003</xref></td><td valign="top">SALKseq_39334/NASC N925357</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>ago1-27</italic></td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.arabidopsis.org/">https://www.arabidopsis.org/</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morel et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="top">n/a</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td valign="top">35S:HA-YFP-NOT9B</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">ATPS06</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">αPHYA (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Agrisera, Vännäs, Sweden</td><td valign="top">AS07 220</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1,500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">αAGO1 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Agrisera, Vännäs, <break/>Sweden</td><td valign="top">AS09 527</td><td valign="top">WB (1:2,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">35S:HA-YFP-NOT9B</td><td valign="top">this paper</td><td valign="top">DS361</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Anti-GFP MicroBeads</td><td valign="top">Miltenyi</td><td valign="top">130-091-125</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Phycocyano-billin (PCB)</td><td valign="top">Frontier Scientific, Logan, Utah</td><td valign="top">FSIP14137</td><td valign="top">n/a</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning</title><p>All vectors, oligonucleotides, and gBlocks used in this study have either been described previously or are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

For FRET-FLIM analyses, the lifetime of the donor fluorophore YFP was compared between the leek cells that express YFP-tagged protein alone or co-expressed with mCherry-tagged proteins. YFP was excited with a pulsed picosecond laser at 470 nm (detection gate of 521–549 nm, and a frequency of 40 MHz) and the emission signals were detected by HyD SMD hybrid detector (Leica Microsystems). In the same cell the expression of mCherry- (excited by a 561 nm PMT laser with detection gating of 620–730 nm) tagged proteins (if co-expressed) was also detected. The fluorescence lifetime of YFP was determined by Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) using FLIM hardware from PicoQuant (PicoQuant GmbH, Berlin, Germany).

A total of 100 μl Anti-GFP MicroBeads (Miltenyi, Cat-No: 130-091-125) were added to the supernatant and incubated for 2 hr in darkness at 4°C. The pulldown was performed as indicated in the manufacturers protocol. Elution was done using 3× 50 μl 0.1 M TEA pH 13.1 and directly neutralised with 3 μl 1 M MES pH 2. Eluate fractions 1, 2, and 3 were combined (approx. 140–150 μl with pH 6–7) and 200 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8 was added to obtain a total volume of 200 μl. The disulfide bonds in the proteins were reduced with TCEP and the free sulfhydrils derivatised with MMTS. Proteins were then precipitated with cold acetone (6× volume) overnight at −20°C. The washed pellets were rehydrated in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer pH 8 at 37°C for 1 hr, then trypsin was added and the proteins digested overnight. An aliquot of the digests was analysed by LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer on-line coupled to a Waters nanoAcquity UPLC in data-dependent fashion using HCD fragmentation as follows. Five μl of the sample was loaded onto a Waters Symmetry trap column (C18, 5 μm, 180 μm × 20 mm) in 99% solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) at a flow rate of 5 μl min<sup>−1</sup> for 5 min. Peptides were separated by increasing solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) from 5% to 35% in 90 min, then to 50% in 5 min and up to 90% in 4 min.

publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The revised version of your manuscript provides additional evidences that support the existence of a direct regulatory link between phyA and CCR4-NOT complex component NOT9B to regulate far-red (FR) light signaling in Arabidopsis. According to the proposed model, NOT9B acts as a negative regulator of early seedling development, acting downstream of phyA. Subcellular localization and protein-protein interaction assays show that such a function occurs mainly at the nucleus, where active phyA competes with NOT1, a central component of CCR4-NOT complexes, for interaction with NOT9B. As a result, NOT9B is recruited into photobodies together with phyA, which likely impairs NOT9B function in the control of alternative splicing and FR light-regulated gene expression.</p><p>In sum, this study describes a novel function for phyA as a repressor of CCR4-NOT complex component NOT9B, a negative regulator of FR light signaling in Arabidopsis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Unexpected function of the CCR4-NOT complex in phytochrome A-mediated light signalling in plants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Vicente Rubio as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Whereas the data provided convincingly show a functional connection between phyA and NOT9B to regulate seedling development in response to FR light, much less is known on how NOT9B controls gene expression and developmental responses downstream of phyA. It is proposed, based on phenotypic similarities between <italic>not9b</italic> and <italic>ago1</italic> mutants and affinity copurification of both NOT9B and AGO1, that AGO1 could mediate, at least partly, NOT9B functions in FR light signaling. Genetic analysis of the effect of <italic>ago1</italic> mutation in NOT9B overexpressing lines would be highly desirable to evaluate the contribution of AGO1 to NOT9B-mediated repression of FR responses. However, such a line might not be available at this point, precluding its characterization in a timely manner. A feasible alternative is to analyze the transcriptomic behavior of lines with altered NOT9B and AGO1 function (already available), by means of simple RNA seq analyses, both under dark and FR light conditions. Such RNAseq analysis would be also very helpful to assess the extent to which the gene expression changes reflect the complex phenotypic changes that the authors show. In some cases, the mutant and OX lines display similar phenotypes. The authors provide explanations for this, but a comprehensive gene expression analysis as opposed to choosing a limited number of genes would give a broader picture of the visible and molecular phenotypes regulated by these complexes.

It is proposed, based on phenotypic similarities between not9b and ago1 mutants and affinity copurification of both NOT9B and AGO1, that AGO1 could mediate, at least partly, NOT9B functions in FR light signaling. Genetic analysis of the effect of ago1 mutation in NOT9B overexpressing lines would be highly desirable to evaluate the contribution of AGO1 to NOT9B-mediated repression of FR responses. However, such a line might not be available at this point, precluding its characterization in a timely manner. A feasible alternative is to analyze the transcriptomic behavior of lines with altered NOT9B and AGO1 function (already available), by means of simple RNA seq analyses, both under dark and FR light conditions. Such RNAseq analysis would be also very helpful to assess the extent to which the gene expression changes reflect the complex phenotypic changes that the authors show. In some cases, the mutant and OX lines display similar phenotypes. The authors provide explanations for this, but a comprehensive gene expression analysis as opposed to choosing a limited number of genes would give a broader picture of the visible and molecular phenotypes regulated by these complexes. Moreover, these analyses might help to identify additional alternative splicing events controlled by the phyA-NOT9B-AGO1 module during FR light signaling, which is limited to a single gene in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting experiment and we plan to do it in the future, yet it is not possible at the moment and would considerably delay publication of our current manuscript. The take home message of the current manuscript is that NOT9B and the CCR4-NOT complex play a role in light signalling and that phyA can regulate CCR4-NOT, which is novel and interesting as acknowledged by the reviewers. As the conclusions of the manuscript do not depend on this experiment, you have previously agreed that this experiment is not required for the revised version of the manuscript to be accepted for publication for which we are very grateful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, a key observation in the proposed model is the mutually-exclusive binding of NOT9B to NOT1 and phyA that is regulating early events in gene expression.

We also showed that the long hypocotyl phenotype of NOT9Box lines is partially rescued by overexpression of NOT1 M. The reviewers suggested to further confirm this (partial) complementation by testing for complementation of gene expression defects of NOT9Box by overexpression of NOT1 M. We performed this experiment and data presented in Figure 6—figure supplement 5 show that overexpression of NOT1 M partially rescues the NOT9Box gene expression defect for representative light marker genes (<italic>ELIP1</italic>, <italic>ELIP2</italic>, <italic>CHS</italic>). Expression levels for all three genes are still lower in NOT9Box NOT1 Mox double transgenic seedlings than in the wildtype control, but expression levels are significantly higher than in the NOT9Box line not overexpressing the NOT1 M transgene. This finding is fully consistent with the partial rescue of the hypocotyl growth phenotype of NOT9Box by overexpression NOT1 M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, for a protein to function analysis in such a large complex, it is difficult to assess pairwise interaction using yeast-two-hybrid or in vivo immunoprecipitation assays as these proteins might be in a complex and show interaction even in yeast.

The HEK293T CoIP data presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 4 confirm that phyA and NOT9B are in complex. Y2H and HEK293T CoIP data show that no additional plant-specific proteins are required for phyA/NOT9B complex formation but we cannot formally rule out the possibility that components of the CCR4-NOT complex conserved in animals, yeast, and plants (and therefore present in yeast and HEK293T cells) bridge between NOT9B and phyA in these assays. Yet, if phyA would bind indirectly to NOT9B through other components of the CCR4-NOT complex, we would expect complex formation for phyA and both NOT9A and NOT1 in the Y2H assay and recruitment of NOT9A and NOT1 into phyA-dependent photobodies. However, we did not observe either. Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewers that we cannot formally exclude that components of the CCR4-NOT complex might bridge between phyA and NOT9B in the Y2H or CoIP assays, which we point out in the Discussion of the revised version of the manuscript. Furthermore, we also mention that testing complex formation of heterologously expressed phyA and NOT9B could prove a direct interaction. However, both phyA and NOT9B are very difficult to express in <italic>E. coli</italic> and therefore such an experiment is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Instead, we have modified the interaction statements in the manuscript as suggested by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regard to the title, this study unveils an unknown mechanism by which phyA regulates the function of downstream factors acting at the nucleus to control RNA metabolism and gene expression in response to FR light.
