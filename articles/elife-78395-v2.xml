supported by distinct connectivity states, with strong input to the hippocampus benefitting encoding and weak input benefitting retrieval. Previous research in rodents suggests that the hippocampal theta oscillation orchestrates the transition between these states, with opposite phase angles predicting minimal versus maximal input. We investigated whether this phase dependence exists in humans using network-targeted intracranial stimulation. Intracranial local field potentials were recorded from individuals with epilepsy undergoing medically necessary stereotactic electroencephalographic recording. In each subject, biphasic bipolar direct electrical stimulation was delivered to lateral temporal sites with demonstrated connectivity to hippocampus. Lateral temporal stimulation evoked ipsilateral hippocampal potentials with distinct early and late components. Using evoked component amplitude to measure functional connectivity, we assessed whether the phase of hippocampal theta predicted relatively high versus low connectivity. We observed an increase in the continuous phase–amplitude relationship selective to the early and late components of the response evoked by lateral temporal stimulation. The maximal difference in these evoked component amplitudes occurred across 180 degrees of separation in the hippocampal theta rhythm; that is, the greatest difference in component amplitude was observed when stimulation was delivered at theta peak versus trough. The pattern of theta-phase dependence observed for hippocampus was not identified for control locations. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal receptivity to input varies with theta phase, suggesting that theta phase reflects connectivity states of human hippocampal networks. These findings confirm a putative mechanism by which neural oscillations modulate human hippocampal function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>theta</kwd><kwd>phase</kwd><kwd>iEEG</kwd><kwd>CCEP</kwd><kwd>stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS113804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voss</surname><given-names>Joel L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31MH125577</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lurie</surname><given-names>Sarah M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human hippocampal connectivity to network afferents varies continuously with the phase of the local theta oscillation, confirming a putative mechanism by which neural oscillations modulate human hippocampal function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Episodic memory encoding and retrieval are thought to involve distinct hippocampal functional connectivity states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hasselmo and Stern, 2014</xref>). During memory formation, fragments of episodic information are bound into coherent memory traces by the hippocampus. This process is thought to benefit from increased input via connectivity of entorhinal cortex to CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maass et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brankack et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernández et al., 1999</xref>) along with reduced recurrent hippocampal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>). This connectivity pattern is thought to enhance the strength of incoming sensory signals while preventing interference from memory reactivation. Retrieval involves hippocampal-dependent reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waldhauser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gelbard-Sagiv et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tayler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eichenbaum, 2000</xref>), which is thought to benefit from the opposite functional connectivity pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hasselmo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duncan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montgomery and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In rodents, hippocampal theta oscillations orchestrate the transition between these distinct connectivity states. Rodent hippocampal theta synchrony supports memory formation and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Markowska et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Winson, 1978</xref>), with different theta phases thought to support opposing functional connectivity patterns. For instance, tetanic electrical stimulation of hippocampal CA1 results in long-term potentiation when delivered at the stratum radiatum theta peak versus long-term depression when delivered at the trough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hölscher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hyman et al., 2003</xref>), supporting a theta-phase dependence of encoding readiness. In addition, disrupting the theta cycle with inhibitory stimulation locked to local peak versus trough has been shown to differentially impact encoding and retrieval in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>).</p><p>It is currently unclear whether human hippocampus shows the phase dependence of receptivity to external input that has been identified in rodents, particularly given the numerous differences in human versus rodent hippocampal theta characteristics including the presence and functional relevance of high-power oscillatory bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goyal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kahana et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raghavachari et al., 2001</xref>). The goal of the present experiment was to test predictions of this theta-phase dependence model in humans. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the hippocampus in patients undergoing intracranial electrophysiological recording via implanted depth electrodes as part of their clinical care. We applied direct electrical stimulation to hippocampal network sites in lateral temporal cortex with putative projections to entorhinal cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Insausti et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catani and Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhong and Rockland, 2004</xref>), and measured the hippocampal response to lateral temporal stimulation using well-characterized early and late evoked-potential components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsumoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novitskaya et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that if hippocampal receptivity to network input varies with the theta oscillation, then the hippocampal response to stimulation would differ according to hippocampal theta phase at the time of stimulation delivery. In rodents, fissural theta trough versus peak are the phases commonly related to maximal versus minimal receptivity to external input (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hasselmo, 2005</xref>). However, previous studies in rodents have reported disparate phase angles relating to maximal entorhinal–hippocampal transmission, likely due to differences across studies in the targeted hippocampal layer. Because the theta oscillation arises from interlaminar dipoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goutagny et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kamondi et al., 1998</xref>), its observed phase varies according to electrode depth. Studies in rodents have therefore reported maximal entorhinal input variously at the recorded hippocampal trough (from fissural recording, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brankack et al., 1993</xref>), peak (from pyramidal layer recording, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Douchamps et al., 2013</xref>), and falling phases (from recording in variable layers; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Siegle and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Thus, we anticipated 180 degree separation in phases associated with maximal versus minimal receptivity in humans, without strong hypotheses for which phase angles would be associated with these states given the localization uncertainty in electrodes placed for clinical purposes in human subjects. We therefore tested this hypothesis by first analyzing continuous variation in amplitude based on theta phase following stimulation. We used a novel method to account for the phase dependence of amplitude values that occurs irrespective of stimulation. To test selectivity, we analyzed theta-phase dependence for non-hippocampal control locations in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants and stimulation protocol</title><p>Data were collected from eight individuals with refractory epilepsy (two males; mean age ± standard deviation [SD]: 37 ± 10 years; range 28–55 years; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) undergoing invasive electrophysiological monitoring as part of their inpatient clinical care at the Northwestern Memorial Hospital Comprehensive Epilepsy Center.

Using the same peak-finding method that identified peaks in the EP (see Materials and methods: Quantification of hippocampal EPs), we found peaks in the phase–amplitude relationship at +50 and +135 ms following stimulation onset, which aligns closely with the early and late EP components (+62 and +134 ms, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Stimulation trials also exhibited a sharp local decrease from approximately +0 to +5 ms following stimulation, likely due to phase-independent artifact during and immediately after the stimulation pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

We constructed an LME model for each response component with a fixed effect of phase and random effects on slope and intercept of both subject and electrode nested within subject [i.e., response amplitude ~ phase + (phase|subject/electrode)]. We then performed likelihood ratio tests to assess whether this model fit was improved by the inclusion of the fixed effect of phase. That is, after accounting for participant variance, we tested whether stimulation phase improved the prediction of response amplitude. Including the phase effect improved the model fit for the early component, with a marginal effect in the late component (one-sided likelihood ratio test for improvement, early: LRStat = 3.8, p = 0.05; late: LRStat = 3.3, p = 0.06). We then repeated this process using amplitude values from the isolated evoked response (i.e., following correction for non-evoked oscillatory activity, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The effect of phase was reduced in these models (early: LRStat = 2.8, p = 0.09; late: LRStat = 0.9, p = 0.3), in accordance with the observed reduction in peak versus trough differences at the electrode level following correction for non-evoked oscillatory activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated whether the human hippocampus varies in receptivity to external stimulation along with the local theta oscillation. Lateral temporal stimulation consistently evoked a hippocampal response with distinct early and late negative components. These component amplitudes were found to vary continuously with theta phase at stimulation onset. The continuous relationship between phase at stimulation onset and EP amplitude showed temporal specificity, with a notable increase during the early component. We additionally found that stimulation at theta peak versus theta trough yielded maximal differences in evoked response amplitude. This effect was most pronounced during the early negative component (27–113 ms after stimulation onset), where it persisted even after corrections for non-evoked oscillatory activity which emerged from the phase-sorting procedure. These findings suggest that human hippocampal connectivity to network afferents varies across the local theta oscillation.</p><p>As data in this study were collected opportunistically from participants undergoing clinically necessary invasive monitoring, hippocampal electrodes were implanted at variable laminar depths that could not be known due to the relative imprecision of CT/MRI. Nonetheless, we observed a consistent effect of phase angle on the recorded hippocampal response. The relatively small phase offset we observed between hippocampal sites from a given participant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>) supports that the recorded oscillation was depth indifferent, perhaps owing to the large size and interlaminar placement of the macroelectrodes. Further studies would be necessary to determine subfield and layer-specific phase angles conferring maximum entorhinal input to the human hippocampus.</p><p>The observed effect of peak versus trough is likely specific to the synaptic distance and conduction delay between the stimulation site and hippocampus. While stimulating electrodes were all located in lateral temporal cortex, their gyral locations varied according to clinical constraints. Accordingly, while phase offsets between lateral temporal cortex and hippocampus were non-uniform (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>), there were pronounced differences in the offset angle between participants. It is possible that differences in transmission latencies contributed to the observed variance in peak–trough effects across participants. We hypothesize that stimulation targeting a different site in the hippocampal network would produce a similarly theta-periodic hippocampal response, albeit likely maximized at a different stimulation phase angle (i.e., not necessarily at the observed hippocampal theta peak). Further, it is possible that the relationship of theta phase to the evoked response amplitude varies with theta power, although we were methodologically unable to assess theta power on a per-trial basis. Our exploratory analyses of theta power during an offline period did not find any relationship between power and the phase–amplitude relationship (see Appendix 1: Offline theta bout incidence does not impact periodicity of the evoked response), although quantifying power during a period other than stimulation is not ideal. Future research could address this issue, potentially by cueing stimulation based on an online assessment of theta power.</p><p>One limitation is that this study was performed in individuals with refractory epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy is associated with episodic memory impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayeux et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helmstaedter and Kockelmann, 2006</xref>) thought to be caused by structural abnormalities as well as interictal epileptiform activity in the hippocampus and hippocampal cortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Helmstaedter and Kockelmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gelinas et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, iEEG recordings from individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy have previously been used to study mechanisms for hippocampal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lega et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wixted et al., 2014</xref>). To enhance the study’s generalizability, we rejected trials with recorded epileptiform activity and ensured during data collection that the stimulation protocol did not elicit afterdischarges or spiking. It is nonetheless unclear whether epilepsy-related changes to hippocampal structure and network connectivity influenced our findings.</p><p>Phase dependence of the response to stimulation has, however, been demonstrated in non-epilepsy model organisms. Previous studies have reported phase-dependent responses to external stimulation across diverse neocortical areas. Direct electrical stimulation of sensory cortices has been found to differentially induce long-term potentiation or depression depending on LFP phase e.g., with beta- and gamma-dependence in rodent visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wespatat et al., 2004</xref>) and beta-dependence in primate sensorimotor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zanos et al., 2018</xref>). In humans, local oscillatory phase has been found to relate to the amplitude of the cortical response evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kundu et al., 2014</xref>). These findings support that oscillatory phase relates generally to local excitability. Thus, one part of our analysis strategy was to assess whether any observed phase dependence was specific to (or specifically enhanced in) hippocampus. We investigated the phase dependence of stimulation response in two control regions: amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. Like hippocampus, both regions have anatomical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi and Cassell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iwai et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morecraft et al., 1992</xref>) and functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2020</xref>) connectivity with the lateral temporal stimulation site. But while amygdala is physically adjacent to hippocampus and densely connected with hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saunders et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pikkarainen et al., 1999</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chrobak et al., 2000</xref>) – and might therefore be expected to show hippocampus-like phase dependence of input receptivity – orbitofrontal cortex is more distant both in space and connectivity. Indeed, we observed significant theta-phase dependence in the amygdala EP but no such effect in orbitofrontal cortex. As was the case in hippocampus, the amygdala showed greater response amplitude when stimulation was applied at theta peak relative to trough. The amygdala also showed greater response amplitude to stimulation at theta rising phase relative to falling phase. Unlike in hippocampus, this effect was present exclusively in the late component. The presence of early components in the amygdala and orbitofrontal EPs supports connectivity between these control regions and the lateral temporal stimulation site. However, we note that the stimulation site was chosen on the basis of its functional connectivity with hippocampus as measured via the stimulation-evoked potential, and not based on connectivity with these other brain areas. Performing network-targeted stimulation for each control region could provide stronger evidence for the effect’s selectivity to hippocampus.</p><p>This study used direct electrical stimulation as a proxy for endogenous network signaling. Follow-up studies are required to assess whether and how these changes in human hippocampal connectivity due to theta phase relate to memory processing. Nonetheless, by demonstrating phase dependence of input receptivity in the human hippocampus, this study suggests a homology with the phase dependence previously characterized in rodent models in relation to memory encoding and retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Electrode localization</title><p>sEEG electrodes were localized using MRIcron (v1.0.20190902; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rorden and Brett, 2000</xref>) and the Statistical Parametric Mapping package (SPM12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Penny et al., 2011</xref>).

This was done separately for each electrode because theta-phase shifts across space in the hippocampus. In depth penetrations of rodent CA1, theta phase is stable through the strata oriens and pyramidale then undergoes a gradual phase shift, resulting in a 180° phase difference at the fissure compared to dorsal layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brankack et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bragin et al., 1995</xref>). Rodent hippocampal theta phase has been found to fully reverse between the longitudinal poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2012</xref>) i.e., the ‘traveling wave’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>). Monotonic phase shift across the long axis has also been demonstrated to occur within individual CA subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>). In LFPs recorded along the human hippocampus via implanted depth electrodes, theta phase has been found to shift monotonically across the hippocampal long axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang and Jacobs, 2015</xref>). Studies of hippocampal theta in rodent models often estimate phase at the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of CA1, near the hippocampal fissure. Besides the benefit of fissural theta’s especially high amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brankack et al., 1993</xref>), this approach provides a unitary measure of hippocampal theta phase. In humans, it is not feasible to control for these spatial phase shifts by recording uniformly at any specific site in hippocampus. This is because electrodes are placed according to clinical need, and their locations vary across subjects in both laminar depth and location on the long axis.</p><p>LFPs recorded from human depth electrodes generally reflect a sum of phase-asynchronous laminar inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">West and Gundersen, 1990</xref>) weighted by distance from the contributing layer to the electrode. As the phase shift is stable across layers and septotemporal distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lubenov and Siapas, 2009</xref>), phase at a given electrode has a consistent offset to other hippocampal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang and Jacobs, 2015</xref>). Thus, to account for this offset, we estimated phase independently for each electrode. First, trial epochs were truncated at +50 ms (i.e., 50 ms following stimulation onset) to avoid contamination of the phase estimate by the stimulation EP. After applying a zero-phase bandpass-filter (3–8 Hz second-order Butterworth IIR), we estimated phase angle at the time of stimulation onset using the Hilbert transform.</p><p>We assessed the accuracy of this approach using stimulation-free pseudotrials. For each hippocampal electrode, we first performed zero-phase bandpass filtering (3–8 Hz, second-order Butterworth IIR) across a continuous stimulation-free period (from the same recording as used in the main analysis). We then applied the Hilbert transform to obtain ground-truth phase angles for each timepoint. We created stimulation-free trials by pseudorandomly selecting trial-length epochs during this stimulation-free period. We observed the ground-truth phase values at the timepoints corresponding to each trial’s mock stimulation onset. Epochs from the first and last 5 s of the recording sessions were excluded to reduce filter edge artifact contamination.</p><p>Next, we created an ostensibly phase-balanced model of stimulation for each channel by binning stimulation trials at 90° intervals (centered at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) and computing the grand average across bins. We added this model stimulation to each stimulation-free trial, yielding pseudotrials. We estimated pseudotrial phase angle at <italic>t</italic> = 0 using the approach described for stimulation trials and compared the estimates to the ground-truth phase angles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of narrowband theta activity</title><p>To assess whether theta-frequency activity was present in hippocampus and control regions, we characterized narrowband activity across the power spectrum during a continuous stimulation-free period (from the same recording as used in the main analysis; all rest periods had duration &gt;90 s). We estimated oscillatory power at 50 logarithmically spaced frequency intervals from 1 to 50 Hz using the fast Fourier transform. To identify frequencies where reliable oscillations were present, we first estimated the background 1/<italic>f</italic> power spectrum using a robust linear fit to the log–log scaled power spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lega et al., 2012</xref>). We subtracted this background from the power spectrum and identified positive local maxima in the resultant curves, following four-frequency boxcar smoothing to eliminate noisy peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lega et al., 2012</xref>). We performed this analysis for individual electrodes as well as for the mean power spectrum across all analyzed electrodes within each ROI. For each identified peak frequency, we assessed whether its power consistently exceeded the background 1/<italic>f</italic> spectrum by performing one-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests of the corrected spectrum power versus 0 across electrodes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification of hippocampal EPs</title><p>As a measure of the hippocampal response to stimulation, we quantified the trialwise amplitudes of early and late components in the stimulation EP. We first estimated component timecourses for each electrode. To avoid phase-dependent differences in component shape or timecourse from biasing this estimate (i.e., in the case of non-uniform stimulation phase distributions), we computed a phase-balanced EP for each electrode by binning stimulation trials according to theta phase at stimulation onset (at 90° intervals, centered at 0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) and computing the mean across bins. We then observed the grand average phase-balanced trial across electrodes. We quantified component timecourses by searching for the first two negative minima following stimulation artifact (on a search window of +20 to +500 ms after stimulation; see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kubota et al., 2013</xref>) on the grand average trial across electrodes. Component edges were estimated as the nearest inflection points within 150 ms of the local maximum. A minimum interval of 50 ms was required between peaks. For each trial, we computed the average signal amplitude across each component timecourse. This method was selected rather than peak estimation (as in e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsumoto et al., 2004</xref>) in order to produce a more noise-indifferent estimate for single trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Circular–linear analysis of theta phase and hippocampal response amplitude</title><p>We performed circular–linear analyses to determine whether the hippocampal response varied continuously with theta phase at stimulation onset. For each electrode, we found the circular–linear correlation coefficient between phase at stimulation onset and component amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berens, 2009</xref>). We <italic>z</italic>-scored these values via permutation testing (<italic>n</italic> = 500), wherein each electrode’s trial phase values and component amplitudes were repeatedly randomly paired. The circular–linear correlations were evaluated using a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test comparing the electrode <italic>z</italic>-scores against zero. To investigate the timecourse of the continuous phase–amplitude relationship, we performed a follow-up timepoint analysis. For each electrode, we computed the circular–linear correlation coefficient between phase at stimulation onset and EP amplitude at every timepoint. We identified peaks in the phase–amplitude relationship by searching for the first two maxima following stimulation artifact (on a search window of +20 to +500 ms after stimulation). This method was modified from our procedure to identify components in the EP amplitude timecourse (see Quantification of hippocampal EPs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Comparison of hippocampal EPs by binned theta phase</title><p>To test how specific phase angles were related to hippocampal responsiveness to stimulation, we analyzed trials according to theta phase at stimulation onset. We estimated local broadband theta phase at stimulation onset for each trial and binned trials to 90° intervals, centered on peak, trough, rising, and falling phase angles. By taking the means within each bin, we obtained average peak, trough, rising and falling stimulation trials for each electrode. We then compared component amplitudes across peak versus trough and rising versus falling trials using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Comparison of stimulation trials to phase-matched stimulation-free trials</title><p>Direct comparison of component amplitudes according to phase at stimulation onset is complicated because oscillatory phase necessarily predicts future amplitude, regardless of any phase-dependent differences in the effects of stimulation on EPs. We therefore used stimulation-free trials to account for the ongoing theta oscillation. Stimulation-free trials were captured for each electrode at 100-ms intervals across stimulation-free periods at the beginning and end of the recordings. Stimulation-free trials were recorded and preprocessed using the same approach as stimulation trials (for trial pruning by kurtosis, kurtosis scores were compared only to other stimulation-free trials from the same channel). Phase was estimated for each trial at <italic>t</italic> = 0 using the same methods as for stimulation trials (i.e., truncating at +50 ms after stimulation onset, filtering, and applying the Hilbert transform). In order to more closely match the non-evoked activity present in the stimulation trials, we randomly resampled stimulation-free trials using the phase angle distributions of the stimulation trials as sampling weights.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Timepoint analysis of EP amplitude following stimulation at theta peak versus trough</title><p>As a follow-up to our finding of peak versus trough effects on component amplitudes, we investigated whether phase dependence was temporally restricted to components. For each electrode, we computed the difference between average peak and trough trials at each timepoint. To assess the contribution of the non-evoked signal over time, we repeated this procedure on stimulation-free trials. To measure phase dependence related to the evoked signal, we compared peak–trough amplitude differences across stimulation and stimulation-free trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Oscillatory synchronization between the stimulation site and hippocampus</title><p>Although we estimated hippocampal theta-phase angle at the time of stimulation onset to avoid bias from the evoked response, this timepoint is not the most relevant to hippocampal receptivity to external input. As stimulation was applied to lateral temporal network afferents and conveyed via polysynaptic signaling, there was likely some latency between stimulation onset and the relevant transmission to hippocampus (i.e., the timepoint when entorhinal input receptivity would be relevant).</p><p>Oscillatory synchronization (i.e., phase coupling) is a known mechanism that supports interregional communication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fries, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fell and Axmacher, 2011</xref>). We therefore estimated this latency by observing theta-phase locking and phase offset between the stimulation site and hippocampus. First, we estimated 3–8 Hz theta-phase angle for each electrode across a continuous, stimulation-free period in the recording. For each timepoint, we then obtained the angular distance between each hippocampal electrode and its corresponding lateral temporal electrode that was used for stimulation. We thereby computed the phase-locking value (PLV; mean resultant vector length of lateral temporal–hippocampal angular distance on the unit circle) and mean phase offset (the circular mean of lateral temporal–hippocampal angular distances) for each hippocampal electrode.</p><p>We applied the Rayleigh test to the mean phase offsets to assess whether the phase lag distribution was uniform. We used permutation testing to determine whether the observed phase locking was greater than expected by chance. To achieve this, we broke the continuous hippocampal and lateral temporal phase estimates into 500-ms epochs. We then obtained the mean PLV across all epochs. To <italic>z</italic>-score these PLVs, we used permutation testing (<italic>n</italic> = 500), wherein hippocampal and lateral temporal epochs were repeatedly randomly paired. We performed a one-sample <italic>t</italic>-test comparing <italic>z</italic>-scores against zero to assess phase locking.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation.

consistent with ground-truth phase values in analysis of stimulation-free pseudotrials</title><p>The method we used to estimate hippocampal theta phase at the time of stimulation involved truncating the hippocampal recordings shortly after each stimulation pulse (see Materials and methods: Theta-phase estimation). We assessed whether this approach yielded an accurate estimate of phase (i.e., one based on the ongoing oscillatory activity and without contamination by the evoked response or filter artifact) using ‘pseudotrials’, epochs made from data collected during a continuous, stimulation-free period with an added model stimulation pulse and EP. We estimated the phase of these pseudotrials at mock stimulation onset (i.e., <italic>t</italic> = 0) using the same approach as for stimulation trials. As pseudotrials were created from continuous, stimulation-free data, we were also able to calculate ‘ground-truth’ phase values (i.e., obtained in the absence of stimulation artifact or EP and without truncating the recording). We then measured the trialwise differences between ground-truth and estimated phase angles.</p><p>Across hippocampal recording electrodes, the mean difference between ground-truth and estimated phase was −11.2° (mean distance ± SD: −11.2 ± 4.6°). This difference was highly concentrated (Rayleigh test: <italic>z</italic>(22) = 22.9, p &lt; 0.001), indicating consistency of the phase angle estimate performance across electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref>). Although estimated phase angles were significantly more concentrated than ground-truth phase angles (two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test on mean resultant vector lengths, <italic>t</italic>(22) = 7.4, p &lt; 0.001, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 2.1), the distribution of mean estimated phase angles was uniform (Hodges–Ajne test: <italic>m</italic>(22) = 9, p = 0.9). These findings demonstrate that the estimation approach introduced a small and consistent phase angle bias.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phase estimation method yielded consistent, low-magnitude offset to ground-truth phase in pseudotrial analysis.</title><p>Comparison of ground-truth and estimated phase angles from pseudotrials (stimulation-free resting data with added model stimulation artifact and EP).

Because the phase estimation approach involves truncating the epoch at +50 ms following stimulation onset, signal after this point does not contribute to the phase estimate. Theta coherence therefore decreases asymmetrically about <italic>t</italic> = 0, with a more rapid dropoff after <italic>t</italic> = 0 than before it. In contrast, trials binned according to ground-truth phase show symmetrical declines in coherence before and after <italic>t</italic> = 0.</p><p>To assess whether this bias impacted our analyses, we re-performed our binning analyses after accounting for each electrode’s estimated bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b</xref>). In other words, we adjusted the phase angle label for each trial according to the electrode-specific bias. After this correction, we observed the same pattern of phase dependence as in the original analysis, with enhancement of the EP by stimulation at peak versus trough in both early and late components (early: <italic>t</italic>(22) = −2.5, p = 0.02, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = −0.2; late: <italic>t</italic>(22) = −2.7, p = 0.01, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = −0.09) and no effect of falling versus rising phase stimulation (early: <italic>t</italic>(22) = −0.22, p = 0.8, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = −0.02; late: <italic>t</italic>(22) = 0.15, p = 0.9, Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 0.007). Rebinning did not impact the results of the continuous, circular–linear analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Order of stimulation pulses had no effect on phase distribution</title><p>One possible alternative explanation for the observed relationship between phase and EP amplitude was that over the course of the experimental session, stimulation induced changes in both the distribution of phase angles at stimulation onset and in the amplitude of the evoked response. We therefore performed control analyses to assess whether the theta-phase distribution of stimulation pulses and their associated hippocampal evoked responses changed according to order in the experimental session.</p><p>For each hippocampal electrode, we divided stimulation trials into quartiles according to order of occurrence in the stimulation session.

Bout incidence in the hippocampus and broader hippocampal network has been associated with spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kahana et al., 1999</xref>) and performance of non-spatial memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raghavachari et al., 2001</xref>). Given the relevance of theta bouts to hippocampal function, we investigated whether the observed theta-phase dependence of response amplitude was stronger in electrodes with greater bout incidence. As estimates of theta power during the stimulation protocol would be contaminated by the evoked response, we analyzed theta bout incidence during stimulation-free rest just prior to the experimental session. We used this measure as a proxy for the proportion of stimulation trials we expected to occur during periods of high theta power.</p><p>For each hippocampal electrode, we performed bout detection in the 3–8 Hz range during continuous periods of stimulation-free rest using the BOSC toolbox (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitten et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hughes et al., 2012</xref>). First, we computed power across the stimulation-free period using the Morlet wavelet transform (<italic>w<sub>0</sub></italic> = 6; 50 frequency samples spaced logarithmically from 1 to 60 Hz). To isolate significant oscillations, we fit a 1/<italic>f</italic> background power spectrum for each electrode by performing robust linear regression on the time-averaged power spectrum in log–log space. Then, for each sampled frequency, we identified timepoints where power exceeded the 95th percentile of the estimated <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup> probability distribution of the background spectrum for a minimum duration of three cycles. We thereby obtained a theta bout rate for each hippocampal electrode corresponding to the proportion of the recording where high-power oscillations were present in any of the 3–8 Hz frequency samples.</p><p>Across electrodes, detected bout incidence ranged from 27% to 73% of the recording (mean incidence ± SD = 48 ± 13%). We quantified response amplitude theta periodicity for each electrode as the <italic>z</italic>-scored circular–linear correlation between hippocampal theta phase at stimulation onset and component amplitude.

The paper should improve or correct its analyses of the phase differences between the hippocampal and neocortical contacts, because the current analyses that suggested at 90 degree phase difference do not seem supported by the data.</p><p>2. Verify that the results persist when full circular-linear models are used instead of the binned data (which leave room for inaccuracies) – see comment from reviewer 3.</p><p>3. Perform follow up analyses to ensure that the effects are not driven by the timing/order of stimulation. This could be a confound, for example, if peak versus trough stimulation trials are not evenly distributed over the course of each session.</p><p>4. Verify that the results are not driven by volume conduction that could disrupt the phase measurements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The paper should show more detail regarding how many electrodes were excluded based on the different exclusion criteria described in the Methods section. For example, &quot;To prune excessively noisy or artifactual data, epochs were excluded according to their signal range (excluded if &gt; 800 μV) and kurtosis (excluded if &gt; 2 SD over channelwise mean kurtosis). Channels were excluded from analyses if &lt; 200 epochs remained following pruning.&quot; How many channels and epochs were excluded from this procedure?</p><p>– Similarly, the #'s of excluded/included electrodes should be provided in the text at &quot;Of these, we excluded electrodes where stimulation provoked seizure or afterdischarges during clinical testing.&quot;</p><p>– How many stimulation electrodes and hippocampus electrodes were included in the analysis in Figure 1? Similarly, how many amygdala and OFC electrodes were included in and excluded from analysis? How many electrodes are shown in Figure 10? Also, how many epochs were included for analysis for amygdala and OFC?</p><p>– It is unclear why/if the 0.5 Hz stimulation is not jittered, whereas the 1 Hz stimulation has a 0.25 second jitter.</p><p>– It would be helpful to show a time course of evoked hippocampal responses across stimulation bouts. 60 pulses were delivered per train in the 0.5 Hz setting and 1200 pulses were delivered per train in the 1 Hz setting. Given the rapid and extended delivery of pulses, the authors should show that there was no contamination from previous stimulation pulses on later evoked potentials.</p><p>– A detailed analysis of the phase estimation procedure is provided, showing a small and consistent phase angle bias of ~11 degrees. It is unclear if the authors corrected subsequent analyses based on this estimate.</p><p>– In Figure 4a, it is unclear what method is used for abolishment of oscillatory activity in the trace of phase matched stimulation-free trials. Is this done with the same method as in Figure 4b, by subtraction of average phase-matched stimulation free trials, or through a band-stop filter applied post stimulation?</p><p>– The authors suggest that late-phase dependence of evoked potentials in the amygdala may be driven by secondary transmission from hippocampus. To more strongly support this claim, it would be interesting to see a direct analysis showing hippocampal responses preceding amygdalar responses on a per subject basis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My one major concern is about the state of hippocampal LFPs prior to stimulation. Presumably, patients were not in constant high-powered theta states throughout the recording session. In most comparable rodent experiments, high powered theta states are either pharmacologically controlled (in anesthetized preps) or behaviorally controlled by having animals run during stimulation periods. The authors do not mention any analysis to determine if patient's were in high-powered theta states, so presumably, all data are included. Certainly, phase can be assessed in the theta range even in the absence of clear theta in raw signals, so couldn't the variance in theta power also affect evoked potential strength. It would be nice to see a control analysis, that includes stimulation events that only occurred during periods of ongoing high-powered theta, to see how this effects the results.</p><p>While I really like the methods the authors use to assess phase lag and potentially explain the peak=higher power EP results, they authors spend a bit too much time playing coy about this explanation, while they feign that the original hypothesis was wrong. A few tweaks here and there to hedge some of the &quot;original hypothesis was wrong&quot; statements could go a long way to helping assure the readers take home the main points of the article.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Neutral questions:</p><p>– Is it worth mentioning phase coding in the introduction? Is it relevant at all that bats and humans exhibit non-oscillatory hippocampal spike-phase coding, where rodent spike-phase coding is highly oscillatory? That might change one's prior about whether the same oscillatory patterns would be visible in rodents and humans.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>– Why bin phase values instead of doing circular-linear regression from the outset? Finding a continuous relationship between phase and stimulation amplitude would be much more convincing. Even showing the peak-trough difference in context with the other two bins in Figure 5 would be more convincing. It seems these analyses are redundant, so in this reviewer's opinion, the best strategy would be to do circular linear analyses and show those data instead of the binned data.</p><p>– It is critical to control for timing/order of stimulation. Stimulation later could be producing smaller EPs, and if more trough stimulation trials occurred later, that could be producing the reported effect.</p><p>– The choice of a pre-determined theta frequency band for human subjects would be improved by examining a band defined by a peak in the theta range and its half width or something similar. How do you know a predefined 3-8 Hz frequency band is relevant?</p><p>– Since stimulation was applied to contacts on the same electrode as the recording contact, how can the authors be sure that volume conduction from local stimulation sites (in the lateral temporal cortex) was not affecting their results? Do the results hold with Laplacian re-referencing? This issue might explain the unexpected phase reversal that the authors mention.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78395.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Verify that the results persist when full circular-linear models are used instead of the binned data (which leave room for inaccuracies) – see comment from reviewer 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the manuscript such that circular-linear models are the primary analysis. Results persist using this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Perform follow up analyses to ensure that the effects are not driven by the timing/order of stimulation.

Verify that the results are not driven by volume conduction that could disrupt the phase measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue applies to the analysis of phase lag between hippocampus and neocortex. As indicated above, we no longer emphasize this analysis given the potential issue of volume conduction (see response to Essential Revisions #1) and in general have de-emphasized the relevance of absolute phase values to our results. In the revised manuscript, we include an analysis of the effect of an alternative referencing scheme selected to reduce volume conduction (bipolar re-referencing) on the phase latencies between hippocampus and the stimulating contacts (Appendix 1-Figure 4b). It is important to note that issues concerning volume conduction would not be expected to impact the main reported finding of 180-degree hippocampal theta phase separation between minimal and maximal response amplitudes. We also note that the large distance between stimulating and recording contacts should reduce volume conduction effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The paper should show more detail regarding how many electrodes were excluded based on the different exclusion criteria described in the Methods section. For example, &quot;To prune excessively noisy or artifactual data, epochs were excluded according to their signal range (excluded if &gt; 800 μV) and kurtosis (excluded if &gt; 2 SD over channelwise mean kurtosis). Channels were excluded from analyses if &lt; 200 epochs remained following pruning.&quot; How many channels and epochs were excluded from this procedure?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide information on the numbers of channels included/excluded and the number of epochs included/excluded for hippocampus and control regions (Materials and methods: sEEG recording and stimulation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Similarly, the #'s of excluded/included electrodes should be provided in the text at &quot;Of these, we excluded electrodes where stimulation provoked seizure or after discharges during clinical testing.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity, we now include the total number of included stimulating electrodes in Materials and methods: sEEG recording and stimulation (n=16). Electrodes where stimulation provoked seizure or after discharge during clinical testing were excluded from consideration and were not assessed by the research team. Given the large volume of electrodes stimulated over the course of clinical testing, the research team only noted the lateral temporal contacts that were possibilities for use in the stimulation experiment. The research team selected from among those pairs using the evaluation procedure described in Materials and methods: sEEG recording and stimulation. This procedure did not evoke afterdischarge or seizure in any evaluated electrode pair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How many stimulation electrodes and hippocampus electrodes were included in the analysis in Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>14 neocortical stimulating electrodes and 18 hippocampal recording electrodes were included in the electrode visualization in Figure 1a. We now include this information in the figure caption. We now also emphasize in the figure caption that imaging was unavailable in one subject and they were therefore excluded from this visualization, as this information was previously described only in Materials and methods. All analyses include the full dataset of 16 stimulating electrodes and 23 hippocampal recording electrodes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, how many amygdala and OFC electrodes were included in and excluded from analysis? Also, how many epochs were included for analysis for amygdala and OFC?</p></disp-quote><p>As was the case for hippocampal electrodes, the revised manuscript provides channel inclusion/exclusion and epoch inclusion/exclusion counts in Materials and methods: sEEG recording and stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many electrodes are shown in Figure 10?</p></disp-quote><p>9 amygdala electrodes and 22 orbitofrontal electrodes (i.e., the full analysis set) are shown in Figure 5. We now emphasize this information in the figure caption as well as in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is unclear why/if the 0.5 Hz stimulation is not jittered, whereas the 1 Hz stimulation has a 0.25 second jitter.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain in Materials and methods that jitter was applied to the 1-Hz stimulation in order to enable data analysis for a secondary experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be helpful to show a time course of evoked hippocampal responses across stimulation bouts. 60 pulses were delivered per train in the 0.5 Hz setting and 1200 pulses were delivered per train in the 1 Hz setting. Given the rapid and extended delivery of pulses, the authors should show that there was no contamination from previous stimulation pulses on later evoked potentials.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript addresses the effect of stimulation order on evoked amplitude (as well as on stimulation phase distribution) in the new appendix (Appendix 1: Order of stimulation pulses had no effect on phase distribution). There were no significant effects of stimulation order.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A detailed analysis of the phase estimation procedure is provided, showing a small and consistent phase angle bias of ~11 degrees. It is unclear if the authors corrected subsequent analyses based on this estimate.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not rebin phase angles according to the estimated bias from the phase estimation procedure in our main analyses. Our revised manuscript reports the effects of performing this correction on our main analyses (see Appendix 1: Assessment of phase estimation approach). We found no change in the outcomes of our binned analyses of EP component amplitude. This procedure has no effect on the continuous (circular-linear) analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 4a, it is unclear what method is used for abolishment of oscillatory activity in the trace of phase matched stimulation-free trials. Is this done with the same method as in Figure 4b, by subtraction of average phase-matched stimulation free trials, or through a band-stop filter applied post stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>The phase-matched, stimulation-free trials shown in the revised manuscript in Figures 3a,c and Figure 5c,d,g,h do not have any abolishment of oscillatory activity applied. Rather, these traces show what the underlying, non-evoked activity looks like when revealed by phase-sorting. We abolish the oscillatory activity from the original EP by subtracting the average phase-matched stimulation-free trial from the original EP. For example, the black (peak) trace in Figure 3b is the result of subtracting the phase-matched, stimulation-free trace (red) from the raw EP trace (black) in Figure 3a, top panel. The revised manuscript includes retooled visualization, figure layout, and caption in an effort to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors suggest that late-phase dependence of evoked potentials in the amygdala may be driven by secondary transmission from hippocampus. To more strongly support this claim, it would be interesting to see a direct analysis showing hippocampal responses preceding amygdalar responses on a per subject basis.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript includes an analysis of per-subject latency between the hippocampal EP and the amygdala late response. While the hippocampus N1 consistently preceded the amygdala N2, we found no correlation across trials between the onset of the hippocampus N1 and the amygdala N2 (see Appendix 1: Amygdala late-component latency does not relate to hippocampal EP timing). We have updated our results and Discussion sections accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My one major concern is about the state of hippocampal LFPs prior to stimulation. Presumably, patients were not in constant high-powered theta states throughout the recording session. In most comparable rodent experiments, high powered theta states are either pharmacologically controlled (in anesthetized preps) or behaviorally controlled by having animals run during stimulation periods. The authors do not mention any analysis to determine if patient's were in high-powered theta states, so presumably, all data are included. Certainly, phase can be assessed in the theta range even in the absence of clear theta in raw signals, so couldn't the variance in theta power also affect evoked potential strength. It would be nice to see a control analysis, that includes stimulation events that only occurred during periods of ongoing high-powered theta, to see how this effects the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to contamination by stimulation and the evoked response, we were unable to analyze theta bouts online (i.e., on a per-trial basis). We instead investigated bout incidence during the offline, pre-stimulation period. There was no relationship between offline bouts and the phase-dependence of the hippocampal evoked response (Appendix 1: Offline theta bout incidence does not impact periodicity of the evoked response). We now note in the Discussion section that this is an important direction for future research, perhaps by cuing stimulation based on online assessment of theta power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While I really like the methods the authors use to assess phase lag and potentially explain the peak=higher power EP results, they authors spend a bit too much time playing coy about this explanation, while they feign that the original hypothesis was wrong. A few tweaks here and there to hedge some of the &quot;original hypothesis was wrong&quot; statements could go a long way to helping assure the readers take home the main points of the article.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the revised manuscript’s emphasis on full circular-linear models helps resolve this issue. In particular, we focus on the finding of 180 degree phase separation between minimal and maximal receptivity states, thus emphasizing our finding’s homology to previous findings in rodent models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Neutral questions:</p><p>– Is it worth mentioning phase coding in the introduction? Is it relevant at all that bats and humans exhibit non-oscillatory hippocampal spike-phase coding, where rodent spike-phase coding is highly oscillatory? That might change one's prior about whether the same oscillatory patterns would be visible in rodents and humans.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Introduction, we now directly address differences in characteristics and functional relevance of the theta oscillation across species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>– Why bin phase values instead of doing circular-linear regression from the outset? Finding a continuous relationship between phase and stimulation amplitude would be much more convincing. Even showing the peak-trough difference in context with the other two bins in Figure 5 would be more convincing. It seems these analyses are redundant, so in this reviewer's opinion, the best strategy would be to do circular linear analyses and show those data instead of the binned data.</p></disp-quote><p>We now use the circular-linear regressions from the outset (see Essential Revisions #2). We have retained the binning analysis secondarily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It is critical to control for timing/order of stimulation. Stimulation later could be producing smaller EPs, and if more trough stimulation trials occurred later, that could be producing the reported effect.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript includes a supplementary analysis of the effect of stimulation order (see Essential Revisions #3). We did not find effects of stimulation order on the distribution of stimulation phase angles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The choice of a pre-determined theta frequency band for human subjects would be improved by examining a band defined by a peak in the theta range and its half width or something similar. How do you know a predefined 3-8 Hz frequency band is relevant?</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide analyses of power spectra in hippocampus to verify the presence of significant narrowband oscillations within the 3-8 Hz frequency band (see revised Figure 1c). In particular, we detected consistent oscillations around 5.3 Hz and 6.3 Hz. All analyzed contacts were found to have at least one narrowband peak in the 3-8 Hz frequency range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since stimulation was applied to contacts on the same electrode as the recording contact, how can the authors be sure that volume conduction from local stimulation sites (in the lateral temporal cortex) was not affecting their results? Do the results hold with Laplacian re-referencing? This issue might explain the unexpected phase reversal that the authors mention.</p></disp-quote><p>Volume conduction may have contaminated our findings in regard to the hippocampal-neocortical latency. As such, we have removed those analyses from our interpretation in the Results and Discussion sections, moved the phase-latency analysis to the appendix, and have generally de-emphasized the absolute phase values relating to minimal and maximal evoked response (see Essential Revisions #1 and #4). Laplacian re-referencing was not possible for many hippocampal contacts which were at the end of their depth electrode lead. The revised manuscript, we include an analysis of the effect of bipolar re-referencing, which did not eliminate the bimodal phase-lag distribution observed in the original reference scheme (see Essential Revisions #1). However, we note that volume conduction would not be expected to impact the primary results of circular-linear phase to evoked-amplitude relationship and 180-degree hippocampal theta phase separation in minimal vs. maximal response to stimulation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
