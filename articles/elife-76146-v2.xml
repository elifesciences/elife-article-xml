common Smad, Smad4, and phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads. How the Smad-complex is assembled and regulated is still unclear. Here, we report that active Arl15, an Arf-like small G protein, specifically binds to the MH2 domain of Smad4 and colocalizes with Smad4 at the endolysosome. The binding relieves the autoinhibition of Smad4, which is imposed by the intramolecular interaction between its MH1 and MH2 domains. Activated Smad4 subsequently interacts with phosphorylated receptor-regulated Smads, forming the Smad-complex. Our observations suggest that Smad4 functions as an effector and a GTPase activating protein (GAP) of Arl15. Assembly of the Smad-complex enhances the GAP activity of Smad4 toward Arl15, therefore dissociating Arl15 before the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. Our data further demonstrate that Arl15 positively regulates the TGFβ family signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Arf-like 15</kwd><kwd>TGFbeta signaling</kwd><kwd>Smad4</kwd><kwd>Arl G protein</kwd><kwd>GAP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AcRF Tier1 RG35/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Tie</surname><given-names>Hieng Chiong</given-names></name><name><surname>Divyanshu</surname><given-names>Mahajan</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Xiuping</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Boh</surname><given-names>Boon Kim</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier2 MOE2015-T2-2-073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Tie</surname><given-names>Hieng Chiong</given-names></name><name><surname>Divyanshu</surname><given-names>Mahajan</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Xiuping</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Boh</surname><given-names>Boon Kim</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2018-T2-2-026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Meng</given-names></name><name><surname>Tie</surname><given-names>Hieng Chiong</given-names></name><name><surname>Divyanshu</surname><given-names>Mahajan</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Xiuping</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name><name><surname>Boh</surname><given-names>Boon Kim</given-names></name><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The active small G protein, Arl15-GTP, interacts with the MH2 domain of Smad4 and positively regulates the TGFß family signaling pathway by promoting the assembly of the Smad-complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) family signaling pathway is initiated by the TGFβ family cytokines, consisting of TGFβs, nodals, activins, growth and differentiation factors, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Derynck and Budi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Massagué, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmierer and Hill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wrana, 2013</xref>). The pathway can profoundly affect the development and homeostasis of animal tissue and has long been recognized as one of the most critical contributors to multiple human diseases such as cancers, fibrotic disorders, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goumans and Ten Dijke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seoane and Gomis, 2017</xref>). The core molecular framework of this pathway was outlined more than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Massagué, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmierer and Hill, 2007</xref>). In the canonical TGFβ and BMP signaling pathways (hereafter referred to as the TGFβ and BMP signaling pathways), the TGFβ family cytokines first bind to and activate the type II and I receptor kinases, which phosphorylate receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), including TGFβ-specific Smad2 and 3 (hereafter referred to as TGFβ R-Smads) and BMP-specific Smad1, 5 and 8 (hereafter referred to as BMP R-Smads). Smads share a three-domain organization comprising N-terminal MH1 and C-terminal MH2 domains connected by a linker region. The type I receptor kinase phosphorylates the MH2 domain of an R-Smad. After phosphorylation, phospho-R-Smads and Smad4 assemble into a complex, usually a heterotrimer with two phospho-R-Smads and one Smad4, via their MH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chacko et al., 2004</xref>). Eventually, the Smad-complex translocates to the nucleus and executes genomic actions by chromatin remodeling, transcriptional activation, or repression of responsive genes. The formation of phospho-R-Smad and Smad4 complex, or the Smad-complex, is a central event in the TGFβ family signaling pathway. However, we still do not entirely understand this event at the molecular and cellular level. A fundamental question is what initiates and regulates the assembly of the Smad-complex. Hata et al. previously reported that the self-autoinhibition of Smads regulates the assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hata et al., 1997</xref>). They found that, in Smad4, the MH1 domain intramolecularly interacts with the MH2 domain, therefore preventing full-length Smad4 from interacting with R-Smads. What relieves the autoinhibition of Smad4 and how the resulting active Smad4 subsequently complexes with R-Smads are currently unknown.</p><p>Small G proteins are molecular switches that regulate diverse cellular processes. In the G protein cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cherfils and Zeghouf, 2013</xref>), the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activates an inactive or GDP-bound G protein to become the GTP-loaded or active form, which binds to its effectors and triggers cellular effects. The active G protein requires the GTPase activating protein (GAP) to hydrolyze the bound GTP and terminate its active state, completing the G protein cycle by returning it to its initial GDP-bound or inactive form. Arf-family G proteins comprise Arf, Sar, and Arf-like (Arl) groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sztul et al., 2019</xref>). Arf and Sar group members have well-documented cellular roles in recruiting vesicular coats and regulating lipid production. Arl group has the most members (&gt;20), but most of them are poorly studied. They have diverse cellular functions, such as membrane trafficking, organelle positioning, microtubule dynamics, and ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donaldson and Jackson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sztul et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Arl15 is an uncharacterized Arl group member. It became interesting after a series of genome-wide association studies linked its gene locus to rheumatoid arthritis, multiple metabolic traits, such as body shape, blood lipid level, and magnesium homeostasis, and metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and childhood obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danila et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glessner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Negi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ried et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Willer et al., 2013</xref>). It is unclear whether <italic>ARL15</italic> is the causative gene and how its genetic changes can lead to the diseases above since its molecular and cellular functions are largely unknown. Recent studies suggested that Arl15 might play a role in insulin signaling, adiponectin secretion, and adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rocha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we identified Arl15 as a novel regulator of the TGFβ family signaling. We found that it can directly bind to and activate autoinhibited Smad4 to promote the assembly of the Smad-complex. At the same time, the Smad4-containing complex negatively feedbacks to Arl15 by accelerating the GTP hydrolysis of Arl15. Therefore, our data demonstrate that Smad4 acts as an effector and GAP for small G protein Arl15.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arl15-GTP can directly interact with Smad4</title><p>During our systematic study of Arl group small G proteins, we focused on Arl15 due to its genetic implication in human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danila et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glessner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Negi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ried et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Willer et al., 2013</xref>). Arl15 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, and its orthologs are present in most metazoans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). According to the conserved guanine nucleotide-binding motifs of small G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feig, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sprang, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sztul et al., 2019</xref>), we introduced GTP non-hydrolyzable mutation (GTP-bound or active form mutation), A86L (hereafter referred to as AL; see below for the experimental confirmation), and GDP-bound or inactive form mutation, T46N (hereafter referred to as TN), to Arl15.</p><p>We subsequently performed yeast two-hybrid screening to identify potential interacting partners of Arl15. Using Arl15-AL as a bait, we uncovered Smad4 as one of the most robust hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>). Their interaction was confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays. We found that exogenously expressed and C-terminally GFP-tagged Arl15-AL, but not Arl15-TN, pulled down endogenous Smad4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). In contrast, Arl5b, another member of Arl group, showed negative results in either GTP (Q70L) or GDP-mutant (T30N) form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). In the reverse immunoprecipitation, endogenous Smad4 pulled down substantially more endogenous Arl15 in the presence of guanosine 5′-[β,γ-imido]triphosphate (GMPPNP), a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, than GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, the weak pull-down band in the GDP panel is likely due to the cellular GTP. Next, we asked if the TGFβ1 treatment regulates the interaction between endogenous Smad4 and Arl15. We found that, under the control shRNA knockdown (GL2-shRNA), TGFβ1 treatment significantly increased the amount of Arl15 immunoprecipitated by endogenous Smad4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). Therefore, our finding suggests that TGFβ1 could stimulate the interaction between Smad4 and Arl15 through a currently unknown mechanism.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Arl15-GTP interacts with Smad4.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The GTP-mutant form of Arl15 specifically immunoprecipitated endogenous Smad4.

Notably, the punctate appearance of mCherry-Smad4 was barely discernable against its cytosolic pool. The poor punctate localization might be due to the closed conformation of Smad4, formed by the intramolecular interaction between its MH1 and MH2 domains (see below). Therefore, we tested the mCherry-tagged Smad4-MH2 domain, which does not possess the inhibitory MH1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

However, further addition of Arl15-AL (lane 2), but not Arl15-TN (lane 3), significantly weakened the interaction, suggesting that Arl15-GTP might promote the Smad4-MH2 domain to engage MH2 domains of R-Smads. Altogether, our biochemical data provide evidence that Arl15-GTP might activate Smad4 by relieving its MH2 domain from the intramolecular inhibition imposed by its MH1 domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Arl15-GTP promotes the assembly of the Smad-complex</title><p>We next investigated the effect of Arl15-GTP on the assembly of the Smad-complex in the context of exogenously expressed full-length Smads.

Our data confirmed these reports and further revealed a molecular role of Arl15 in the assembly of the Smad-complex. First, bead-immobilized GST-Smad4 pulled down a substantial amount of Smad2-SE, but not WT and the non-phosphorylatable mutant, Smad2-S465A/S467A (hereafter referred to as Smad2-SA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>); consistently, GFP-tagged Smad2-SE, but not WT or Smad2-SA, was found to interact with Myc-Smad4 in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Second, only Smad2-SE, but not Smad2-SA, was pulled down by bead-immobilized Arl15-AL in a Smad4-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Third and most importantly, we observed that the interaction between Smad2-SE and Smad4, that is, the formation of the Smad-complex, was substantially enhanced in the presence of Arl15-AL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e and f</xref>). A similar promoting effect of Arl15-AL on the interaction between Smad1, a BMP R-Smad, and Smad4 was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To study Arl15’s effect on the Smad-complex assembly in the context of endogenous proteins, we investigated the interaction between Smad4 and phospho-Smad2/3 upon the depletion of Arl15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). We first demonstrated that depleting Arl15 does not significantly change the cellular level of phospho-Smad2/3 stimulated by the TGFβ1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). Importantly, consistent with our above overexpression studies, we found that the depletion of Arl15 substantially reduced phospho-Smad2/3 immunoprecipitated by Smad4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>), suggesting an essential role of Arl15 in the efficient assembly of the Smad-complex. Collectively, our data showed that Arl15-GTP might promote the assembly of the Smad-complex by binding to and activating the Smad4-MH2 domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The Smad-complex functions as a GAP to inactivate Arl15-GTP</title><p>Once assembled in the TGFβ family signaling pathway, the Smad-complex enters the nucleus to initiate genomic actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Derynck and Budi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Massagué, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schmierer and Hill, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wrana, 2013</xref>). We then asked if Arl15-GTP co-translocates to the nucleus together with the Smad-complex. In fluorescence imaging, we observed that Arl15 did not localize to the nucleus under the TGFβ1 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In contrast, the nuclear localization of phospho-Smad2/3 increased substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We then further confirm our imaging result and explore the role of Arl15 in the nuclear localization of the Smad-complex using the nuclear fractionation assay. Consistent with our imaging, we did not detect Arl15 in the nuclear fraction in starved or TGFβ1 stimulated control knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). However, in control or Arl15 knockdown cells, nuclear fractions of phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 substantially increased under the TGFβ1 treatment compared to the starvation treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

Our findings prompted us to test the hypothesis that the Smad-complex might act as a GAP to inactivate and consequently dissociate Arl15. To that end, we first purified recombinant His-tagged Smad2-SE, Smad4, and Arl15 (WT or AL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Next, His-Arl15 (WT or AL) was first loaded with GTP and subsequently incubated with or without different combinations of His-Smad2-SE and His-Smad4. The inorganic phosphate released during the GTP hydrolysis was enzymatically converted and continuously monitored by spectrophotometry (see Materials and methods). We found that Arl15-WT alone displayed a weak GTP-hydrolysis activity and that the presence of Smad4, but not Smad2-SE, substantially accelerated the GTP hydrolysis rate of Arl15, demonstrating Smad4 as a potential GAP for Arl15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the addition of Smad2-SE greatly enhanced the GAP activity of Smad4 toward Arl15. As expected for a small G protein, we observed that AL mutation abolished the GTP hydrolysis activity of Arl15 in all cases — either alone or with the addition of Smad4 or Smad2-SE, retrospectively confirming AL as the GTPase-defective mutation. Using purified domains of Smad4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>), we mapped the GAP activity to the Smad4-MH2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). The extension of the MH2 domain to include the linker region further increased the GAP activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). The positive effect of the linker region on the GAP activity of the MH2 domain is probably due to the enhanced interaction between the Smad4-MH2 domain and Arl15-GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). In summary, our data suggest that, after the assembly of the Smad-complex, Smad4 might have an enhanced GAP activity and consequently inactivate Arl15 and dissociate the latter from the complex.</p><p>To better understand the significance of dissociating Arl15 from the Smad-complex, we investigated the effect of overexpressing Arl15-AL on the TGFβ1-stimulated nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. Since Arl15-AL does not significantly hydrolyze the bound GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and f</xref>), we expect that it could tightly bind to the Smad-complex with minimal dissociation. HeLa cells transfected with Arl15-AL or empty vector (control) were subjected to starvation or TGFβ1-stimulation as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>. Our nuclear fractionation assay demonstrates that Arl15-AL reduced the percentage of nuclear Smad4 and phospho-Smad2/3 compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g–i</xref>). Therefore, when bound, Arl15 seems to inhibit the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. The Smad-complex must inactivate and dissociate the bound Arl15 for efficient nuclear translocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Arl15-GTP is a positive and essential regulator for the full activity of TGFβ and BMP signaling pathways</title><p>To understand the cellular significance of Arl15-Smad4 interaction, we investigated the effect of overexpression or depletion of Arl15 on TGFβ-induced transcriptions in HeLa cells. We first tested the transcription of Smad binding element ×4 luc (SBE ×4 luc), a luciferase reporter that comprises four tandem repeats of SBEs as its enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zawel et al., 1998</xref>). SBE ×4 luc is commonly used for assaying the TGFβ R-Smad-dependent transcription or TGFβ signaling. We found that when HeLa cells were treated with the serum-free medium (serum-starvation or hereafter referred to as starvation), overexpression of Arl15-WT or AL, but not TN, was sufficient to stimulate the transcription of SBE ×4 luc to ≥2 fold that of the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). However, the stimulation was much weaker than that of TGFβ1 treatment, which is ~25 fold that of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The stimulation was abolished by SB431542 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>), a small molecule inhibitor of TGFβ type I receptor kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laping et al., 2002</xref>). A possible explanation for these observations is that Arl15-AL might amplify the autocrine TGFβ signaling in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qing et al., 2004</xref>) by promoting the formation of the Smad-complex. Similarly, we found that overexpression of Arl15-WT or AL, but not TN, also stimulated the transcription of BRE-luc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b</xref>), a luciferase reporter for assaying the BMP R-Smad-dependent transcription or BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Korchynskyi and ten Dijke, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, when endogenous Arl15 was depleted by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1c</xref>), TGFβ1 or BMP2-induced reporter transcription was attenuated to less than half of the control, and the autocrine stimulated transcription also decreased under starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

Therefore, we first investigated if Arl15 is required for secretory trafficking. Using ManII (a Golgi transmembrane glycosidase) and TNFα (a PM-targeted transmembrane protein) RUSH reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boncompain et al., 2012</xref>), we found that Arl15 knockdown did not substantially affect the ER-to-Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1e</xref> and f) and the subsequent Golgi-to-PM trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1g</xref> and h).

In summary, our data argue against the hypothesis that Arl15 indirectly regulates the TGFβ family signaling by intracellular trafficking. Instead, they support a model in which Arl15 regulates the TGFβ family signaling by promoting the assembly of the Smad-complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Arl15 is essential for the efficient transcription of TGFβ target genes</title><p>In addition to luciferase reporters, we also studied the effect of disrupting Arl15 on the cellular transcription profile of TGFβ target genes.

Therefore, we propose that Arl15-AL might have two opposing effects on the Smad-complex – promoting its assembly and inhibiting its nuclear translocation. Under starvation, the assembly of the Smad-complex might be the rate-limiting step when cellular phospho-Smad2/3 concentration is low under autocrine stimulation. Arl15-AL might spontaneously dissociate from the Smad-complex, freeing the Smad-complex for its subsequent nuclear translocation.

According to our knowledge, it is the first small G protein reported to interact with Smads. It positively regulates both TGFβ and BMP pathways by directly interacting with the MH2 domain of common Smad, Smad4, and promoting the assembly of the Smad-complex. Interestingly, the Smad-complex serves as an effector and a GAP of Arl15 so that it dissociates Arl15 and subsequently enters the nucleus.</p><p>Our work provides a molecular mechanism on how closed or autoinhibited Smad4 becomes open or activated, an outstanding question in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hata et al., 1997</xref>). We discovered that opening and, hence, activation of Smad4 is specifically aided by Arl15-GTP through direct binding to the MH2 domain of Smad4. A small G protein is regulated by its GEFs and GAPs, activities of which could be subject to further intracellular or extracellular stimuli. Hence, our study reveals Arl15 as a potential signaling integration node between a small G-protein activation cascade and the TGFβ family signaling. The finding might provide a new clue to understanding the contextual and paradoxical nature of the TGFβ family signaling.</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a working model for the molecular role of Arl15 in the TGFβ family signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>). A currently unidentified GEF, which is positively stimulated by TGFβ family cytokines, first activates Arl15-GDP to become GTP-loaded. Next, Smad4, mainly in a closed or inactive conformation, interacts with Arl15-GTP. Once bound to Arl15-GTP, Smad4-MH1 dissociates from its MH2 domain, rendering Smad4 in an open or active conformation. Although the Smad4-MH2 domain possesses a GAP activity toward Arl15, it might be too weak to inactivate Arl15-GTP in vivo. Therefore, a pool of Arl15-GTP-Smad4 complex might accumulate intracellularly. Upon stimulation by a TGFβ family cytokine, R-Smads (Smad2 as an example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g</xref>) are phosphorylated by TGFβ type I receptor kinase at their C-termini. With an activated MH2 domain, Arl15-bound Smad4 subsequently interacts with phospho-R-Smads. Since the R-Smad and Smad4 are known to assemble as a heterotrimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chacko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chacko et al., 2004</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that one Arl15-GTP and one Smad-heterotrimer form a heterotetramer. We further assume that associated Arl15 probably inhibits the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. By engaging R-Smads, the GAP activity of Smad4 is greatly enhanced and consequently triggers the GTP hydrolysis of Arl15. After the resulting Arl15-GDP dissociates from the Smad-complex, the latter translocates to the nucleus and executes eventual genomic actions.</p><p>Our model proposes that the Smad-complex is an effector and a terminator for active Arl15, which promotes the assembly of the Smad-complex in the first place. A similar case has been proposed for Sar1 and COPII coat complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonny et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi et al., 2007</xref>). Sar1 is an Arf-family small G protein that initiates the assembly of the COPII coat at the ER exit site. The COPII coat consists of repetitive units of two heterodimers, Sec23-Sec24, and Sec13-Sec31. In Sec23-Sec24 heterodimer, Sec23 functions as both an effector and a GAP for Sar1. The GAP activity of Sec23 is substantially boosted after Sec23-Sec24 recruits Sec13-Sec31 to complete the budding of a COPII-coated vesicle. The hydrolysis of Sar1-bound GTP eventually uncoats COPII-coated vesicles, which prepares them for the subsequent transport and fusion. We note that Arl15 and Sar1 have Ala (at 86) and His (at 77) in their G3-motifs, respectively, in contrast to Gln of other Arf-family small G proteins. Conserved Gln in the G3-motif functions to facilitate the GTP hydrolysis by correctly positioning the water molecule. Therefore, termination of active Sar1 and Arl15 in vivo probably requires their effector-cum-GAPs, which ensure the proper assembly of the COPII coat and the Smad-complex, respectively, before the complete dissociation of small G proteins. This property probably makes Sar1 and Arl15 a suitable initiator in promoting the assembly of large protein complexes. Confirmation of our speculation awaits future structural study of the Arl15-Smad-complex.</p><p>Our observation that Arl15 is required for the efficient invasion and migration of malignant cancer cells suggests that it might be a pro-metastatic factor. However, the finding of mutations compromising the Arl15-Smad4 interaction in the cancer genomic database suggests that Al15 might be a tumor suppressor. It is well known that the TGFβ signaling pathway possesses a context-dependent dual-role in cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Massagué, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Massagué, 2012</xref>). In normal epithelia or pre-malignant cancers, the TGFβ signaling pathway exerts a cytostatic or tumor-suppressive effect to inhibit the proliferation of cells. On the other hand, in malignant or metastatic cancers, TGFβ signaling exerts a pro-metastatic effect to promote growth and invasion of cells. An example is the effector of Arl15, Smad4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deckers et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the tumor-suppressive function of Smad4, depletion of Smad4 promotes the growth of NMuMG mammary gland epithelial cells; in contrast, the depletion of Smad4 inhibits the metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells, in agreement with the pro-metastatic role of Smad4. Furthermore, inactivating mutations are commonly found in the <italic>SMAD4</italic> gene in pre-malignant cancers such as pancreatic carcinoma, while <italic>SMAD4</italic> has been reported as an essential gene for metastasis of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levy and Hill, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Massagué, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Massagué, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that, like Smad4, Arl15 might play a similar dual-role in cancer progression.</p><p>Although our study mainly focused on the TGFβ signaling pathway, we observed that Arl15 promotes the assembly of the BMP Smad-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and it is essential for the full activity of BMP R-Smad-dependent transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Therefore, our data indicate that Arl15 also participates in the BMP signaling pathway. Recent evidence suggests that TGFβ and BMP pathways play opposite roles in animal development and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ning et al., 2019</xref>). It has been proposed that competition between TGFβ and BMP pathways for Smad4 contributes to their antagonistic cellular effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Candia et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sartori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we speculate that, similar to Smad4, Arl15 might mediate antagonistic crosstalk between the two pathways.</p><p>Genetic studies have implicated the <italic>ARL15</italic> gene locus in rheumatoid arthritis and multiple metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Danila et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glessner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Negi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahajan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richards et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ried et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Willer et al., 2013</xref>).

signaling in the transforming growth factor-β pathway and they identify through a two-hybrid screen a novel interactor of Smad4 called Arl15, which is a small G-protein. They demonstrate that Arl15 binds the MH2 domain of Smad4 leading to a release of its autoinhibitory structure which facilitates complex assembly with the R-Smads. An important mechanistic feature of this study is that the authors show these interactions are induced upon transforming growth factor-β stimulation. Finally, consistent with the proposed mechanism the authors show that a limited set of known downstream transcription factor targets of the transforming growth factor-β pathway are dependent upon Arl15.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76146.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Bennett</surname><given-names>Anton M</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03v76x132</institution-id><institution>Yale University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.12.14.472727">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.14.472727v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers felt that your results were intriguing but concern was raised regarding the physiological significance of your findings. In particular, based upon the comments from the reviewers it will be essential in the revised manuscript that additional experimentation be provided to address the issue of whether the Arl15 signaling mechanism is TGF-b responsive. Also, whether the reported interactions, particularly between Arl15 and Smad 4 with Smad 2/3 occur at endogenous levels in a regulated TGF-b manner. Additionally, it will be essential to demonstrate that Arl15 modulates Smad 2/3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-b, again under endogenous conditions. We feel that these experiments are key to supporting the physiological relevance of your findings and strongly encourage you to directly address these issues with further experimentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The localization data in figure 1 seems misplaced as an opening figure. That Arl15 is localized to a number of different membranes including the Golgi and plasma membrane is of interest but the presentation of these data as Figure 1 is distracting and disrupts the flow of the ensuing data as the relevance is vague. Although one could argue that Arl15-AL mutant localization data showing that it is localized to the plasma membrane would raise technical concerns over how the two-hybrid experiment was able to identify Smad4 as an interactor. The data in Figure 1 neither setup nor provide any rationale for the following two-hybrid screen that was performed with Arl15 as bait.</p><p>2. The interaction data is convincing although the authors do not show whether the interaction occurs at endogenous levels of both Smad4 and Arl15. Also, of importance is the question of whether this interaction is responsive to TGF-β activation.</p><p>3. Figure 2 is somewhat inconclusive since the authors are comparing the puncta staining &quot;intensity&quot; between full-length Smad4 and the MH2 domain alone. This difference in intensity could simply be a result of the MH2 domain alone expressing to much higher levels than that of full-length Smad4. This is very likely to be the case. The authors should modify their interpretation of these results or provide some control expression data for Smad4 in this experiment.</p><p>4. Can the authors add a table in the supplementary section listing the interactors identified in the two hybrid screen. What other partners were found?</p><p>5. Discrete point mutants in the MH2 and switch II domains of Smad4 and Arl15, respectively would provide stronger evidence for the specificity of the interaction and further mitigate any possibility that the failure to interact through these regions is simply due to inappropriate protein folding.</p><p>6. Figure 4D which shows quantitation of the previous pull-downs – this table should be labeled with the actual experimental conditions instead of just lanes 1-4.</p><p>7. It is surprising that there is a stoichiometric dissociation of Arl15 from Smad4. The authors should perform biochemical fractionation experiments with Arl15 in the presence and absence of TGF-β to substantiate their claim that Arl15 fails to piggy-back with Smad4 to the nucleus.</p><p>8. What is the status of Smad2/3 phosphorylation in response to TGF-β when Arl15 is knocked down.</p><p>9. The TGF-β pathway plays an important role also in the activation of fibrogenic genes, are these repertoire of targets (e.g. collagens and fibronectins) also affected by Arl15 loss-of-function/gain-of-function mutants.</p><p>10. In the Results section the authors simply refer to cancer-associated mutants from &quot;cancer patients&quot; the type of cancer that these mutants have been identified in, the frequency of occurrence should be provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I previously reviewed this manuscript for another journal.

Can one really say that decreased MH1-MH2 domain interaction confers activation?</p><p>– Figure 4c: This panel needs to additionally show the retention of HA-Smad4-MH2 by GST-Smad2-MH1 to allow for better interpretation of the data.</p><p>– Section starting line 184: This section needs to show the effects of wt Arl15 and Arl15-AL on the TGF-b-induced association of endogenous Smad2 or Smad3 with endogenous Smad4, and on the BMP-induced association of endogenous Smad1 or Smad5 with endogenous Smad4. This is key!</p><p>– Additionally, this section needs to show the effects of wt Arl15 and Arl15-AL on the TGF-b-induced nuclear translocation of endogenous Smad2 or Smad3 (with endogenous Smad4), and on the BMP-induced nuclear of endogenous Smad1 or Smad5 with endogenous Smad4. Immunofluorescence may be insufficiently informative, but nuclear versus cytosolic fractionation should visualize any effects.</p><p>– Data in Figure 6c: What is the effect of wt Arl15 (not only Arl15-AL)?</p><p>– Considering that Arl15-AL enhances the TGF-b-induced transcription response of direct target genes, does Arl15-AL enhance the TGF-b-induced binding of Smad complexes to regulatory gene sequences, as assessed by ChIP?

The interaction data is convincing although the authors do not show whether the interaction occurs at endogenous levels of both Smad4 and Arl15. Also, of importance is the question of whether this interaction is responsive to TGF-β activation.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we tested the endogenous interaction between Smad4 and Arl15 and explored if TGFβ1 regulates the interaction. Indeed, we confirmed the interaction between endogenous Smad4 and Arl15. Furthermore, we found that TGFβ1 stimulates their interaction. The new data have been incorporated into Figure 1.</p><p>The following sentences have been added to the Results.</p><p>“Next, we asked if the TGFβ1 treatment regulates the interaction between endogenous Smad4 and Arl15. We found that, under the control shRNA knockdown (GL2-shRNA), TGFβ1 treatment significantly increased the amount of Arl15 IPed by endogenous Smad4 (Figure 1c and d). Therefore, our finding suggests that TGFβ1 could stimulate the interaction between Smad4 and Arl15 through a currently unknown mechanism.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2 is somewhat inconclusive since the authors are comparing the puncta staining &quot;intensity&quot; between full-length Smad4 and the MH2 domain alone.

Instead, we wanted to compare the ratio of the punctate to the cytosolic background intensity. The difference in the two ratios is visually obvious in Figure 2 c and d — the ratio of the MH2-domain is much higher than that of the full-length.</p><p>We have modified the corresponding text to avoid confusion. We now use &quot;barely discernable&quot;, instead of weak punctate appearance, to describe the low ratio of the punctate to the cytosolic background intensity.</p><p>“Although immunostaining did not reveal a clear membrane association of Smad4, our live-cell confocal imaging uncovered a limited colocalization between mCherry-Smad4 and Arl15-AL-GFP at punctate structures (Figure 2c). Notably, the punctate appearance of mCherry-Smad4 was barely discernable against its cytosolic pool. The poor punctate localization might be due to the closed conformation of Smad4, formed by the intramolecular interaction between its MH1 and MH2 domains (see below).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We think that this reviewer refers to the colocalization between full-length Smad4 and Arl15-AL. Indeed, full-length Smad4 does not have a good membrane localization at all, possibly due to its closed conformation. However, the colocalization between Smad4-MH2 and Arl15-AL should be clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 149-155: Related to Figure 3b, the right panel is compared with the left panel, but it is unclear if the Smad band intensities of these two panels can be compared with each other, especially since it is unclear if these two panels derive from one gel with one exposure intensity.</p></disp-quote><p>1) The left (without the expression of GFP-Smad4) and right panels (with the expression of GFP-Smad4) were from different gels.

Instead, we calculated in Figure 3c the percentage of Flag-Smad1 pulled down in Figure 3b using the 1% cell lysate input lane. From the plot of Figure 3c, the percentage of Flag-Smad1 pulled down showed a significant increase with the expression of GFP-Smad4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Related to the same experiment(s), does repressing endogenous Smad4 levels using shRNA result in decreased R-Smad interaction?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the experiment as advised by this reviewer.

This is key!</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we tested the interaction between endogenous Smad4 and phospho-Smad2/3, which was stimulated by TGFβ1 treatment, upon the depletion of Arl15 (see Figure 1c and Figure 4h and i). We found that depletion of Arl15 reduces the interaction between Smad4 and Phospho-Smad2/3, therefore suggesting that Arl15 might be essential for efficient Smad-complex assembly. We have incorporated these new results into Figure 1c and Figure 4h and i.</p><p>We have added the following text in the Results section of our manuscript.</p><p>“To study Arl15's effect on the Smad-complex assembly in the context of endogenous proteins, we investigated the interaction between Smad4 and phospho-Smad2/3 upon the depletion of Arl15 (Figure 1c). We first demonstrated that depleting Arl15 does not significantly change the cellular level of phospho-Smad2/3 stimulated by the TGFβ1 treatment (Figure 4h). Importantly, consistent with our above overexpression studies, we found that the depletion of Arl15 substantially reduced phospho-Smad2/3 IPed by Smad4 (Figure 4i), suggesting an essential role of Arl15 in efficient Smad-complex assembly.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Additionally, this section needs to show the effects of wt Arl15 and Arl15-AL on the TGF-b-induced nuclear translocation of endogenous Smad2 or Smad3 (with endogenous Smad4), and on the BMP-induced nuclear of endogenous Smad1 or Smad5 with endogenous Smad4. Immunofluorescence may be insufficiently informative, but nuclear versus cytosolic fractionation should visualize any effects.</p></disp-quote><p>As advised by this reviewer, we tested the TGFβ1-induced nuclear translocation of endogenous phospho-Smad2/3, Smad4, and Arl15 upon depletion of Arl15 and overexpression of Arl15-AL using the nucleus fractionation assay (see Figure 5 b-d and g-i).</p><p>1) We found that Arl15 was undetectable in the nuclear fraction under starvation or TGFβ1 treatment in control knockdown cells. However, in control and Arl15 knockdown cells, nuclear fractions of phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 increased substantially under the TGFβ1 treatment compared to the starvation treatment. Importantly, when Arl15 was depleted, substantially less phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 were detected in the nuclear fraction (Figure 5 b-d). Our finding thus supports our hypothesis that Arl15 is essential for the efficient assembly of the Smad-complex, which ensures the subsequent nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex.</p><p>We have modified or added the following text in the Results part of our manuscript.</p><p>“We then asked if Arl15-GTP co-translocates to the nucleus together with the Smad-complex. In fluorescence imaging, we observed that Arl15 did not localize to the nucleus under the TGFβ1 treatment (Figure 5a). In contrast, the nuclear localization of phospho-Smad2/3 increased substantially (Figure 5a). We then further confirm our imaging result and explore the role of Arl15 in the nuclear localization of the Smad-complex using the nuclear fractionation assay. Consistent with our imaging, we did not detect Arl15 in the nuclear fraction in starved or TGFβ1 stimulated control knockdown cells (Figure 5b). However, in control or Arl15 knockdown cells, nuclear fractions of phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 substantially increased under the TGFβ1 treatment compared to the starvation treatment (Figure 5b). Similar observations were made for Arl15 and phospho-Smad1/5/8 in BMP2 stimulated cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 1a). Our findings are consistent with our current knowledge of the TGFβ family signaling pathway, in which phospho-R-Smads and Smad4 translocate to the nucleus upon stimulation by TGFβ family cytokines (Derynck and Budi, 2019; Massague, 2012; Schmierer and Hill, 2007; Wrana, 2013). Notably, when Arl15 was depleted, substantially less phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 were found in the nuclear fraction (Figure 5 b-d). The finding thus supports our hypothesis that Arl15 is essential for the assembly of the Smad-complex, which subsequently translocates to the nucleus.”</p><p>2) We observed that overexpression of Arl15-AL decreased the nuclear fraction of phospho-Smad2/3 and Smad4 compared to empty vector control, suggesting that bound Arl15-AL inhibits the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. We have modified or added the following text in the Results part of our manuscript.</p><p>“To better understand the significance of dissociating Arl15 from the Smad-complex, we investigated the effect of overexpressing Arl15-AL on the TGFβ1-stimulated nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. Since Arl15-AL does not significantly hydrolyze the bound GTP (Figure 5e and f), we expect that it could tightly bind to the Smad-complex with minimal dissociation. HeLa cells transfected with Arl15-AL or empty vector (control) were subjected to starvation or TGFβ1-stimulation as Figure 5b. Our nuclear fractionation assay demonstrates that Arl15-AL reduced the percentage of nuclear Smad4 and phospho-Smad2/3 compared to the control (Figure 5g-i). Therefore, when bound, Arl15 seems to inhibit the nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. The Smad-complex must inactivate and dissociate the bound Arl15 for efficient nuclear translocation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Data in Figure 6c: What is the effect of wt Arl15 (not only Arl15-AL)?</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of Arl15-WT should be weaker than Arl15-AL since not all Arl15-WT is in the GTP-binding or active form. This prediction is supported by experiments in Figure 6a and Figure 6—figure supplement 1b. Under the starvation treatment, Arl15-WT promotes the transcription of TGFβ1 and BMP pathway luciferase reporters more weakly than Arl15-AL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Considering that Arl15-AL enhances the TGF-b-induced transcription response of direct target genes, does Arl15-AL enhance the TGF-b-induced binding of Smad complexes to regulatory gene sequences, as assessed by ChIP? Does silencing Arl15 expression decrease the binding of these complexes?</p></disp-quote><p>Arl15 promotes the assembly and nuclear translocation of the Smad-complex. The increased nuclear concentration of Smad-complex is expected to increase the binding of the Smad-complex to the DNA sequences of target genes, as reported by extensive literature. However, Arl15 does not follow the Smad-complex to the nucleus, and it remains in the cytoplasm. Our study focuses on Arl15 and its role in assembling the Smad-complex. Therefore, we think that the investigation of Smad-complex's DNA binding in the nucleus is not within the scope of the current study. Instead, it should belong to the future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
