major source of fishery commodities in the near future. Hemocytes are key players of the immune system in shrimps; however, their classification, maturation, and differentiation are still under debate. To date, only discrete and inconsistent information on the classification of shrimp hemocytes has been reported, showing that the morphological characteristics are not sufficient to resolve their actual roles. Our present study using single-cell RNA sequencing revealed six types of hemocytes of <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicus</italic> based on their transcriptional profiles. We identified markers of each subpopulation and predicted the differentiation pathways involved in their maturation. We also predicted cell growth factors that might play crucial roles in hemocyte differentiation. Different immune roles among these subpopulations were suggested from the analysis of differentially expressed immune-related genes. These results provide a unified classification of shrimp hemocytes, which improves the understanding of its immune system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>non-model organisms</kwd><kwd>hemocytes</kwd><kwd>cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>crustacean</kwd><kwd>marsupenaeus japonicus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K15603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koiwai</surname><given-names>Keiichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19J00539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koiwai</surname><given-names>Keiichiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kikuchi</surname><given-names>Kiyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell mRNA sequencing on hemocytes of penaeid shrimp revealed six types of hemocytes, type markers, differentiation pathways, and different immune roles among these subpopulations based on their transcriptional profiles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aquaculture is an important source of animal protein and is considered one of the most important long-term growth areas of food production, providing 60% of fish for human consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">FAO, 2020</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/en">http://www.fao.org/fishery/statistics/en</ext-link>). However, crustaceans that lack an adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jiravanichpaisal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tassanakajon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Flegel, 2019</xref>) are vulnerable to pathogens. This means that ordinal vaccination is not applicable to crustaceans, unlike in fish aquaculture. Shrimp is the main target species for crustacean aquaculture. Therefore, an immune priming system for shrimp, which is entirely different from conventional vaccines, needs to be developed to control the infection of pathogens. However, little is known about the immune system of crustaceans due to the lack of biotechnological tools, such as uniform antibodies and other biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Hemocytes, which are immune cells of crustaceans, are traditionally divided into three morphological types based on the dyeing of intracellular granules, which was established by Bauchau and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauchau, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Söderhäll and Smith, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johansson et al., 2000</xref>). However, there have been additional reports on the classification of the hemocytes of shrimp; they were classified into four, eight, and five types based on electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">van de Braak et al., 2002</xref>), another dyeing method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kondo et al., 2012</xref>), and iodixanol density gradient centrifugation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dantas-Lima et al., 2013</xref>), respectively. As the morphology and dye staining properties of shrimp hemocytes are not absolute indicators, no unified understanding of their role has been established yet. Molecular markers, such as specific mRNAs, antibodies, or lectins, are usually available for characterizing the subpopulations of cells in model organisms, but this is not often the case for non-model organisms. Although monoclonal antibodies have been developed for some hemocytes of shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Rodriguez et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">van de Braak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sung et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sung and Sun, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Winotaphan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Xing et al., 2017</xref>), their number is lower than that of humans, and their correspondence to the cell type, as well as their differentiation stage, is under debate.</p><p>Recently, single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques have dramatically changed this scene, allowing researchers to annotate non-classified cells solely based on the mRNA expression patterns of each cell. In particular, droplet-based mRNA sequencing, such as Drop-seq, developed by Macosko (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>), has gained popularity for classifying cells and identifying new cell types. The enormous amount of biological data obtained from scRNA-seq leads us to classify cells into specific groups, analyze their heterogeneity, predict the functions of single-cell populations based on the gene expression profiles, and determine the cell proliferation or development pathways based on the pseudo-time ordering of a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Soneson and Robinson, 2018</xref>). More recently, hemocytes of invertebrate, fly, and mosquito models have been subjected to these types of microfluidic-based scRNA-seq to reveal their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Raddi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattenoz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we performed scRNA-seq analysis on <italic>Marsupenaeus japonicus</italic> hemocytes to classify the hemocyte types and characterize their functions using the custom-built Drop-seq platform. To perform scRNA-seq, a high-quality gene reference is essential; however, such reference genomes are scarce for crustaceans because of the extremely high proportion of simple sequence repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). We circumvented this problem by preparing reference genes using hybrid de novo assembly of short- and long-read RNA sequencing results. The sequences obtained from the scRNA-seq were mapped onto the reference genes successfully. Our scRNA-seq uncovered the transcriptional profiles of a few thousand <italic>M. japonicus</italic> hemocytes. We identified the markers of each population and the differentiation pathways associated with their maturation. We also discovered the cell growth factors that might play crucial roles in hemocyte differentiation. Different immune roles among these subpopulations were also suggested from the analysis of differentially expressed immune-related genes. Our results present a unified classification of shrimp hemocytes and a deeper understanding of the immune system of shrimp.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-seq clustering of <italic>M. japonicus</italic> hemocytes</title><p>Our study utilized scRNA-seq to determine the cellular subtypes with a distinct transcriptional expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To map the scRNA-seq sequences from <italic>M. japonicus</italic> hemocytes, we first prepared a high-quality de novo assembled reference genes using hybrid assembly of short- and long-read RNA sequencing results. The quality of assembled genes was quality-checked by BUSCO against arthropoda database. BUSCO tool showed 91.5% (35.6% complete and single-copy genes and 55.9% complete and duplicated genes) as complete genes, showing good completeness of the assembly. Some of the assembled genes constructed in this study showed homology to the same genes despite processed EvidentialGene program to remove similar sequences. Cluster database at high identity with tolerance (CD-HIT) programs was also applied on our draft assembled genes, but it was not able to cluster better than EvidentialGene program. Since we thought that subjective clustering of specific genes by ourselves would result in bias, we conducted our analysis based on the results of clustering by EvidentialGene program. Then, by using self-built Drop-seq microfluidic chips, single hemocytes were captured and their mRNA was barcoded using the droplet-based strategy. This process was performed in triplicates for three shrimp individuals. Following library preparation and sequencing, the transcriptomes obtained from scRNA-seq were mapped against the reference genes to discover the cell types.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The schematic of single-cell mRNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of penaeid shrimp <italic>M. japonicus</italic> hemocytes.</title><p>Single hemocytes were analyzed through the microfluidics-based Drop-seq, mRNA sequencing for the preparation of de novo assembled gene sets, in silico analysis workflow, and morphology-based cell classification.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66954-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Using the Drop-seq procedure, we profiled a total of 2566 cells and obtained a median value of 2427 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), 1193 genes, and 2.9% of mitochondrial genes per cell across three replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). There was some transcriptional variability, which may have resulted from the artifacts of the Drop-seq system, because it is consistent with the original Drop-seq paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>) and with recent findings in other organisms, such as fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carmona et al., 2017</xref>), flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cho et al., 2020</xref>), and mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Raddi et al., 2020</xref>). We constructed three Drop-seq libraries, which accumulates 1500 cells each from three individual shrimps. The sequence depth of read number per single-cell counts about 800,000 reads per cell based on the calculation that 400 million reads from NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit/three individual shrimp/1500 cells. Conventionally, this read number is sufficient for any biological clustering with reference to the additional information of Drop-seq <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mccarrolllab.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Figure_S3_REV.pdf">original paper</ext-link>; however, we obtained a median value of 2427 UMIs per cell, which is lower than other organisms such as <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> counting 8000 UMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>) or HEK (human) and 3T3 (mouse) cells counting 9000 UMIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Macosko et al., 2015</xref>), respectively. This is due to the lack of genomic information of <italic>M. japonicus</italic>; hence, we prepared de novo assembled transcripts for the read mapping.

GHSR is a receptor for ghrelin and stimulates growth hormone secretion in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Smith et al., 2001</xref>). Growth hormone-releasing peptide-6 (GHRP-6) is a synthetic peptide that mimics the effect of the endogenous ligand ghrelin and has a strong growth hormone secretagogues activity.

CHF is a hematopoietic factor of crayfish, and the silencing of CHF leads to an increase in the apoptosis of cells in HPT and a reduction in the number of circulating hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jiao et al., 2016</xref>).

Transglutaminase (TGase) plays critical roles in clotting and hematopoiesis, and there are two types of TGases in shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Söderhäll, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lin and Söderhäll, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). In crayfish, different types of TGases are localized in different types of hemocyte, in immature hemocytes and granular hemocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Junkunlo et al., 2020</xref>). In our scRNA-seq, different types of TGases were expressed in different cluster of hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that shrimp TGases are also expressed in different places. More interestingly, it is reported that TGase is not expressed in all granulocytes in crayfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Junkunlo et al., 2020</xref>). Our result was in accordance with the previous study because not 100% of the hemocytes expressed TGase in clusters Hem 5 and Hem 6. Alpha2-a2m of shrimp contributes to clotting pathway and are stored in the granules of hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chaikeeratisak et al., 2012</xref>). Since our results also showed strong expression of a2m in Hem 5 and Hem 6, these clusters are predicted to be a granulocyte. Coagulation factor and hemocytin are related to clotting pathway in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lavine and Strand, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kotani et al., 1995</xref>). Strong expression of the whole clotting-related genes was predicted in Hem 1, Hem 2, Hem 5, and Hem 6, except Hem 3 and Hem 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although it is not possible to estimate which genes are working in clotting pathway and how, it is clear that there were populations, Hem 3 and Hem 4, that are not involved in clotting.</p><p>Melanization is performed by PO and controlled by the prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation cascade in shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amparyup et al., 2013</xref>). Except prophenoloxidase-activating factor 2-like (PPAF2-like) and QM protein, melanization-related genes were expressed in Hem 4 to Hem 6. This result is consistent with the fact that <italic>proPO</italic> was a marker gene for mature hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the previous study, the strong PO activity was observed in granules of hemocytes in crayfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Giulianini et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting that PO activity and granules are closely related. In addition, it is considered that mature granulocytes are involved in melanization. Although the detailed functions of PPAF2-like and QM protein were still unknown except that these genes are involved in proPO cascade in shrimp, it is reasonable to conclude that melanization or proPO cascade is the product of a cascade reaction through the entire hemocytes, not just granulocytes.</p><p>Phagocytosis is a crucial defense mechanism against bacteria and viruses in shrimp. Many types of genes are involved in phagocytosis, such as receptors for recognition, downstream signal pathways, and intracellular regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). In kuruma shrimp <italic>M. japonicus</italic>, <italic>integrin alpha PS</italic> is reported as a marker for hemocytes that mediates phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koiwai et al., 2018</xref>). However, it is reported that different subpopulations of hemocytes seem to exhibit specific preferences of different bacteria or viruses in phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Since there are many cascades for phagocytosis and various molecules work together, it is difficult to determine which cluster is centralized, but various phagocytosis-related genes are expressed relatively strongly in Hem 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). <italic>Rab7</italic> was found to be highly expressed in Hem 1, which is known to be involved in the endosomal trafficking pathway of virus-infected penaeid shrimp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). However, there have been no detailed functional studies of <italic>Rab7</italic> on whether it is involved in phagocytosis in shrimp, so it is early to determine its role in Hem 1.</p><p>Some of the hemocyte type-specific markers related to their immune function have been studied in crayfish: proPO in matured hemocytes, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD) in semi-granular cells (SGC), and Kazal-type proteinase inhibitor (KPI) in granular cells (GC), and TGase in immature cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Söderhäll, 2013</xref>). The usefulness of proPO and TGase as markers has already been discussed above. Both <italic>KPI</italic> and <italic>SOD</italic> were mostly expressed at both Hem 5 and Hem 6, and their expression levels were similar between these clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>). These results suggest that the functional segregation of hemocytes in shrimp is different from that in crayfish.</p><p>We also identified other immune-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6</xref>). <italic>Notch</italic> and <italic>pellino</italic> regulate AMPs expression through the signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ning et al., 2018</xref>). As discussed in the section explaining cluster-specific markers, <italic>ML protein, VRP,</italic> and <italic>Vago 5</italic> are related to virus infection. Molecules that directly affect defense, such as AMPs and clotting-related genes, are more abundantly expressed in Hem 4 to Hem 6, whereas molecules that regulate immune system seem to be more abundantly expressed in Hem 1 to Hem 3. In other words, it was predicted that agranulocytes play a role in signaling for immune system, and that granulocytes are responsible for direct biological defense functions. In addition, the expression of virus infection-related genes, <italic>ML protein</italic>, <italic>VRP,</italic> and <italic>Vago 5</italic>, suggests Hem 2, Hem 3, and Hem 4 might play important roles when virus infect shrimp.</p><p>In the mosquito, scRNA-seq revealed a new subpopulation called ‘antimicrobial granulocytes’ that expressed characteristic AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Raddi et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>M. japonicus</italic>, the expression patterns of immune-related genes were also different among certain clusters, suggesting that shrimp hemocytes are more heterogeneous than previously thought.

The sorted populations were observed using microscopy. FACS was able to separate hemocytes into two morphologically different populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>): smaller cells with low internal complexity in region 1 (R1) (50.7 ± 5.2%) and larger cells with high internal complexity in region 2 (R2) (47.7 ± 3.4%). From differential interference contrast (DIC) and dye staining imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–D</xref>), we observed that cells in the R1 region contained no or few granules in the cytoplasm.

The combination of FACS and qRT-PCR results confirmed that the gene expression of the two populations in shrimp hemocytes was roughly divided based on morphology, that is, agranulocytes and granulocytes, which is consistent with our scRNA-seq analysis. Some of these genes were not statistically different in the t-test, but due to the small sample size, we used the mean values for discussion. Granulocytes found in the R2 region expressed major AMPs, such as <italic>penaeidin</italic>, <italic>crustin</italic>, and <italic>stylicin</italic>, suggesting that they consist of clusters Hem 4 to Hem 6.

Our conclusion that the cells in R1 and R2 regions separated by FACS consist of Hem 1–3 and Hem 4–6, respectively, is quantitatively supported by the fact that Hem 1–3 and Hem 4–6 cover 60.4 and 39.6% of whole cells, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed that there are six subpopulations of hemocytes in shrimp. This result provides us a detailed and advanced understanding of the cell classification over previous strategies based on various approaches, such as simple staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Söderhäll and Smith, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johansson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">van de Braak et al., 2002</xref>), monoclonal antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Xing et al., 2017</xref>), flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koiwai et al., 2017</xref>), and lectin-binding profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Koiwai et al., 2019</xref>). We hope that future studies will clarify the relationships between these phenotypic features and our classification to comprehend the role of each cluster in the immune system of shrimp.</p><p>The cluster-specific markers and cell proliferation-related genes found here helped us to understand how shrimp hemocytes differentiate. A strong expression of <italic>TGase</italic>, cell proliferation-related genes, and G2/M state-related genes in Hem 1 suggested that hemocytes in this cluster are oligopotent and located upstream in the differentiation process. In crustaceans, especially shrimp and crayfish, it is known that hemocytes are produced in HPT, and that differentiated hematopoietic cells from HPT circulate in the body fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">van de Braak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Söderhäll, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Söderhäll, 2013</xref>). Hem 1 accounts for only 6.5% of the analyzed cells, which indicates that only a very small fraction of oligopotent or initial state hemocytes exists among the circulating hemocytes. Many of the markers that were characteristically expressed in Hem 1 could not be functionally predicted by the BLAST search (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We speculate that the characteristic genes of Hem 1 are associated with cell duplication or differentiation. The division and differentiation mechanisms of shrimp hemocytes are still largely unknown, and no techniques on culture shrimp hemocytes in vitro have been reported. The analysis of these unknown gene characteristics may reveal these mechanisms.</p><p>Our results also revealed that the growth-related genes were expressed on specific clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It was predicted that several growth factors are involved in differentiation and maturation of hemocytes, and that these factors play roles in the maturation of hemocytes through several cellular processes. In <italic>P. monodon</italic>, a model has been proposed in which hemocytes differentiate linear to two types of granulocytes from a single type of agranulocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">van de Braak et al., 2002</xref>). Our study strongly supports this previous study. We would also like to emphasize that shrimp hemocytes are not completely separated into distinct cell types, and their differentiation process is rather continuous. Loss and gain function studies of these growth-related genes are necessary to prove the full differentiation process of penaeid shrimp hemocytes.</p><p>Crayfish’s hemocytes and <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes have been classified into three and four major types according to the marker genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tattikota et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Söderhäll, 2016</xref>). The relationship between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and shrimp was almost impossible to establish on the hemocyte-type markers. Also, for crayfish hemocyte markers, there was no difference between clusters according to <italic>SOD</italic> and <italic>KPI</italic> that are the markers of SGC and GC, respectively. Insects and crustaceans are thought to become independent about 500 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rota-Stabelli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Thomas et al., 2020</xref>), and shrimp and crayfish are thought to have become evolutionarily independent about 450 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wolfe et al., 1901</xref>). Thus, it is straightforward to reason that the functions of these genes have changed during the evolutionary process. Therefore, we should not simply argue that the morphological and functional similarities between shrimp and <italic>Drosophila</italic>/crayfish hemocytes are the same. Interestingly, however, <italic>proPO</italic> (or <italic>PPO</italic>) was found to be highly expressed in mature hemocytes in shrimp, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and crayfish alike. Therefore, it is possible that <italic>proPO</italic> is a marker gene for mature hemocytes, at least in common with these three species. It is unclear to what extent this trend will hold, but it is interesting to examine why this trend is conserved across species.</p><p>There have been a number of studies to investigate the function of hemocytes, but most of them were done on whole hemocytes because of the difficulty in distinguishing and isolating cell types. Here, we predicted the major functions, that is AMPs releasing, clotting, melanization, and phagocytosis, of each hemocyte population. The strong expression of the AMPs, melanization, and phagocytosis-related genes in mature hemocytes revealed that granulocytes are the cells that play a central role in immune activity in shrimp. Furthermore, clotting-related genes were strongly expressed in Hem 1 and Hem 2, indicating that agranulocytes are the main player in clotting. In addition, the expression of genes that is known to be elevated by viral infection was high in Hem 3 and Hem 4. This may indicate that these hemocyte populations are the ones that work during virus infection. Or, the percentage of this hemocyte population may increase during viral infection, while the amount of gene expression in the hemocytes remains the same. This aspect will be clarified by studying the expression dynamics in shrimps infected with viruses or bacteria. In mature hemocytes, the final products of the immune response, such as <italic>AMPs</italic>, <italic>a2m</italic>, and <italic>proPO</italic>, were strongly expressed, whereas the genes responsible for the middle of the cascade, such as <italic>PPAF</italic>, <italic>Notch</italic>, <italic>pellino</italic>, <italic>ML protein</italic>, and <italic>Vago 5</italic>, were expressed in immature or differentiated hemocytes. This observation suggests that the immune system is not governed solely by granulocytes, but there is a communication with agranulocytes in response to foreign substances.</p><p>In conclusion, we succeeded in classifying shrimp hemocytes into six subpopulations based on their transcriptional profiles, while they were only classified into two groups using FACS. Furthermore, our results imply that hemocytes differentiate from a single initial population. Although we have not yet successfully cultured crustacean hemocytes in passaging cultures, information on these subpopulations and marker genes will provide a foothold for hemocyte culture studies. Despite our success in the classification of hemocytes, we have not yet been able to fully understand the functions of each hemocyte group in detail. One reason for this is that the functions of some marker genes are still unknown. The present single-cell transcriptome data serves as a platform providing the necessary information for the continuous study of shrimp genes and their functions. Additionally, we have only determined the subpopulations of hemocytes in the normal state, so that our next goal will be to analyze the hemocytes in the infected state of certain diseases at different levels of cell maturation. In this way, we will be able to identify the major subpopulations that may work against the infectious agent. Likewise, it will be interesting to see how hemocytes from fertilized eggs mature. Additionally, single-cell analysis of HPTs can also be expected to reveal more detailed differentiation mechanisms. Unlike terrestrial invertebrates, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mosquitoes, shrimps are creatures that live in the ocean and are evolutionarily distant from each other. There is room for improvement in genomic information, library preparation efficiency, functional prediction, etc., but this kind of single-cell study in shrimp will provide efficient solutions to aquaculture problems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The following steps were performed in triplicates for three shrimp individuals. Briefly, the self-built Drop-seq microfluidic device was prepared by molding polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Sylgard 184, Dow Corning Corp.) from the microchannel structure formed by the negative photoresist (SU-8 3050, Nippon Kayaku Co.). Using this device, droplets containing a cell and a Barcoded Bead SeqB (ChemGenes Corporation) were produced up to 2 mL per sample using a pressure pump system (Droplet generator, On-chip Biotechnologies Co., Ltd.). During the sample introduction, the vial bottles containing cells and beads were shaken using a vortex mixer to prevent sedimentation and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biočanin et al., 2019</xref>). Droplets were collected from the channel outlet into the 50 mL corning tube and incubated at 80°C for 10 min in a water bath to promote hybridization of the poly(A) tail of mRNA and oligo d(T) on beads. After incubation, droplets were broken promptly and barcoded beads with captured transcriptomes were reverse transcribed using Maxima H Minus Reverse Transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature (RT) for 30 min, then at 42°C for 90 min. Then, the beads were treated with Exonuclease I (New England Biolabs) to obtain single-cell transcriptomes attached to microparticles (STAMP). The first-strand cDNAs on beads were amplified using PCR. The beads obtained above were distributed throughout PCR tubes (1000 beads per tube), wherein 1× KAPA HiFi HS Ready Mix (KAPA Biosystems) and 0.8 µM 1st PCR primer were included in a 25 μL reaction volume. PCR amplification was achieved using the following program: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min; 4 cycles at 98°C for 20 s, 65°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 6 min; 12 cycles of 98°C for 20 s, 67°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 6 min; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The amplicons were pooled, double-purified with 0.9× AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter), and eluted in 100 μL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O. Sequence-ready libraries were prepared according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Picelli et al., 2014</xref>. A total of 1 ng of each cDNA library was fragmented using home-made Tn5 transposome in a solution containing 10 mM TAPS-NaOH (pH 8.5), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10% dimethylformamide at 55°C for 10 min. The cDNA fragments were purified using a DNA Clean and Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research) and eluted in 25 µL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O. The index PCR reaction was performed by adding 12 µL of the elute to a mixture consisting of 1× Fidelity Buffer, 0.3 mM dNTPs, 0.5 U KAPA HiFi DNA polymerase (KAPA Biosystems), 0.2 µM P5 universal primer, and 0.2 µM i7 index primer. Each reaction was achieved as follows: initial extension and subsequent denaturation at 72°C for 3 min and 98°C for 30 s; 12 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 63°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. The amplified library was purified using 0.9× AMPure XP beads and sequenced (paired-end) on an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer (NextSeq 500/550 High Output v2 kit [75 cycles]); 20 cycles for read1 with custom sequence primer, 8 cycles for index read, and 64 cycles for read2.

To remove data from low-quality cells or empty droplets, we filtered digital expression data with unique feature counts over 4000 or less than 500 and mitochondrial counts over 10% or less than 1%, then the remained 2566 dataset was used for the further analysis. SCTransform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) was performed to remove the technical variation, while retaining biological heterogeneity. We ran a PCA using the expression matrix of the top 3000 most variable genes. The total number of principal components (PCs) required to compute and store was 50. The UMAP was then performed using the following parameters: n.neighbors, min.dist, and n.components were 50L, 0.2, and 2, respectively, to visualize the data in the two-dimensional space, and then the clusters were predicted with a resolution of 0.4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Functional prediction of the highly expressed genes and clusters</title><p>The de novo assembly constructed 30,986 transcripts. However, not all transcripts were not so expressed in our single-cell data. Thereby, we limited to the highly expressed genes as ‘Ex50’ that represent 50% of the total normalized expression data.

In the FSC/SSC two-dimensional space, two main populations were predicted as R1: small/simple and R2: large/complexity populations, which were defined as agranulocytes and granulocytes, respectively. After sorting, some sorted hemocytes were immediately fixed in 2% formalin in KPBS and stained with a May-Grunwald and Giemsa staining solution to observe the cellular components. Briefly, fixed hemocytes were smeared on a glass slides and dried, stained for 5 min with 20% May-Grunwald stain solution (Merck KGaA) in 6.67 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), washed with phosphate buffer, stained for 15 min with 4% Giemsa stain solution (Merck KGaA) in 6.67 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.6), and washed with tap water, dried, mounted with malinol (Muto Pure Chemicals). Non-stained and stained hemocytes were subjected to microscopy IX71 (Olympus Corporation) to observe their structures.</p><p>Total RNA was also collected from sorted cells and pre-sorted cells. The concentration of RNA was measured using a nanodrop, and cDNA was transcribed using a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Constructed cDNA was diluted five times with TE buffer and subjected to qRT-PCR with a number of cycles as 40 using KOD SYBR qPCR (TOYOBO Co. Ltd.), following the manufacturer’s protocol. When the CT value was not detectable, we set a CT value of 40 to use for ΔCT calculation.

This study takes advantage of single-cell RNA sequencing and profiles the diversity and putative lineages of shrimp hemocytes. The primary claims are well supported by the data, and this study will contribute substantially, not only to crustacean biology but also related areas.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single-cell RNA-seq analysis reveals penaeid shrimp hemocyte subpopulations and cell differentiation process&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor.

Previous study indicates phagocytosis by hemocyte is a crucial defense mechanism for the host against infections (PMID: 32194551).

Your revised article has been evaluated by Utpal Banerjee (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>As you can find below comments, the reviewers agreed that the authors addressed most of the concerns by reanalyzing and processing the data. Yet, the new data raise additional points with regards to (1) considerably different conclusions obtained by alternative parameters and (2) multiple calls of the same gene transcripts in some analyses due to the lack of reference genome. These points need to be reanalyzed if possible or at least be discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors performed additional analyses and successfully addressed all the major concerns. The authors substantially enhanced the quality of data by removing dead cells and increasing UMI/gene counts. Although overall numbers of UMI and genes are still lower than those of other model organisms, it would be potentially improved with a reference genome which is expected to be built shortly. The quality of clustering is also clear enough. Further, descriptions of in vivo experiments and models are simplified as suggested, and I hope to see in-depth validation in the near future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to all questions but my main concern is that when they remade the analysis nearly completely, the results were so different with a new software and when new parameters are used. This is a bit worrying especially for the lineage determination. In the first version the conclusion was four lineages and now only two lineages. The authors need to explain why the resolution is so very different.</p><p>A problem that should at least be discussed is related to the lack of genome sequence, and this is evident for example in figure 8 figure supplement 1, where several transcripts seem to be from the same gene (AMH87234.1 = Mj-18245 + Mj-19281+ Mj-20968 and ABW88999.1=Mj-3787+Mj-19067+Mj-19338+Mj-28125). This is always a problem when using transcriptome instead of a fully annotated genome, and it is important to be aware of that single-cell RNA-seq provides only a snapshot of each individual cell and they may be in different stages of the cell cycle and / or turnover of RNA. Therefore, transcripts belonging to the same gene should be merged when possible. I realize that this is impossible for all transcripts, but for known important immune genes and/or cell cycle genes used in the clustering and lineage determination it should be done.</p><p>Regarding the validation at line 492 and forward, this is still not meaningful. The authors say that BrdU incorporation and in situ hybridization are not possible for shrimp hemocytes, but there are several published studies showing in situ hybridization of crustacean hemocytes so this answer is difficult to understand. The FACS-analysis is not a good enough separation, and in situ hybridization of some of the transcripts could be of value to show the morphology of the corresponding cell. Maybe morphology doesn't tell us so much, but this is important to show.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors did a great job in the revised manuscript to address all the concerns that I had for the first submission.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66954.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the study was well-performed and analyzed and bears the potentials to improve understandings of shrimp immune systems.

This is probably due to the improvement in the number of detected UMIs. The early version showed four pathways because the resolution of the analysis was low, and we think the newer version, with its improved resolution of gene analysis per cell, is the best for the current situation. Also, the endpoints of the previous four pathways are thought to be enclosed in the current pathway. We do not believe that our result is complete, and we expect that more detailed studies will be conducted in the future as reference genomes become available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A problem that should at least be discussed is related to the lack of genome sequence, and this is evident for example in figure 8 figure supplement 1, where several transcripts seem to be from the same gene (AMH87234.1 = Mj-18245 + Mj-19281+ Mj-20968 and ABW88999.1=Mj-3787+Mj-19067+Mj-19338+Mj-28125).

We also used a program called EvidentialGene to exclude similar genes as much as possible, and we tried to exclude duplicates using a program called CD-HIT, but it did not work as well as EvidentialGene. As you pointed out, if we summarized only specific genes by ourselves, it would be a bias, so we conducted the analysis based on the results of clustering by EvidentialGene in this manuscript.

Also, we strongly agree with the &quot;Maybe morphology doesn't tell us so much&quot; part. However, we believe that the significance of this paper lies in the fact that we applied single cell analysis to shrimp hemocytes and established guidelines for a classification. The actual function of the markers and differentiation factors discovered in this study is the target of future research, and we would like to challenge more molecular biological assay systems at that time. We believe that the reader will understand the challenges of this research result, as we have also described them in the summary section after Line 595.</p></body></sub-article></article>
