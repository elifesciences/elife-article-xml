Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + palmitic acid (PA) decreased lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>) and increased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> through mitochondrial ROS, which was suppressed in <italic>Trpm2</italic>-KO macrophages. Inflammasome activation and metabolic inflammation in adipose tissue of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice were ameliorated by <italic>Trpm2</italic> KO. ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling occurred after lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release whose blockade attenuated LPS + PA-induced inflammasome. Subsequently, store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup>entry (SOCE) was activated whose inhibition suppressed inflammasome. SOCE was coupled with K<sup>+</sup> efflux whose inhibition reduced ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> content ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>) and impaired [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> recovery. LPS + PA activated KCa3.1 channel, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel. Inhibitors of KCa3.1 channel or <italic>Kcnn4</italic> KO reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub>, attenuated increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> or inflammasome activation by LPS + PA, and ameliorated HFD-induced inflammasome or metabolic inflammation. Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release induced delayed JNK and ASC phosphorylation through CAMKII-ASK1.

The detailed mechanism of inflammasome activation by lysosomal stress has been unclear, while roles of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release were suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okada et al., 2014</xref>). K<sup>+</sup> efflux is crucial in most inflammasome activations, facilitating NLRP3-NEK7 oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharif et al., 2019</xref>).

We found that LP induces mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) that activates a lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux channel (TRPM2), leading to lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, delayed JNK activation, ASC phosphorylation, and inflammasome activation. We also found occurrence of ER<bold>→</bold>lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling sustaining lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux and subsequent store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) in inflammasome. Finally, we elucidated the roles of K<sup>+</sup> efflux facilitating SOCE through hyperpolarization-accelerated extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guéguinou et al., 2014</xref>), and identified KCa3.1 Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channel as the K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel in LP-induced inflammasome and metabolic inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release by mitochondrial ROS in inflammasome</title><p>We investigated whether lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release occurs in inflammasome activation by LP, a combination activating inflammasome related to metabolic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wen et al., 2011</xref>).

We next measured lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> content ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>) that can be affected by lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> determined using Oregon Green BAPTA-1 Dextran (OGBD) was significantly lowered by LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), consistent with lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.

However, we observed no activation of TRPM2 current on the plasma membrane of MΦs treated with LP, arguing against the roles of plasma membrane TRPM2 in inflammasome by LP. Further, dissipation of lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> reservoir by bafilomycin A1 abrogated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> increase by LP, strongly supporting the roles of lysosomal TRPM2 rather than plasma membrane TRPM2 in inflammation by LP.</p><p>We observed decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> in inflammasome activation by LP, which was due to ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling through IP<sub>3</sub>R to replenish diminished [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> after lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Previous papers have shown the roles of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> in inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>); however, the role of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> replenishing reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub> in inflammasome has not been addressed. Direct Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux from ER to cytoplasm, which was reported in inflammasome activation by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), cannot explain ER→lysosome refilling or abrogation of LP-induced increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> by bafilomycin A1, which would not decrease but increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release into cytoplasm due to abrogated lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">López Sanjurjo et al., 2014</xref>). Likely due to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to replenish reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>Lys</sub>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>ER</sub> was reduced, which in turn induced SOCE. Then, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx appears to replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> after ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> loss due to ER→lysosome Ca<sup>2+</sup> refilling. The roles of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in inflammasome have been suggested, while extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx was unrelated to ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tseng et al., 2017</xref>). STIM1 aggregation and its colocalization with ORAI1 strongly support SOCE in inflammasome by LP to replenish ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaca, 2010</xref>), which is different from the activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing receptor by extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> reported in ATP-induced inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). We have observed that BTP2 inhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through ORAI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogeski et al., 2010</xref>) suppressed LP-induced inflammasome, suggesting that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is a process of SOCE through STIM1/ORAI1 channel activated by ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion rather than a direct extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cytoplasm through TRPM2 on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhong et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, these results additionally support the roles of lysosomal TRPM2 but not plasma membrane TRPM2 in LP-induced inflammasome.</p><p>We observed that K<sup>+</sup> efflux occurs in inflammasome by LP, similar to that by other activators. K<sup>+</sup> efflux through KCa3.1 channel appears to induce NLRP3 binding to NEK7 and oligomerization, which was inhibited by TRAM-34 or <italic>Kcnn4</italic> KO. Previous papers suggested the roles of KCa3.1 channel in SOCE, while such relationship was unrelated to inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duffy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2010</xref>). A KCa3.1 channel activator, together with LPS, has been reported to induce IL-1β release; however, the roles of KCa3.1 channel in authentic inflammasome have not been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schroeder et al., 2017</xref>). Although we observed significant roles of KCa3.1 channel in inflammasome activation, contribution of other Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> channels such as BK channels cannot be eliminated since iberitoxin, a BK channel inhibitor, has been reported to inhibit ATP-induced inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schroeder et al., 2017</xref>). However, the relationship between BK channel and Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was not studied. Previous papers also reported the roles of TWIK2 channel, a two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channel, in K<sup>+</sup> efflux in ATP-induced inflammasome, which was inhibited by quinine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di et al., 2018</xref>). The role of THIK-1, another two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channel in IL-1β release from microglia by ATP, has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Madry et al., 2018</xref>). However, inflammasome by LP was not inhibited by quinine. Further, the relationship between K<sup>+</sup> efflux through two-pore K<sup>+</sup> channels and SOCE was not studied. The relationship between ATP-induced P2X7 activation and K<sup>+</sup> efflux could be distinct from coupling of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and K<sup>+</sup> efflux by lysosomotropic agents or other events primarily affecting lysosomal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Di et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Muñoz-Planillo et al., 2013</xref>).

These results suggest mitochondrial ROS-lysosomal TRPM2 axis as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of metabolic inflammation. Elucidation of KCa3.1 channel as the K<sup>+</sup> efflux channel in inflammasome and its role in facilitation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through SOCE would provide another target for modulation of inflammasome that is activated in a variety of diseases or conditions in addition to metabolic syndrome.

After staining with 5 μM MitoSOX (Invitrogen) at 37°C for 30 min and suspension in PBS-1% FBS, cells were subjected to flow cytometry on FACSVerse (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Measurement of KCa3.1 and TRPM2 current</title><p>To measure KCa3.1 channel activity with intact cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> environment, nystatin perforated whole-cell patch was performed. 180–250 μg/ml of nystatin was added to intracellular pipette solution (140 mM KCl, 5 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 mM MgATP, and 10 mM HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.3 with KOH). The extracellular bath solution (145 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM sucrose, pH adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH) was perfused through recording chamber. After perforated whole-cell configuration is formed, KCa3.1 current was activated by applying ramp-pulse voltage from –120 to 60 mV. Voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels were suppressed by –10 mV holding potential. Intrinsic KCa3.1 current activity was isolated by application of a selective inhibitor, TRAM-34. Activity of TRAM-34-sensitive current was analyzed with slope conductance fitting between –60 to –40 mV.</p><p>To measure plasma TRPM2 channel activity, conventional whole-cell patch was performed. To induce TRPM2 current, 200 μM of ADP-ribose was added to intracellular pipette solution (87 mM Cs-glutamate, 38 mM CsCl, 10 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM EGTA, and 0.9 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). Cells were perfused with extracellular bath solution (143 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 10 mM glucose, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH) during TRPM2 current recording. When maximal TRPM2 current was established, 20 μM ACA was added to inhibit TRPM2 current.</p><p>Patch clamp experiments were performed at room temperature. Patch clamp pipettes were pulled to resistances of 2–3 MΩ with PP-830 puller (Narishige, Japan). Electrophysiological data was recorded and analyzed with Axopatch 200B, Digidata 1440A, and Clampfit 11 program (Axon Instruments, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All values are expressed as the means ± s.e.m. from ≥3 independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was tested with two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test to compare values between two groups. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s test was employed to compare between multiple groups. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni, Sidak, or Turkey’s test were employed to compare multiple repeated measurements between groups. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Version 8 software (La Jolla, CA). p values &lt;0.05 were considered to represent statistically significant differences.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>CEO of LysoTech, Inc</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the Public Health Service Policy in Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

The experimental approaches used to study the calcium dynamics are highly problematic and the results shown are of very poor quality.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) The analysis of lysosomal Ca2+release is being carried out after many hours of treatment. Such evidence is not meaningful to claim that PA activates Ca2+ efflux from lysosome and even if this phenomenon was robust, it is not doubtful that such kinetics are meaningful for the regulation of inflammasome activation. Furthermore, the evidence for lysosomal Ca2+ release is indirect and relies on a convoluted process that doesn't make any conceptual sense to me. In addition to these major shortcomings, the indirect evidence of perilysosomal Ca2+ elevation is also of very poor quality and from the standpoint of my expertise in calcium signaling, the data are incredulous. The use of GCaMP3-ML1, *transiently transfected* into BMDMs is highly problematic. The efficiency of transfection in BMDMs is always extremely low and overexpression of the sensor in a few rare cells can lead to erroneous observations. The overexpression also results in gross mislocalization of such membrane-bound sensors. The accumulation of GCaMP3-ML1 in the ER of these cells would prevent any credible measurements of perilysosomal Ca2+ signals. A meaningful investigation of this process in primary macrophages requires the generation of a mouse line wherein the sensor is expressed at low levels in myeloid cells, and shown to be localized almost exclusively in the lysosomal membrane. The mechanistic framework built around these major conceptual and technical flaws is not especially meaningful and since these are foundational results, I cannot take the main claims of this study seriously.</p><p>A few transfected cells may overexpress the protein through a strong promoter but this is not ideal. For reliable Ca2+ measurements, one needs low expression of the sensor in a substantially high percentage of cells. This can only be demonstrated by showing the time lapse of Ca2+ responses in the macrophages. More generally, I have nearly 2 decades of experience working with primary BMDMs and it is widely known that primary BMDMs are incredibly difficult to transfect - it is the nature of these cells. The claim that they get high efficiency of transfection is frankly too incredulous to take seriously.</p><p>(2) The cytosolic Ca2+ imaging shown in figure 1C doesn't make any sense. It looks like a snapshot of basal Ca2+ many hours after PA treatment - calcium elevations are highly dynamic. Snapshot measurements are not helpful and analyses of Calcium dynamics requires a recording over a certain timespan. Unfortunately, this technical approach has been used throughout the manuscript. Also, BAPTA-AM abrogates IL-1b secretion because IL-1b transcription is Ca2+ dependent - the result shown in figure 1D does not shed light on anything to do with inflammasome activation and it is misleading to suggest that.</p><p>(3) Trpm2-/- macrophages are known to be hyporesponsive to inflammatory stimuli - the reduced secretion of IL-1b by these macrophages is not novel. From a mechanistic perspective, this study does not add much to that observation and the proposed role of TRPM2 as a lysosomal Ca2+ release channel is not substantiated by good quality Ca2+ imaging data (see point 3 above). Furthermore, the study assumes that TRPM2 is a lysosomal ion channel. One paper reported TRPM2 in the lysosomes but this is a controversial claim, with no replication or further development in the last 14 years. This core assumption can be highly misleading to readers unfamiliar with TRPM2 biology and it is necessary to present credible evidence that TRPM2 is functional in the lysosomal membrane of macrophages. Ideally, this line of investigation should rest on robust demonstration of TRPM2 currents in patch-clamp electrophysiology of lysosomes. If this is not technically feasible for the authors, they should at least investigate TRPM2 localization on lysosomal membranes of macrophages.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, authors showed TRPM2 localization but these results are problematic. The authors provide no information on what TRPM2 antibody they used for this study and whether it has been validated by use of knockouts. The staining shows very high amounts of TRPM2 all across the cell - even more than LAMP2. In reality, TRPM2 expression in macrophages is very low. Are the authors overexpressing TRPM2? These data only add to my concerns about this manuscript.</p><p>(4) Apigenin and Quercetin are highly non-specific and their effects cannot be attributed to CD38 inhibition alone. Such conclusions need strong loss of function studies using genetic knockouts of CD38 - or at least siRNA knockdown. Importantly, if indeed TRPM2 is being activated downstream of CD38, this should be easily evident in whole cell patch clamp electrophysiology. TRPM2 currents can be resolved using this technique and authors have Trpm2-/- cells for proper controls. Authors attempted these experiments but the results are of very poor quality. If the TRPM2 current is being activated through ADPR generated by CD38 (in response to PA stimulation), then it is very odd that authors need to include 200 uM cADPR to see TRPM2 current (Fig. 3A). Oddly, even these data cast great doubt on the technical quality of the electrophysiology experiments. Even with such high concentrations of cADPr, the TRPM2 current is tiny and Trpm2-/- controls are missing. The current-voltage relationship is not shown, and I feel that the results are merely reporting leak currents seen in measurements with substandard seals. Also 20 uM ACA is not a selective inhibitor of TRPM2 - relying on ACA as the conclusive diagnostic is problematic.</p><p>(5) TRPM2 is expressed in many different cell lines. The broad metabolic differences observed by the authors in the Trpm2-/- mice cannot be attributed to macrophage-mediated inflammation. Such a conclusion requires the study of mice wherein Trpm2 is deleted selectively in macrophages or at least in the cells of the myeloid lineage.</p><p>(6) The ER-Lysosome Ca2+ refilling experiments rely on transient transfection of organelle-targeted sensors into BMDMs. See point #1 to understand why I find this approach to be highly problematic. Furthermore the data procured are also not convincing and lack critical controls (localization of sensors has not been demonstrated and their response to acute mobilization of Ca2+ has not been shown inspire any confidence in these results).</p><p>(7) Authors claim that SCOE is coupled to K+ efflux. But there is no credible evidence that SOCE is activated in PA stimulated macrophages. The data shown in Fig 4 supp 1 do not investigate SOCE in a reliable manner - the conclusion is again based on snapshot measurements and crude non-selective inhibitors. The correct way to evaluate SOCE is to record cytosolic Ca2+ elevations over a period of time in absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+. However, even such recordings can be unreliable since the phenomenon is being investigated hours after PA stimulation. So, the only definitive way to demonstrate that Orai channels are indeed active during this process is through patch clamp electrophysiology of PA stimulated cells.</p><p>Authors failed to respond to these concerns in a credible manner and simply tried to obfuscate the matters with extraneous arguments and wild claims. The revised manuscript was not a significant improvement. I have major concerns with this manuscript and let it be on record that this is very poor-quality science.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87561.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this manuscript by Kang et. al., the authors investigated the mechanisms of K+-efflux-coupled SOCE in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by LP（LPS+PA, and identified an essential role of TRPM2-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release and subsequent IP3Rs-mediated ER Ca2+ release and store depletion in the process. K+ efflux is shown to be mediated by a Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa3.1). LP-induced cytosolic Ca2+ elevation also induced a delayed activation of ASK1 and JNK, leading to ASC oligomerization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

Regarding the role of lysosomal TRPM2 in inflammation, we have shown that bafilomycin A1 treatment abrogated increase of cytosolic Ca2+ by LPS+PA (Figure 3-figure supplement 1D), supporting the role of lysosome and lysosomal Ca2+ in inflammasome activation by LPS+PA.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that TRPM2 expression on lysosome needs to be tested.

Thus, we have conducted in vitro stimulation of TRPM2-KO primary peritoneal macrophages with LPS+PA. We have observed that IL-1β release of TRPM2-KO macrophages in response in vitro treatment with LPS+PA was significantly lower than that from wild-type macrophages (Figure 2C &amp; D), showing the role of TRPM2 in macrophages in inflammasome activation by LPS+PA, which could be independent of TRPM2 in tissues or cells other than macrophages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The ER-Lysosome Ca2+ refilling experiments rely on transient transfection of organelle-targeted sensors into BMDMs. See point #1 to understand why I find this approach to be highly problematic. Furthermore, the data procured are also not convincing and lack critical controls (localization of sensors has not been demonstrated and their response to acute mobilization of Ca2+ has not been shown to inspire any confidence in these results).</p></disp-quote><p>Ans We agree with the reviewer’s comment that transfection or ER-targeted Ca2+ sensor could have artifactual effects. However, we have studied ER-Lysosome Ca2+ experiment using not only GEM-CEPIAer but also using D1ER, a FRET-based ER Ca2+ sensor which has an advantage of short distance of molecular interaction. Thus, we believe that changes of ER Ca2+ after treatment with LPS+PA is not due to an artifactual effect. Multiple contact between VAPA and ORP1L (Figure 4E) also supports ER-lysosome contact, likely facilitating ER-lysosome Ca2+ flux.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Authors claim that SCOE is coupled to K+ efflux. But there is no credible evidence that SOCE is activated in PA stimulated macrophages. The data shown in Fig 4 supp 1 do not investigate SOCE in a reliable manner - the conclusion is again based on snapshot measurements and crude non-selective inhibitors. The correct way to evaluate SOCE is to record cytosolic Ca2+ elevations over a period of time in absence and presence of extracellular Ca2+. However, even such recordings can be unreliable since the phenomenon is being investigated hours after PA stimulation. So, the only definitive way to demonstrate that Orai channels are indeed active during this process is through patch clamp electrophysiology of PA stimulated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Ans We agree with the reviewer’s comment that the final proof of SOCE activation is activation of Orai channel evidenced by electrophysiology. However, we have shown STIM1 aggregation colocalized with Ora1, which is another strong evidence of SOCE channel activation (Vaca L. Cell Calcium 47:199, 2010). Such a paper showing the role of SOCE aggregation in SOCE activation was incorporated in the text (line 4 from the bottom of page 10) and References.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript by Kang et. al., the authors investigated the mechanisms of K+-efflux-coupled SOCE in NLRP3 inflammasome activation by LP（LPS+PA, and identified an essential role of TRPM2-mediated lysosomal Ca2+ release and subsequent IP3Rs-mediated ER Ca2+ release and store depletion in the process. K+ efflux is shown to be mediated by a Ca2+-activated K+ channel (KCa3.1). LP-induced cytosolic Ca2+ elevation also induced a delayed activation of ASK1 and JNK, leading to ASC oligomerization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Overall, this is an interesting and comprehensive study that has identified several novel molecular players in metabolic inflammation. The manuscript can benefit if the following concerns could be addressed:</p><p>(1) The expression of TRPM2 in the lysosomes of macrophages needs to be more definitively established. For instance, the cADPR-induced TRPM2 currents should be abolished in the TRPM2 KO macrophages. Can you show the lysosomal expression of TRPM2, either with an antibody if available or with a fluorescently-tagged TRPM2 overexpression construct?</p></disp-quote><p>Ans We agree with the reviewer’s comment that TRPM2 expression on lysosome needs to be tested. We conducted confocal microscopy after immunofluorescent staining using anti-TRMP2 and -LAMP2 antibodies, which showed a certain portion of TRPM2 was colocalized with LAMP2. This result was incorporated as Figure 2-figure supplement 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Can you use your TRPM2 inhibitor ACA to pharmacologically phenocopy some results, e.g., about [Ca2+]ER, [Ca2+]LY, and [Ca2+]i from the TRPM2 knockout?Ans We agree with the reviewer’s comment that the effect of ACA on other experimental results needs to be shown. We did not study the effect of ACA on Ca2+ flux; however, we have observed that ACA inhibited IL-1β release in response to LPS+PA. This data was incorporated as Figure 3-figure supplement 1A.</p></disp-quote><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87561-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Fig. S4A, bathing the cells in zero Ca2+ for three hours might not be ideal. Can you use a SOCE inhibitor, e.g, YM-58483, to make the point?</p></disp-quote><p>Ans We agree with the reviewer’s comment that SOCE inhibitor experiment would be necessary in addition to the experiment employing zero Ca2+. In fact, we have already used two SOCE inhibitors (2-APB and BTP2) (Figure 4-fig. supplement 1 B-D). Particularly, BTP2 experiment could eliminate possible role of ER Ca2+ inhibition that might occur when 2-APB was employed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Fig. 1A, you need a positive control, e.g., ionomycin, to show that the GPN response was selectively reduced upon LP treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>Ans We did not employ ionomycin as a control in this study. In our previous study using other agents inducing lysosomal Ca2+ efflux, we have observed lysosomal Ca2+ efflux with intact subsequent ionomycin response. While we did not include ionomycin in the current paper, we are positive that ionomycin response would be preserved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>See Public Review.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(5) In Fig. 4B, the red label should read &quot;BAPTA-1 Dextran&quot;, but not &quot;GAPTA-1 Dextran&quot;.</p><p>(6) Writing should be improved in many sections.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
