individual units share costs and benefits through both task specialization and exchanged materials. Socially exchanged fluids, like seminal fluid and milk, allow individuals to molecularly influence conspecifics. Many social insects have a social circulatory system, where food and endogenously produced molecules are transferred mouth-to-mouth (stomodeal trophallaxis), connecting all the individuals in the society. To understand how these endogenous molecules relate to colony life, we used quantitative proteomics to investigate the trophallactic fluid within colonies of the carpenter ant <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic>. We show that different stages of the colony life cycle circulate different types of proteins: young colonies prioritize direct carbohydrate processing; mature colonies prioritize accumulation and transmission of stored resources. Further, colonies circulate proteins implicated in oxidative stress, ageing, and social insect caste determination, potentially acting as superorganismal hormones. Brood-caring individuals that are also closer to the queen in the social network (nurses) showed higher abundance of oxidative stress-related proteins. Thus, trophallaxis behavior could provide a mechanism for distributed metabolism in social insect societies. The ability to thoroughly analyze the materials exchanged between cooperative units makes social insect colonies useful models to understand the evolution and consequences of metabolic division of labor at other scales.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Division of labor is essential for cooperation, because groups can achieve more when individuals specialize in different tasks. This happens across the natural world, from different cells in organisms performing specific roles, to the individuals in an ant colony carrying out diverse duties. In both of these systems, individuals work together to ensure the survival of the collective unit – the body or the colony – instead of competing against each other. One of the main ways division of labor is evident within these two systems is regarding reproduction. Both in the body and in an ant colony, only one or a few individual units can reproduce, while the rest provide support. In the case of ant colonies, only queens and males reproduce, while the young workers nurse the brood and older workers forage for food.</p><p>This intense cooperation requires close communication between individual units – in the case of some species of ants, by sharing fluids mouth-to-mouth. These fluids contain food but also many molecules produced by the ants themselves, including proteins. Given that both individuals and the colony as a whole change as they age – with workers acquiring new roles, and new queens and males only reared once the colony is mature – it is likely that the proteins transmitted in the fluid also change.</p><p>To better understand whether the lifecycles of individuals and the age of the colony affect the fluids shared by carpenter ants <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic>, Hakala et al. examined the ant-produced proteins in these fluids. This revealed differences in the proteins shared by young and mature colonies, and young nurse ants and older forager ants. In young colonies, the fluids contained proteins involved in fast sugar processing; while in mature colonies, the fluids contained more proteins to store nutrients, which help insect larvae grow into larger individuals, like queens. Young worker ants, who spend their time nursing the brood, produced more anti-aging proteins. This may be because these ants are in close contact with the queen, who lives much longer than the rest of the ants in the colony. Taken together, these observations suggest that ants divide the labor of metabolism, as well as work and reproduction.</p><p>Dividing the labor of metabolism among individuals is one more similarity between ants and the cells of a multicellular organism, like a fly or a human. Division of labor allows the sharing of burden, with some individuals lightening the load of others. Understanding how ants achieve this by sharing fluids could shed new light on this complex exchange at other scales or in other organisms. By matching proteins to life stages, researchers have a starting point to examine individual molecules in more detail.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>life history evolution</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>social physiology</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>tradeoff</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR00P3_179776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>LeBoeuf</surname><given-names>Adria C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003497</institution-id><institution>Bundesbehörden der Schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020.0228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hakala</surname><given-names>Sanja M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Socially exchanged fluids passed mouth-to-mouth in ant colonies contain protein signatures of colony maturity and individual behavioral role, indicating that this fluid may underlie a distributed metabolism that functions over the scale of the colony.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the course of social evolution, related organisms have formed cooperative entities such as multicellular organisms or groups of social animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szathmáry, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Queller, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamilton, 1963</xref>). In social animal groups, collective decisions on movement, reproduction and even development are needed for survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Couzin, 2009</xref>). Some social groups have taken this coordination to a very high level: social insect societies develop and function as a single unit instead of as competing individuals, as ‘superorganisms’ paralleling the development of multicellular organisms as a single unit rather than as a set of competing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson and Linksvayer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boomsma and Gawne, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In these superorganismal societies, reproductive queens and males function as the germline, and workers as the soma. Similarly to different tissues in multicellular organisms, workers can be further specialized and exhibit division of labor across different behavioral and morphological castes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourke, 2011</xref>). While morphological castes are determined during development, the behavioral caste of an individual worker typically changes during its lifetime. At the beginning of their adult life, workers specialize inside the nest as nurses focusing on brood care, and as they age, they switch to foraging outside of the nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huang and Robinson, 1996</xref>). Social insect colonies also go through life stages. Young colonies have an initial growth phase where they solely produce one type of worker, and only later in their life cycle they may produce more specialized worker castes and finally, males and queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wilson, 1971</xref>). The switch to reproductive phase is a major life-history transition at the colony level, and connected to female caste determination. In social Hymenoptera, determination of whether a female larva develops into a queen or a worker, and what kind of worker exactly, is controlled by intricate differences of gene expression of the same female genome, guided primarily by environmental factors, in particular nutrition and social cues, sometimes partially influenced by genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wheeler, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rajakumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schwander et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Coordinated function of tightly integrated groups such as social insect colonies, and subgroups such as their different castes, has been described as social physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2020</xref>), consisting of various behavioral, morphological, and molecular mechanisms that ensure cooperation and inclusive fitness benefits for all group members. As a part of their social physiology, some social insect societies have developed a form of social circulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wheeler, 1928</xref>), where nutrition and endogenously produced functional molecules, such as hormones, are transferred mouth-to-mouth from the foregut of one individual to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LeBoeuf et al., 2018</xref>). This social fluid transfer is called stomodeal trophallaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meurville and LeBoeuf, 2021</xref>). It ensures not only that food is distributed to all adults and larvae within the colony, but also that all individuals of the colony are interconnected through shared bodily fluids. Trophallactic fluid of ants and bees typically contains endogenous proteins involved in digestion, immune defense and developmental regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that this fluid transmits more than food.</p><p>Molecular signals are important in controlling the colony life histories and guiding caste determination both at the colony level and at the individual level. Queen pheromones are central signaling molecules acting across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kocher and Grozinger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nijhout and Wheeler, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pamminger et al., 2016</xref>). Juvenile hormone and vitellogenin are central signaling molecules in classical insect development that may also play across-individual roles in some social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LeBoeuf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scharf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harwood et al., 2019</xref>). Together with fundamental nutrient-response signaling pathways (insulin, TOR), these molecules establish the developmental trajectories of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chandra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Libbrecht et al., 2013</xref>). In solitary organisms, such molecules are produced and function solely within the organism’s own body. In contrast, in social Hymenoptera even the molecules traditionally functioning within-individuals can be secreted to the crop and distributed among the society members through trophallaxis and the social circulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Molecular components transmitted through trophallaxis, namely juvenile hormone and juvenile hormone esterase-like proteins, have been shown to influence the development of ant larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LeBoeuf et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible that molecules in trophallactic fluid may influence caste determination, similarly to honeybee workers feeding larvae with royal jelly to direct their development toward a queen fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buttstedt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buttstedt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kamakura, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kucharski et al., 2015</xref>). The molecular functions of trophallactic fluid are still largely unstudied, but it is known, for example, that social isolation changes its composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>), with some protein components of this fluid shifting with social environment. In medicine, such correlations are typically used to define biomarkers for specific conditions and treatments, and often both accurately predict function and provide mechanistic insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Strimbu and Tavel, 2010</xref>). We propose that trophallactic fluid could both reflect and affect the social environments of the colony, thus providing important cues for collective decision making. However, it is not yet feasible to study the causes and consequences of the molecular composition of trophallactic fluid, as it is still largely unknown how much and what kind of qualitative and quantitative variation is present.</p><p>If indeed trophallactic fluid acts as a form of social circulatory system, managing distributed metabolic processes related to colony maturation, endogenously produced factors should correlate with colony life stages. To test this, we analyzed the trophallactic fluid proteome of the carpenter ant <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> at different scales. Our aim is to demonstrate that trophallactic fluid proteomes are filled with biomarkers reflecting biotic and abiotic conditions at both the colony and individual scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We sought to determine whether the endogenously produced proteins present in trophallactic fluid create a robust biomarker-like signature of colony status. To assess this, we analyzed the trophallactic fluid proteomes of colonies at different stages in the colony life-cycle (<italic>Young vs. Mature</italic>), of colonies in natural conditions or kept in the lab (<italic>Field vs. Lab</italic>), and between colonies found on different nearby islands (<italic>East vs. West</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Because trophallactic fluid proteins may be differentially expressed, transmitted, and/or sequestered across the social network of a colony, we also analyzed trophallactic fluid proteomes of single individuals in different colony ‘tissues’ – in-nest workers taking care of brood and out-of-nest workers (<italic>Nurse vs. Forager</italic>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of study design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Four comparisons, <italic>Young vs. Mature</italic>, <italic>Nurse vs. Forager</italic>, <italic>Field vs. Lab</italic>, and <italic>East vs. West</italic>, analyzed in this study with sample numbers indicated in parentheses.

species</title><p><italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic> is a common species of carpenter ant in the south-eastern USA, and has already been the focus of previous trophallactic fluid analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">LeBoeuf et al., 2018</xref>). They live in dead wood or in man-made structures, often in urban habitats, and forage for honeydew, floral nectar, extra-floral nectar, and arthropod prey. Each colony has a single, singly mated queen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadau et al., 1996</xref>), and polydomous nest-structures where queenless satellite nests are common. Colonies grow to tens of thousands of workers and produce sexual brood only after multiple years of initial growth. Large established colonies have two morphologically differentiated worker castes, with variably sized small-headed minors focusing on brood care when young and foraging when old, and big-headed majors that engage in nest defense, foraging and food storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deyrup, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Colony and sample identification</title><p>The species was identified based on worker and queen morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deyrup, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deyrup, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Moreau et al., 2014</xref>). In line with previous studies, we use the name <italic>C. floridanus</italic> with the knowledge that the taxonomy and nomenclature of the C. <italic>atriceps</italic> complex (to which it belongs) is not fully resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deyrup, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We collected full young colonies (0–80 workers) and mature colony extracts (30–200 workers) on several Florida Keys islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) in winter 2019 and 2020. A colony was deemed ‘young’ if the worker population was &lt;100, primarily minors, and the queen was found (meaning both that the species could be clearly identified and that the nest was not a queenless satellite of an established colony), and ‘mature‘ if the colony was larger ( &gt; 1000 individuals visible) and the opened nest contained many large aggressive majors. Young colonies lack majors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gibson, 1989</xref>) and individuals are generally less aggressive. We only collected mature colony samples when we also found larval brood in the opened nest. In our study area, we observed that young colonies are typically found nesting in different material than are mature colonies. Young colonies are often found under stones or in lumps of clay-like mud associated with crab burrows a short distance from the water, whereas the mature colonies were found nesting in large pieces of damp rotting wood.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Laboratory rearing</title><p>Young colonies were brought to the lab and maintained in fluon-coated plastic boxes with a mesh-ventilated lid, at 25 °C with 60 % relative humidity and a 12 hr light/dark cycle. Each colony was provided with one or more glass tube for nesting, 10 % sugar water, and a Bhatkar &amp; Whitcomb diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatkar and Whitcomb, 1970</xref>) and some <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. One week prior to proteomic sampling, we substituted the honey-based food with maple syrup-based food to avoid contamination with honeybee proteins (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Trophallactic fluid collection</title><p>Field samples of trophallactic fluid were collected within eight hours of ant collection. Of the 20 young colonies and 23 mature colonies, workers collected from two of the mature colonies (L and N) were subdivided into six fragments to assess variation within a single colony (two samples from major workers, two samples from brood-associated workers, and two samples from the remaining minor workers). For all other analyses, only one of these for each colony (referred to as minors1) was used to avoid pseudo-replication. In the laboratory, the trophallactic fluid samples underlying the <italic>Field vs. Lab</italic> comparison were sampled after six months in the lab. The four colonies used for the single individual analyses had been in the lab for 18 months at the time of trophallactic fluid collection.</p><p>Trophallactic fluid was obtained from CO<sub>2</sub>- or cold-anesthetized workers whose abdomens were gently squeezed to force them to regurgitate the contents of their crops. This method of collection was shown previously to correspond to the fluid shared during the act of adult-adult stomodeal trophallaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LeBoeuf et al., 2016</xref>). For each colony, at least 30 individuals were sampled to obtain at least 10 µl of raw trophallactic fluid. For many young colonies only smaller samples were possible, because of the low number of workers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Young colony samples were only used for further analysis if at least 2.5 µl of trophallactic fluid were collected. For single individual samples, workers with visibly full abdomens were chosen and the obtained sample volumes ranged from 0.7 µl to 2.2 µl. An individual was classified as forager, when it was seen outside the nest tube in the feeding area of an undisturbed laboratory nest box, and a nurse, when it remained in the nest tube even after the tube was removed from the original laboratory nest and placed into a new one. For colonies from which individual samples were collected, a pooled sample was also taken from individuals that remained after individual sampling. Samples were collected with glass capillaries into 5 µl of 1 x Sigmafast Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) with 50 mM Tris pH nine in LoBind eppendorf tubes and were stored –80 C until further analysis. The total proteomics sample number is 73 colony samples of following types: 23 mature colonies with two of them sampled six times, 20 young colonies in the field, 16 young colonies in the laboratory, four laboratory colonies used for single individual sampling; and 40 individual samples: 20 nurses and 20 foragers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein mass spectrometry sample preparation and analysis</title><p>Samples were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer and pH was adjusted with 1 M Tris-Cl, pH 7. After reduction with 1 mM DTT for 10 min at 75 °C and alkylation using 5.5 mM iodoacetamide for 10 min at room temperature protein samples were separated on 4–12% gradient gels (ExpressPlus, GeneScript). Each gel lane was cut into small pieces, proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega) and the resulting peptide mixtures were processed on STAGE tips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shevchenko et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>LC-MS/MS measurements were performed on a QExactive plus mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an EasyLC 1000 nanoflow-HPLC. HPLC-column tips (fused silica) with 75 µm inner diameter were self-packed with Reprosil-Pur 120 C18-AQ, 1.9 µm (Dr. Maisch GmbH) to a length of 20 cm. A gradient of A (0.1 % formic acid in water) and B (0.1 % formic acid in 80 % acetonitrile in water) with increasing organic proportion was used for peptide separation (loading of sample with 0 % B; separation ramp: from 5 to 30% B within 85 min). The flow rate was 250 nl/min and for sample application 650 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode and switched automatically between MS (max. of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> ions) and MS/MS. Each MS scan was followed by a maximum of ten MS/MS scans using normalized collision energy of 25 % and a target value of 1,000. Parent ions with a charge state form z = 1 and unassigned charge states were excluded from fragmentation. The mass range for MS was m/z = 370–1750. The resolution for MS was set to 70,000 and for MS/MS to 17,500. MS parameters were as follows: spray voltage 2.3 kV; no sheath and auxiliary gas flow; ion-transfer tube temperature 250 °C.</p><p>The MS raw data files were uploaded into MaxQuant software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tyanova et al., 2016a</xref>), version 1.6.2.10, for peak detection, generation of peak lists of mass error corrected peptides, and for database searches. MaxQuant was set up to search both the UniProt (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002380">SCR_002380</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org/">https://www.uniprot.org/</ext-link>) and NCBI (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003496">SCR_003496</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) databases restricted to <italic>C. floridanus</italic> (UniProt, February 2020 version; NCBI RefSeq, version 7.5), along with common contaminants, such as keratins and enzymes used for digestion. Carbamidomethylcysteine was set as fixed modification and protein amino-terminal acetylation and oxidation of methionine were set as variable modifications. Three missed cleavages were allowed, enzyme specificity was trypsin/P, and the MS/MS tolerance was set to 20 ppm. The average mass precision of identified peptides was in general less than one ppm after recalibration. Peptide lists were further used by MaxQuant to identify and relatively quantify proteins using the following parameters: peptide and protein false discovery rates, based on a forward-reverse database, were set to 0.01, minimum peptide length was set to 7, minimum number of peptides for identification and quantitation of proteins was set to one which must be unique. The ‘match-between-run’ option (0.7 min) was used, which helps improve the protein identifications especially for our single-individual samples. All proteins labelled as contaminants, reverse or only identified by site were excluded and proteins with scores less than 70 were removed. After the filtering, the dataset contained 519 proteins. Quantitative analysis was performed using iBAQ values. Intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) is the quotient of sum of all identified peptides and the number of theoretically observable peptides of a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schwanhäusser et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analyses of dataset characteristics were performed in Perseus v1.6.15.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tyanova et al., 2016b</xref>), R 3.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">R Development Core Team, 2013</xref>) and Matlab R2020b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Differences in protein numbers among the sample types were analyzed with a negative binomial model, using the function nb.glm from the R-package MASS 7.3–53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Venables and Ripley, 2002</xref>). Proteome variability per sample type, as measured by the coefficient of variation of the iBAQ abundance of each protein when present, was analysed with a generalized linear model with gamma distribution and log-link with the R-package LME4 (1.1–26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). The package multcomp 1.4–15 was used for post-hoc testing for both models. Pearson correlation tests were used to check whether obtained protein number correlates with the sample volume. Because significant correlation was found, all further analyses were done separately for the individual samples that have small volume, and colony samples that have larger volume. Principal component analysis was run in Matlab on raw iBAQ values, for both the individual and the colony datasets.</p><p>Metric for self-similarity (S) within and across samples was calculated in Matlab2020b (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dradri/variation2021">https://github.com/dradri/variation2021</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">LeBoeuf, 2021</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:31122a476d483e6e00038562c8a90309182e32e6;origin=https://github.com/dradri/variation2021;visit=swh:1:snp:3330c4d279416d095a02ffcea90b070bfa731ab0;anchor=swh:1:rev:4a620922992272317f3cedad3dae6e60871cb282">swh:1:rev:4a620922992272317f3cedad3dae6e60871cb282</ext-link>) as follows: pairwise standardized Euclidean distances (dissimilarities, D) were calculated between each pair of samples based on square-root transformed and median subtracted protein abundances; these dissimilarities were averaged for each sample with the other samples within type <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>∈</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and with the samples of the other type <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="false"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and divided by the average dissimilarity to all other samples.

In addition, the extent of spatial effects was analyzed for the field-collected <italic>Young vs. Mature</italic> dataset by dividing the sampling locations to two areas (<italic>East vs. West</italic>). For the colony data, the differing sample volumes may account for a small proportion of the significant differences in the <italic>Young vs. Mature</italic> comparison, and to lesser extent in the <italic>Field vs. Lab</italic> comparison, where sample volume is collinear with the sample type. Our analyses may miss some of the proteins more abundant in the young field collected colonies which have the smallest sample volumes.</p><p>Quantitative proteomic comparisons between sample types were performed independently with three different approaches to robustly identify significantly differing proteins: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Szathmáry, 2015</xref>) classical frequentist t-tests, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Queller, 1992</xref>) linear models with empirical Bayes variance correction, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamilton, 1963</xref>) machine-learning paired with modified Shapley values. Our approach is designed to be at the same time conservative and to find most of the differing proteins among our comparisons of the trophallactic fluid. The frequentist t-tests are the most conservative, and they miss some interesting proteins due to their strict model expectations that allow only to use the most common proteins. The empirical Bayes approach to cope with sample variance is a more flexible method that allows use of the entire dataset, finding important hits also among the rarer proteins, although the high amount of missing values, where iBAQ equals zero, makes the model less powerful for these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kammers et al., 2015</xref>). The machine learning approach paired with modified Shapley values, although less well explored in the current proteomics literature, is promising for its ability to find multivariate patterns that the other methods miss, and results in interpretable classification. For each comparison, we report the full results of all three analyses in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> (significantly differing proteins only) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3 supp4 supp5">Supplementary files 3-5</xref> (all results).

All data were log2 transformed and median-centered, and missing data were imputed by random sampling from normal distribution with 2SD downward shift and 0.3 width for each sample. For colony datasets, we used the permutation-based FDR of 0.05, and for the single individual dataset that contained more borderline-significant proteins, we used a more stable Benjamini-Hochberg FDR with a stricter threshold of 0.01. S0 parameter (similar to fold-change) was set to two for all analyses. All comparisons were run as two-sample t-tests, with the <italic>Field vs. Lab</italic> as paired.</p><p>For the individual dataset, the combined effects of colony identity and behavioral role (<italic>Nurse vs. Forager</italic>) and their interaction were analyzed with two-way ANOVA, with Benjamini-Hochberg FDR corrections performed in R with the base R 3.6.1 command ‘p.adjust’. Both factors were also analyzed separately with multiple- and two-sample t-tests (for colony identity and behavioral role, respectively). To allow comparison to the other statistical methods, only the simple <italic>Nurse vs. Forager</italic> analysis without the interaction was used for combining the lists of significantly different protein abundances. Our balanced sampling guarantees the results of this simpler model are robust enough to find the most descriptive proteins for nurse and forager trophallactic fluid, even when the more complex interactive patterns are lost.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Empirical Bayesian analysis</title><p>We implemented LIMMA (Linear Models for Microarray Data), a method for two-group comparison using empirical Bayes methods to moderate the standard errors across proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kammers et al., 2015</xref>), on our score-filtered iBAQ proteomic datasets with the LIMMA-pipeline-proteomics pipeline 3.0.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050581">http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4050581</ext-link>) developed for R 4.0.2.

If accuracy was below 85%, hyper-parameter tuning was performed with GridSearchCV (sklearn 0.22.1), and the model re-fit. A seed and its corresponding model were not retained for further analysis if accuracy could not be improved above 75 %. Accuracies for <italic>East vs. West</italic> ranged from 33 to 89% and over 20 seeds, only one could be improved above 75 %. The typical parameters: max_depth, 3 or 5; max_features, 'auto'; min_samples_leaf, 3; min_samples_split, 8 or 12; n_estimators, 100 or 500. Samples were classified with out-of-box scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The average accuracies of classification for comparisons were: <italic>Young vs. Mature</italic>, 87 %; <italic>Nurse vs. Forager</italic>, 93 %; <italic>Field vs. Lab</italic>, 91 %; <italic>East vs. West</italic>, 58 %.</p><p>To understand which proteins contributed to the classification, we used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations, shap package v0.37.0 for Python 3), a game theory tool that explains the output of machine learning models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lundberg and Lee, 2017</xref>). To analyze the importance of each protein in a given comparison (feature importance), we averaged the absolute value of the Shapley values per protein across the data to derive the feature importance. Then for each protein, we averaged the feature importances over each of the 10 seeded models. Proteins that have no impact on the model classification receive a feature importance value of 0. When ranked according to average feature importance, the data had an approximate Pareto distribution with an inflection point typically at feature importance of ~0.15. Thus, because there is no established cutoff for significance in this form of analysis, we chose to include as ‘significant’ in further analyses all proteins with a feature importance of &gt;0.15 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).</p><p>For random forest predictions, models trained on the classification between young and mature colonies were used to classify the same young colonies after 6 months in the laboratory. Out-of-box scores were averaged over five seeded models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Orthology, gene ontology, and protein network analyses</title><p>Because little functional work has been done in ants, we analyzed gene ontology terms for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs to our genes of interest.

The protein-protein interaction enrichment analysis in STRING used a hypergeometric test with Benjamini-Hochberg corrected FDR.

Essentially, the authors must focus on the concept of trophallaxis. Thus, the biochemical processes outlined by proteomic analysis should be addressed to explain how the shared physiology of colony works out.</p></disp-quote><p>Our discussion now focuses more on trophallaxis as a whole, and the biomarker-like quality of the changing proteome. We agree the biochemical processes and their role in the shared colony physiology are fascinating topics. We have not yet performed follow-up experiments with the many proteins present in this fluid and thus do not want to over-conclude. We have now stated more clearly in the discussion what the current data can reveal about these topics, what is assumed via orthology, and what needs to be addressed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This manuscript provides a comprehensive proteomic analysis of the trophallactic fluids extracted from carpenter ants. The analytical methods are state-of-the-art, and the results presented should fuel many studies. The vision of the research program, embodied in the title of the paper, is very exciting and is to be encouraged. However, the title of the paper in no way reflects the content of the paper, as none of the functional processes mentioned have been proven. This will require a lot of work and the development of perhaps new bioassays. I truly hope the PI’s lab takes this on a deep and substantial way; the notion of trophallaxis and its socially exchanged fluid has long captivated the fancy of social insect biologists, but with a few specific exceptions, the promise has not yet been realized. The technical and descriptive results presented here lay a strong foundation. For purposes of present publication, I strongly recommend a different title and a revised discussion that reflects the disconnect I outline. Cause/consequence issues need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for seeing our vision and that this is indeed foundational work that will “fuel many studies.” We also agree that the title and discussion contained too much speculation. The aim of this paper was to prove that there is systematic variation in trophallactic fluid in natural populations that correlates with biologically important social conditions, and further, that some proteins in this fluid can both act as biomarkers and be informative about underlying molecular processes. We have now communicated this more clearly in the introduction. In the revised version of the paper, we have reduced the speculation, and where appropriate, made it clear when there is speculation.</p><p>For example, discussion lines 233-238:</p><p>“Overall, our data reveal a rich network of trophallactic fluid proteins connected to the principal metabolic functions of ant colonies and their life cycle. […] Our establishment of biomarkers transmitted over the social circulatory system that correlate with social life will allow researchers to formulate and test hypotheses on these proteins’ &lt;milestone-start /&gt; &lt;milestone-end /&gt; functional roles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Three technical points:</p><p>1) Sample sizes are low for some analyses (2/group) – though they are cleverly pooled.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the reviewer is referring to – none of our sample types had this low sample size (see SI Table 1 for sampling scheme). In contrast, for a proteomics study, our sample sizes are quite high. We are aware that for a study focusing on a natural population, the colony-level sample size of 16 (laboratory colonies) can be considered low, but this has been taken into account in our stringent statistical analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How to distinguish between what animals actually transmit and what is found in the gut? There could be differences.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been addressed in our previous work, where it was shown that the crop content is equivalent to what is exchanged among individuals of this same species during the act of adult-adult stomodeal trophallaxis (Figure 1A, LeBoeuf et al. <italic>eLife</italic> 2016). We have now clarified this in the methods section of the current paper (line 361-364).</p><p>“Trophallactic fluid was obtained from CO<sub>2</sub>- or cold-anesthetized workers whose abdomens were gently squeezed to force them to regurgitate the contents of their crops. This method of collection was shown previously to correspond to the fluid shared during the act of adult-adult stomodeal trophallaxis (17).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there evidence that the substances found are not just the product of digestion of ingested food? The differences between lab and field colony samples supports this.</p></disp-quote><p>In the type of proteomic analysis we have performed (the most commonly used proteomics approach when a genome is available), we detect only proteins found in the reference genome of interest (in our case <italic>Camponotus floridanus</italic>), so excepting cannibalism, we should not see proteins that originate from food. Note that this is why we do not provide lab colonies with the typical lab-reared ant diet that includes honey, as bees are also Hymenoptera, and royal jelly and trophallactic fluid have many proteins in common. Cannibalism could result in trace observation of many proteins, but could not produce the consistent and high-abundance set of proteins that we have observed as they are not produced in those precise ratios in larvae or adults.</p><p>The observed shift in trophallactic fluid from field to lab may reflect a change in diet or microbiome and these are questions that could be further investigated in future work (mentioned in lines 229-232). The clear difference we observe between trophallactic fluid of young and mature colonies, or the difference between the worker castes within a colony, is evidence that the variation observed in trophallactic fluid reflects more than diet.</p><p>“Trophallactic fluid complexity declines over time when colonies are brought from the field to the laboratory. This may reflect dietary, microbiome or environmental complexity – typical of traits that have evolved to deal with environmental cues and stressors (e.g. immunity, (37)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The paper addresses a very important topic that should be of widespread interest to social biologists.</p><p>Journal choice should reflect that this is a technically excellent paper that presents descriptive information but functional significance is highly speculative.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewer agrees that our results are of widespread interest to social biologists. Indeed, our results must be somewhat descriptive, as we are working on a mostly unexplored socially exchanged fluid in a natural population. However, our study design tests clear hypotheses with preplanned sampling and experimental transfer of ant colonies to a new laboratory environment. We present confirmatory results of the hypothesis that trophallactic fluid is complex mixture of biomarker-like molecules and that these biomarkers can be used predict sample origin through machine learning (see random forest predictions, emphasized in lines 151-152). The fact that our evidence for this is correlative does not render it speculative. Indeed, in both ecology and in much of medicine, using correlative evidence is the norm, as it is often impossible to manipulate ecosystems, natural populations and some organisms in a safe and controlled manner. This is what convinced us to invoke the term ‘biomarkers’, &lt;milestone-start /&gt; &lt;milestone-end /&gt; as biomarkers are excellent examples of molecular correlates of larger conditions that have spurred advances in biology and medicine.</p><p>Some of the next steps in our research will be, as reviewer #2 suggested, additional studies on the roles of individual compounds of trophallactic fluid, building on the results of this paper. Additionally, while this study may not have explored the roles of specific molecules, open ended exploration is extremely important and necessary for any scientific advancement in the long run (<italic>eLife</italic> 2020;9:e52157).</p><p>All in all, we are grateful for this comment, as it showed us that we must communicate the aims of our work more clearly – which we have now done both in introduction (line 77-91) and throughout the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee Cross-commenting</p><p>Yes. Most of the discussion is pure speculation because we do t k ow what is exchanged and what the modes of action might be. But it's a great start!</p></disp-quote><p>We have reduced the speculation on the roles of single molecules, and we hope our responses to the points above clarify some of the reviewer’s uncertainties about what is exchanged. However, we do still outline hypotheses for potential functions and origins in the Discussion section, as this study is intended to be a foundation for new lines of research.</p></body></sub-article></article>
