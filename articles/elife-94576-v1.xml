apples are bigger than cherries) to subjective preferences (e.g., cherries are tastier than apples). Whether the brain instantiates these different choices by recruiting either specialised or shared neural circuitry remains debated. Specifically, domain-general accounts of prefrontal cortex (PFC) function propose that prefrontal areas flexibly process either perceptual or value-based evidence depending on what is required for the present choice, whereas domain-specific theories posit that PFC sub-areas, such as the left superior frontal sulcus (SFS), selectively integrate evidence relevant for perceptual decisions. Here, we comprehensively test the functional role of the left SFS for choices based on perceptual- and value-based evidence, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging with a behavioural paradigm, computational modelling, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Confirming predictions by a sequential sampling model, we show that TMS-induced excitability reduction of the left SFS selectively changes the processing of decision-relevant perceptual information and associated neural processes. In contrast, value-based decision-making and associated neural processes remain unaffected. This specificity of SFS function is evident at all levels of analysis (behavioural, computational, and neural, including functional connectivity), demonstrating that the left SFS causally contributes to evidence integration for perceptual but not value-based decisions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>perceptual choice</kwd><kwd>value-based choice</kwd><kwd>left superior frontal sulcus</kwd><kwd>drift-diffusion model</kwd><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00yjd3n13</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>105314_152891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruff</surname><given-names>Christian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00yjd3n13</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII3_141965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruff</surname><given-names>Christian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00yjd3n13</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51NF40_ 144609</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruff</surname><given-names>Christian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00yjd3n13</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCCR Affective Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruff</surname><given-names>Christian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Disrupting left superior frontal sulcus selectively impaired perceptual but not value-based decisions, revealing segregated prefrontal circuits for integrating sensory evidence versus subjective preferences in human choice behaviour.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans and animals alike perform a mélange of goal-directed decisions that require the accumulation of different types of information. If the goal, for example, is to accurately determine whether an apple is bigger than a cherry (perceptual choice), the decision-maker accumulates size information of each fruit; or, the decision-maker may draw out information from personal taste profiles if the goal is to determine whether consuming a cherry over an apple maximises their subjective preferences (value-based choice). Previous studies have shown that different brain circuitries are recruited to accumulate evidence that would instantiate such distinct goal-directed decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Summerfield and Tsetsos, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>); thus, it remains debated to what degree certain decision-making processes share neural circuitry or whether these processes operate under specialised systems. However, prior studies were largely correlational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heekeren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>), and most causal studies were only limited to one type of choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>) and performed in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding and Gold, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Animal studies provide critical causal insights, yet direct translation to humans can be limited by species-specific anatomy and potential non-homologies (e.g., human superior frontal sulcus [SFS] versus frontal orienting fields in rodents). Therefore, establishing causal contributions in the human brain remains essential.</p><p>In the absence of a comparison choice task, it is impossible to ascertain whether neural circuitry is domain-specific to a particular process, or domain-general that it may be involved across many types of choices. Very few studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>) have carefully matched perceptual- and value-based decisions in terms of evidence strength, stimulus display, and response modality, and compared them through the lens of a common sequential sampling framework of evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dutilh and Rieskamp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Krajbich, 2019</xref>), which has long been applied to both perceptual- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>) and value-based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Busemeyer and Townsend, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Usher and McClelland, 2001</xref>) decisions. Such studies were able to identify common and specialised circuitries and mechanisms associated with perceptual- or value-based decisions or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>But unless causality is established, it is even more difficult to attribute the circuitry’s role in evidence accumulation for one or several choice domains, or whether its involvement is peripheral and merely functionally supporting a larger system. Given task complexity, such studies of observing causal neural effects in healthy human populations using non-invasive brain stimulation are incredibly sparse. One previous study has, at least, shown that causally de-synchronising frontoparietal connectivity specifically increased choice variability during value-based choice, but had no effect on perceptual decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>; thus, establishing the causal role of the frontoparietal network during value-based choice. But while indeed causal, the study was limited, relative to the standards of evidence in animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Piet et al., 2017</xref>), since its results, as in many causal stimulation studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>), showed behavioural, but no neural effects. Furthermore, we only have evidence of a single dissociation that shows a causal stimulation effect specific to value-based, and not perceptual choice. What candidate region would show a causal effect that is specific to perceptual, not value-based decisions in a way that would demonstrate a double dissociation?</p><p>Seminal human imaging studies have repeatedly implicated the SFS, a posterior portion of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), during perceptual decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heekeren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mulder et al., 2014</xref>). While these studies have shown correlational evidence, it remains challenging to establish whether the SFS is directly involved in evidence accumulation or whether its observed activity reflects upstream or downstream support processes (e.g., attention or working memory maintenance) rather than the accumulation computation per se. In this context, it is conceivable to imagine that the SFS would only play a role in a broader network that is not specific to the evidence accumulation process. Moreover, causal evidence from human studies is difficult to obtain because most prior causal studies were only limited to one type of choice or performed in animals, and it is unclear if findings can be translated from animal models to human decision-making. However, disruption of human left SFS with non-invasive stimulation has been shown to impact behavioural performance and response speed in a dynamic face-house classification task, in a manner consistent with a reduction of evidence accumulation during decision-making. However, the domain-specificity of SFS contribution is unclear. Some studies have shown that dlPFC activity may reflect value-based evidence integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sokol-Hessner et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting the domain-generality of prefrontal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Owen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petrides, 2005</xref>). However, it is hard to directly compare the implicated neural processes to those that underlie perceptual decision-making processes, due to major differences in the stimuli and experimental approaches classically used in each domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>), and that direct and principled comparisons with other decision-making domains, in general, are largely missing.</p><p>Here, we test the domain-specificity of the left SFS and address the crucial double-dissociation gap in the literature by applying continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS) followed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while human participants alternated between matched perceptual- and value-based choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>). We modelled the observed behavioural changes with the DDM, allowing us to causally associate the stimulated SFS region to specific underlying latent subprocesses of the unfolding decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mulder et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>) as well as BOLD activation. Thus, this common evidence accumulation framework provides us with clear testable hypotheses regarding possible effect patterns across behavioural, computational, and neural levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The experiment</title><p>We recorded fMRI data from hungry, healthy participants (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>20</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft1">\begin{document}$n=20$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) performing perceptual- and value-based choice tasks in alternation (Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For perceptual decisions, participants chose the larger food item, while for value-based decisions, participants chose the food item that they would preferably receive and consume by the end of the experiment. The stimuli and motor responses were identical for both tasks, as in previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>). Choice pairings were predetermined based on participants’ individual subjective perceptual- and value-based ratings of the food items, obtained just prior to the scanning session. Perceptual evidence was defined as the size difference (SD) between the food items, whereas value evidence was defined as the difference in value ratings (VD) between the choice alternatives (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A choice was classified as correct when it was consistent with the previously acquired ratings regarding size and preference, respectively, that is, when the larger-rated item was chosen for perceptual decisions or the higher-valued item was chosen for value-based decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) Logistic regression results show that the larger the evidence strength, the more likely decision-makers will respond accurately.

Following this intervention, participants completed four post-stimulation fMRI blocks. By comparing the effects of stimulation on both types of behaviour and brain activity between post- and pre-stimulation blocks, we identify the role of SFS for either type of decision-making. In particular, we examined whether the SFS is indeed selectively involved in perceptual decisions as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heekeren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our initial fMRI analyses were conducted at two levels. The first analysis aimed to broadly identify brain areas recruited for each choice task and those common to both. In this analysis, we assessed the average BOLD activity at the task level (perceptual versus value-based), irrespective of evidence accumulation. The second analysis focused on areas representing evidence accumulation specific to each type of choice. Here, we assessed how BOLD activity is modulated by trial-by-trial evidence strength. For this analysis, we used evidence strength from each choice task (perceptual or value-based) as a parametric modulator and regressed trial-by-trial evidence strength with BOLD (see Methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Study hypotheses</title><p>Previous studies have identified the causal mechanistic role of the SFS in evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heekeren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>), and its effect on stimulation may arise from one of either two channels. That is, one study reported that SFS disruption during a speeded perceptual categorisation task reduced accuracy and increased response times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>) and found associated decreases in drift rate, the DDM parameter describing the efficiency of sensory evidence integration. In contrast, another human brain stimulation study suggested that behavioural changes due to SFS disruption during a perceptual two-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) task reflect decreases in the decision threshold, characterised by faster response speed but decreased choice precision. Simulations with the same DDM modelling framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>) suggested that the decision threshold parameter could account for individual behavioural changes. Simultaneously acquired fMRI data suggested that SFS does not code the rate of integration but rather the necessary amount of evidence to be accumulated for the perceptual choice at hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To this end, we hypothesise that if SFS neurons indeed selectively accumulate perceptual evidence, we should find that their inhibition by cTBS leads to decreases in choice precision and increases in reaction times, a behavioural pattern that corresponds to a decrease in the DDM drift-rate parameter, and to concurrent increases in BOLD signals (caused by prolonged neural evidence accumulation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Critically, a different pattern can be expected when SFS neurons are involved in setting the criterion, i.e., determining the amount of evidence that needs to be accumulated for a perceptual choice to be taken. In this case, SFS inhibition should result in decreases in both choice precision and reaction times, a decrease in the DDM boundary parameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>), and a reduction in associated neural activity due to the lower amount of evidence accumulated during the shorter response time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Here, we directly test these two contrasting scenarios, by characterising the behavioural, neural, and neuro-computational consequences of cTBS to the left SFS. Crucially, we also investigate for both possible outcomes whether the functional contribution of the SFS during decision-making is indeed specific for perceptual choices, by comparing the results between the two matched types of choices.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Study hypotheses.</title><p>Scenario 1: left superior frontal sulcus (SFS) is causally involved in evidence accumulation.

Since the neural activity devoted to evidence accumulation (area under the curve) should increase (C, left), we would expect higher BOLD signal in this case (C, right).

To establish a fair comparison between perceptual (PDM) and value-based decision-making (VDM), we must necessarily show that we can distinctly identify the brain regions associated with each type of choice, and that behaviour is systematically a function of their respective evidence measures. Initial visual inspection shows that choice accuracy/consistency systematically increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and RTs become faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) the larger the evidence difference, and this holds across tasks and stimulation conditions. All behavioural and fMRI analyses were performed on valid trials only (see Methods for inclusion criteria). Behavioural regressions confirmed that our task design allowed for a clear computational separation of both choice types: during perceptual decisions, participants relied exclusively on perceptual evidence, as reflected in both increased choice accuracy (main effect SD, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.560</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft24">\begin{document}$\beta =0.560,p\lt 0.001$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> and VD, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.023</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.178</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft25">\begin{document}$\beta =0.023,p=0.178$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and faster reaction times (RTs) with larger perceptual evidence, but not value-based evidence (main effect SD, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="false"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.057</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="inft26">\begin{document}$\beta =- 0.057,p\lt 0.001$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> and VD, <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.002</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.281</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft27">\begin{document}$\beta =0.002,p=0.281$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

Thus, our results replicate previous findings obtained with a similar paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polanía et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grueschow et al., 2015</xref>) showing that participants can use exclusively task-relevant evidence to make choices, and they confirm the suitability of our paradigm for directly comparing perceptual- and value-based decisions with matched stimuli and motor responses. Across sessions, RTs tended to shorten in both tasks. In line with the hierarchical drift-diffusion model (HDDM) results—selective boundary reductions for PDM and selective non-decision times (nDT) shortening for VDM—we interpret the VDM RT speed-ups as reflecting more efficient non-decision (sensorimotor) components rather than changes in evidence accumulation. To illustrate baseline trends, we provide session-wise RT trajectories (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref> for RT-by-session).

First, we found visual and motor areas were jointly activated for both types of choices (p &lt; 0.05, FWE-corrected with cluster-forming thresholds at <italic>T</italic>(19) &gt; 2.9; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

At this stage, we were evaluating whether the brain can flexibly recruit distinct brain regions based on task design, irrespective of whether these differences arise from variations in evidence accumulation or other cognitive processes. The second analysis assessed how BOLD activity is modulated by trial-by-trial evidence strength. Here, we identified a parametric modulator for evidence accumulation and regressed it on BOLD activity using a general linear model (GLM). This analysis revealed that the left SFS shows significant activation specifically when perceptual evidence is parametrically modulated. BOLD activity in the left SFS is detectable only when perceptual evidence is considered6. In fact, previous studies have similarly shown that the SFS only appears once a variable that measures the degree of evidence accumulation is included in the analysis6.

In contrast, DT are the component of RT where evidence accumulation actually takes place, and we can measure and derive DT using the evidence-dependent DDM parameters (see Methods for more details).</p><p>Our results showed that the faster RTs observed for value-based decisions after the stimulation indeed did not reflect evidence-dependent choice processes, but rather a change in non-decision-related sensorimotor processes (nDT) (see Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>): this parameter was decreased after stimulation for VDM (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf53"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.062</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft53">\begin{document}$p_{MCMC}=0.062$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) but not PDM (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf54"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.707</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft54">\begin{document}$p_{mcmc}=0.707$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3B</xref>), with a significant difference between these effects (<inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf55"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.041</mml:mn></mml:math><tex-math id="inft55">\begin{document}$p_{mcmc}=0.041$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Taken together, these results suggest that the simultaneous change in RT reveals completely different computational processes, whereby faster RTs during value-based choice are simply a by-product of task-related learning that may perhaps be unrelated to stimulation, while faster RTs during perceptual choice are actually related to decision-relevant, evidence-dependent latent choice processes. However, completely ascertaining whether such effect from stimulation is due to SFS inhibition, we need clear causal evidence of changes from neural processing. The pattern of nDT and decision-time changes is consistent with the posterior-predictive fits shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">6</xref>, with numerical posterior summaries in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8 supp9 supp10 supp11">Supplementary files 8–11</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>fMRI: SFS activation changes for perceptual choices in line with model predictions</title><p>To investigate whether our behavioural and computational results directly relate to task-specific disruption of neural activity in left SFS, we investigated BOLD response changes in this brain area after stimulation. We exploited the fact that our fitted DDM and its latent parameters make clear predictions about how BOLD responses in this area should change if the stimulation affects the neural computations involved in setting the boundary for the necessary amount of evidence accumulation. Importantly, these predictions translate to clear parametric regressors that we can use for trialwise analysis of fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domenech et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu and Pleskac, 2011</xref>).

Using the more detailed trialwise measures, however, the same area can be computed as a function of each trial’s RTs divided by the evidence level, since according to the DDM, the duration of response times is directly proportional to the decision boundary, and the evidence level is directly proportional to the slope of the drift rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ratcliff and Rouder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; see Methods for more details).

Moreover, we used the latter contrast to define fully independent ROIs in OCC processing the visual stimuli independent of task type and performed an ROI analysis on the individual SFS–OCC–PPI betas extracted for each participant.

Our findings are more in line with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>, who also suggested that SFS disruption leads to lower threshold setting. In contrast, previous work has also shown that SFS activity correlates with the evidence accumulation process reflected by the drift rate. These findings are not necessarily incompatible, but rather, they may reflect the interlinked computational mechanisms of the SFS in perceptual evidence accumulation, where the SFS plays a role in setting the decision threshold. Furthermore, our findings, in a way, contribute to closing the double dissociation gap left by previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>), where it was shown that frontoparietal connectivity is causally specific to the precision of value-based, not perceptual choice using the same matched perceptual- and value-based choice task. More importantly, our study provided results above and beyond current standards of causal studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Polanía et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murd et al., 2020</xref>), that was only observed in animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ding and Gold, 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we simultaneously showed that causal TMS effects affected behaviour, latent computations and, more crucially, neural circuitry, as observed by changes in fMRI-BOLD activation after stimulation.</p><p>Many human decision neuroscience studies have employed model-based approaches to identify BOLD signals that correspond to computational processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forstmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Palmeri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wijeakumar et al., 2017</xref>). However, the links between neural and latent computational processing established by these studies are largely correlational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Logothetis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Poldrack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ramsey et al., 2010</xref>), and there are many model alternatives that could possibly account for BOLD signals. Our study illustrates that causal manipulations induced by targeted functional inhibition of brain areas can provide decisive information and provide more direct support for neuro-computational mechanisms posited by cognitive models. Specifically, our study underlines that the DDM provides a plausible mechanistic account of the decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Herz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Turner et al., 2015</xref>), by showing that left SFS inhibition by cTBS affects the evidence representation posited by the model consistently across behavioural, computational, neural, neural–behavioural levels. Importantly, our results directly link changes in behaviour to changes in both latent computations and neural processing, by demonstrating how raw trialwise neural signals from the left SFS can augment the DDM to explain behaviour. This suggests that once brain stimulation studies have established (causal) correspondence between neural activity and latent variables in decision models, such models can be fruitfully extended by neural measures to provide a more complete characterisation and prediction of choice behaviour and potentially its malfunctions.</p><p>Our fMRI inferences rest on model-based assumptions linking accumulated evidence to BOLD amplitude. Alternative mechanisms—such as time-dependent (collapsing) boundaries—could attenuate the prediction that weaker-evidence trials yield longer accumulation and larger BOLD signals. While our behavioural and neural results converge under the DDM framework, we acknowledge this as a general limitation of model-based fMRI. The within-participant design enhances statistical sensitivity, yet the absence of an a priori power analysis constrains our ability to rule out small effects, particularly for null results in VDM. Consistent with this, model-fit indices and posterior-predictive checks indicated that the HDDM captured perceptual decisions somewhat more tightly than value-based decisions. This pattern likely reflects additional sources of variability in subjective value-based choices, together with our decision to keep the model architecture identical across tasks for principled comparison. Nevertheless, posterior-predictive simulations confirmed that, also for the value-based task, the model reproduced choice proportions and full RT distributions at the group and subject level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">6</xref>), indicating that the fit quality is sufficient for the present inferences. Thus, although very small stimulation effects on value-based decision parameters cannot be completely excluded, the convergent behavioural, computational, and neural evidence points to a selective impact of cTBS on the perceptual decision process implemented in left SFS.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Specificity of the SFS during perceptual decisions—only in humans?</title><p>To this end, our study reinforces already established findings by showing that the causal role of SFS during perceptual decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heekeren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>) is a specialised function of evidence integration. Furthermore, our finding of a selective role of left SFS in perceptual evidence accumulation is particularly intriguing. The area appears to be uniquely developed in the human brain, with no close anatomical homologue in other species. In the animal literature, most prefrontal disruption studies in non-human primates have focused on the frontal eye fields (FEF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hanks and Summerfield, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>) and in rodents on the frontal orienting fields (FOF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). While we and others observed disruption of the evidence accumulation process after interfering with SFS function in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>), disruption of the FOF in rodents has not affected behaviour at all or in a qualitatively different manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>). However, the results of electrical stimulation of the FEF in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ding and Gold, 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hanks and Summerfield, 2017</xref>) cannot necessarily be directly compared with TMS studies of human SFS, since FEF and SFS in humans are both structurally and functionally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Murd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, while it is tempting to speculate that the SFS perceptual evidence accumulation process identified here may be specific to humans, it is possible that researchers may have to further consider other putative homologues across species that may truly correspond to the SFS area stimulated here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hanks and Summerfield, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Do value-based decisions also rely on distinct PFC areas?</title><p>At the same time, our findings do not rule out the possibility of SFS involvement during value-based choice, where it may have a secondary function (but one that does not involve value evidence accumulation) or other specialised roles in decision-making. An alternative interpretation is that cTBS to left SFS induces a general speeding of perceptual processes that are engaged in both tasks. Under this view, the same perturbation of a perceptual decision stage could manifest as a reduction in decision boundary in the pure perceptual task, yet be absorbed as a shortening of nDT in the value task when modelled with a single accumulator. Our data cannot completely rule out this multi-stage account for the value task. Importantly, however, such a scenario remains compatible with our central conclusion that SFS plays a primarily perceptual role: any contribution of SFS to the value task would arise via an upstream perceptual component, while the value-comparison process proper is likely implemented in distinct valuation circuitry. The task-specific modulation of BOLD activity in SFS by cTBS during perceptual, but not value-based, choice—together with preserved value sensitivity and the absence of value-related SFS signals—strongly supports this interpretation.</p><p>Beyond our paradigm, previous work has suggested that during value-based decisions, the dlPFC more broadly interacts with the vmPFC to modulate value signals and facilitate self-control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hare et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, value-based decision-making encompasses a wide range of choice types with varying degrees of complexity. For instance, more complex value-based decisions entail choices under risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glickman et al., 2019</xref>), intertemporal choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peters and D’Esposito, 2020</xref>), and strategic or social decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hutcherson et al., 2015</xref>), which may plausibly recruit PFC regions due to working memory demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbey et al., 2013</xref>), adjustment of decision time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sokol-Hessner et al., 2012</xref>), or cost–benefit computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basten et al., 2010</xref>). In light of these additional value-based decision types, the functional specificity of SFS to perceptual decisions that we propose here should be viewed with some caution. Future studies should therefore compare more complex value-based decisions with perceptual decisions, while carefully matching task demands and complexity across domains to avoid confounds induced by context or difficulty.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of SFS in choice criterion setting during perceptual decisions</title><p>That being said, the same holds true with the varying degrees of complexity across perceptual decision-making processes. Our findings show that the mechanism of which the left SFS is causally involved is modulating the decision threshold, with clearly consistent results across behavioural, computational, neural, and neural–behavioural levels. Our findings are more in line with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>, who also suggested that SFS disruption leads to lower threshold setting. In contrast, previous work has also shown that SFS activity correlates with the evidence strength in the accumulation process, as reflected by the drift rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heekeren et al., 2006</xref>). In support of this notion, cortical activity disruption with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation resulted in lower choice accuracy and slower RTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is important to note that these results are not at all incompatible, but reflect the interlinked computational mechanisms of the SFS in perceptual evidence accumulation. All these studies, including ours, point out that the DDM’s drift rate and decision boundary are both decision-relevant latent mechanisms with distinct as well as overlapping implications on choice behaviour: impairments in both boundary and drift lead to lower choice consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>). The main difference, in fact, concerns reaction times: lower drift rate implies slower RTs, while a lower boundary implies faster RTs. The differences in RT-TMS effects of our study and that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref> may reveal the differences in task design and the nature of the stimuli. For instance, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref> used dynamic series of briefly presented sequential face-house stimuli, varying the strength of each stimulus within noise to vary the evidence levels. By contrast, our study and that by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref> presented a static stimulus pair simultaneously during a 2AFC task and varied evidence not with noise but by stimulus difference.</p><p>We speculate that the goals of these tasks (i.e., discriminability from noisy dynamic stimuli versus stimulus SD between static stimuli) may sensitively affect different latent processes. Previous studies have shown that different tasks can produce proximally similar behaviour but may involve different goal functions and therefore, computationally distinct processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Heng et al., 2020</xref>). For instance, noisy dynamic stimuli entail the accumulation of sensory evidence until the decision-maker can form representations suitable for choice discrimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ratcliff and McKoon, 2008</xref>; thus, such stimuli are sensitively modulated by evidence strength and reflected by a lower drift rate when SFS is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>) and where consequently, the circuitry takes more time to form perceptual representations. In contrast, evidence in the form of SD may depend on the sensitivity to which SFS can detect the difference, and this is modulated by the decision threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cavanagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Green et al., 2013</xref>). Here, SFS impairment to accumulate evidence in the context of static, simultaneously presented stimuli may result in the inability of the circuitry to reliably discriminate SDs, resulting in the early termination of the accumulation process, which is behaviourally reflected as lower choice accuracy and faster RTs and computationally as lower thresholds. While a common evidence framework can plausibly reconcile our findings and that of previous studies, future studies should consider addressing this issue directly, by comparing the different goal functions and stimulus displays within perceptual decision-making tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional coupling between left SFS and visual cortex</title><p>Furthermore, our study further expands our understanding of SFS function vis-à-vis other brain regions. It is well established that the PFC is structurally connected with many other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wycoco et al., 2013</xref>) and may flexibly interact functionally with different areas depending on choice demands. Our exploratory connectivity results suggest that the SFS role for domain-specific accumulation of perceptual evidence is not just a local phenomenon but extends to functional communication with visual areas. Inhibition of this area’s functional contribution to evidence accumulation led to an increase in its functional coupling with areas in OCC representing the stimuli visually upon which choices were based. The changes in functional coupling strength between the two cortical regions also corresponded to observed behavioural and latent computational changes. This suggests that perceptual choices rely not only on local processing in SFS but on an integrated functional circuit, comprising both SFS and OCC, at least for decisions based on visual stimuli as studied here. Though exploratory, our results are generally consistent with an occipito-frontal information exchange but extend it specifically to the SFS during perceptual evidence accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bullier et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We can speculate why the OCC may have been recruited after inhibition of the left SFS via cTBS stimulation. For example, it is possible that cTBS-related impairments in the accumulation mechanism implemented by the SFS bias the system to rely on second-best suboptimal mechanisms for solving the tasks, such as template matching from working memory. Previous work has provided converging evidence that maintenance of visual information in working memory enhances coupling between sensory processing in visual cortex and information storage in lateral PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gazzaley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Serences et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, it has been suggested that SFS is canonically organised in ‘memory receptive fields’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Postle, 2016</xref>) that may be more heavily taxed when direct accumulation mechanisms for sensory input are impaired, as in the case of cTBS manipulations. Of course, there are many other candidate mechanisms, such as attention or working memory, that may be more heavily taxed to compensate for the excitability manipulation of the SFS area specialised for processing the sensory evidence, as suggested by previous work on prefrontal–occipital interactions during various attention and working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zanto et al., 2011</xref>). Overall, the exploratory nature of our analysis warrants future investigation on the directionality of information flow between OCC and SFS. Additionally, future studies should also test whether perceptual choices based on other sensory modalities (e.g., touch, audition) lead to a flexible coupling of SFS with the specific sensory areas processing these stimuli. In any case, our study shows clearly that in the healthy, undisrupted human brain, left SFS plays a key role in transforming perceptual evidence into choices.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for theories of PFC organisation</title><p>Our study also contributes to our understanding of PFC functional organisation, given the considerable debates surrounding its organising principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Owen, 1997</xref>). Previous studies have posited that different PFC regions contribute to specific aspects of information processing, in a manner that can be flexibly applied to all types of information, be it from different sensory modalities or in different cognitive formats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Petrides, 2005</xref>). Prevailing perspectives have also proposed an anterior-to-posterior hierarchy in PFC for the purpose of general cognitive control and executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nee and D’Esposito, 2016</xref>), suggesting that the main role of the PFC is largely in the domain of higher-order cognitive and abstract operations that transcend specific functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Domenech and Koechlin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Koechlin and Summerfield, 2007</xref>). In contrast, our finding of a domain-specific causal role of SFS in evidence accumulation for perceptual decision-making suggests that the PFC is organised as a collection of fractionated sub-regions, such that each region processes different types of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goldman-Rakic and Leung, 2002</xref>), as opposed to a systematic hierarchy. Moreover, the fact that the SFS is even involved in the integration of low-level perceptual evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heekeren et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heekeren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Heekeren et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rahnev et al., 2016</xref>) implies that the PFC’s role is not limited to higher-order cognitive function. Overall, our findings are in no position to propose an overarching framework of overall PFC organisation, given the limited area in posterior dlPFC targeted by our study, but rather a call to consider alternative views where the underlying organisational principles are more fractionated and less hierarchical.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Implications for computational psychiatry</title><p>Finally, our finding of SFS causal involvement in decision threshold setting during perceptual decision-making may offer clinical implications. Particularly, manifestations of impulsive behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnett Heyes et al., 2012</xref>) are largely apparent in clinical populations with aberrations in decision threshold setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herz et al., 2016</xref>). However, most studies of these disorders have focused on impulsive behaviour induced by reward or preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Glimcher et al., 2007</xref>). It is important to note here that reward impulsivity is only one of the many domains of aberrant behaviour in clinical populations. Perceptual impulsivity is also important, since many of the behavioural and cognitive deficits are closely linked to impairments in perceptual function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuermaier et al., 2018</xref>). For instance, impulsive behaviour can also arise in non-reward-related settings, such as when perceptually discriminating SDs where less accurate and faster responses have been observed in people with addiction disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banca et al., 2016</xref>) and borderline personality disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berlin and Rolls, 2004</xref>). Perceptual deficiencies are also prevalent in clinical populations with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or Parkinson’s disease and are thought to be linked to impairments in the dopaminergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuermaier et al., 2018</xref>). Prior causal evidence from deep-brain stimulation, in particular, has shown that disrupting the STN lowered decision thresholds, thus increasing this perceptual impulsivity among Parkinson’s patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Herz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Herz et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings that TMS of the left SFS causally and selectively lowered the decision boundary during perceptual decisions suggest that the lateral PFC may be functionally integrated with these cortico-striatal and cortico-subthalamic nuclei (STN) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bogacz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Green et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Green et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Overall, impulsive behaviour is not exclusive to the reward domain, and our results suggest that there is something to gain from understanding impulsive behaviour in non-reward settings requiring decisions on perceptual information. Maladaptive behaviour may not only reflect individual wants or likings, often assumed by addiction studies, but could also be a function of low-level sensory or higher-order cognitive processes that have so far not fully been accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuermaier et al., 2018</xref>). This may have serious implications for how cognitive therapies or interventions are designed, and our findings may provide useful insights in guiding such future work. Particularly, it is worth exploring to what degree the left SFS and its connections are structurally or functionally different in clinical populations, and whether these impulsive tendencies can be captured by sequential sampling models, such as the DDM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty healthy right-handed volunteers (ages 20–30; 8 female) with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated in the study.

During the rating task, we asked participants to provide perceptual- and value-based ratings of the same set of 61 food images using an on-screen slider scale. All of the food items were in stock in our lab and participants were informed about this via visual inspection. For perceptual ratings, participants rated—on a scale from 5% to 100% in steps of 5%—how much of the black background within the white square perimeter was occupied by the food item. For value-based ratings, participants rated—on a scale from 5 to 100 in steps of 5—how much they wanted to eat the presented food item at the end of the experiment.

perceptual or value-based evidence. We matched the visual sensory stimuli of the food items as well as their motor outputs across the two choice types. The only difference was the type of evidence participants had to accumulate to make a choice. Each trial started with presentation of a central fixation marker (length ~0.8°, height ~0.3°). Next, a centrally presented word indicated whether participants would perform a perceptual (word ‘AREA’) or value-based (word ‘LIKE’) choice. On the subsequent screen, the task cue was replaced by either the letter ‘A’ or ‘L’ (~0.2°) to remind participants that they were in a perceptual or value-based block, respectively. Two food items were simultaneously displayed, one above and one below the screen (y eccentricity 3.6°; a white square of 6° width surrounded each food item). Blocks alternated between perceptual- and value-based choices in a given session (7–9 trials per task-block). Participants pressed one of two buttons on a keypad with their right middle finger (upper item) or right index finger (lower item) to indicate their choice. On a given trial, participants had 3 s for their choice; otherwise, the trial would be regarded as a ‘missed trial’ and would not enter the analysis. Analyses were conducted on valid trials only, defined as trials with a registered response within the task’s response window and passing pre-specified validity checks; trials without a response were excluded and not analysed. Participants made correct or consistent choices when they chose the food item with the higher rating as indicated in the double ratings task prior to entering the scanner. After the experiment, participants stayed in the room with the experimenter while they ate the food that was selected based on the participants’ choice in one randomly selected VDM trial. During perceptual decision-making blocks, participants were rewarded with 0.5 CHF every time they correctly discriminated between the SD of the two food items presented on the monitor screen.</p><p>The experiment had a total of 256 trials divided into 8 sessions of 32 trials each. The first four sessions were pre-stimulation sessions where participants performed the task without stimulation. The last four sessions were post-stimulation sessions during which participants performed the choices with decreased neural excitability in the SFS due to the preceding cTBS.

In an initial fMRI session, we acquired high-resolution T1-weighted 3D fast-field echo anatomical scans used for subsequent neuro-navigation (181 sagittal slices, matrix size = 256 × 256, voxel size =1 mm<sup>3</sup>, TR/TE/TI = 8.3/2.26/181 ms, 3T Philips Achieva). The hand area of the left M1 (motor hotspot) was determined by identifying the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) movement-evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by TMS pulses. We delivered single monophasic TMS pulses using a figure-of-eight coil attached to the TMS stimulator. We then marked an equidistant circular grid on each individual’s anatomical MRI scan using a neuro-navigation system over the hand motor region, located at the anterior portion of the central sulcus. We localised the optimal motor hotspot as the point in the grid that elicited the strongest FDI MEPs from TMS pulses. Once we selected the motor hotspot, we asked participants to activate their FDI by pressing their thumb and index finger at about 20% maximum force in order to obtain their active motor threshold (AMT). We defined the AMT as the minimal TMS intensity required to produce MEPs of ≥200 mV amplitude (measured with Magventure MRi-B91) in ≥5–10 consecutive pulses. We retested the AMT by visually inspecting the FDI twitches triggered by TMS pulses over the marked optimal hotspot. The average AMT outside the scanner was 52.35 ± 6.27% while the AMT inside the scanner was 52.91 ± 6.18%. We applied cTBS at an intensity of 80% of the individual’s AMT. The cTBS protocol contained bursts of three pulses at 50 Hz. This protocol has been shown to reduce cortical excitability for at least 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Huang et al., 2005</xref>). Every burst was repeated at a rate of 5 Hz, resulting in 200 bursts with a total of 600 pulses delivered within 40 s.</p><p>Before moving our participant into the scanner, we marked the motor hotspot as well as the stimulation site on a swimming cap fixed in position by straps. Participants wore this cap while they were inside the scanner. Before the start of the fifth session, participants received cTBS over the left SFS. We used a figure-of-eight MR-compatible TMS coil (MRi-B91) attached to a TMS stimulator. Participants returned to the scanner after receiving stimulation and proceeded to complete the last four sessions. On average, the post-TMS fMRI task started 228 ± 41 s after the end of theta-burst stimulation following established protocols from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Knecht et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thut and Pascual-Leone, 2010</xref>). Given the established timeline of cTBS effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Huang et al., 2005</xref>), we expected the stimulation effects to weaken over time due to neural recovery. In line with established procedures, we treated the first two post-stimulation sessions as the actual post-cTBS period and the last two post-stimulation sessions as a recovery period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Philiastides et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Differences-in-differences</title><p>We implemented a DID regression analysis to identify the causal relationships based on stimulation-induced neural inhibition in SFS.

In particular, images were slice-time corrected (to the acquisition time of the middle slice) and realigned to account for subjects’ head motion. Each participant’s T1-weighted structural image was co-registered with the mean functional image and normalised to the standard T1 MNI template using the new-segment procedure in SPM8. The functional images were normalised to the standard MNI template using the same transformation, spatially resampled to 3 mm isotropic voxels, and smoothed using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM, 8 mm).</p><p>We estimated two GLMs, constructed by convolving a series of appropriately placed indicator functions with the default model of the BOLD response embedded in SPM8. GLM1 contained only two indicator functions for the onsets of PDM or VDM trials. On the other hand, GLM2 contained four indicator functions for the onsets of task (PDM and VDM trials) and stimulation (pre- or post-TMS) runs, coupled with one regressor each for parametric modulation of the BOLD response by the trialwise accumulated evidence (aE).

No participant suffered from any neurological or psychological disorder or took medication that interfered with their participation in the study. Participants received monetary compensation for participation and performance of the perceptual choices, as well as one food item to consume after the experiment depending on a random value-based choice trial.

A perceptual choice task in which they compared the sizes of pairs of items and a value-different task in which they identified the higher value option among pairs of items with the two tasks involving the same stimuli. Based on previous fMRI research, the authors sought to determine whether the superior frontal sulcus (SFS) is involved in both perceptual and value-based decisions or just one or the other.

A perceptual choice task in which they compared the sizes of pairs of items and a value-different task in which they identified the higher value option among pairs of items with the two tasks involving the same stimuli. Based on previous fMRI research, the authors sought to determine whether the superior frontal sulcus (SFS) is involved in both perceptual and value-based decisions or just one or the other. Initial fMRI analyses were devised to isolate brain regions that were activated for both types of choices and also regions that were unique to each. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied to the SFS in between fMRI sessions and it was found to lead to a significant decrease in accuracy and RT on the perceptual choice task but only a decrease in RT on the value-different task. Hierarchical drift diffusion modelling of the data indicated that the TMS had led to a lowering of decision boundaries in the perceptual task and a lower of nondecision times on the value-based task.

We are pleased that the multi-pronged approach combining causal manipulation, fMRI, and hierarchical drift–diffusion modelling, as well as the careful matching of perceptual content across the two tasks, came across clearly. We also appreciate the reviewer’s positive remarks on the specificity of our a priori hypotheses and their links to decision-model parameters. In revising the manuscript, we have aimed to further streamline the presentation of these hypotheses and to more explicitly connect the behavioural predictions, model parameters, and neural readouts throughout the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In my previous comments (1.3.1 and 1.3.2) I noted that key results could be potentially explained by cTBS leading to faster perceptual decision making in both the perceptual and value-based tasks. The authors responded that if this were the case then we would expect either a reduction in NDT in both tasks or a reduction in decision boundaries in both tasks (whereas they observed a lowering of boundaries in the perceptual task and a shortening of NDT in the value task). I disagree with this statement. First, it is important to note that the perceptual decision that must be completed before the value-based choice process can even be initiated (i.e. the identification of the two stimuli) is no less trivial than that involved in the perceptual choice task (comparison of stimulus size). Given that the perceptual choice must be completed before the value comparison can begin, it would be expected that the model would capture any variations in RT due to the perceptual choice in the NDT parameter and not as the authors suggest in the bound or drift rate parameters since they are designed to account for the strength and final quantity of value evidence specifically. If, in fact, cTBS causes a general lowering of decision boundaries for perceptual decisions (and hence speeding of RTs) then it would be predicted that this would manifest as a short NDT in the value task model, which is what the authors see.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points and for the helpful clarification. We agree that, in principle, the architecture of the value-based task can be conceived as involving an upstream perceptual process that must be completed, to some degree, before value comparison can proceed. Under such a multistage framework, it is indeed possible that cTBS-induced changes in a perceptual decision stage could manifest as a reduction in boundary separation in the <italic>pure</italic> perceptual task, while the same perturbation appears as a shortening of non-decision time (NDT) when fitting a single-stage DDM to the value task. In this sense, our earlier statement that a “general speeding effect” would necessarily produce identical parameter changes (either NDT or boundaries) in both tasks was too strong, and we are grateful to the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><p>At the same time, this alternative explanation remains fully compatible with our central claim that the left SFS plays a perceptual rather than value-based role. We agree with the reviewer that there must be a stimulus-related circuit (in visual and parietal regions) that encodes the physical attributes of the options, and that this upstream processing can influence both tasks. However, a large body of work suggests that left SFS is not part of this primary identification circuitry, but rather contributes specifically to the accumulation and comparison of sensory evidence (e.g., Heekeren et al., 2004, 2006), downstream from areas such as FFA, PPA, or MT/V5 that encode stimulus identity. In other words, stimulus identification (forming a representation of “what is where”) is anatomically and functionally distinct from the accumulation of evidence toward a perceptual decision. Within this framework, the reviewer’s proposal that cTBS speeds “perceptual decisions” across tasks can be understood as targeting precisely the evidence-accumulation stage we ascribe to SFS, with the value-comparison stage proper likely implemented in other regions (e.g., vmPFC and connected valuation circuitry).</p><p>We therefore do not rely solely on the dissociation between boundary changes in the perceptual task and NDT changes in the value task as decisive evidence against a “general speeding” account. Instead, our interpretation is based on the convergence of behavioural, model-based, and neural results. First, in the perceptual task, cTBS to left SFS leads to a selective reduction in decision boundary and a concomitant change in trialwise BOLD activity within the stimulated region that covaries with perceptual choice behaviour and with the latent decision variable inferred from the HDDM. Second, in the value task, cTBS does not affect value sensitivity or accuracy, nor does it alter value-related drift or boundary parameters; the only robust HDDM effect is a modest shortening of NDT. Third, critically, left SFS BOLD activity is modulated by perceptual evidence and by cTBS in the perceptual task, but we observe no evidence that SFS activity encodes value evidence or shows value-related cTBS neuronal effects in the value task.</p><p>Taken together, these findings indicate that the left SFS serves a causal role in the accumulation of perceptual evidence and in the setting of the choice criterion for perceptual decisions. The reviewer’s suggestion that cTBS may induce a general speeding of perceptual processes that also influences the value task is compatible with this conclusion, in the sense that any contribution of SFS to the value task is best understood as acting via a perceptual component that is upstream of value comparison, rather than via the value accumulation process itself. We have clarified this point in the Discussion of the revised manuscript and now explicitly acknowledge that our DDM dissociation alone does not exclude a general perceptual speeding account, but that the combination of task-specific neural effects in SFS, preserved value-based choice behaviour, and the absence of value-related BOLD changes in SFS strongly support a primarily perceptual role for this region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors set out to test whether a TMS-induced reduction in excitability of the left Superior Frontal Sulcus influenced evidence integration in perceptual and value-based decisions.

We are pleased that the convergence between causal TMS, fMRI, and hierarchical modelling comes across as providing credible evidence for the role of left SFS in perceptual decision-making, and that our attempt to link these results to the existing literature is seen as appropriately nuanced. We also appreciate the reviewer’s positive assessment of the task design, in particular the close matching of perceptual content and motor output across perceptual and value-based decisions, which was central to our goal of testing domain-specific theories of prefrontal function. In revising the manuscript, we have further clarified these design choices and their rationale, and we have streamlined the exposition of how the hypotheses, model parameters, and neural readouts are connected across the two decision domains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I was confused about the model specification in terms of the relationship between evidence level and drift rate. While the methods (and e.g. supplementary figure 3) specify a linear relationship between evidence level and drift rate, suggesting, unless I misunderstood, that only a single drift rate parameter (kappa) is fit. However, the drift rate parameter estimates in the supplementary tables (and response to reviewers) do not scale linearly with evidence level.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and appreciate the opportunity to clarify the model specification.

This is reflected in the somewhat higher DIC values for VDM compared with PDM and in slightly broader posterior-predictive distributions (Supplementary Tables 8–11 and Supplementary Figs. 11–16). We believe this difference primarily reflects the greater intrinsic variability of subjective value-based choices (e.g. trial-to-trial fluctuations in preferences, satiety, or attention), coupled with our decision to use the same relatively simple DDM architecture for both tasks to allow a principled cross-task comparison. Importantly, posterior-predictive checks show that, for VDM as well, the model adequately reproduces both accuracy and full RT distributions at the group and subject level (Supplementary Figs. 11–16), indicating that the fit quality is sufficient for our purposes. In the revised manuscript we now explicitly note that the model captures PDM behaviour more tightly than VDM and that this may reduce sensitivity to very small cTBS effects on value-based decision parameters, even though no systematic effects are evident in our data. Crucially, our central conclusion—that left SFS plays a domain-specific role in setting the decision boundary for perceptual evidence—relies on the robust behavioural, computational, and neural effects observed in PDM and does not depend on assuming a perfect model fit for VDM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Supplementary Figure 3 specifies the distribution for kappa hyper-parameter twice.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this typo.
