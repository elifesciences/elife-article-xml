syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) movement within France, but also involving France in Europe and in the world, remain only partially characterized in this timeframe. Here, we analyzed GISAID deposited sequences from January 1 to December 31, 2020 (<italic>n</italic> = 638,706 sequences at the time of writing). To tackle the challenging number of sequences without the bias of analyzing a single subsample of sequences, we produced 100 subsamples of sequences and related phylogenetic trees from the whole dataset for different geographic scales (worldwide, European countries, and French administrative regions) and time periods (from January 1 to July 25, 2020, and from July 26 to December 31, 2020). We applied a maximum likelihood discrete trait phylogeographic method to date exchange events (i.e., a transition from one location to another one), to estimate the geographic spread of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions and lineages into, from and within France, Europe, and the world. The results unraveled two different patterns of exchange events between the first and second half of 2020. Throughout the year, Europe was systematically associated with most of the intercontinental exchanges. SARS-CoV-2 was mainly introduced into France from North America and Europe (mostly by Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Germany) during the first European epidemic wave. During the second wave, exchange events were limited to neighboring countries without strong intercontinental movement, but Russia widely exported the virus into Europe during the summer of 2020. France mostly exported B.1 and B.1.160 lineages, respectively, during the first and second European epidemic waves. At the level of French administrative regions, the Paris area was the main exporter during the first wave. But, for the second epidemic wave, it equally contributed to virus spread with Lyon area, the second most populated urban area after Paris in France. The main circulating lineages were similarly distributed among the French regions. To conclude, by enabling the inclusion of tens of thousands of viral sequences, this original phylodynamic method enabled us to robustly describe SARS-CoV-2 geographic spread through France, Europe, and worldwide in 2020.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>phylodynamics</kwd><kwd>genomic epidemiology</kwd><kwd>maximum likelihood</kwd><kwd>France</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By producing one hundred SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic trees for different geographical and time scales, the maximum likelihood-based phylodynamic method implemented here enabled to robustly describe SARS-CoV-2 geographic spread through France, Europe, and worldwide in 2020.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>On December 1, 2019, an outbreak of severe respiratory disease was identified in the city of Wuhan, China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was rapidly identified as the agent of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>), responsible for the ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By the end of 2020, the virus caused over 1.8 million deaths worldwide including ~65,000 deaths in France, concomitantly with social and economic devastations in many regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mofijur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Santomauro et al., 2021</xref>). Since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community has thoroughly characterized the virus, including its pathogenesis, the monitoring of its circulation in human populations, and the development of several treatments or vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cevik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krammer, 2020</xref>). Epidemiological models have been particularly helpful to quantify viral spread both in the short and long terms and to inform public health decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoertel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kissler et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to clinical and epidemiological insights, viral whole-genome sequencing has become a powerful and invaluable tool to better understand infection dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Volz et al., 2013</xref>), including the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of available SARS-CoV-2 whole-genome sequences has rapidly grown thanks to the efforts of scientists and researchers gathered via international networks such as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, GISAID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gisaid.org/">https://www.gisaid.org/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Khare et al., 2021</xref>). These genomic sequences are essential to effectively reconstruct the global viral spread and the origins of variants. Genomic data have become a strong asset in addition to epidemiological data to inform governments and help public health decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attwood et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rife et al., 2017</xref>). However, due to the computational time required for many analyses, existing phylogenetic tools are limited for studying large amounts of data such as those generated by widespread viral sequencing. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop methods to analyze large datasets while optimizing computational calculation times. Producing appropriate subsamples through several replicates may be an efficient approach in this matter.</p><p>In France, the first COVID-19 suspected case was identified in late December 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deslandes et al., 2020</xref>), and the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected on January 24, 2020, in individuals who had recently traveled in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernard Stoecklin et al., 2020</xref>). COVID-19 cases remained scarce until the end of February, when the national incidence curve of new SARS-CoV-2 infections started to rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By the end of February, reinforced measures were announced, including social distancing, cessation of passenger flights to France, school closure, and finally, a complete lockdown across the entire country from March 17 to May 10, 2020. The reported daily incidence and numbers of severe cases peaked at the beginning of April 2020 before decreasing steadily until August 2020. However, after the relaxation of social distancing measures in June, a second wave of infections occurred in early September peaking at more than 100,000 positive cases and 1300 confirmed deaths in a single day on November 2, 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After this peak, daily incidence and severe COVID-19 cases gradually diminished down to a number of positive daily cases varying between 2000 and 25,000 at the end of 2020 thanks to a second national lockdown applied between October 29 and December 15, 2020. Epidemiological trends were similar in most European countries except for Russia or Romania, where high rates of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths were reported even in the summer of 2020. Of note, the other continents showed different patterns of virus circulation: compared to Europe, the number of deaths increased about 2 weeks later in North America and remained high throughout 2020; and from early May, Asia and South America were also highly impacted by the pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Timeline of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-related deaths and stringency index in France, 2020.</title><p>Key events are indicated on the timeline.

Here, we analyzed GISAID deposited sequences to elucidate the origins and spread of the virus in France, Europe, and the world from January 1 to December 31, 2020. Through a maximum likelihood discrete trait phylogeographic method, we estimated the main geographical areas that contributed to viral introduction into France and Europe, the countries/continents to which France exported SARS-CoV-2 the most and the contribution of the different French regions to the national circulation of the virus. The main exchanged lineages were also investigated. We looked at the differences in virus circulation during each of the two European epidemic waves of 2020 independently. Given France’s central geographic location in Europe and the high proportion of international travelers visiting this country before the pandemic, we aimed to explore the role that France played in SARS-CoV-2 exchanges both in Europe and worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining appropriate subsamples using simulations</title><p>From January 1 to December 31, 2020, a total of 638,706 sequences were retained in our study. Inferring a phylogenic tree with such a large number of sequences would require very long calculation times. To overcome this limit, we constructed smaller datasets by randomly choosing subsamples (with replacement) of the sequences. The number of sequences for each country at each week was chosen to be proportional to the number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths per country and per week with a 2-week shift to account for the time between infection and death.</p><p>As a proof of concept, we conducted an extensive simulation study to estimate the accuracy of the discrete trait phylogeographic inference for rates of transitions between two distinct locations. First, to evaluate the precision of such inference on a tree of 1000 leaves, we simulated a two-states model with different combinations of transition rates in 50 replicates. Parameters were correctly estimated with limited variability across the 50 replicates.

For each resulting subtree, we conducted inferences on 50 replicates corresponding to 50 realizations of the stochastic process of evolution of the discrete character – as done in the first simulation – on the whole tree of 10,000 leaves. For each replicate, we observed some error on the estimation of the parameter, because one replicate only corresponds to one possible realization of the evolutionary process, although the overall median of inferred parameters across subsampled trees was closer to the true parameter values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Different estimations of the transition rates conducted on different subsampled trees are not expected to be fully independent because the subtrees partly share the same evolutionary history. Therefore, we estimated the level of independence of these estimations. When several estimates are perfectly independent from one another and are averaged to obtain the final estimate of the quantity of interest, we expect the error in parameter estimation to converge to 0 with a 1/<italic>N</italic> (<italic>N</italic><sup>−1</sup>) scaling, where <italic>N</italic> is the number of replicates. This is indeed what we observed when we calculated the error on estimation of the parameter as a function of the chosen number of replicates <italic>N</italic> in the first set of simulations. Here, the replicates were truly independent replicate realizations of the evolutionary history and inference was conducted on the whole tree of 1000 leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). On the contrary, when estimates are perfectly dependent, error on the averaged parameter estimate is expected to not decrease with <italic>N</italic>. When evaluating the error on parameter estimates across subsamples of the large tree, we expected the scaling of error as a function of number of subsamples <italic>N</italic> to be intermediate between non-independence (~<italic>N</italic><sup>0</sup> scaling) and perfect independence (~<italic>N</italic><sup>−1</sup> scaling). Using the relationship between log(error) as a function of log(<italic>N</italic>), we estimated a slope of −0.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, inferences conducted on subsamples of the same phylogenetic tree are partly independent. The precise degree of independence is expected to depend on the shape of the phylogenetic tree, but the coefficient was similar when doing the same study on a randomly generated tree instead of the SARS-CoV-2 tree.</p><p>We finally conducted another round of simulations to evaluate the error on what we considered as exchange between multiple locations when using sparse subsampling. For that, a 1,000,000-leaves tree was simulated with a five-states discrete trait representing geographical units. Then, 100 subsampled 1000-leaves trees from the whole phylogenetic tree were produced and the ancestry for the discrete trait was reconstructed from the leaf data only. We estimated the number of transitions (exchanges) of each type and compared them with the one obtained from the main tree, finding a mean error rate of 2.7% over the 100 subsamples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these simulations suggested that using subsamples of 1000 sequences from a large dataset and performing partially independent replicates seems to be sufficient to accurately estimate transition events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Description of the datasets and global diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences</title><p>We defined 100 subsamples of sequences proportionally to COVID-19 deaths across geographic locations and time for different geographic scales (worldwide, Europe, and French regions) and time periods (from January 1 to July 25, 2020, and from July 26 to December 31, 2020, respectively, covering the first and second European epidemic waves). We chose the sampling intensity guided by the weekly number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths reported by public health organizations. Here, the number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths was used rather than the number of detected cases because the latter was biased due to variable ascertainment rates across countries and time. For example, the larger number of PCR tests conducted in the second epidemic wave could wrongly suggest that the virus circulated much more during the second half of 2020 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>For each geographic scale and time period, there was a positive correlation between the weekly number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths and the weekly number of sequences we included for a subsample (Spearman’s rank correlation, p &lt; 0.001; <italic>r</italic> = 0.94 for the lowest correlation).

Focusing on French administrative regions, sequences available on the GISAID database were very sparse. The Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur (PACA, Marseille area) was the only region that highly sequenced SARS-CoV-2 in 2020.

Both IDF and ARA participated concomitantly in virus spread at similarly large levels (43.3 and 42.6% of the total number of exportation events, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The first exportation events mostly occurred in the spring and summer in IDF. ARA was associated with a high increase in exportation events by the end of July, consistent with the resumption of the epidemic. Again, the second national lockdown – implemented in October 29, 2020 – was associated with a strong decline of the number of exchange events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Regarding introduction events, PACA received 31.3% of the total number of introductions, followed by ARA (24.7%), IDF (24.1%), OCC (11.5%), and BRE (8.2%). Overall, ARA, BRE, OCC, and PACA mostly sent and received the B.1.160 lineage. Only IDF showed a different pattern, exporting at similar rates both the B.1.160 and the B.1.177 lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, SARS-CoV-2 exchange events within France showed two distinct patterns between the first and second epidemic waves of 2020. While most SARS-CoV-2 exchanges involved the Paris area during the first half of 2020, the situation was much more balanced after the summer 2020 with the Lyon area (ARA) also contributing to many exchanges. Viral spread across French regions in summer 2020 could be explained by travel associated with the summer holidays.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Prior to this analysis, the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions within France or between France and other countries (in Europe or worldwide) has been only partially characterized. To our knowledge, three studies have explored the virus spread in France, but only focused on the first French epidemic wave and/or could not address SARS-CoV-2 introduction events from other continents or other European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Danesh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elie and Alizon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gámbaro et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies have focused on larger scales such as Europe as a whole, but did not explore in-depth the dynamics of exchanges especially in France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hodcroft et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nadeau et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we studied introduction and exportation events in France at different scales during the first year of the pandemic, covering the two first European epidemic waves. Our approach provides a way to analyze large amounts of genomic data for future epidemics and improve our understanding of viral spread in France and Europe.</p><p>Methodologically, most phylodynamics studies on SARS-CoV-2, as well as on other viruses or pathogens, are based on Bayesian approaches (notably with the popular and robust BEAST tool; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>) using one or more phylogenetic trees composed of several thousand sequences. To reconstruct the evolution parameters and ancestral states at nodes (here, the geographical area and the SARS-CoV-2 lineage), Bayesian methods require high computational power, representing their main limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drummond and Rambaut, 2007</xref>). Overall, the generation of a dated phylogenetic tree and the ancestral state reconstruction for even a few thousands of sequences is no small feat, requiring a very long computational time, and sometimes parameter estimation fails to converge. Furthermore, conclusions obtained would be based on a single sample with a relatively limited number of sequences, but different samples may lead to different results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall et al., 2016</xref>). As stated by Dellicour et al., Bayesian phylogenetic analysis on about 2800 SARS-CoV-2 sequences required over 150 hr to obtain enough samples from the posterior distribution across 15 parallel runs with a GPU accelerated implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dellicour et al., 2021</xref>). Since the GISAID database stores several hundred thousand SARS-CoV-2 sequences (<italic>n</italic> = 638,704 on May 8, 2022 for the year 2020 alone), we believe that using a phylogeny of a few thousand sequences only might not be the best way to accurately infer exchange events. In order to obtain more comprehensive trends drawing conclusions from a larger number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences, we constructed 100 semi-independent maximum likelihood phylogenies of relatively limited size (from 418 to 904 sequences depending on the geographic scale and time period investigated) and inferred ancestral states by a maximum likelihood discrete trait phylogeographic method. Bayesian approach seems not to be more accurate than maximum likelihood for the reconstruction of ancestral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hanson-Smith et al., 2010</xref>), and we gain a lot in terms of sampling, computational time, and trends by sampling 100 semi-independent subsamples. The maximum likelihood-based method was recently used to depict with accuracy the genomic epidemiology of the virus in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McLaughlin et al., 2022</xref>), as well as in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cunningham et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pupko et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>We characterized SARS-CoV-2 spatial spread within France, and between France and European and all other countries in 2020. Between January 1 and July 25, 2020 (first European epidemic wave), France mostly exchanged SARS-CoV-2 with Europe and North America. The observation contrasts with the second European epidemic wave – that took place between late October and the end of 2020 – where France almost exclusively exchanged the virus with other European countries. This result is logical insofar as the borders of France have gradually reopened with European countries but remained mostly closed to the rest of the world. A very low rate of SARS-CoV-2 exchanges between Europe (including France) and Asia or South America was found in 2020, which is not surprising since the virus started to spread in these continents only from May 2020 where all borders of Europe were already closed. On the European scale, France was a major source of SARS-CoV-2 exchange. It ranked third regarding exportation events (mainly directed toward neighboring countries) only behind the United Kingdom and Italy between January 1 and July 25, 2020, and third again behind Spain and Russia (where exchange events happened mostly in summer 2020) between July 26 and December 31, 2020. The first cases introduced from European countries into France came from Italy and Spain, consistent with the early days of SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe. These results are in line with the observations made across Europe through Bayesian inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemey et al., 2021</xref>). In line with the lack of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity at the beginning of the pandemic, both B.1 and B.1.1 were the most representative lineages introduced into or exported from France. During the second European epidemic wave, some cases were introduced into France (and some other European countries) from Russia where virus incidence was high since the summer 2020. Then, most introductions into France originated from Spain which initiated the second wave in European Union, followed by Italy and Germany. Most of the introductions into France were the lineages B.1.1, B.1.177, and B.1.258 that highly circulated in Europe. By contrast, France mostly exported the B.1.160 lineage which was firstly detected in July 2020 in Marseille (PACA, France), and represented the majority of sequences in fall 2020. The frequency of the B.1.160 lineage then decreased rapidly at the beginning of 2021 in favor of B.1.1.7. Interestingly, the number of international exchanges was lower during the second wave compared to the first one, indicating the effectiveness of border control measures and that French people reduced travel outside France after the first national lockdown.</p><p>Our results on the French scale should be interpreted considering several limitations. In addition to a limited overall size, genomic data only covered 5 out of 13 administrative regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The North and East of France (i.e., regions Hauts-de-France and Grand-Est, respectively) that border Belgium, Luxembourg, and Germany, were not investigated. More importantly, the region Grand-Est was associated with early large clusters that participated in virus spread across the country during the first European epidemic wave, such as the evangelical gathering of the Christian Open-Door Church (Mulhouse, Haut-Rhin) that took place from 17 to February 21, 2020 and consisted of approximately a thousand infected individuals. Keeping these limitations in mind, we observed two distinct patterns of SARS-CoV-2 exchanges within France in 2020. During the first wave, most of the exportations originated from IDF (Paris area). This may be linked with the larger number of individuals living in IDF who left to other French regions at the beginning of the epidemic. In the second epidemic wave, we observed a similar contribution of IDF to exchanges, but this time accompanied with ARA (Lyon area) which was associated with a strong SARS-CoV-2 incidence. The circulation of lineages was the same between the French regions, both during the first and second epidemic waves. The B.1 was the major circulating lineage during the first wave, while B.1.160 was mostly transmitted during the second one, concomitantly with B.1.177 in IDF.</p><p>To conclude, using an original phylodynamic approach to investigate a large SARS-CoV-2 sequence dataset, we characterized SARS-CoV-2 spatial spread within France, across Europe and in the world in 2020 and unraveled distinct patterns of exchanges between the two first epidemic waves.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequence acquisition and curation, and dataset production</title><p>A phylodynamics study (which aims to depict with accuracy exchange events between locations) requires a large number of sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attwood et al., 2022</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences were downloaded from the GISAID database on May 8, 2022 (<italic>n</italic> = 10,005,024). The following inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to select samples for analysis: (1) only complete viral genomes from infected individuals (more than 29 kb in length) were included; (2) the maximal proportion of undetermined nucleotide bases was fixed to 5%; (3) sequences with unknown or incomplete sampling dates, or unknown geographical location, were excluded; (4) sampling dates were comprised between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020; and (5) sequences from non-human were excluded. The final dataset included 638,704 sequences. In a second pass, 26,103 genomes were considered as outliers as they were in the extreme 5% regarding the number of non-synonymous mutations.</p><p>We studied the epidemic at three different geographic scales: (1) worldwide, to identify SARS-CoV-2 exchanges between continents and France; (2) at the European scale, to determine more precisely which European countries mostly exchanged with France; and finally (3) at the French administrative region level, to get a better understanding of virus spread inside the country. For each geographic scale, the analyses were independently run for the two first European epidemic waves (January 1 to July 25, 2020 (weeks 1–30), and July 26 to December 31, 2020 (weeks 31–52); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Considering the large number of sequences in GISAID that passed our criteria (<italic>n</italic> = 638,704), we produced 100 subsamples of sequences for each investigated geographic scale analysis (i.e., worldwide, Europe, and French administrative regions) and time period (January 1 to July 25, 2020 and July 26 to December 31, 2020). To determine the number of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences to be included so as to be representative of each location epidemic, we used the number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths per territory and per week as a proxy for virus circulation taking place 2 weeks earlier. We did not use SARS-CoV-2 detected cases as the proxy for infections because the intensity of COVID-19 testing was increased after the first wave, which probably increased the ascertainment probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). For each subsample, sequences were drawn randomly from our GISAID extraction. Some countries and French regions had to be discarded because of their under-representation in the GISAID database. For the European scale, we selected countries with more than 10,000 sequences. Ukraine, Czech Republic, and Hungary passed this threshold, but were excluded for having too many weeks without enough data. At the French region scale, we included only regions with less than 20% of weeks lacking data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>For the first time period investigated (January 1 to July 25, 2020), an average of 846, 904 and 416 SARS-CoV-2 sequences were included in each set at the worldwide, European and French scales, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

In a first simulation, we investigated the inference of transition parameters on a random phylogenetic tree of 1,000 leaves produced with the <italic>rtree</italic> function of the ape package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paradis et al., 2004</xref>) in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">R Development Core Team, 2022</xref>).

In this simulation, we tested different combinations of the two rates.</p><p>In a second simulation analysis, we tested the accuracy of inference done on subsamples of a larger phylogenetic tree.

We then made 100 random subsampled 1000-leaves trees and reconstructed the ancestry for the discrete trait from the leaf data only using the ape function <italic>ace</italic> (once again ARD model). The mean error rate was obtained by calculating the number of transitions of each type and comparing them with the one obtained from the main tree.

Three distinct Markov models of discrete character evolution through maximum likelihood were tested and compared: the Equal Rates (ER) which assumes a single rate of transition among all possible states, the All Rates Different (ARD) which allows a distinct rate for each position transition between two states, and the Symmetrical Rates (SYM) where forward and reverse transitions share the same parameter. In this study, we only present the results obtained with the SYM model because both the ARD and ER models led to nearly identical observations compared to the SYM model.

To detect and count each exchange event, we compared the geographic state of a node with the state of its two children. If the nodes corresponded to different geographic locations, we counted an exchange event from the parent node state to the given child node state. The midpoint of the parent–child branch was chosen as the date of exchange in all cases. The same strategy was applied to investigate the proportions of introduced or exported pango lineages.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Phylodynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions in France, Europe and the world during 2020&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher JR Illingworth (Reviewer #1); Angela McLaughlin (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers and the Editor think that this is an important study that presents interesting findings about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in France and in Europe, and are positive about the work's eventual publication. However, the reviewers brought up important considerations, including methodological concerns, that need to be addressed in a revised version. Following the consultation with the editor and reviewers, we would welcome a revised version that addresses the substantial methodological comments. In summary:</p><p>(1) Sampling: there are two questions. One is about the number of sequences and the number of deaths (both reviewers commented on this), as opposed to the number of infections; whether the correlation (sequences to deaths) is an artefact of the method used (Rev 1) and whether it validates the analysis (Rev2). In addition, since deaths and infections can be reported differently in different places, what is the impact of having different sampling fractions in different geographies? this could be addressed by looking at the robustness of the inferences to different choices of relative numbers of sequences from different regions</p><p>(2) Downsampling to &lt; 1000 sequences, bootstrapping and adding: We were all concerned about the small individual datasets and the assumption that adding the results would generate the correct numbers of viral movements. After all, why this number of replicates – why not add after 5000 or 800 or some other number of replicates? Also, there are some instances where the same introduction event would be detected in many replicates, and somewhere it would be missed in most of them, so it's not clear that it's additive. Other authors have averaged, in similar analyses (but since each replicate might miss some events, averaging might not be). Given that this analytical method has the advantage that much larger numbers of sequences are tractable to analyze, the authors should analyze substantially larger datasets.</p><p>(3) The fast clock assumption has the potential to bias the analysis; a number of other related methodological issues were raised by reviewers. These should be addressed.</p><p>(4) Quantitative descriptions of the results and their variability should be included in the results (for example, the importation rate). This will aid in articulating the public health interpretation and relevance, which reviewers also note would add interest and weight to the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The method is described as 'original' but line 377 implies that the same method was used to study data from Canada. Please clarify what is new about the approach used here relative to previous studies.</p><p>It is stated in line 65 that existing phylogenetic tools cannot include the large datasets generated by projects such as the international COVID sequencing effort. However, researchers on the COG-UK project generated a tree of sequences comprising hundreds of thousands, if not millions of sequences (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/priority-areas/data-linkage-analysis/public-data-analysis/). It would be helpful to clarify what can and cannot be achieved with which phylogenetic methods.</p><p>The positive correlations observed between the number of deaths and the number of sequences in a dataset (Figure 2) is a reassuring check but seems to be a direct artefact of the methods, whereby the number of deaths was used to determine the number of sequences. I suggest including these plots in supplemental material.</p><p>I would value more explicit information in the Methods section about how data from the inferences performed on different bootstrapped samples was combined.</p><p>The link to the stated GitHub repository did not work at the time I tried it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>L97: Figure comments: It is recommended to add an annotation for the date delineation of the two COVID waves analyzed in the main graphic. The legend should report how reproduction rate was calculated, and this should be clearly described in the methods. Relatedly, L447-448: state exact dates instead of 'mid' and 'late' months. Applies in results as well.</p><p>L106: Although the authors say that sequences are representative of 'sars-cov-2 infections', they then describe the comparison to deaths. Did the authors also compare case incidence to deaths and separately, to sequences over time? Need to better justify the use of deaths rather than new diagnoses. It would help the reader if there was also a presentation of cases over time in addition to deaths that could be done for example in Figure 1.</p><p>L114;L124;L209;L287,L465: Regarding the discarding of sequences from geographies that were underrepresented in the sequence set – how would the results be expected to change if these geographies were not discarded? They would be perhaps less likely to be sampled as well as represented in the ancestral nodes due to low representation, but they might have indicated additional nuances to the French regional transmission patterns.</p><p>Also, in the methods, what was the threshold by which the authors decided if a region was too underrepresented to be included? L404: what percent of cases and/or deaths were associated with the administrative regions that were excluded due to low or no sequences in each wave?</p><p>L115: Need to clarify how many sequences per phylogeny in the results. Were sequences sampled by geography randomly or proportionally to the relative number of deaths over time? Were the sampled sequences distributed uniformly over time or proportionally to deaths over time? Were sequences sampled entirely at random?</p><p>L133: Were sequences masked for problematic sites, i.e. due to homoplasy and likely sequencing errors, as identified by Nicola de Maio and group, prior to the phylogenetic inference? This is important and standard in these analyses; if the authors performed masking of problematic sites it is important to mention in the methods. If masking of problematic cites was not performed then this should be done and the analyses repeated during revision.</p><p>L156: why is the analysis delineated into periods in mid-July when the authors state here that the second European wave started in October? The delineation of epidemic waves and studied periods needs to be clarified and justified.</p><p>L161-165; L237-240; 374-376: the positive correlation between intra-territory transmission events and the estimated number of deaths does not convincingly validate the method, because this is what would be expected even in the presence of remaining bias. Why not total transmission in relation to deaths? Lastly, the authors have shown deaths are also associated with sequences, therefore this does not distinguish model accuracy from reflecting the relative inclusion of sequences.</p><p>L378: McLaughlin et al. 2022 used maximum likelihood ancestral reconstruction, but did not sum across replicates; rather, they averaged across replicates. Also, it would be good to include a couple other references as well that a similar approach, as well as the origins of the method algorithms (Pupko et al., 2000, Cunningham et al., 1998)</p><p>There are multiple instances in the Results section where relative flows are discussed for different geographies or over time, but only in a qualitative rather than qualitative manner. Please quantify rate estimates and/or relative changes/differences (as the authors did on L296 and L321) in other places. L186: 'at similar rates'. L192: 'quite similar'. L225: 'sequentially – and drastically – increased…'. L233: 'drastic'. L245: 'drastic'. L266: 'steep increase'. L268: 'sharp increase'. L294 'much more'. L308: 'a bit lower'.</p><p>L279: it is speculative that government measures had varying success rates based on the analyses conducted and presented in this manuscript.</p><p>L275; and generally: The manuscript would benefit from more discussion or stratification of which Pango lineages or Nextstrain clades dominated particular transmission types and routes in the two waves.</p><p>L299: Normally, Spearman rank correlation can be appropriately performed when there are 10 or more observations, here, as written the correlation has been performed with only three measurements – please clarify or rectify this.</p><p>L430; Supplementary: The GISAID identifiers should be a separate appendix and the authors need to follow the GISAID recommendations for inclusion of a table acknowledging labs for each sequence.</p><p>L443-446: What is missed by not conducting all three analyses together? How much international origin among a given region in France, for example?</p><p>L470: The inclusion of earlier diversity from the first wave in the trees for the second wave is laudable, however, how did the authors ignore transmission events involving those context sequences when analyzing the second wave in terms of intra- vs inter-territory transmission? Precisely how this was done needs to be clarified in the manuscript.</p><p>L480: How were trees rooted? This is an important omission and should be clearly specified in methods.</p><p>L483: how could the use of a strict clock rate have impacted the results? Employing model selection and describing in methods to justify would be valuable. If the authors have already performed model selection then clear description in the results is warranted.</p><p>L486: in regards to Figure 6-Figure supp 1 on estimating versus fixing the clock rate, the authors should move some of the text in the legend into the main results to better explain why the authors fixed a strict clock rate. Also, the reader may wonder to what extent the issue encountered with early node dating and long branches might have been related to specifying a strict instead of relaxed clock. Thus, please elaborate on this in the results.</p><p>Generally in the figure supplement legends, any interpretations of the plots should be moved into the Results section.</p><p>It would be informative to contextualize the authors' results within the literature available to date by having a more thorough comparison to other papers on the genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Europe in the Background and/or Discussion; for example, Worobey 2021, Hodcroft 2021, and Huisman et al. 2022.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82538.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers and the Editor think that this is an important study that presents interesting findings about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in France and in Europe, and are positive about the work's eventual publication.

First of all, the choice of sampling the number of sequences per week based on the number of deaths seems to us much more relevant than based on the number of infections. Indeed, confirming a death related to COVID-19 is globally robust and reported by health care centers, whatever the time period investigated. In sharp contrast, studying the number of infections completely biases any comparison between the first and second waves, since the availability of detection tools (RT-qPCR and antigenic tests) varied widely by country and throughout the year. PCR tests were almost not used outside of hospitals during the first wave in Europe, whereas their use has increased significantly in the second part of 2020. Therefore, we necessarily find many more infections than deaths during the second wave. Here we made this observation in France as an example (other countries were investigated and presented in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2): for the first wave, about 30,000 deaths were recorded, and 34,000 during the second wave, suggesting that the virus had overall a similar impact on the French population, which we think is expected because no vaccine was available. Focusing on infections, there were about 215,000 confirmed infections in the first wave, and ten-fold more (about 2.5 million cases) during the second wave (based on COVID-19 data explorer from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ourworldindata.org/">https://ourworldindata.org/</ext-link>). It is highly unlikely that the virus circulated ten-fold more in the population, since containment measures were still quite high as indicated by the stringency score index shown in Figure 1 (replacing the virus reproduction rate in the previous version). This difference cannot be explained by a change in virulence of the circulating strains, since the α variant started to increase in frequency only at the very end of 2020. Therefore, the drastic ratio of death to infection change is easily explained by the increase of testing during the year 2020. Since PCR tests were used in a large majority of countries from the summer of 2020 onwards, we thus believe that sampling the number of sequences on the basis of COVID-19-related deaths is a more accurate proxy than sampling from the number of confirmed infections. Since information is now stated at lines 165-171 and 458-464.</p><p>Concerning the correlation between the number of deaths and the number of sequences included for a subsample for a given time period of time and geographical scale, we aimed to show that our selection algorithm performs a consistent sampling with the epidemiological data, so as not to over- or under-represent a locality at a specific date. We however agree that the correlation of intra-regional transmission and the number of deaths is a very tautological argument (since our baseline sampling respects these spatio-temporal constraints), and is therefore not a direct validation of the method. We removed this element from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Downsampling to &lt; 1000 sequences, bootstrapping and adding: We were all concerned about the small individual datasets and the assumption that adding the results would generate the correct numbers of viral movements. After all, why this number of replicates – why not add after 5000 or 800 or some other number of replicates? Also, there are some instances where the same introduction event would be detected in many replicates, and somewhere it would be missed in most of them, so it's not clear that it's additive. Other authors have averaged, in similar analyses (but since each replicate might miss some events, averaging might not be). Given that this analytical method has the advantage that much larger numbers of sequences are tractable to analyze, the authors should analyze substantially larger datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>The low sampling and the production of some subsamples is, in our opinion, one of the strengths of our work and should be the subject of a precise justification. The use of about 1,000 sequences allows a non-negligible saving in computation time, both for phylogenetic reconstruction, temporal calibration, and the reconstruction of ancestral characters at nodes. To demonstrate the validity of multiple subsampling of the same pool of sequences, we included in the manuscript a simulation assay (lines 107-160 for the results, lines 475-502 for the method, figure 2 and figure 2—figure supplement 1). Based on our results, performing a number of subsamples greater than 100 is not useful. In our various analyses we systematically studied the number of introduction and exportation events per subsample, and calculated the mean and standard deviation over the course of the subsamples: we observed that each locality reaches an equilibrium of exchange events fairly quickly (often after 25 subsamples).</p><p>Summing exchange events by region and date across subsamples was unconventional. As recommended, we averaged the events by locality and week across all subsamples (the ratio between geographical units remains unchanged).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The fast clock assumption has the potential to bias the analysis; a number of other related methodological issues were raised by reviewers. These should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the editors and reviewers for this remark, as the molecular clock is a crucial feature of this phylodynamic study. Initially, our goal was primarily to correlate the number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths with the number of intra-regional exchanges. To ensure that, we fixed a fast molecular clock, with a mutation rate about 10 times higher than expected (6 x 10<sup>-3</sup> instead of ~7 x 10<sup>-4</sup> substitution per site per year). After many tests, discussions and recommendations (in part with and by Dr. Angela McLaughlin, reviewer #2 of this work and first author of the genomic epidemiology of the first two waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada (doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.73896)), our initial attempt was not really justified and, as previously pointed out, the correlation between the number of intra-regional transmissions and the epidemiological data is a simple byproduct of the methodology. We agree that the choice of such a clock has the potential to strongly bias our observations. Therefore, we reassessed all our code and uncovered a simple error in our dating method. After correction of this error, the mutation rate – previously set at 6 x 10<sup>-3</sup> substitution per site per year – is now estimated for each subsample and consistently with other studies, reaching ~7 x 10<sup>-4</sup>.</p><p>The other methodological concerns raised by the reviewers will be discussed specifically later.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Quantitative descriptions of the results and their variability should be included in the results (for example, the importation rate). This will aid in articulating the public health interpretation and relevance, which reviewers also note would add interest and weight to the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In the first version of our study, we mainly presented the results in a qualitative way. We agree with the editors and reviewers that a quantitative aspect is required for having a much more precise view of the exchanges between the different localities, but also of the main changes between the first and second epidemic waves. We therefore reworked all the results to put more emphasis on the quantitative aspect of the exchanges between localities. Now, we systematically present the percentages of introduction and exportation events in order to have a more precise idea of which continents/European countries/French regions exchanged the most.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The method is described as 'original' but line 377 implies that the same method was used to study data from Canada. Please clarify what is new about the approach used here relative to previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The similarity with a pre-existing study was a clear overstatement on our part. McLaughlin <italic>et al.</italic> 2022 (<italic>eLife</italic>, doi: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.73896) studied the genomic epidemiology of the first two waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada without resorting to Bayesian inference. The authors also used a subsampling strategy, however, the aim was to produce subsets using different proportions of Canadian sequences to identify the proportion maximizing the ability to identify domestically circulating sublineages (they ended up with 27,552 sequences, 75% of their total). The re-sampling strategy is indeed ‘original’ and we added a simulation assay to show its performance. All this information has been clarified in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is stated in line 65 that existing phylogenetic tools cannot include the large datasets generated by projects such as the international COVID sequencing effort. However, researchers on the COG-UK project generated a tree of sequences comprising hundreds of thousands, if not millions of sequences (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/priority-areas/data-linkage-analysis/public-data-analysis/). It would be helpful to clarify what can and cannot be achieved with which phylogenetic methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Building a phylogeny of several hundreds of thousands or millions of sequences is theoretically conceivable. When we look in depth at the astounding work done by COG-UK, we can see on the methods described on their ‘phylopipe’ github (https://github.com/virus-evolution/phylopipe) that they do not build a gigantic tree in one go but instead use a smart divide and conquer strategy bases on computing subtrees of known clades that they graft together at the end.</p><p>Whether using Bayesian or maximum likelihood approaches, dating such phylogenies and reconstructing ancestral characters at nodes (for example, the Pango lineages constituted of hundreds of factors) can require several weeks – if not more – of computational time. Therefore, we chose a strategy to overcome these limits by considering relatively small phylogenies across different sampling (i.e., subsamples). This information has been clarified in the revised version of the manuscript, especially at lines 357-360.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The positive correlations observed between the number of deaths and the number of sequences in a dataset (Figure 2) is a reassuring check but seems to be a direct artefact of the methods, whereby the number of deaths was used to determine the number of sequences. I suggest including these plots in supplemental material.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the positive correlations between the number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths and the number of sequences in a set are simply a result of a sequence draw consistent with the epidemiological data. The plots were made to show that the datasets we produced do not include notable biases. As advised, these plots were put as a supplementary figure (figure 2—figure supplement 2), while we put more emphasis on a simulation analysis to prove that a set of 1,000 sequences gave satisfying results in describing more complex phylogenies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would value more explicit information in the Methods section about how data from the inferences performed on different bootstrapped samples was combined.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous version, exportation and introduction events were summed, which is indeed not the most conventional strategy.

As far as the reproduction rate is concerned, since we did not talk about it or relate it to our study, it has been removed from the figure. Instead, we put the stringency index, which seems to us much more relevant. The definition of this index is explained in the legend of Figure 1 (lines 695-698). For lines 447-448 (as well as in other parts in the manuscript, notably the “Results” section), we modified the text by giving the exact dates rather than the notions of “mid” or “late”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L106: Although the authors say that sequences are representative of 'sars-cov-2 infections', they then describe the comparison to deaths. Did the authors also compare case incidence to deaths and separately, to sequences over time? Need to better justify the use of deaths rather than new diagnoses. It would help the reader if there was also a presentation of cases over time in addition to deaths that could be done for example in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a misnomer on our part. The subsamples we produced are spatio-temporally representative of COVID-19-related deaths, not infections. We did not produce subsamples based on infections because we believe that this parameter is biased due to the heavy use of PCR tests only from the second epidemic wave, wrongly suggesting that the virus circulated much more during the second wave than the first wave. For more details, we refer the reviewer to point (1) of the essential revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L114;L124;L209;L287,L465: Regarding the discarding of sequences from geographies that were underrepresented in the sequence set – how would the results be expected to change if these geographies were not discarded? They would be perhaps less likely to be sampled as well as represented in the ancestral nodes due to low representation, but they might have indicated additional nuances to the French regional transmission patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer's remark is very pertinent, and we asked ourselves this question at the beginning of this study: should we or not discard countries/regions for which the number of sequences was (significantly) underestimated? We decided to discard such countries/regions in order to avoid misinterpretation. If we take the example of the French regions, based on the few reports from Santé Publique France (https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus-covid-19), the Grand-Est region would have been strongly involved in the dissemination of the virus during the first French wave, in particular because of the evangelical gathering in Mulhouse, in the Haut-Rhin, where more than a thousand people were contaminated. This was one of the largest epidemic clusters in Europe at the beginning of the epidemic. However, on the GISAID platform, only a handful of sequences associated with the Haut-Rhin region were available, and we could not have reproduced such an observation. In the new version, we however added two additional French regions, Bretagne and Occitanie, which include some others very densely populated French cities (Toulouse, Montpellier and Rennes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, in the methods, what was the threshold by which the authors decided if a region was too underrepresented to be included?

We corrected that in the new version of the manuscript. Briefly put as can be seen in Figure 2—Figure Supplement 3, the regions were very unevenly represented in the data. We excluded regions with more than 20% of weeks insufficiently represented in the database (lines 464-469).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L115: Need to clarify how many sequences per phylogeny in the results. Were sequences sampled by geography randomly or proportionally to the relative number of deaths over time? Were the sampled sequences distributed uniformly over time or proportionally to deaths over time? Were sequences sampled entirely at random?</p></disp-quote><p>Before producing a phylogeny, we perform a random draw of sequences per country/French region and per week. For that, we first specify the desired sample size (e.g., 1,000 sequences). The next step consists in assigning the number of sequences associated with each country/French region according to the number of deaths related to COVID-19, and then to make a breakdown by week, still according to the number of deaths. In the revised version of the manuscript, we detail this procedure in the “Results” and &quot;Methods&quot; section. The dataset generation algorithm is provided on GitHub (https://github.com/Rcoppee/PhyloCoV). The figure showing the correlation, for a subsample, between the number of sequences included per continent/European country/French region and per week as a function of the number of deaths represents, according to us, a proof of the well constitution of the subsamples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L133: Were sequences masked for problematic sites, i.e. due to homoplasy and likely sequencing errors, as identified by Nicola de Maio and group, prior to the phylogenetic inference? This is important and standard in these analyses; if the authors performed masking of problematic sites it is important to mention in the methods. If masking of problematic cites was not performed then this should be done and the analyses repeated during revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We mask the problematic sites using the list provided by De Maio and colleagues (filedate=2021-10-27) on GitHub.

The delineation of epidemic waves and studied periods needs to be clarified and justified.</p></disp-quote><p>The second European epidemic wave effectively begins in October with an almost exponential increase in the number of SARS-CoV-2-related deaths. However, on a continental scale, Asia and South America (and to a lesser extent, North America) were particularly affected by the pandemic during the summer of 2020 (between June and September, based on COVID-19 data explorer from https://ourworldindata.org). Therefore, we thought it would be interesting to study the role of Europe during this period. Furthermore, while the epidemic has strongly declined in Europe in summer 2020, some European countries such as Russia continued to have a relatively high number of COVID-19-related deaths. It was therefore interesting for us to better understand what this epidemic in Russia may have entailed. In our study, it appears that Russia likely transmitted the virus to a number of European countries, possibly causing a resurgence of cases in Europe, particularly in Spain, before proliferating to the rest of Europe.</p><p>We clarified the concepts of time periods by giving the precise dates of each period to avoid ambiguity thorough the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L161-165; L237-240; 374-376: the positive correlation between intra-territory transmission events and the estimated number of deaths does not convincingly validate the method, because this is what would be expected even in the presence of remaining bias. Why not total transmission in relation to deaths? Lastly, the authors have shown deaths are also associated with sequences, therefore this does not distinguish model accuracy from reflecting the relative inclusion of sequences.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer made broadly the same point as Reviewer 1. We agree with their observations: the positive correlation between the number of intra-regional events and the number of deaths related to COVID-19 is only an artifact of the methodology. In the revised version of the manuscript, we removed all such notions of correlations because they did not ultimately add any weight to the observations. The number of intra-region transmissions was simply used to determine the total proportion of inter-region transmissions, and thus quantify the increase or decrease in the number of such events between the two time periods investigated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L378: McLaughlin et al. 2022 used maximum likelihood ancestral reconstruction, but did not sum across replicates; rather, they averaged across replicates.

Indeed, on the continental scale and in the case of small phylogenies, we only included few sequences per week and per country (depending on the number of deaths). Therefore, we could not model with sufficient accuracy the exchanges for smaller geographical scales such as the European scale or the scale of French regions.

In this revised version, and after code proofreading, the molecular clock is no longer fixed but estimated using LSD2 v2.3 following the production of phylogenies with FastTree.
