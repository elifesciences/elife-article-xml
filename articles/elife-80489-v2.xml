Under optimal environmental conditions, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females have access to human hosts that provide blood proteins for egg development, conspecific males that provide sperm for fertilization, and freshwater that serves as an egg-laying substrate suitable for offspring survival. As global temperatures rise, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females are faced with climate challenges like intense droughts and intermittent precipitation, which create unpredictable, suboptimal conditions for egg-laying. Here, we show that under drought-like conditions simulated in the laboratory, females retain mature eggs in their ovaries for extended periods, while maintaining the viability of these eggs until they can be laid in freshwater. Using transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> ovaries, we identify two previously uncharacterized genes named <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum,</italic> each encoding a small, secreted protein that both show ovary-enriched, temporally-restricted expression during egg retention. These genes are mosquito-specific, linked within a syntenic locus, and rapidly evolving under positive selection, raising the possibility that they serve an adaptive function. CRISPR-Cas9 deletion of both <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> demonstrates that they are specifically required for extended retention of viable eggs. These results highlight an elegant example of taxon-restricted genes at the heart of an important adaptation that equips <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females with âinsuranceâ to flexibly extend their reproductive schedule without losing reproductive capacity, thus allowing this species to exploit unpredictable habitats in a changing world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic></kwd><kwd>mosquito</kwd><kwd><italic>Aedes albopictus</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic></kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>taxon-restricted genes</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>rapid evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BIF PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Venkataraman</surname><given-names>Krithika</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001201</institution-id><institution>Kavli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KNSI Pre-doctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herre</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30DC017658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herre</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBO ALTF 286-2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shai</surname><given-names>Nadav</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MIRA R35GM133780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rita Allen Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007204</institution-id><institution>Vallee Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VS-2020-35</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA Training Grant #GM066699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neal</surname><given-names>Lauren A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

Adaptations can be behavioral, physiological, or structural, and are evolutionarily selected to enable members of a species to persist by providing survival value. Ecosystems within which animals exist are in constant flux. When faced with changing habitats, animals must act flexibly and appropriately to survive and reproduce. For example, when the river-dwelling African lungfish (<italic>Protopterus annectens</italic>) experiences food and water scarcity during drought, it burrows into the dried riverbed, forming a cocoon with secreted mucus. It can survive for years while remaining metabolically dormant but within a week of rainfall, it reawakens and resumes normal metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Heimroth et al., 2018</xref>). Among birds, species like the blackcap (<italic>Sylvia atricapilla</italic>) exhibit genetically encoded seasonal migratory behaviors that rapidly evolve in the face of changing resource availability, resulting in new migratory routes and destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berthold and Querner, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthold et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Delmore et al., 2020</xref>). Land mammals such as marsupials alter the timing of their reproductive cycle in response to offspring-derived cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Renfree, 1979</xref>). Tammar wallaby (<italic>Macropus eugenii</italic>) mothers can newly conceive while carrying previously birthed offspring in their pouches, but they developmentally arrest conceived embryos at the 100 cell stage, only resuming embryonic development after the pouch offspring has finished suckling and left to live independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Renfree, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tyndale-Biscoe et al., 1974</xref>).</p><p>Mosquitoes that lay eggs at the edge of freshwater and go through an aquatic life cycle as larvae and pupae are very susceptible to fluctuating precipitation patterns and climate change-driven catastrophes like drought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hopp and Foley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caldwell et al., 2021</xref>). Despite climate variations, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes are highly invasive on almost every continent and pose a serious, immediate, and growing threat to global public health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Juliano and Lounibos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lounibos and Kramer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kraemer et al., 2019</xref>). While biting multiple humans to obtain the protein-rich blood they require to develop each batch of eggs, these mosquitoes have evolved as efficient vectors of arboviral infections such as yellow fever, Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, and of parasitic infections such as lymphatic filariasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">WHO, 2017</xref>). Domestic strains of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> prefer hunting and biting humans over other vertebrate hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Harrington et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Harrington et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">McBride et al., 2014</xref>), and prefer laying eggs on moist surfaces proximal to freshwater in natural and manmade containers found around human settlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bentley and Day, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>). Female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> typically mate once in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gwadz and Craig, 1968</xref>), storing sperm in specialized organs called the spermathecae from which sperm are released to fertilize eggs post-ovulation, as eggs are in transit through the reproductive tract en route to being laid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jones and Wheeler, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Degner and Harrington, 2016</xref>). Once laid at the edge of freshwater, eggs darken and harden, and embryogenesis occurs within the eggshell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Li, 1994</xref>). After this, if conditions are suboptimal for hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rezende et al., 2008</xref>), a developmental arrest state is triggered for up to 3â6 months to prevent embryo desiccation. Embryos then hatch when pools of freshwater become available again in their surroundings, and when aquatic larval and pupal development can be completed before eclosion to the terrestrial adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clements, 1963a</xref>).</p><p>The innate behaviors of an adult female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito are centered on the appropriate selection of a reproductive strategy that balances tradeoffs between internal energetic resources and external environmental conditions. Female mating, host-seeking, and egg-laying behaviors are inextricably linked, each proceeding only when the necessary âcheckpointsâ have been cleared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clements, 1963b</xref>). For example, females will not lay most, if any, of their eggs before they have mated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Villarreal et al., 2018</xref>). Females will suppress their attraction to hosts while eggs are developing and only restore attraction once eggs are laid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Klowden and Lea, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Klowden and Lea, 1979b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Klowden and Lea, 1979a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Klowden, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Liesch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duvall et al., 2019</xref>). Females will not lay eggs both until and unless they locate freshwater, retaining them in their ovaries as needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Judson, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Day, 2016</xref>). This interconnectedness of innate behaviors ensures that reproductive steps proceed in the order required for offspring survival. Because precise temporal control of egg-laying without loss of viability is an adaptation that maximizes the reproductive resilience and the fitness of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females, understanding its basis will illustrate how this species is able to invade otherwise inhospitable ecological niches. Despite the importance of this question, little is known about how females are able to retain viable eggs in their ovaries during periods of prolonged drought.</p><p>Here we show that under drought-like conditions simulated in the laboratory, <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females will robustly retain eggs in their ovaries until freshwater is located. Under optimal conditions when freshwater is plentiful, females will lay eggs 3â4 days after a blood meal. We restricted access to freshwater for 4â12 days post-blood meal. A considerable proportion of eggs laid after extended retention to at least 12 days post-blood-meal were viable, hatching at high rates. We identified two previously uncharacterized, tightly linked genes â here named <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> for the curious pair of characters in Lewis Carrollâs 1871 book, âThrough the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found Thereâ â that are adult female-specific and ovary-enriched in their expression. The expression of these genes is dramatically upregulated in the ovaries only during the period in which females retain eggs, and the genes are spatially limited to cells that encapsulate mature eggs. Both genes are taxon-restricted, with no detectable orthology except in <italic>Aedes albopictus,</italic> a similarly invasive disease vector mosquito species that is~70 million years diverged from <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and several <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito species, we identify putative orthologs with no sequence homology to <italic>tweedledee</italic> or <italic>tweedledum</italic>, but which bear other featural similarities such as synteny, gene structure, gene size, and the presence of signal peptides in the predicted proteins. <italic>Aedes aegypti tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum,</italic> as well as the <italic>Anopheles gambiae putative ortholog</italic>, are rapidly evolving genes within their respective species, and show strong signatures of positive selection. Using loss-of-function mutagenesis that disrupts both genes, we show that <italic>Aedes aegypti tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> are specifically required for extended retention of viable eggs under suboptimal drought conditions. Without <italic>tweedledee</italic> or <italic>tweedledum,</italic> mated, blood-fed <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females lose their reproductive âinsuranceâ, such that when egg retention is triggered by restricted freshwater access due to drought-like conditions, most of the eggs they have matured no longer generate viable offspring if laid. Our results suggest that <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> play a crucial role in maintaining the reproductive resilience of female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes faced with fluctuating precipitation cycles and unpredictable drought-like conditions. This work thus illustrates a globally relevant example of rapidly evolving, taxon-restricted genes enabling an adaptation that allows <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes to reproduce and thrive in otherwise inaccessible and inhospitable ecological niches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Female innate reproductive behaviors are interconnected</title><p>To ensure that the timing and sequence of steps in a female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoâs reproductive cycle is appropriate for maximal reproductive output, the innate behaviors enabling access to blood meal sources, sperm, and freshwater egg-laying substrates are interconnected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

After blood-feeding, mated females suppressed their drive to hunt during egg development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâE</xref>). Mated females continued to suppress their host-seeking drive when they were forced to retain mature eggs in their ovaries, as in the absence of an egg-laying substrate, for moderate (6 days post-blood-meal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) or extended (12 days post-blood-meal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) periods. Using individual egg-laying vials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), we found that ~80% of mated females 6 days post-blood-meal completed egg laying within 3 hr of gaining access to freshwater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Females showed restored attraction to humans within 2 hr of completing egg laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>). This shows that attraction to humans is only fully restored upon completion of egg-laying, at which time the female is ready to initiate a second cycle of reproduction. The dynamics of mosquito attraction to humans is similar across multiple cycles of reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which suggests that attraction to humans â a de facto protein-feeding drive â is strongly dependent on reproductive physiology. Virgin females, in contrast to mated females, laid few melanized eggs when provided access to freshwater 6 days post-blood-meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Females that have both mated and have matured eggs within 3â4 days post-blood-meal must locate freshwater to lay their eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Blood-feeding and mating are thus decoupled â either one can occur first â but egg-laying, the ultimate step in a femaleâs reproductive sequence, is tightly coupled to both mating and blood-feeding and requires both to occur.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> female reproduction is drought-resilient.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> male and female mating (left), female blood-feeding from a human host (center), and female laying eggs in water (right).

Therefore, we hypothesized that candidate regulators of viable egg retention would be abundantly expressed across egg retention time-points, with specific upregulation at time-points when eggs are retained compared to pre-blood meal or during egg development. We expected that post-egg-laying, the expression of these genes would eventually decline as the female transitions out of her reproductive state. To identify putative candidates, we generated a list of genes ranked by abundance at the three time points when eggs were retained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Among the top 50 most abundant genes, we identified two that showed striking regulation of expression across the reproductive cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These previously uncharacterized genes, <italic>LOC5563800</italic> and <italic>LOC5566109,</italic> which we named <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> respectively, show similar and striking patterns of regulation in our transcriptomic dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). <italic>tweedledee</italic> is expressed in females before a blood meal and during egg development, but its expression increases ~3 orders of magnitude during periods of egg retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The regulation of <italic>tweedledum</italic> is even more remarkable. It is present at less than 1 transcript per million (TPM) at non-blood-fed and egg production stages but rises to ~10,000 TPM during egg retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>Using published transcriptomes of developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>) and adult tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Matthews et al., 2016</xref>) from <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, we discovered that <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> are adult-specific and female-enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Both genes show ovary-enriched expression with strong upregulation post-egg maturation in the females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), with some expression in male reproductive tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). In addition to specific upregulation during egg retention, <italic>tweedledee</italic> shows basal, constitutive expression across several conditions and tissues, whereas the spatiotemporal expression of <italic>tweedledum</italic> is more tightly restricted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâG</xref>). These data in adult females show exquisite specificity of <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> expression in ovaries bearing mature eggs, strengthening the possibility that the genes are candidate regulators of viable egg retention.</p><p>We next performed quantitative proteomics profiling of the female ovaries across a subset of reproductive time-points corresponding to non-blood-fed, egg development, egg retention, and post-egg-laying states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). PCA shows that replicates within each stage again clustered together as in the RNA-seq dataset, and all reproductive states formed distinct clusters in PC1 and PC2, reflective of the ovaries being tightly and distinctly controlled across these different reproductive states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Both tweedledee and tweedledum proteins were notably upregulated at the egg retention phase of the reproductive cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). Because tweedledee and tweedledum expression levels remain high in the ovaries when sampled &lt;5 hr post-egg-laying when all mature eggs have been laid, we speculate that these genes are expressed in somatic tissues in the ovary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p><italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> are predicted, based on their sequence, to encode proteins with N-terminal signal peptides. To test if they are secreted, we profiled the proteome of the circulating hemolymph, the insect equivalent of blood. We collected hemolymph samples across non-blood-fed, egg development, egg retention, and post-egg-laying states in the first and second cycles of reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). The hemolymph is in close apposition to the ovaries, and its contents during distinct reproductive time-points reflect interorgan communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Spielman, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Sun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hansen et al., 2014</xref>). PCA of the hemolymph proteome showed that at 2 days post-blood-meal, the composition of the circulating fluid is most distinct (separated by PC1) from other profiled time-points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). These findings are consistent with our expectations, as this is the only time-point profiled during which eggs are likely to still be maturing and during which the hemolymph is therefore transporting components for egg maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagedorn, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hagedorn and Fallon, 1973</xref>). Notable examples of hemolymph-transported proteins include the vitellogenins (yolk protein precursors), which we detect in our dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5945524">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5945524</ext-link>). These proteins are synthesized in the fat body, an analog of the vertebrate liver, and transported via the hemolymph to the ovaries where they are packaged into maturing eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hagedorn, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fallon et al., 1974</xref>). We detected tweedledee and tweedledum protein in the hemolymph and found that they were both strongly upregulated in each of the reproductive cycles during egg retention and within 5 hr of egg-laying compared to pre-blood-meal, during egg development, or &gt;1 week post-egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>).

On average, the wild type hatch rate was 73%, while the hatch rate for <italic>Îdeedum</italic> eggs was only 36% after moderate egg retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Deleting <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> therefore had a considerable effect on egg viability during moderate egg retention.</p><p>If instead we withheld freshwater for 12 days after the blood meal before providing it to females, 98% of wild type females still laid at least one melanized egg compared to 82% of <italic>Îdeedum</italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H, I</xref>).

To date, we have been unable to establish a homozygous <italic>Îdee</italic> single mutant strain. However, we recovered a <italic>Îdum</italic> single mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2AâB</xref>) and observed that it had a phenotype largely overlapping with that of <italic>Îdeedum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2CâI</xref>). The <italic>Îdum</italic> mutant had a deletion of 175 bp within the second exon, and the resulting gene fusion is predicted, in silico, to encode a protein with the first 17 amino acids of tweedledum conserved before the breakpoint junction, after which a frameshift adds 7 missense amino acids followed by a stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2AâB</xref>). <italic>Îdum</italic> mutants engorged on blood meals to approximately double their body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). They retained eggs and motile sperm in their visually healthy ovaries and spermathecae, respectively, for moderate (6 days post-blood-meal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2D</xref>) or extended (12 days post-blood-meal, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2G</xref>) durations post-blood-meal. <italic>Îdum</italic> single mutants laid a similar number of melanized eggs compared to wild type after moderate retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2EâF</xref>), but significantly fewer melanized eggs after extended retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2HâI</xref>). Of the melanized eggs laid after extended retention, a starkly smaller proportion from <italic>Îdum</italic> single mutants compared to wild type generated viable offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2H and J</xref>).

Adult <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females carrying mature eggs accordingly prefer to lay them at the edge of freshwater. Fluctuating climates with unpredictable and intense droughts likely impose selective pressures on this species, which has evolved multiple reproductive strategies that contribute to its resilience and invasive potential. Decoupling of mating from host-seeking and subsequent blood-feeding â such that either can take place first â and the appropriate coupling of both behaviors with egg-laying provides female <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes with flexibility to maximize their reproductive output while still ensuring they have the required sperm and blood proteins for producing viable offspring. If faced with drought after being laid, embryos developmentally arrest within the eggshell for several months as an added layer of protection, until freshwater that can support larval survival becomes available to stimulate hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rezende et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that the ability of adult <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females to retain mature eggs in their ovaries without complete loss of viability for flexible lengths of time while searching for an egg-laying site is of significant adaptive value. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum,</italic> a pair of linked, mosquito-specific genes, encode proteins that allow a female to retain her eggs for extended durations as needed without marked loss of viability, such as when access to freshwater is precluded due to drought. Females lacking both genes show a time-dependent phenotype. Their reproductive resilience dramatically worsens as length of egg retention increases from 6 to 12 days post-blood-meal, whereas wild type females continue to maintain a remarkable degree of reproductive resilience regardless of the duration of egg retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Our findings highlight an example of plasticity in the innate reproductive behaviors of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, which allows them to thrive in a remarkable range of ecosystems with distinct climates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Providing protection to eggs: abundance in the right place, at the right time</title><p>Oocytes are stored within the ovaries of females in species separated by millions of years of evolution. Increased oocyte storage time carries the risk of increased damage, which females have evolved diverse strategies to mitigate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greenblatt et al., 2019</xref>). Mammalian oocytes are maintained for decades and gradually released from their reserves. In humans, as a female and her oocyte reserve both age, oocytes become increasingly prone to meiotic segregation errors that result in higher rates of miscarriage and Downâs syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Webster and Schuh, 2017</xref>). Mammalian oocytes in reserve reside within primordial follicles where they are nurtured by maternally derived nutrients that play a role in maintaining oocyte longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Webster and Schuh, 2017</xref>). Bidirectional exchange between germline (oocyte) and somatic (follicle) cells is critical for germline maintenance and occurs through both gap junction-mediated transfer of small molecules, as well as via paracrine secretion of nourishing factors from follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kidder and Vanderhyden, 2010</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies, oocytes are retained if access to protein or sperm is restricted, and extended oocyte storage results in lower capacity for embryonic development. In wild type fly oocytes, abundant expression of two heat shock protein chaperones, <italic>Hsp26</italic> and <italic>Hsp27</italic> contributes to maintenance of developmental capacity following extended oocyte retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greenblatt et al., 2019</xref>). These examples highlight a strong precedence for the existence of protective or nurturing mechanisms in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> ovaries, which would enable the female to maintain viable eggs for extended durations post-maturation.</p><p>What is the mechanism by which a pair of abundantly expressed genes ensure long-term viability of eggs retained in the mosquito ovary? We have few clues to work with. The highly regulated spatiotemporal expression of these paired genes in the ovary suggests to us that they both contribute to egg viability during retention. After maturation, and in the hours post-egg-laying, expression of <italic>tweedledum</italic> is restricted within the ovaries to the follicular epithelial cells surrounding eggs. In contrast, <italic>tweedledee</italic> is basally expressed in all the reproductive states of the ovaries, although its upregulation by several orders of magnitude is concurrent with its expanded expression in the follicular epithelial cells surrounding mature eggs during egg retention, together with <italic>tweedledum</italic>. Since the follicular epithelial cells form a socket around mature eggs, the expression of both genes together in these cells may be most functionally relevant in protecting eggs during retention, such as by forming a secreted desiccation-resistant barrier or a coating required for long-term maintenance. On the way to being laid, mature eggs also interact with the calyx where <italic>tweedledee</italic> is additionally expressed. It is therefore possible that additional interaction between the eggs and <italic>tweedledee</italic> while eggs are in transit facilitates egg competence for subsequent sperm entry and fertilization after extended retention, thereby ensuring viability. Future biochemical studies may reveal mechanistic insight into whether the proteins interact with each other, or with other molecules that provide protection to the egg after maturation.</p><p>In this study, we generated both <italic>Îdeedum</italic> double mutants and a <italic>Îdum</italic> single mutant.

Our proteomic analysis supports the hypothesis that these proteins are secreted, as we detect tryptic peptides from both proteins that represent N-terminal signal peptide-cleaved forms, both in the circulating hemolymph, as well as in the ovary. It is unclear if the circulating forms of these proteins are waste products destined for destruction after production in the ovaries, or if they serve a signaling function. One possibility is that tweedledee and tweedledum sustain eggs in the ovary while also acting as a humoral signal to alert other organs â including the nervous system â of the femaleâs reproductive status. There is a precedent for secreted egg-related proteins serving multiple roles. Vitellogenins are best known as egg yolk proteins, but also function as a hormone secreted into hemolymph, where they have multiple effects on behavior and longevity in social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corona et al., 2007</xref>).

Although the strong correlations between the variations of the two genes and ecological variables are not direct evidence showing that the two genes are adaptive, it indirectly supports the role of these genes in climate-related variables. Since we used a candidate-gene approach to study the functions of these taxon-restricted genes, we do not reject the possibility that the divergence of many conserved genes, as shown in myriad studies, may be functionally important to adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Colosimo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Manceau et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Evolutionary origins of <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic></title><p>The evolutionary history of <italic>tweedledee</italic>, <italic>tweedledum</italic>, and the <italic>putative orthologs</italic> is intriguing.

These involve differences in adult female behavioral parameters: flexibility in choosing a blood meal host, circadian control of host-seeking, mating frequency, and egg-laying site selection; differences in the potential for diapause and dormancy/quiescence or resistance to desiccation in embryos; and tolerance of larvae for different aquatic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Degner and Harrington, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wallis, 1954</xref>).

All animals used for behavior experiments, regardless of genotype, were blood-fed using the blood puck.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Blood-feeding for behavior assays using the blood puck</title><p>For all behavior experiments requiring blood-fed mosquitoes, 5- to 16-day-old females were fed defibrinated sheep blood supplemented with 2 mM adenosine 5â-triphosphate (ATP) (Sigma Aldrich, A6419) in aqueous sodium bicarbonate buffer using a new artificial membrane feeder we designed called the blood puck. Metal blood pucks were custom-made at The Rockefeller University Precision Instrumentation Technologies Resource Center and the Rockefeller High-Energy Physics Machine Shop. Three-dimensional designs for fabrication, and a bench manual for suggested use are provided (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5945524">https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5945524</ext-link>). The blood puck is a disc with one indented, rimmed face on which blood rests with Parafilm stretched over it. This allows the female mosquitoes to pierce the Parafilm membrane and feed on the blood beneath. The other face of the disc is fully flat and does not have Parafilm stretched across its surface.</p><p>Before assembling the blood puck, 8.1 mL of defibrinated sheep blood stored at 4 Â°C was warmed to 42 Â°C for 15â30 minutes in a water bath, and 1 mL aliquots of 20 mM ATP in 25 mM aqueous sodium bicarbonate stock stored at â20 Â°C were slowly thawed on wet ice to room temperature. To assemble the feeding disc of the blood puck membrane-feeder, a 10x10 cm square of Parafilm M (Fisher Scientific, S37440) was first rubbed on both sides against a human skin surface free of cosmetics, such as the forearm or neck, then stretched evenly until translucent before setting aside. The blood puck disc was placed in a metal bead or water bath at 42 Â°C for at least 10 min. It was then removed from the warming bath and thoroughly dried with a paper towel. Next, the Parafilm rubbed on human skin was stretched across the entire indented face of the disc with the utmost care taken to ensure there were no holes in the Parafilm on the feeding side of the disc. Additional strips of Parafilm were used to seal the edges of the disc, and the stretched Parafilm was checked to ensure that it was taut enough to be pierced by a female mosquitoâs stylet. Working quickly to prevent heat dissipation from the pre-heated feeding disc and blood, 900 ÂµL of ATP stock was added to the 8.1 mL of heated blood for a final concentration of 2 mM ATP, and vortexed thoroughly to mix. Care was taken to ensure the ATP was never heated and did not undergo multiple freeze-thaw cycles. The blood puck disc was held by its edges with the indented, rimmed side face-down and the flat side face-up. The blood + ATP mixture was pipetted through one of the two holes from the flat face. The disc was swirled laterally to evenly distribute the blood before gently placing the blood puck on top of a mesh face of the mosquito cage. In this configuration, the indented, rimmed side sat atop mesh of the cage with female mosquitoes beneath, while the flat side was face-up. Any excess blood dribbling out of the puck after placing on the mosquito cage was blotted with paper towels, and 1â2 additional metal discs (either additional blood pucks, or simple metal discs with both faces flat) pre-warmed to 42 Â°C were placed on top of the feeding disc to maintain warmth. These discs were reheated and replaced as needed to maintain the feeding disc at an optimal temperature for mosquito blood-feeding. As needed, mosquitoes were activated by an experimenter exhaling their breath into the cage. Blood-feeding was conducted both at ambient room temperature conditions and in the environmental chamber with similarly high and reliable engorgement rates. Females were typically allowed to feed for 15 min, or until fully engorged, and a single blood puck could be used for 2â3 cages of ~400â450 females each with replacement of rewarmed flat discs between transfer of the apparatus between cages. After feeding to repletion, typically within 15â30 min per cage, the discs were taken off the cage, the Parafilm discarded into biohazard waste, and the metal discs rinsed under hot water to thoroughly remove all traces of blood. The blood puck was dried with paper towels for subsequent use.</p><p>After feeding, animals were cold anesthetized in a 4 Â°C cold room to separate and discard males, as well as non-blood-fed and partially engorged females. Fully engorged females were selected by eye and returned to their original rearing conditions in a fresh cage with continuous access to 10% sucrose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Preparation of mosquitoes for weighing</title><p>When blood meal size was measured by weighing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>), non-blood-fed females of all genotypes were each split into two cages of 80â100 females and sugar-starved for 20â24 hr prior to delivering the blood meal. During the sugar-starvation period in experiments involving subsequent weighing, females were offered deionized water-soaked cotton balls to prevent dehydration. Non-blood-fed controls and experimental group females engorged on blood were both immediately cold anesthetized at 4 Â°C after offering the blood meal and weighed in respective groups of 5 each, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">JovÃ© et al., 2020b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Preparation of mosquitoes at different reproductive time-points</title><p>To prepare groups of mosquito females at different reproductive time-points, all groups were age-matched within each experiment to the extent possible and maintained in mixed-sex cages for at least 5â7 days post-eclosion to ensure that most females were mated.

For all blood-feeding groups, females were provided sheep blood supplemented with 2 mM ATP, and only fully engorged females were selected by eye for subsequent experimental use. For egg retention groups, cages were carefully checked for any prematurely dumped eggs prior to collection of females for dissections. For all experiments in which females were required as soon after egg-laying as possible, that is, groups where eggs were laid &lt;5 hr prior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we standardized 3 hr as the allotted time for individual females after they were aspirated into egg-laying vials at room temperature. The allotted time of 3 hr was determined based on our finding that ~80% of females complete egg-laying within 3 hr of transfer to egg-laying vials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). Eggs laid by <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> females are initially white, and melanize within the first 1â2 hr of egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Isoe et al., 2019</xref>). Based on this, we postulated that any egg-laying vials with at least 10 melanized eggs are likely to have come from females that had completed laying their full clutch of ~100 eggs.</p><p>Females of the &lt;5 hr post-egg-laying group used for ovary RNA-seq, ovary proteomics, and hemolymph proteomics experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were tested behaviorally to verify that they had restored attraction to humans using a long-range, live human stimulus olfactometer as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basrur et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, females that had laid â¥10 melanized eggs were pooled into reproductively similar groups of 20, gently aspirated at room temperature into âstartâ canisters of the olfactometer, acclimated for 10 min, and the trial run for 5 min and 30 s as per standard assay protocol. Attracted females were defined as those that entered the trap proximal to the human arm. These attracted females were collected directly from the trap, and only these attracted females were dissected for ovary or hemolymph sample collection. Females that did not enter the attraction trap were discarded and not used for ovary or hemolymph sample collection.</p><p>For whole-mount ovary fluorescence RNA in situ hybridization experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâE</xref>, females were collected and used immediately from egg-laying vials that contained at least 10 melanized eggs, without further assessment of their attraction to humans. For groups that had laid eggs greater than 1 week prior to sample collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), plastic cups (VWR HDPE Multipurpose Containers, H9009-664) half-filled with deionized water and lined with filter paper (GE Healthcare, WHA1001055) were introduced to the cage as continuously available egg-laying substrates between 3 and 6 days after blood-feeding. When dissected, 13 days had elapsed since the last blood-meal of this group. When groups in their second reproductive cycle were collected, either for behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) or for hemolymph proteomics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2KâM</xref>), they were treated equivalently to the corresponding first reproductive cycle groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Live human olfactometer assay</title><p>Live human olfactometer assays for testing female mosquito attraction to a human forearm were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basrur et al., 2020</xref>).

Experiments were conducted at 70â90% humidity and 25â28Â°C. Each trial consisted of approximately 20 female mosquitoes, grouped by reproductive condition. The groups of 20 were aspirated into âstartâ canisters at least 30 min before their trial. Females were given continuous access to 10% sucrose prior to sorting into canisters but were not provided any sucrose or water after being re-housed in the canister. Trials with non-blood-fed females were treated as positive controls and were interspersed throughout each experimental day. Experimental days were counted for final analysis only after ensuring average attraction to the live human arm stimulus of the non-blood-fed group was â¥50% across trials. All groups were run on each experimental day. Two trials were run simultaneously, one using each arm of the live experimenter as the stimulus. Groups were shuffled between ports to minimize bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Egg retention, laying, and hatching assay</title><p>For all egg retention experiments, to prevent accumulated condensation that could trigger premature egg âdumpingâ, special care was taken to ensure that all cages and sucrose-soaked cotton wicks for blood-fed female mosquitoes were not subjected to frequent fluctuating temperature and humidity, and closely monitored to remove any accumulated droplets of water. Following the duration of egg retention, cages were thoroughly checked for any dumped eggs. If a small proportion of eggs was found prematurely dumped on the sugar-soaked cotton wicks, this was noted prior to set up of egg-laying. Although observed extremely rarely, if the cage floor was found to be covered with a large proportion of prematurely dumped eggs, suggesting that little to no egg retention was achieved, all females in such a cage were discarded and not used for further experimentation.</p><p>Only for the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>, a single-female modular egg-laying assay setup was used as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>). The assay setup was modified to accommodate 28 females instead of 14, and each female was provided access to a single egg-laying substrate of deionized water instead of two substrate choices.

Egg-laying vials were made using plastic <italic>Drosophila</italic> vials (VWR, 25 mm diameter, 95 mm length, 75813â164) with 2â3 mL of deionized water, and a 55 mm diameter Whatman filter paper (GE Healthcare, WHA1001055) folded into a cone at the bottom of the vial to serve as a moist egg-laying substrate as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duvall et al., 2019</xref>). Vials were kept plugged (Genesee Scientific, Flugs Narrow Plastic Vials, 49â102) under standard insectary conditions following transfer of females ready for egg-laying. All females were removed 20â24 hr after transfer under brief cold anesthesia and either discarded or stored at â20 Â°C if required for further genotyping. Filter paper lined with laid eggs, and any eggs remaining on the sides of the vial or in the water, were removed from the vial at room temperature and placed briefly on a paper towel to remove excess moisture. The melanized eggs were then manually counted by eye or under a dissection scope as needed and the number of melanized eggs laid per female recorded. If most eggs from a female were unmelanized or submerged in the pool of water instead of lined on the filter paper, the sample was excluded. The egg-lined filter paper was returned to the emptied and dried vial within 24 hr of removing the female and terminating the egg-laying assay. All vials were kept under standard insectary conditions for 6â14 days prior to hatching.</p><p>Egg hatching was staggered to ensure that all egg papers were dried for the same length of time prior to hatching (6â14 days), and egg papers from distinct individuals were hatched and maintained separately. Eggs were hatched either by transferring egg papers into a small plastic cup (VWR, HDPE Multipurpose Containers, H9009-662) with 50â60 mL âhatch brothâ comprised of deoxygenated water with finely ground fish food (Pet Mountain, Tetramin Tropical Tablets Fish Food for Bottom Feeders, YT16110M), or by adding 20 mL of hatch broth directly to the egg-laying vial with the dry egg paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>, respectively). Larvae hatched were provided with a fresh pinch of fish food as needed.</p><p>At least 5 days after hatching, the egg viability experiment was terminated. Egg papers were removed and larvae, sometimes mixed with pupae or eclosed adults, were either cold anesthetized at 4 Â°C or killed by freezing at â20 Â°C overnight before thawing and counting. Offspring from each individual female were separately poured onto Petri plates (Fisher Scientific, S33580A) or small plastic cups with fresh deionized water and photographed on a light board using a webcam (Logitech, C922x Pro Stream Webcam) mounted from above, ensuring that all offspring were captured in the field-of-view.

Ovaries were dissected on ice, in ice-cold RNase-free 1 X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen, AM9625). They were moved using forceps into 0.5 mL Eppendorf LoBind microcentrifuge tubes (Sigma Aldrich, Z666521), and immediately snap-frozen on a cold block (Simport, S700-14) pre-chilled to â78 Â°C on dry ice. Extreme caution was taken during the tissue dissection to ensure that there was no contamination from other mosquito tissues. Each dish and forcep was carefully cleaned with 70% ethanol and RNase-away (Thermo Fisher, 7003) after every dissection. All replicates for each experimental group were dissected in parallel to avoid artifacts and batch effects. Dissected tissue was stored at â80 Â°C until RNA extraction.</p><p>RNA extraction was performed using the PicoPure Kit (Thermo Fisher, KIT0204) with the following modification for homogenizing tissue: instead of lysis buffer, 100 ÂµL of TRIzol (Thermo Fisher, 15596026) was added to the collection tube on ice. Tissues were homogenized manually using a Pellet Pestle Motor (Kimble, 749540) and an RNase-Free pellet pestle (VWR, KT749510-0590) for 30 s following the addition of 140 ÂµL of TRIzol to a total of 240 ÂµL. Tubes stood at room temperature for 5 min before 48 ÂµL of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 24:1 was added (Sigma, C0549). Tubes were hand-shaken for 30 s and left to stand for 2 min before centrifuging at 12,000 RPM for 15 min at 4 Â°C. The aqueous TRIzol layer was then removed and added into the PicoPure column, up to 130 ÂµL at one time.

Subsequently, ovary samples were dehydrated on ice using a series of graded methanol/0.1% PBS-T washes for 10 min, as follows: 25% methanol in 0.1% PBS-T, 50% methanol in 0.1% PBS-T, 75% methanol in 0.1% PBS-T, and two washes in 100% methanol. Ovaries remained in 100% methanol at â20 Â°C overnight. To rehydrate the ovaries, samples were washed for 10 min each on wet ice with a series of graded methanol/0.1% PBS-T solutions, as follows: 75% methanol in 0.1% PBS-T, 50% methanol in 0.1% PBS-T, 25% methanol in 0.1% PBS-T, and two washes of 0.1% PBS-T. Ovary tissue was then digested in 20 Î¼g/mL Proteinase-K (Thermo Fisher, AM2548) with 0.1% PBS-T for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently washed twice in 0.1% PBS-T at room temperature for 10 min each. Tissues were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1% PBS-T for 20 min at room temperature and washed three times in 0.1% PBS-T for 15 min each at room temperature.</p><p>Ovaries were incubated in Probe Hybridization Buffer for 5 min at room temperature, and subsequently in a 37 Â°C hybridization oven for 30 min in pre-warmed Probe Hybridization Buffer. A solution of pre-warmed Probe Hybridization Buffer and probe sets, each at 8 Î¼mol, was mixed, and used to incubate samples at 37 Â°C in a hybridization oven for three nights. Ovaries were next washed five times for 10 min each in a 37 Â°C hybridization oven using Probe Wash Buffer pre-warmed to 37 Â°C. The samples were then washed twice with 5 X saline-sodium citrate (SSC) buffer (Invitrogen, 15557044) containing 0.1% Tween-20 solution for 5 min each at room temperature. To pre-amplify, ovaries were incubated in room temperature Amplification Buffer for 10 min. A total of 24 Î¼mol hairpins were prepared by heating 8 Î¼L of 3 Î¼M stock of H1 and H2 hairpins, separately, each at 95 Â°C for 90 s on an Eppendorf Mastercycler. The hairpins were cooled to room temperature for 30 min in the dark, as hairpins are photosensitive and subject to photobleaching. Hairpins were then added to 100 Î¼L of Amplification Buffer in which ovaries were incubated on a rotator at room temperature in the dark overnight. Ovaries were next incubated in the dark in a solution of 1:1000 DAPI in 5 X SSC with 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature for 1 hr. Ovaries were finally washed four times for 10 min each in 5 X SSC with 0.1% Tween-20 and mounted in SlowFade Diamond (Thermo Fisher, S36972) onto glass slides with confocal microscopy-compatible coverslips.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Ovary confocal imaging</title><p>Images were acquired using an Inverted LSM 880 Airyscan NLO laser scanning confocal and multiphoton microscope (Zeiss). Either a 10 x/0.45 NA objective, or an immersion-corrected 25 x/0.8 NA or 63 x/1.4 NA objective was used at a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels. If tiling was used, images were stitched with 10% or 12% overlap. Laser power, gain, and other parameters were individually optimized to acquire highest quality images for ovary samples from non-blood-fed and post-egg-laying animals.

We noted that the current release of the <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> genome assembly (GCF_006496715.1 as of December 2021) contained multiples copies of the locus with <italic>tweedledee</italic>, <italic>tweedledum</italic>, <italic>scratch</italic> and <italic>peritrophin-like</italic>. With the currently available data, we were unable to ascertain whether the multiple copies of the locus reflect true duplication events, or incompletely collapsed haplotypes. We arbitrarily chose one locus for subsequent analyses with <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> genes, but repeating analyses with genes in a second locus yielded no significant differences. Putative orthologs in <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> and all specified <italic>Anopheles</italic> species were found by searching syntenic genomic regions between annotated orthologs of <italic>peritrophin-like</italic> and <italic>scratch</italic> on VectorBase. <italic>Anopheles</italic> genome annotations were used for further analyses if <italic>peritrophin-like, scratch</italic> exon 1 and the <italic>putative orthologs</italic> were all unambiguously annotated, and if all three genes were found on the same contig. <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic> protein sequences were obtained from NCBI. <italic>Anopheles</italic> protein sequences were also downloaded from NCBI if a RefSeq annotation was available, but if unavailable as with <italic>Anopheles quadriannulatus</italic> and <italic>Anopheles culicifacies</italic>, protein sequences were taken from VectorBase. Multiple sequence alignments and protein sequence identity matrices were generated using MUSCLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Madeira et al., 2019</xref>). The annotation of <italic>scratch</italic> was fragmented, with both exons annotated as separate genes in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>, <italic>Anopheles culicifacies</italic> and <italic>Anopheles quadriannulatus</italic>, likely due to the presence of a large &gt;50 kb intron.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Claude Desplan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Even though we all saw potential in the research, the manuscript needs substantial changes before we can consider it for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study focuses on egg retention in the face of desiccating conditions in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The research identifies genes associated with a trait that could be important to explain the vectorial capability of Ae. aegypti to transmit disease and expand into a cosmopolitan range. Given the truly gigantic genome size of the Aedes genome, the authors resort to the use of a differential expression and candidate gene approach which the authors leverage to generate genetic mutants in mosquitoes. This eventually leads to the identification of two loci that might be associated with the trait. The reviewers found the differentiation expression approach somehow limited because genes with low levels of expression might also be important to explain a sizable portion of the genetic variance of the trait. This possibility does not appear mentioned in the manuscript.</p><p>The second component of the manuscript is the generation of genetic knockouts. This section seems technically sound and the research group has led the efforts on this matter. Nonetheless, and given the differential expression approach, these findings are preliminary because the piece does not identify the architecture of the trait. This concern is somehow, but not completely, alleviated by the results on panel 5I.</p><p>This leads to a third concern: The figures are inscrutable. Part of the delay to finalize the review of this manuscript was the complex presentation of the results which took the reviewers a long time to digest. Any revised version of this manuscript will require a major overhaul of the presentation of the results.</p><p>The final concern is the lack of scholarship in the manuscript. There are several references that should be cited that do not appear in the text. This issue is particularly apparent in the area of evolutionary biology. The work is not contextualized in the larger picture of copy number evolution, gene duplication, and genetic architecture broadly defined. The authors for example coined the term 'conceptualog' which is simply a potential homolog. Coining terms like this one is not helpful and just creates confusion in the literature. The reviewers offer useful suggestions but the authors will need to make an effort to better provide the readers with the tools to understand the importance of their work.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Consider the caveats of the differential gene expression approach. Elaborate on how these limitations affect your conclusions. It is particularly important to discuss the findings in the context of the potential genetic architecture of the trait.</p><p>2. Make the figures and legends more accessible to the reader.</p><p>3. Improve the scholarship of the piece. Review the body of work on gene duplication and the origin of new genes.</p><p>4. Remove the concept of 'conceptualog'.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Please do not coin any new terms such as &quot;conceptualog&quot;. It is not required and is unnecessary.

This approach should allow the authors to strengthen two conclusions. First, they can examine the frequency of taxon-restricted genes in such modules vs. random expectation (of ovary-expressed genes in general). Second, this should allow the authors to compare dN/dS not to the overall genome, but to other ovary-limited genes which in general seem to show rapid evolutionary rates in mosquitoes. As I realize this may be more analyses than the authors wish to perform, I think the alternative is to simply acknowledge that their candidate gene approach has biased them to look specifically at taxon-restricted genes and to identify genes with potentially higher evolutionary rates as caveats in their discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80489.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have also simplified Figure 2 such that it describes the abundant expression of these two candidate genes, and provides evidence for their precisely controlled temporal- and tissue-restricted expression. This highlights the uniqueness of these genes and their compelling characteristics, focusing on these reasons as reasons for further studying them, rather than the use of a differential gene expression approach with limitations and caveats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We appreciate your positive evaluation and constructive criticism. The manuscript was not meant to prove that all rapidly evolving genes are functionally important, but rather some (here in this paper, two) rapidly evolving genes can be important for evolution and adaptation. In the new version, we edited the manuscript to make the above points clear. Although we appreciate the reviewerâs suggestion of performing co-expression analysis, we decided not to include them in the revised version, as that would deviate from the major points of the already lengthy manuscript. Instead, we took the reviewerâs suggestion and acknowledged that we used a candidate gene approach.</p><p>The suggestion of performing dN/dS not to the overall genome is an excellent point. We have revised the analysis to analyze all ovary-expressed genes. The percentiles of dN/dS for <italic>tweedledee</italic> and <italic>tweedledum</italic> are 98% and 94%, slightly more extreme compared to the results using all genes, suggesting that dN/dS of the two genes are indeed outliers compared to all ovary-expressed genes. In line with this thought, we also performed a McDonald-Kreitman test (MK test) for the genes and found that both genes are marginally significant or insignificant (<italic>tweedledee</italic> p = 0.068; <italic>tweedledum</italic> p = 0.048), despite that these are small genes and have low Pn values.</p></body></sub-article></article>
