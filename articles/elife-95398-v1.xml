Based on deviations between predictions and actual sensory input, primary sensory areas of cortex have been shown to compute sensorimotor prediction errors. How prediction errors in one sensory modality influence the computation of prediction errors in another modality is still unclear. To investigate multimodal prediction errors in mouse auditory cortex, we used a virtual environment to experimentally couple running to both self-generated auditory and visual feedback. Using two-photon microscopy, we first characterized responses of layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons to sounds, visual stimuli, and running onsets and found responses to all three stimuli. Probing responses evoked by audiomotor (AM) mismatches, we found that they closely resemble visuomotor (VM) mismatch responses in visual cortex (V1). Finally, testing for cross modal influence on AM mismatch responses by coupling both sound amplitude and visual flow speed to the speed of running, we found that AM mismatch responses were amplified when paired with concurrent VM mismatches. Our results demonstrate that multimodal and non-hierarchical interactions shape prediction error responses in cortical L2/3.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>predictive processing</kwd><kwd>layer 2/3 neurons</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor mismatch responses</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 - Research and Innovation Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>865617</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Audiomotor mismatch responses in auditory cortex are amplified by concurrent visuomotor mismatches, highlighting non-hierarchical and multimodal processing of prediction errors.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuronal responses consistent with prediction errors have been described in a variety of different cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audette and Schneider, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han and Helmchen, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heindorf et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu and Kanold, 2022</xref>) and across different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stanley and Miall, 2007</xref>). In V1, these responses are thought to be learned with experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>) and depend on local plasticity in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Widmer et al., 2022</xref>). Prediction errors signal the unanticipated appearance or absence of a sensory input, and are thought to be computed as a deviation between top–down predictions and bottom–up sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>). One type of top–down signals that conveys a prediction of sensory input are motor-related signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>). In auditory cortex (ACx), motor-related signals can modulate responses to self-generated vocalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>) or to sounds coupled to locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>). ACx is thought to use these motor-related signals to compute audiomotor (AM) prediction error responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Audette and Schneider, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eliades and Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keller and Hahnloser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu and Kanold, 2022</xref>). These AM prediction errors can be described in a hierarchical variant of predictive processing, in which top–down motor-related signals function as predictions of bottom–up sensory input. While parts of both auditory and visual processing streams are well described by a hierarchy, the cortical network as a whole does not easily map onto a hierarchical architecture, anatomically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Markov et al., 2013</xref>) or functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">St Yves et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suzuki et al., 2023</xref>). One of the connections that does not neatly fit into a hierarchical model is the surprisingly dense reciprocal connection between ACx and V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clavagnier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falchier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ibrahim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). From ACx to V1, this connection conveys a prediction of visual input given sound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garner and Keller, 2022</xref>). What the reciprocal projection from V1 to ACx conveys is still unclear. In proposals for hierarchical implementations of predictive processing there are no such lateral connections, and there is no reason to assume prediction error computations in different modalities should directly interact at the level of primary sensory areas. Thus, we argued that the lateral interaction between V1 and ACx is a good starting point to investigate how non-hierarchical interactions are involved in the computation of prediction errors, and how multimodal interactions shape sensorimotor prediction errors.</p><p>Based on this idea, we designed an experiment in which we could couple and transiently decouple running speed in a virtual environment to both self-generated auditory feedback and self-generated visual flow feedback. While doing this, we recorded activity in L2/3 neurons of ACx using two-photon calcium imaging. Using this approach, we first confirmed that a substantial subset of L2/3 neurons in ACx responds to either auditory, visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>), or motor-related inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henschke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morandell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vivaldo et al., 2023</xref>). While we found that L2/3 neurons in ACx responded to AM mismatches in a way that closely resembles visuomotor (VM) mismatch responses found in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>), we found no evidence of responses to VM mismatch in ACx. However, when coupling both visual flow and auditory feedback to running, we found that L2/3 neurons in ACx non-linearly combine information about VM and AM mismatches. Overall, our results demonstrate that prediction errors can be potentiated by multimodal interactions in primary sensory cortices.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Auditory, visual, and motor-related signals were intermixed in L2/3 of ACx</title><p>To investigate auditory, visual, and motor-related signals in mouse ACx, we combined an audiovisual virtual reality (VR) system with two-photon calcium imaging in L2/3 ACx neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector to express a genetically encoded calcium indicator (AAV2/1-EF1α-GCaMP6f-WPRE) in ACx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Following recovery from surgery, mice were habituated to the VR setup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We first mapped the location of the primary auditory cortex (A1) and the anterior auditory field (AAF) using widefield calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>). Based on these maps, we then chose recording locations for two-photon imaging of L2/3 neurons in either A1 or AAF. For the purposes of this work, we did not distinguish between A1 and AAF and will refer to these two areas here as ACx. To characterize basic sensory- and motor-related responses, we recorded neuronal responses to pure tones, full-field moving gratings, and running onsets. Throughout all experiments mice were free to run, and auditory and visual responses were pooled across both sitting and running conditions (unless explicitly stated otherwise). We first assessed population responses of L2/3 neurons evoked by sounds (pure tones presented at 4, 8, 16, or 32 kHz at either 60 or 75 dB sound pressure level [SPL]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) presented while the VR was off. While pure tones resulted in both increases and decreases in calcium activity in individual neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), the average population response exhibited a significant decrease in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Next, we analyzed visual responses evoked by full-field drifting gratings (see Methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Visual stimulation resulted in a diverse response across the population of L2/3 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>) that was initially positive at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). To quantify motor-related inputs, we analyzed activity during running onsets collected across all experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We found that the majority of neurons increased their activity during running onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>), which was also reflected in a significant positive response on the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Finally, we investigated how running modulates auditory and visual responses in ACx. In V1, running strongly increases responses to visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>), while in ACx running has been shown to modulate auditory responses in a variety of different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bigelow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henschke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Morandell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vivaldo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yavorska and Wehr, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). Separating auditory responses by running state, we found that sound-evoked responses of ACx neurons were overall similar during sitting and running, but exhibited a smaller decrease in activity when the mouse was sitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Visual responses consisted of an increase of activity during running, and a decrease of activity during sitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is reminiscent of the running modulation effect observed on visual responses in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>). Thus, running appears to moderately and differentially modulate auditory and visual responses in L2/3 ACx neurons. Consistent with previous work, these results demonstrate that auditory, visual, and motor-related signals are all present in ACx and that running modulation influences L2/3 ACx neurons differently than in V1.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Auditory, visual, and motor-related signals were present in L2/3 of auditory cortex (ACx).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the virtual reality system.

A mismatch in this context, is the absence of a sensory input that the brain predicts to receive from the environment, and thus a specific type of negative prediction error. We experimentally generated a coupling between movement and sensory feedback and then used movement as a proxy for what the mouse predicts to receive as sensory feedback. To do this with an auditory stimulus, we coupled the sound amplitude of an 8-kHz pure tone to the running speed of the mouse on the spherical treadmill such that sound amplitude was proportional to locomotion speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). In this paradigm, a running speed of 0 corresponded to a sound amplitude of 0, while 30 cm/s running speed corresponded to a sound amplitude of 60 dB SPL. We refer to this type of session as closed loop. We then introduced AM mismatches by setting the sound amplitude to 0 for 1 s at random times (on average every 15 s). An alternative approach to introduce AM mismatches would have been to clamp the sound amplitude to a constant value. However, based on an assumed analogy between sound amplitude and visual flow speed in VM mismatch paradigms, where we induce VM mismatch by setting visual flow speed to 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>), we chose the former. We found that AM mismatch resulted in a strong population response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). AM mismatch responses likely cannot be attributed to changes in running speed and do not result in a pupil response. We found no evidence of AM mismatch induced changes in running speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or pupil dilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the AM mismatch response was already apparent in the first closed loop session with AM coupling that the mice ever experienced, suggesting that this coupling is learned very rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To test whether AM mismatch responses can be explained by a sound offset response, we performed recordings in open loop sessions that consisted of a replay of the sound profile the mouse had self-generated in the preceding closed loop session. Mice were free to run during this session and did so at similar levels as during the closed loop session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The average response to the playback of sound halt during the open loop session was significantly less strong than the average response to AM mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, for detailed discussion on the relationship between mismatch responses and offset responses, see the authors’ response to reviewers’ recommendations). In contrast to visual playback halt responses in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasilevskaya et al., 2023</xref>), we found no evidence of a running modulation of the response to the playback halt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, L2/3 neurons in ACx respond to AM mismatch in a way similar to how the L2/3 neurons in V1 respond to VM mismatch.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>L2/3 neurons of auditory cortex (ACx) responded to audiomotor (AM) mismatch events.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the virtual reality (VR) system used to study responses to AM mismatches.

To test this, we selected the 5% of neurons with the strongest responses to AM mismatch and quantified the responses of these neurons to sound stimulation and running onsets (as for the sound and running onset responses shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Consistent with a model of a subtractive computation of prediction errors, we found that AM mismatch neurons exhibited a strong reduction in activity in response to sound stimulation and an increase of activity on running onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Given that mismatch responses are likely enriched in the superficial part of L2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O’Toole et al., 2023</xref>), and that in our two-photon imaging experiments we also preferentially recorded from more superficial neurons, we suspect that our population is enriched for mismatch neurons. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed a strong population response to AM mismatches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>) and a decrease in population activity in response to sound stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Nevertheless, sound-evoked responses were significantly more negative in neurons strongly responsive to AM mismatch, than for the remainder of the L2/3 neuronal population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This effect was similar when we used different thresholds for the selection of AM mismatch neurons (10% or 20% of neurons with the strongest response to AM mismatch; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistent with a sound driven reduction of activity and running related increase of activity in AM mismatch neurons, the correlation of calcium activity of AM mismatch neurons was predominantly negative with sound amplitude and positive with running speed in open loop sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This again resembles the properties of VM mismatch neurons in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>). If AM mismatch responses are computed as a difference between a locomotion driven excitation and a sound driven inhibition, we could also expect to find a correlation between the strength of mismatch response and the strength of sound playback halt responses. Even in the absence of locomotion driven excitation, a relief from sound driven inhibition could trigger an increase in calcium activity. When comparing AM mismatch responses with playback sound halt responses for all neurons, we do indeed find a positive correlation between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Finally, again assuming a locomotion driven excitation and a sound driven inhibition, we should find systematic differences in closed and open loop running onsets. In closed loop running onsets in which the sound was coupled to movement, we indeed observed only a transient running onset response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In contrast, in the open loop condition, running onset responses were sustained, possibly reflecting motor-related input that is not cancelled out by sensory input. This analysis highlights the difference in input processing depending on whether the animal is in the coupled or uncoupled condition and is consistent with subtractive interactions between prediction and sensory signals. Overall, these results suggest that the implementation of sensorimotor prediction error computation generalizes beyond V1 to other primary cortices and might be a canonical cortical computation in L2/3.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>We found no evidence of VM mismatch responses in L2/3 of ACx</title><p>VM mismatch responses are likely calculated in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jordan and Keller, 2020</xref>), and spread across dorsal cortex from there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heindorf and Keller, 2023</xref>). To investigate multimodal mismatch responses, we first quantified the strength of these VM mismatch responses, which are independent of auditory input, in ACx. In these experiments, the running speed of the mouse was experimentally coupled to the visual flow speed in a virtual corridor, but not to sound feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Note, there are several remaining sources of naturally occurring sound that increase with increasing running speed of the mouse and are still coupled (sound of mouse footsteps, sound of the treadmill rotating, etc.). However, these cannot be easily experimentally manipulated. We introduced VM mismatches by halting visual flow for 1 s at random times while the mice were running, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</xref>). To control for visual responses independent of VM coupling, we used an open loop replay of the visual flow generated in the previous session (see Methods). We found that neither VM mismatches nor visual flow playback halts, which the mouse experienced in open loop sessions, resulted in a measurable population response in ACx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>). No significant changes in locomotion speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or pupil diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were detected upon VM mismatch presentation. Selecting the 5% of neurons with the strongest responses to VM mismatches and quantifying their responses to grating presentations and running onsets, we found that these neurons exhibited positive responses to running onset and no significant response to grating stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These responses were not different from the population responses of the remainder of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Quantifying the correlation of calcium activity with visual flow speed and running speed in the open loop session, we found that VM mismatch responsive neurons exhibited a distribution not different from chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Running onset responses were not different in closed and open loop conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This suggests that motor-related predictions are not cancelled out by visual inputs in the ACx. We also found no evidence of a correlation between VM mismatch responses and playback halt responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To do this, we coupled both sound amplitude and visual flow speed to the running speed of the mouse in an audiovisual virtual environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). We then introduced mismatch events by halting both sound and visual flow for 1 s to trigger a concurrent [AM + VM] mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The nomenclature here is such that the first letter in the pair denotes the sensory input that is being predicted, while the second letter denotes the putative predictor – the square brackets are used to denote that the two events happen concurrently. By putative predictor, we mean an information source available to the mouse that would, in principle, allow it to predict another input, given the current experimental environment. Thus, in the case of a [AM + VM] mismatch both the movement related prediction of visual flow and sound amplitude are violated. The [AM + VM] mismatch resulted in a significant response on the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As with [AM] and [VM] mismatch, we found no evidence of a change in running speed or pupil diameter following [AM + VM] mismatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The concurrent experience of mismatch between multiple modalities could simply be the result of a linear combination of the responses to the different mismatch stimuli or could be the result of a non-linear combination. To test whether we find evidence of a non-linear combination of mismatch responses, we compared the [AM + VM] mismatch to [AM] and [VM] mismatch events presented alone. We found that the presentation of a [AM + VM] mismatch led to a significantly larger response than either an [AM] or a [VM] mismatch in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To test whether the linear summation of [AM] + [VM] mismatch responses could explain the response to the concurrent presentation [AM + VM], we compared the two directly, and found that the concurrent presentation [AM + VM] elicited a significantly larger response than the linear sum of [AM] + [VM] mismatch responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Plotting the [AM + VM] mismatch responses against the linear sum of the [AM] + [VM] mismatch responses for each neuron, we found that while there is some correlation between the two, there is a subset of neurons (13.7%; red dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) that selectively respond to the concurrent [AM + VM] mismatch, while a different subset of neurons (11.2%; yellow dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) selectively responds to the mismatch responses in isolation.

Also, consistent with previous reports, we found that a subset of L2/3 neurons in ACx respond to AM prediction errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Audette et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu and Kanold, 2022</xref>). In V1, it has been demonstrated that neurons signaling prediction errors exhibit opposing influence of bottom–up visual and top–down motor-related inputs. This has been speculated to be the consequence of a subtractive computation of prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jordan and Keller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leinweber et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings now reveal a similar pattern of opposing influence in prediction error neurons in primary ACx that exhibit a positive correlation with motor-related input and a negative correlation with auditory input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). This would be consistent with the idea that both VM and AM prediction errors are computed as a subtractive difference between bottom–up and top–down inputs. Based on this, it is conceivable that this type of computation extends also beyond primary sensory areas of cortex and may be a more general computational principle implemented in L2/3 of cortex.</p><p>While there are many similarities between the AM mismatch responses we describe here in ACx and previously described VM mismatch responses in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Widmer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zmarz and Keller, 2016</xref>), there are several notable differences. Specifically, AM responses in ACx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) appear to be more sustained than VM mismatch responses in visual cortex. We have no explanation for why this might be the case. Additionally, unlike the observed visual flow playback halt responses in V1 and their increase during running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vasilevskaya et al., 2023</xref>), we found only very weak responses to sound playback halts and no evidence of an influence of running on these responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). A decreased dependence of playback halt responses on running may be caused by the fact that the mouse generates additional sounds while running on an air-supported treadmill (e.g., treadmill rotation, changes in airflow, footsteps). These sounds correlate with running speed intensity and may reduce the relative salience of sound playback halts during running. Thus, differences in the experimental control of the sensorimotor coupling for a different sensory modalities could account for some of the observed differences between the AM and VM mismatch responses.</p><p>Finally, we found that concurrent prediction errors in multiple modalities result in an increase in prediction error response that exceeds a linear combination of the prediction error responses in single modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), with a subset of neurons selectively responding only to the combination of prediction error responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). A similar non-linear relationship has been described between auditory and visual oddball responses in both ACx and V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shiramatsu et al., 2021</xref>). At this point, it should be kept in mind that deviations from linearity in terms of spiking responses are difficult to assess using calcium imaging data. However, given that the difference between the concurrent presentation and the linear sum of the two individual mismatch responses was approximately a factor of two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), and the fact that we found a population of neurons that responds selectively to the concurrent presentation of both mismatches, we suspect that also the underlying spiking responses are non-linear. What are the mechanisms that could underlie this interaction? Neurons in ACx have access to information about VM mismatches from at least two sources. In widefield calcium imaging, VM mismatch responses are detectable across most of dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heindorf and Keller, 2023</xref>). Thus, we speculate that VM mismatch responses are present in long-range cortico-cortical axons from V1, or possibly in L4, L5, or L6 neurons in ACx. Alternative sources of VM mismatch input are neuromodulatory signals. Locus coeruleus, for example, drives noradrenergic signals in response to VM mismatches across the entire dorsal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jordan and Keller, 2023</xref>). However, given that noradrenergic signals only weakly modulate responses in L2/3 neurons in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jordan and Keller, 2023</xref>), it is unclear if the broadcasted noradrenergic signals could non-linearly potentiate the AM mismatch responses of ACx neurons. We speculate that cholinergic signals are also unlikely to contribute to this effect. In V1 there are no cholinergic responses to VM mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yogesh and Keller, 2023</xref>). However, given that ACx and V1 receive cholinergic innervation from different sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), we cannot rule out the possibility that cholinergic signals in ACx respond to VM mismatch. In sum, given that the [AM + VM] mismatch responses do not simply appear to be an amplified variant of the [AM] mismatch responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), we speculate that [AM + VM] mismatch responses are primarily driven by long-range cortico-cortical input from V1 that interacts with a local computation of [AM] mismatch responses in the L2/3 ACx circuit.</p><p>Lateral interactions in the computation of prediction errors between sensory streams are not accounted for by hierarchical variants of predictive processing. In these hierarchical variants, prediction errors are computed as a comparison between top–down and bottom–up inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>). To explain the lateral interactions between prediction errors likely computed in ACx (AM mismatch responses) and prediction errors likely computed in V1 (VM mismatch responses) that we describe here, we will need new variants of predictive processing models that include lateral and non-hierarchical interactions. Thus, our results demonstrate that mismatch responses in different modalities interact non-linearly and can potentiate each other. The circuit mechanisms that underlie this form of multimodal integration of mismatch responses are still unclear and will require further investigation. However, we would argue that the relatively strong multimodal interaction demonstrates that unimodal and hierarchical variants of predictive processing are insufficient to explain cortical mismatch responses – if predictive processing aims to be a general theory of cortical function, we will need to explore non-hierarchical variants of predictive processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

id="s4-1"><title>Mice and surgery</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by and carried out in accordance with guidelines of the Veterinary Department of the Canton Basel-Stadt, Switzerland. C57BL/6 female mice (Charles River), between the ages of 7 and 12 weeks were used in this study. For cranial window implantation, mice were anesthetized using a mixture of fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg), and midazolam (5 mg/kg). Analgesics were applied perioperatively. Lidocaine was injected subcutaneously into the scalp (10 mg/kg s.c.) prior to the surgery. Mice underwent a cranial window implantation surgery at an age of between 7 and 8 weeks. First, a custom-made titanium head-plate was attached to the skull (right hemisphere) with dental cement (Heraeus Kulzer). Next, a 3-mm craniotomy was made over left ACx (4.2–4.4 mm lateral from the midline and 2.6–2.8 mm posterior from bregma) followed by four to six injections of approximately 200 nl each of the AAV vector: AAV2/1-EF1α-GCaMP6f-WPRE (10<sup>13–14</sup> GC/ml). A circular glass cover slip was glued (Ultragel, Pattex) in place to seal the craniotomy. Metacam (5 mg/kg, s.c.) and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) were injected intraperitoneally for 2 days after completion of the surgery. Mice were returned to their home cage and group housed for 10 days prior to the first experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>VR environment</title><p>All recordings were done with mice head-fixed in a VR system, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>). Mice were free to run on an air-supported polystyrene ball. Three types of closed loop conditions were used for the experiments. The rotation of the spherical treadmill was either coupled (1) to the sound amplitude of an 8-kHz pure tone (AM coupling), while the animal was locomoting in near-darkness (low ambient light in the experimental rooms, primarily from computer screens); (2) to the movement in a virtual corridor (VM coupling); or (3) to both the sound amplitude of an 8-kHz pure tone and the movement in a virtual corridor (audio–visuo–motor coupling). For AM coupling, we used the running speed of the mouse to control the SPL of an 8-kHz pure tone presented to the mouse through a loudspeaker (see section Auditory stimulation). This closed loop coupling was not instantaneous but exhibited a delay of 260 ± 60 ms (mean ± STD). For VM coupling, the running speed of the mouse was coupled to the visual flow speed in the virtual environment projected onto a toroidal screen surrounding the mouse using a Samsung SP-F10M projector synchronized to the turnaround times of the resonant scanner of the two-photon microscope. The delay in the VM closed loop coupling was 90 ± 10 ms (mean ± STD). From the point of view of the mouse, the screen covered a visual field of approximately 240° horizontally and 100° vertically. The virtual environment presented on the screen was a corridor tunnel with walls consisting of vertical sinusoidal gratings. In auditory experiments, the mouse generated additional sounds while running on an air-supported treadmill (e.g., treadmill rotation, changes in airflow, footsteps), which correlated with running speed intensity. Prior to the recording experiments, mice were habituated to the setup, without any coupling, in 1–2 hr long sessions for up to 5 days, until they displayed regular locomotion. On the first recording day, the mice experienced all three types of closed loop conditions (AM, VM, or combined coupling) in a random order. Closed loop sessions were followed by open loop sessions, in which rotation of the spherical treadmill was decoupled from both the sound amplitude and the movement in the virtual corridor. During these open loop sessions, we replayed the amplitude modulated sound or the visual flow recorded in the previous closed loop session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Auditory stimulation</title><p>Sounds were generated with a 16-bit digital-to-analog converter (PCI6738, National Instruments) using custom scripts written in LabVIEW (LabVIEW 2020, National Instruments) at 160-kHz sampling rate, amplified (SA1, Tucker Davis Technologies, FL, USA) and played through an MF1 speaker (Tucker Davis Technologies, FL, USA) positioned 10 cm from the mouse’s right ear. Stimuli were calibrated with a wide-band ultrasonic acoustic sensor (Model 378C01, PCB Piezotronics, NY, USA). To study sound-evoked responses, we used 4, 8, 16, and 32 kHz pure tones played at 60 and 75 dB SPL (1-s duration, at a randomized inter-stimulus interval 4 ± 1 s, 10 repetitions, 1 ms on and off-ramp, in a randomized order). For AM coupling experiments, we used an 8-kHz pure tone with a sound amplitude that varied between 40 and 75 dB SPL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>For visual stimulation, we used full-field sinusoidal drifting grating (0°, 45°, 90°, and 270°, moving in either direction) in a pseudo-random sequence, each presented for a duration of 6 ± 2 s, with between two and seven repetitions, with a randomized inter-stimulus interval of 4.5 ± 1.5 s during which a gray screen was displayed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Running onsets</title><p>Running onsets were defined as the running speed crossing a threshold of 3 cm/s, where the average speed in the previous 3 s was below 1.8 cm/s. To separate trials with AM mismatch, VM mismatch, auditory stimulus, and grating stimulus based on locomotion state into those running and those while sitting, we used threshold of 0.3 cm/s in a 1-s window preceding the stimulus onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Widefield calcium imaging</title><p>To establish a reference tonotopic map of A1 and AAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), we performed widefield fluorescence imaging experiments on a custom-built microscope consisting of objectives mounted face-to-face (Nikon 85 mm/f1.8 sample side, Nikon 50 mm/f1.4 sensor side), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heindorf and Keller, 2023</xref>). Blue illumination was provided by a light-emitting diode (470 nm, Thorlabs) and passed through an excitation filter (SP490, Thorlabs). Green fluorescence emission was filtered with a 525/50 bandpass filter. Images were acquired at a frame rate of 100 Hz on a sCMOS camera (PCO edge 4.2). The raw images were cropped on-sensor, and the resulting data were saved to disk with custom-written software in LabVIEW (National Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Two-photon imaging</title><p>Calcium imaging of L2/3 neurons in A1 and AAF was performed using a modified Thorlabs Bergamo II microscope with a 16×, 0.8 NA objective (Nikon N16XLWD-PF), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>). To record in left ACx, the microscope was tilted 45° to the left. The excitation light source was a tunable, femtosecond-pulsed laser (Insight, Spectra Physics or Chameleon, Coherent) tuned to 930 nm. The laser power was adjusted to 30 mW. A 12-kHz resonance scanner (Cambridge Technology) was used for line scanning, and we acquired 400 lines per frame. This resulted in a frame rate of 60 Hz at a resolution of 400 × 750 pixels. We used a piezo-electric linear actuator (Physik Instrumente, P-726) to record from imaging planes at four different cortical depths, separated by 15 μm. This reduced the effective frame rate per layer to 15 Hz. The emission light was bandpass filtered using a 525/50-nm filter (Semrock), and signals were detected with a photomultiplier (Hamamatsu, H7422), amplified (Femto, DHCPCA-100), digitized at 800 MHz (National Instruments, NI5772), and bandpass filtered at 80 MHz with a digital Fourier-transform filter on a field-programmable gate array (National Instruments, PXIe-7965). Recording locations were visually registered against the reference images acquired with widefield imaging previously using blood vessels patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Widefield image analysis</title><p>Off-line data processing and data analysis were done with custom-written MATLAB scripts. Slow drifts in the fluorescence signal were removed using 8th percentile filtering with a 62.5-s moving window, similar to what was used for two-photon imaging data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>). Activity was calculated as the Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, where <italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> was the median fluorescence over the entire recording session. For stimulus responses, we use a response window of 0.2 to 1.2 s following stimulus onset and a baseline window of −1 to 0 s before stimulus onset. The pixels with the strongest response (top 3–5% of response distribution) were used to mark the tonotopic areas corresponding to the different stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Two-photon image analysis</title><p>Calcium imaging data were processed as described previously. In brief, raw images were full-frame registered to correct for lateral brain motion. Neurons were selected manually based on mean and maximum fluorescence images. Average fluorescence per neuron over time was corrected for slow fluorescence drift using an 8th percentile filter and a 66-s (or 1000 frames) window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dombeck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leinweber et al., 2014</xref>) and divided by the median value over the entire trace to calculate Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>. All stimulus–response curves were baseline subtracted. The baseline subtraction window was −0.5 to 0 s before stimulus onset. For quantification of responses during different onset types (auditory, visual, running, and mismatch), Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic> was averaged over the response time window (0.5 to 2.5 s after stimulus onset) and baseline subtracted (mean activity in a window preceding stimulus onset, −0.5 to 0 s). Onsets which were not preceded by at least 2 s of baseline or not followed by at least 3 s of recording time, were excluded from the analysis. Sessions with less than two onsets were not included in the analysis. For analysis of responses to the combination of [AM + VM] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), traces were aligned to the onset of the AM mismatch (due to the difference in lag of AM and VM coupling described above, VM mismatch preceded AM mismatch by approximately 170 ms). To quantify the difference in average calcium responses as a function of time, we used a hierarchical bootstrap test for every five frames of the calcium trace (333 ms) and marked comparisons where responses were different (p &lt; 0.05). Mismatch responsive neurons were selected based on the absolute response strength over the response time window (0.5–2.5 s). To infer spikes from calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we used CASCADE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rupprecht et al., 2021</xref>). To test whether running speed or pupil size changed upon mismatch presentation, we compared the values at MM presentation (0.5 to 1 s) to the baseline values in the time window preceding MM presentation (−0.5 to 0 s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical tests</title><p>All statistical information for the tests performed in this manuscript is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. We used hierarchical bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Saravanan et al., 2020</xref>) for statistical testing to account for the nested structure of the data (multiple neurons from one imaging site). We first resampled the data with replacement at the level of imaging sites, followed by resampling at the level of neurons. We then computed the mean responses across the resampled population and repeated this process 10,000 times. The probability of one group being different from the other was calculated as a fraction of bootstrap sample means which violated the tested hypothesis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal procedures were approved by and carried out in accordance with guidelines of the Veterinary Department of the Canton Basel-Stadt, Switzerland.

It focuses on the question of how these signals are shaped by non-hierarchical interactions, specifically multimodal signals arising from same level cortical areas. The authors used 2-photon imaging of mouse auditory cortex in head-fixed mice that were presented with sounds and/or visual stimuli while moving on a ball. First, responses to pure tones, visual stimuli and movement onset were characterized. The authors then made the running speed of the mouse predictive of sound intensity and/or visual flow (closed loop). Mismatches were created through the interruption of sound and/or visual flow for 1 second, disrupting the expected sensory signal. As a control, sensory stimuli recorded during the close loop phase were presented again decoupled from the movement (open loop). The authors suggest that auditory responses to the unpredicted interruption of the sound, which affected neither running speed nor pupil size, reflect mismatch responses. That these mismatch responses were enhanced when the visual flow was congruently interrupted, indicates cross-modal influence of prediction error signals.</p><p>This study's strengths are the relevance of the question and the design of the experiment. The authors are experts in the techniques used. Responses to the interruption of the sound are similar in quality, if not quantity, in the predictive and the control situation, yet the contribution of sound offset sensitivity to the observed mismatch responses is not discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95398.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Solyga</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01bmjkv45</institution-id><institution>Friedrich Miescher Institute</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Basel</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Georg B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01bmjkv45</institution-id><institution>Friedrich Miescher Institute</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Basel</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>I am satisfied with all clarifications and additional analyses performed by the authors.</p><p>The only concern I have is about changes in running after [AM+VM] mismatches.</p><p>The authors reported that they &quot;found no evidence of a change in running speed or pupil diameter following [AM + VM] mismatch (Figures S5A)&quot; (line 197).</p><p>Nevertheless, it seems that there is a clear increase in running speed for the [AM+VM] condition (S5A).

As there is a differential delay in the closed loop coupling of auditory and visual feedback of approximately 170 ms (as described in the methods), visuomotor mismatch onset is slightly before audiomotor mismatch onset. We have corrected this now in the manuscript but have done the statistical analysis for both old and new versions of the figure.

The authors can now conclude that responses to the mismatch are not due to behavioral effects.</p><p>The issue of the relationship between mismatch responses and offset responses remains uncommented. The auditory system is sensitive to transitions, also to silence. See the work of the Linden or the Barkat labs (including the work of the first author of this manuscript) on offset responses, and also that of the Mesgarani lab (Khalighinejad et al., 2019) on responses to transitions 'to clean' (Figure 1c) in human auditory cortex. Offset responses, as the first author knows well, are modulated by intensity and stimulus length (after adaptation?). That responses to the interruption of the sound are similar in quality, if not quantity, in the closed and open loop conditions suggest that offset response might modulate the mismatch response. A mismatch response that reflects a break in predictability would presumably be less modulated by the exact details of the sensory input than an offset response. Therefore, what is the relationship between the mismatch response and the mean sound amplitude prior to the sound interruption (for example during the preceding 1 second)? And between the mismatch response and the mean firing rate over the same period?</p><p>Finally, how do visual stimuli modulate sound responses in the absence of a mismatch? Is the multimodal response potentiation specific to a mismatch?</p></disp-quote><p>There are probably two points important to clarify before answering the question – just to make sure there is no semantic misunderstanding.</p><p>(1) In the jargon of predictive processing, a prediction error is a deviation from a predictable relationship. This can be sensorimotor coupling (as in audio- and visuomotor mismatch), stimulus history (as in oddball, or sound offset responses), surround sensory input (as in endstopping response and center-surround effects in visual processing), etc. A sound offset perceived by an animal in an open loop condition is thus a negative prediction error based on stimulus history (this assumes the animal has no way to predict the time of offset – as is the case in our experiments). We are primarily interested in our work here in characterizing negative prediction errors that result from motor-related predictions – hence the comparison we use is unpredictable sound offset in closed-loop coupling vs. unpredictable sound offset in open-loop coupling. The first is a mixture of an audiomotor prediction error and a stimulus history prediction error. The second is just a stimulus history prediction error. Thus, we compare the two types of responses to isolate the component that can only be attributed to audiomotor prediction errors.</p><p>(2) Audiomotor mismatch responses can of course be explained in a large variety of ways. For example, one could consider a sound offset a sensory stimulus. One could further assume that locomotion increases sensory responses. If so, one could explain audiomotor mismatch responses as a locomotion related gain of a sensory offset response. However, we need to further postulate that this locomotion related gain is stimulus specific, as for sound onset responses there is no detectable difference between locomotion and sitting. Thus, we are left with a model that explains audiomotor mismatch responses as a “stimulus specific locomotion gain of sensory responses”. This is correct – it is just not very satisfying, has no computational basis, and makes no useful predictions (see e.g. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36821437/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36821437/</ext-link> for an extended treatise of exactly this point for visuomotor mismatch responses).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That responses to the interruption of the sound are similar in quality, if not quantity, in the closed and open loop conditions suggest that offset response might modulate the mismatch response.</p></disp-quote><p>Conceptually both a “sound offset” and an “audiomotor mismatch” are negative prediction errors. Could one describe the effect we see as an audiomotor mismatch modulating a sound offset? Certainly. But if the reviewer means modulate in the sense of neuromodulatory – we are not aware of a neuromodulatory responses that would be fast enough (or be strong enough to have these effects – we have looked into ACh, NA, and Ser (unpublished – no MM response)). Alternatively, they could simply add linearly (as predictive processing would predict). Given that AM mismatch responses are likely computed in auditory cortex, we see no reason to speculate that anything more complicated is happening than a linear summation of different prediction error responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A mismatch response that reflects a break in predictability would presumably be less modulated by the exact details of the sensory input than an offset response. Therefore, what is the relationship between the mismatch response and the mean sound amplitude prior to the sound interruption (for example during the preceding 1 second)? And between the mismatch response and the mean firing rate over the same period?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s intuition here – that mismatch responses have a lower resolution than what one thinks of as sensory responses (or sound offset responses) – is probably not warranted. Experiments that quantify the resolution of mismatch responses are relatively data intense – and to the best of our knowledge this has only been done once in the visual system for visuomotor mismatch responses (Zmarz and Keller, 2016). Here we found that visuomotor mismatch responses exhibited matched spatial (in visual space) resolution to that of visual responses.</p><p>Regarding the suggested analyses: In a closed loop session, the sound amplitude preceding the mismatch is directly related to the running speed of the mouse. In visual cortex, the amplitude of visuomotor mismatch responses linearly scales with running speed (and consequently visual flow speed) prior to the mismatch – as predicted by predictive processing. See e.g. figure 4B in (Zmarz and Keller, 2016). We have tried this analysis for audiomotor mismatches in the previous round of reviews, but we fear we do not have sufficient data to address this question properly. If we look at how mismatch responses change as a function of locomotion speed (sound amplitude) across the entire population of neurons, we have no evidence of a systematic change (and the effects are highly variable as a function of speed bins we choose). However, just looking at the most audiomotor mismatch responsive neurons, we find a trend for increased responses with increasing running speed (Author response image 1). We analyzed the top 5% of cells that showed the strongest response to mismatch (MM) and divided the MM trials into three groups based on running speed: slow (10-20 cm/s), middle (20-30 cm/s), and fast (&gt;30 cm/s). Given the fact that we have on average 14 mismatch events in total per neuron, the analysis when split by running speed is under-powered.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The average response of strongest AM MM responders to AM mismatches as a function of running speed (data are from 51 cells, 11 fields of view, 6 mice).</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95398-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the relationship between mismatch response and firing rate prior to mismatch, we are not sure we understand the intuition. Does the reviewer mean, the average firing rate of the mismatch neuron? Or the population mean? The first is likely uninterpretable as it is bound to be confounded by regression to the mean type artefacts. But in either case, we would have no prediction of what to expect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
