gene expression analysis is that mRNA abundances broadly correlate with protein abundance, but these two are often imperfectly correlated. Some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. We present a new global factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that avoidance increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13479.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13479.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13479.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many genes carry information for making proteins. To make a protein, a working copy of the information stored in DNA is first copied into a molecule of messenger RNA. These RNA messages are then interpreted by the ribosome, the molecular machine that makes proteins. Many messages are produced from each gene, and each message can be read multiple times. Thus, it should follow that the number of messages produced dictates the number of proteins made. However, this is not the case and the number of proteins produced cannot be completely predicted from knowing the number of messenger RNAs.</p><p>Cells control how much of a given protein they produce through interactions between the messenger RNAs and other regulatory RNAs. The regulatory RNAs bind directly to a message and impede protein production. Because there are millions of RNAs in a cell, these interactions have evolved to be highly specific. Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that messenger RNAs would encounter other RNAs too, which could short-circuit gene regulation and lead to less protein being produced.</p><p>Umu et al. have now asked if such short-circuit events are selected against during evolution. Computational tools were used to predict the strength of binding between the RNAs found in the dominant forms of microbial life on Earth: the bacteria and the archaea. This approach revealed that the majority of messenger RNAs bind more weakly to the most common RNA molecules found in cells than would be expected by chance. Weakened binding should prevent the RNA molecules from becoming tangled with each other and ensure that protein levels are not perturbed by unintended interactions between highly expressed messages and other RNAs.</p><p>To test this hypothesis further, Umu et al. generated versions of the gene for a green fluorescent protein that differed only in how well their messenger RNAs could avoid interacting with the most abundant RNAs in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells. Those messengers that were designed to avoid interacting with other RNAs yielded far more protein than those that were not. The findings show that taking this kind of avoidance into account can improve predictions about how much protein will be produced and should therefore make it easier to control protein production in experimental systems.</p><p>Finally, the messenger RNAs of some bacteria do not show such clear avoidance. However, these bacteria have a more complex internal cell structure. This finding hints at an alternative means for avoiding short-circuiting events that could be used by more complicated cells, such of those of animals and plants, which also contain much larger numbers of RNAs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13479.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13479.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>ncRNA</kwd><kwd>Archaea</kwd><kwd>bacteria</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umu</surname><given-names>Sinan Uğur</given-names></name><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Anthony M</given-names></name><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardner</surname><given-names>Paul P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008414</institution-id><institution>University of Canterbury</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biomolecular Interaction Centre, Joint PhD Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Umu</surname><given-names>Sinan Uğur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001509</institution-id><institution>Royal Society of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RutherfordDiscovery Fellowships</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poole</surname><given-names>Anthony M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gardner</surname><given-names>Paul P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000183</institution-id><institution>Army Research Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobson</surname><given-names>Renwick CJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stochastic mRNA and non-coding RNA hybridisation has a major impact on protein expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It should in principle be possible to predict protein abundance from genomic data.

Yet, at best, these features account for only 40% of variation, and in some instances explain very little of the observed variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that crosstalk interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs also impact protein abundance, and that such interactions have a greater effect than either mRNA secondary structure or codon usage. We measured interactions between a set of evolutionarily conserved core mRNAs and ncRNAs from 1700 prokaryotic genomes using minimum free energy (MFE) models. For 97% of species, we find a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls. Furthermore, by generating synonymously variant GFP mRNAs that differ in their potential to interact with core ncRNAs, we demonstrate that GFP expression levels can be both predicted and controlled. Our results demonstrate that there is strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. Applying this knowledge to mRNA design will enable precise control of protein abundance through the incorporation or exclusion of inhibitory interactions with native ncRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To examine if avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions is a feature of transcriptomes in bacteria and archaea, we estimated the strength of all possible intermolecular RNA interactions using a minimum free energy (MFE) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mückstein et al., 2006</xref>) using core ncRNAs and mRNAs.

Under-representation of interactions has been considered for the specific case of Shine-Dalgarno-like (SD-like) sequences and the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borg and Ehrenberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diwan and Agashe, 2016</xref>) and between microRNAs and 3' UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartel and Chen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farh, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">van Dongen et al., 2008</xref>). We computed the free energy distribution of interactions between highly conserved mRNA:ncRNA pairs and compared this to a number of negative control interactions, which serve to show the expected distribution of binding energy values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The initiation of translation has been shown to be the rate limiting step for translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tuller and Zur, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakahigashi et al., 2014</xref>), therefore, we focus our analysis on the first 21 nucleotides of the mRNA coding sequence (CDS). This has the further advantage of reducing computational complexity. We also test a variety of negative control mRNA regions, which are unlikely to play a functional role in RNA:ncRNA interactions. The mRNA controls include (1) di-nucleotide preserving shuffled sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Workman, 1999</xref>) (orange, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), (2) homologous mRNAs from another phylum (with a compatible guanine-cytosine (G+C) content) (purple), (3) downstream regions 100 base pairs (bps) within the CDS (pink), (4) the reverse complement of the 5´ of CDSs (green), and lastly (5) unannotated (intergenic) genomic regions (yellow). Our interaction predictions in a single model strain show that native interactions consistently have higher (i.e. less stable) free energies than expected when compared to the five different mRNA negative controls: that is, there is a reduced capacity for native mRNAs and native ncRNAs to interact. We also compared different energy models and confirm that the MFE shift is a result of intermolecular binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We subsequently deployed the most conservative negative control (i.e. di-nucleotide preserving shuffle) and free energy model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) to detect if this shift for less stable binding of mRNA:ncRNA is true of all bacteria and archaea.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13479.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>mRNA:ncRNA avoidance is a conserved feature of bacteria and archaea.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native core mRNA:ncRNA binding energies (green line; mean = −3.21 kcal/mol) are significantly higher than all mRNA negative control binding energies (dashed lines; mean binding energies are -3.62, -5.21, -4.13, -3.86 &amp; -3.92 kcal/mol respectively) in pairwise comparisons (p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup> for all pairs, one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test) for <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> RNAs.

This is generally a biologically reasonable assumption when focussing on core genes based upon past analysis and our own work with RNA-seq data from a range of bacteria and archaea (Figure 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lindgreen et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, any potential mRNA interaction regions are saturated with ncRNA, therefore a summative model of interaction energies is a reasonable approximation to the estimated impact of excess hybridization. If modelling ncRNAs that are not so abundant, then a model weighted by expression level may be advantageous, but it is difficult to assess these across all conditions and developmental stages that are evolutionarily relevant. In order to ensure that our analysis is comparable across all bacteria and archaea we have focussed on just the most highly conserved ncRNA and protein-coding genes. Although, many of the ncRNAs are highly structured and are bound by RNA-binding proteins this is not the case during either synthesis and degradation of these products, furthermore, a fraction of the RNA components of these genes will be exposed. Therefore, we expect these will form useful datasets for initial testing of our hypothesis.</p><p>In order to assess whether mRNA:ncRNA avoidance is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon, we calculated intermolecular binding energies for conserved ncRNAs and mRNAs from 1,582 bacterial and 118 archaeal genomes and compared these to a negative control dataset derived using a di-nucleotide frequency preserving shuffling procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Workman, 1999</xref>). This measures a property that we call the ‘extrinsic avoidance‘ of mRNA:ncRNA interactions, yet this approach may fail to identify genuine avoidance in cases when the G+C content differences between interacting RNAs is extreme. Measuring only extrinsic avoidance (using shuffled mRNAs as negative controls), we found that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in most (73%) of the prokaryotic phyla (p&lt;0.05, one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that there is selection against stochastic interactions in both bacteria and archaea.</p><p>We next sought to establish the degree to which intrinsic G+C features of RNAs lead to avoidance of stochastic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A similar idea has been proposed which suggests that purine loading in thermophilic bacteria may limit mRNA:mRNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lao and Forsdyke, 2000</xref>). A test of G+C composition revealed a significant difference (p&lt;0.05, two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test) between mRNAs and ncRNAs for 95% of bacteria and archaea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Therefore, either extrinsic or intrinsic avoidance signals indicate that selection against stochastic interactions and it is near-universal for the prokaryotes (97% of all strains) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Our results clearly establish a signature of selection that acts to minimise stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions. However, with thousands of potential interacting RNA species in even simple prokaryotic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vivancos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>), the complete avoidance of stochastic interactions is combinatorially unlikely. Therefore, there ought to be a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression. To assess this, we examined the relationship between potential stochastic interactions and the variation between mRNA and cognate protein levels for four previously published endogenous mass spectrometry datasets from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laurent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). We computed Spearman’s correlation coefficients between protein abundances and extrinsic avoidance, 5´ end internal mRNA secondary structure and codon usage. Of the three measures, avoidance is significantly correlated in all four datasets (Spearman’s rho values are between 0.11–0.17 and corresponding p-values are between 0.01 and 1.3 × 10<sup>–12</sup>). In contrast, 5´ end mRNA structure significantly correlates in two datasets, and codon usage significantly correlates in all four datasets. This indicates that, despite strong selection against stochastic interactions, such interactions do significantly impact the proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). We have also conducted an ‘outlier analysis’ on one of the <italic>E. coli</italic> datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Laurent et al., 2010</xref>). We have selected the top and bottom-most expressed genes relative to mRNA expression levels and computed Z-scores for each of codon-usage, internal secondary structure and avoidance measures. We found that avoidance measures show the most extreme shifts downwards for the bottom-most expressed genes and is shifted the highest for the top-most genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13479.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>mRNA attributes have different impacts on protein abundance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) This heatmap summarizes the effect sizes of four mRNA attributes (avoidance of mRNA:ncRNA interaction, 5´ end secondary structure, codon bias and mRNA abundance) on protein expression as Spearman’s correlation coefficients, which are represented in gradient colors, while a starred block shows if the associated correlation is significant (p&lt;0.05).

We examined two available <italic>E. coli</italic>-based GFP experimental datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>), where synonymous mRNAs are generated for a GFP reporter gene. This enables the assessment of the impact of synonymous changes on protein abundance using fluorescence. Avoidance and mRNA secondary structure are both significantly correlated with fluorescence, whereas codon usage is not (Spearman’s rho values are 0.11 and 0.65, the corresponding p-values are 3.17 × 10<sup>−41</sup> and 1.69<sup>–20</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Note that one of the GFP datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>) uses native <italic>E. coli</italic> mRNA 5´ ends for their constructs, whereas the other GFP dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>) is randomly generated. We observe that the influence of avoidance on gene expression for randomly sampled synonymous mRNAs is strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), while endogenous gene expression is limited. Presumably, due to negative selection pruning low avoidance mRNAs from the gene pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>For each of the seven datasets described above we have tested linear models of measures of mRNA levels, codon usage, internal secondary structure and avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Avoidance alone explains around 35% of variance in GFP datasets where extreme mRNA compositions can be explored, whereas in native mass-spec derived datasets 2–3% of the variance is explained by avoidance alone. Codon usage describes 2% to −0.5% of variance in GFP data, and 19% to 0.3% of variance in mass-spec derived datasets. Internal secondary structure 33% to 10% in GFP datasets, and 0.2% to 0% of the variance in mass-spec derived datasets. Using all four measures in combination across the seven datasets between 70% and 42% of variation in protein levels can be explained, removing avoidance from the model reduces these estimates by between 56% and 0.7%. Thus, avoidance is at least as good an explanation of variation in protein abundance as either codon usage and internal mRNA secondary structure.</p><p>Our results indicate that crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs can impact protein expression levels. We therefore predict that taking crosstalk into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled. To test this, we generated GFP constructs based on the following constraints: codon bias, 5´ end mRNA secondary structure stability and crosstalk avoidance (see Materials and methods). Our constructs are designed to capture the extremes of one variable, while controlling other variables (e.g. high or low avoidance and near-average codon bias and mRNA secondary structure). The G+C content, a known confounding factor, was also strictly controlled for each construct. We selected a commercial service to perform our GFP transformations to avoid possible bias and increase the robustness of our approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ioannidis and Khoury, 2011</xref>). We predicted that a construct where all three parameters are optimised will result in a higher expression. Consistent with predictions, our optimised construct had maximal expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of the three parameters, avoidance showed the largest range, suggesting that tuning this parameter permits expression levels to be finely controlled (R<sub>s</sub> = 0.56, p=6.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>).</p><p>For a final confirmation of the avoidance hypothesis, we tested the <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> (<italic>T. thermophilus</italic>) HB8 SSU ribosomal RNA, which is a component of one of the most complete prokaryotic ribosomal structures available in the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rozov et al., 2015</xref>). We identified the regions of the SSU rRNA that had the least capacity to interact with <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> core mRNAs and found that these regions were generally not bound to either ribosomal proteins or other ncRNAs, such as the LSU rRNA (p=2.49 × 10<sup>−17</sup>, Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’).

Furthermore, we predict that similar signals can be observed for mRNA:mRNA and ncRNA:ncRNA avoidance. Although the impacts of these features are challenging to validate, interactions between clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) spacer sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhaya et al., 2011</xref>) and core ncRNAs are good candidates to test ncRNA:ncRNA avoidance.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that the specificity of prokaryotic ncRNAs for target mRNAs is the result of selection both for a functional interaction and against stochastic interactions. Our experimental results support the view that stochastic interactions are selected against, due to deleterious outcomes on expression. We suspect avoidance of crosstalk interactions has several evolutionary consequences. First, as transcriptional outputs become more diverse in evolution, we expect that the probability of stochastic interactions for both new ncRNAs and mRNAs becomes higher. This will impact the emergence of new, high abundance RNAs, since selection for high abundance may be mitigated by deleterious crosstalk events. Second, we predict that stochastic interactions limit the number of simultaneously transcribed RNAs, since the combinatorics of RNA:RNA interactions imply that eventually stochastic interactions cannot be avoided. This may in turn drive selection for forms of spatial or temporal segregation of transcripts. Finally, taking codon usage, mRNA secondary structure and potential mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account allows better prediction of proteome outputs from genomic data, and informs the precise control of protein levels via manipulation of synonymous mRNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Here we summarize the data sources, materials and methods corresponding to our manuscript.

The RNAup algorithm combines the intramolecular energy necessary to open binding sites with intermolecular energy gained from hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mückstein et al., 2006</xref>). In other words, this approach minimizes the sum of opening intramolecular energies and the intermolecular energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In our model of avoidance, we test for a reduction in absolute binding MFE relative to negative controls as a measure of avoidance. After testing a variety of negative controls (e.g. dinucleotide preserved shuffled mRNAs, the 5´ end of homologous mRNAs from a different bacterial phylum, 100 nucleotides downstream of designated interaction region, reverse complements, and identically sized intergenic regions), we selected the dinucleotide frequency preserved shuffled sequences as our negative control since this displayed the most conservative interaction MFE distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). In more detail, to serve as a negative control we compute the interaction MFE between each of the core ncRNAs and 200 dinucleotide-preserved shuffled versions of the 5´ end mRNAs. A dinucleotide frequency preserving shuffling procedure is used, as Gibbs free energies are computed over base pair stacks, i.e. a dinucleotide alphabet, therefore this method has been shown to be important in order to minimise incorrect conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Workman, 1999</xref>). We tested if the energy difference between native and shuffled interaction distributions is statistically significant using the nonparametric one-tailed Mann-Whitney U test, which returns a single p-value per genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). If the distribution of native interaction energies for a genome is significantly higher (i.e. fewer stable interactions) than the negative control, this is an indication that the genome has undergone selection for mRNA:ncRNA avoidance. To create the background density difference lines (seen in grey at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we randomly selected 100 bacterial strains and plot differences between the densities of shuffled interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Test of an intrinsic avoidance model</title><p>The energy-based avoidance model that we defined above is opaque to cases of ‘intrinsic avoidance’. These are where the intrinsic properties of mRNA and ncRNA sequences restrict their ability to interact. For an extreme example, if ncRNAs are composed entirely of guanine and cytosine nucleotides, whilst mRNAs are composed entirely of adenine and uracil nucleotides, then these will rarely interact. Therefore, our energy-based avoidance measures for native and shuffled interactions will both be near zero, and thus will not detect a significant energy shift between the native and control sequences. In order to account for some of these issues, we compared the G+C difference between core ncRNAs and core mRNAs. We used a nonparametric two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test to determine if there is a statistically significant G+C difference between the two samples: G+C of ncRNAs vs G+C of 5´ end mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Sliding window analysis to detect regions of significance for avoidance on SSU ribosomal RNA</title><p>We hypothesise that heterogeneous signals of avoidance within ncRNA sequences may correspond to the accessibility of different ncRNA regions. For example, are highly avoided regions of abundant ncRNAs more accessible than those that are avoided less? To create an avoidance profile, we tested binding MFEs of native and shuffled interactions throughout the full-length SSU ribosomal RNA of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>, using a one tailed Mann-Whitney U tests to evaluate the degree of avoidance for each nucleotide in the SSU rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) with a window size of 10 and step size of 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

The native interactions are the interactions between <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> core mRNAs and SSU ribosomal RNA. The shuffled controls are derived from 200 dinucleotide preserved shuffled versions of the RNAs. We created a 2 × 2 contingency table which separates the counts of residues that either host a strong avoidance signal or little avoidance signal (regions with p&lt;0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) and residues that we predict to either be in contact (&lt;3.4 Angstroms between atoms) with ribosomal proteins or ribosomal, transfer or messenger RNAs or not in contact with other molecules (i.e. accessible) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We calculated binding MFEs using a window size of 21 with a 1 nucleotide step size, and for each region we computed the associated Spearman’s correlation coefficients with p-values.

We calculated Spearman’s correlation coefficients (and associated p-values) among the protein abundances and 5´ end secondary structure (measured by intermolecular MFE), codon bias (measured by codon adaptation index (CAI)) and avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

These models show that avoidance explains more variance on average than secondary structure or codon bias. Up to 70 percent of the variation in GFP expression can be explained by including all the parameters and mRNA abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). CAI metric defines how well mRNAs are optimised for codon bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharp and Li, 1987</xref>).

The folding MFE predicts how stable the secondary structure of an RNA can be. The folding MFEs of GFP mRNAs were calculated using the RNAfold algorithm (version 2.0.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). We restricted folding energy to first 37 nucleotides because the most significant correlation was previously reported for this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>). We acquired previously published GFP data, associated fluorescence values and mRNA quantifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>) via personal communication. Our avoidance model showed the highest and most significant correlation with GFP expression in that dataset (R<sub>s</sub> = 0.65, p=1.69 × 10<sup>−20</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D,E,F</xref>). 5´ end secondary structure (R<sub>s</sub> = 0.62, p=5.73 × 10<sup>−18</sup>) correlates slightly less than avoidance, while CAI does not correlate significantly (R<sub>s</sub> = 0.02, p=0.4).</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>mRNA design</title><p>We have shown that avoidance is a broadly evolutionary conserved phenomenon and that it is significantly correlated with protein abundance relative to mRNA abundance. We now wish to test if avoidance can be used to design mRNA sequences that modulate the abundance of corresponding protein in a predictable fashion. We use a set of GFP mRNA constructs that all maintain the same G+C content, codon adaptation index (CAI) and internal secondary structure but host either very high or very low avoidance values. This procedure was repeated for the CAI and internal secondary structure values while maintaining a constant avoidance. The resulting 13 constructs were synthesised, transformed and expressed by commercial services. In the following paragraphs, we explained how we design our GFP constructs, the experimental set-up and statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-11"><title>Green fluorescence protein (GFP) mRNA design</title><p>We sampled 537,000 synonymous mRNA variants of a GFP mRNA (the 239 AA, 720 nucleotide long, with accession AHK23750, can be encoded by 7.62 × 10<sup>111</sup> possible unique mRNA variants). In brief, these mRNA variants were scored based upon (1) CAI, (2) mRNA secondary structure in their 5´ end region, and (3) mRNA:ncRNA interaction avoidance in their 5 end region. The genome of <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 encodes 52 unique core ncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gardner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nawrocki et al., 2015</xref>), to estimate the level of ncRNA avoidance for each GFP mRNA, we sum the binding MFEs. For example, for each GFP mRNA we compute 52 independent binding MFE values for each ncRNA. In short, a higher summed MFE score for a GFP mRNA implies a higher avoidance, while a lower summed MFE score implies a lower avoidance. This approach assumes that the ncRNAs are expressed at much higher levels than GFP mRNAs (i.e. [ncRNA] &gt;&gt; [mRNA]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Consequently, any potential interaction site on GFP mRNAs are likely to be saturated with ncRNA. Finally, we selected 13 GFP mRNA constructs, while controlling the range of G+C values. These GFP mRNAs were designed to have four different aspects; extreme 5 end secondary structure (2 minimum and 2 maximum folding MFE constructs), extreme codon bias (2 maximum and 2 minimum CAI constructs), extreme interaction avoidance (2 minimum and 2 maximum binding MFE constructs) and an ‘optimal’ construct. The optimal construct was selected for a high CAI, low 5´ end structure and high avoidance. All extreme GFP mRNA constructs have near identical G+C content (between 0.468–0.480) and identical G+C contents at the 5´ end (0.48). Each of the sampled GFP mRNAs is separated from other mRNAs by at least 112 nucleotide substitutions and 122 nucleotide substitutions on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13479.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The median expression of core ncRNA genes (n = 325 data points) in prokaryotic genomes is nearly two orders of magnitude greater than core mRNAs (n = 8086 data points) which proves that ncRNAs constitute most of the cellular RNAs.</title><p>To create this plot, we used mean mapped reads per gene length (i.e. mean read depth per position) of each core gene.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from Umu et al. provides evidence that stochastic base pairing between highly abundant non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as tRNAs, rRNAs etc. and sequences within the 5'end of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) can be deleterious to the translation of the mRNAs. They suggest that this base pairing causes some of the recognized disconnect between mRNA and protein levels, and that these stochastic interactions can have a bigger effect on protein production than either mRNA structure or codon bias. They propose a factor called 'avoidance', which refers to the potential of sequences within the first 21 nt of the mRNA to hybridize to ncRNAs, with lower potential for interaction yielding higher overall expression of the gene product.</p><p>This is an interesting premise, and if fully fleshed out, could provide new insights into mRNA sequence evolution (especially of the 5'-UTR) and an additional explanation for the imperfect correlation between mRNA and protein levels. Overall, the data indicating that interactions between ncRNAs and mRNAs are avoided and could repress translation are generally convincing. Careful controls are employed for the computational and experimental studies.</p><p>However, the reviewers found that the data were largely correlative at this stage, and lacking in development of specific examples of avoidance (or the lack thereof) affecting mRNA expression. The point was also raised that small non-coding RNA molecules that are not tightly bound by proteins would be better case studies than the SSU rRNA.</p><p>Thus, we invite a revision that addresses these issues specifically, as described in more detail below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors stopped short of providing the most interesting and important result: showing that they could better explain the relationship between mRNA levels and protein levels upon consideration of avoidance. The authors use this as motivation for their studies, but don't bring their story full circle and show that integrating avoidance into the equation helps us understand the non-uniform relationship between mRNA and protein. They find that avoidance is correlated with higher protein expression in several data sets, but fail to dig deeper. Without this demonstration of utility, we are concerned about how broad the readership for this manuscript will be.</p><p>a) The authors should investigate deeper into where native mRNAs with particularly high or low avoidance scores fall on the spectrum of mRNA level vs. protein level.</p><p>b) They should attempt to define how much better proteome predictions could be if taking avoidance into account.</p><p>2) The rationale for including some of the well-conserved ncRNAs such as RNase P RNA and 6S RNA that are generally tightly bound by proteins and largely unavailable for RNA-RNA interactions is not clear.

The R<sup>2</sup> when combining all the parameters range from 0.7 (our data) to 0.2 (Goodman et al. data). By removing the avoidance measure from the linear model the R<sup>2</sup> values decrease between 19% and 56% from the R<sup>2</sup> values in the GFP datasets. In the mass-spec data the R2 values decrease between 3 and 0.2%. Compare this with when we remove internal secondary structure information the R<sup>2</sup> values decrease between 18% and -1% for GFP data, and between 1.5% and -0.02% for the mass-spec data. When we remove codon usage statistics the R<sup>2</sup> values decrease between -0.05% and -0.4% for GFP data, and between 9% and -0.06% for the mass-spec data. This is consistent with the avoidance model being at least as good an explanation for variation in protein expression as either internal secondary structure and codon usage statistics. The manuscript has been updated to reflect some of this new analysis. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2figure supplement 3</xref> in the new manuscript.</p><p> <italic>a) The authors should investigate deeper into where native mRNAs with particularly high or low avoidance scores fall on the spectrum of mRNA level vs. protein level.</italic> </p><p>For one of the datasets we have investigated the distribution of protein-per-mRNA ratios (log[protein-per-mRNA]) (Laurent et al. 2010). We have taken the top and bottom 10 most abundant or scarce genes based upon this metric. Then for each of the codon usage, internal secondary structure and avoidance measures we have computed Z-scores for the 20 extreme genes (using means and standard deviations derived from the total dataset). We have found that avoidance is extremely high in the group of 10 abundant genes and is extremely low in the 10 scarce datasets. The shift in Z-scores relative to the null distribution is more modest in the other two measures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2figure supplement 4</xref> has been added to the manuscript and the discussion has been updated.</p><p> <italic>b) They should attempt to define how much better proteome predictions could be if taking avoidance into account.</italic> </p><p>See the discussion and the additional figure in response to point 1, above.</p><p>We found that avoidance alone can explain more than 36 percent of variation in synthetic mRNA expression. Avoidance outperforms the other two global factors in synthetic mRNA expression.</p><p>However, it can only explain around 2 percent of variation in native mRNA expression, which still makes avoidance a comparable factor with codon usage and secondary structure.</p><p>It is plausible to accept that native mRNAs are already selected for their high avoidance, which we detected as a conserved avoidance signal in core mRNA genes. A similar observation is also true for secondary structure. It also marginally influences protein expression in synthetic mRNA expression, but does not have similar effect on native mRNA expression.</p><p> <italic>2) The rationale for including some of the well-conserved ncRNAs such as RNase P RNA and 6S RNA that are generally tightly bound by proteins and largely unavailable for RNA-RNA interactions is not clear. An example of an abundant non-coding species that was freely available for stochastic interactions would be stronger.</italic> </p><p>There are relatively few ncRNA genes that we can say are never bound by protein and are broadly conserved across the range of species that we have analysed. There is increasing evidence that evolutionary turnover of ncRNA genes is rapid (Lindgreen et al. 2014). Furthermore, during assembly and degradation of ribonucleoparticles, presumably most components of these abundant ncRNAs will be accessible at some time. The tRNAs may be the least bound, by proteins (other than a transient interactions with tRNA synthetases and the ribosome). Furthermore, even for highly structured and bound ncRNAs such as the SSU rRNA, we see strong signatures of avoidance. We have included the below text in the manuscript to hopefully make this justification clearer:</p><p>In order to ensure that our analysis is comparable across all bacteria and archaea we have focussed on just the most highly conserved ncRNA and protein-coding genes. Although, many of the ncRNAs are highly structures and are bound by RNA-binding proteins this is not the case during either synthesis and degradation of these products, furthermore, a fraction of the RNA components of these genes will be exposed. Therefore we expect these will form useful datasets for initial testing of our hypothesis.</p><p>We have also included an additional figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3figure supplement 3</xref>) that shows the regions of <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> tRNAs, tmRNA, RNase P and SRP RNA that have the fewest interactions with mRNAs (i.e. are the most avoided).</p><p> <italic>3) The authors should present the specifics for several mRNAs to illustrate the impact of the three parameters.</italic></p><p>The outlier analysis described in response to 1a) hopefully addresses this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
