exclusively to the inactive X chromosome (Xi). However, <italic>Xist</italic>’s ability to diffuse under select circumstances has also been documented, leading us to suspect that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA may have targets and functions beyond the Xi. Here, using female mouse embryonic stem cells (ES) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) as models, we demonstrate that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA indeed can localize beyond the Xi. However, its binding is limited to ~100 genes in cells undergoing XCI (ES cells) and in post-XCI cells (MEFs). The target genes are diverse in function but are unified by their active chromatin status. <italic>Xist</italic> binds discretely to promoters of target genes in neighborhoods relatively depleted for Polycomb marks, contrasting with the broad, Polycomb-enriched domains reported for human <italic>XIST</italic> RNA. We find that <italic>Xist</italic> binding is associated with down-modulation of autosomal gene expression. However, unlike on the Xi, <italic>Xist</italic> binding does not lead to full silencing and also does not spread beyond the target gene. Over-expressing <italic>Xist</italic> in transgenic ES cells similarly leads to autosomal gene suppression, while deleting <italic>Xist</italic>’s Repeat B motif reduces autosomal binding and perturbs autosomal down-regulation. Furthermore, treating female ES cells with the <italic>Xist</italic> inhibitor, X1, leads to loss of autosomal suppression. Altogether, our findings reveal that <italic>Xist</italic> targets ~100 genes beyond the Xi, identify Repeat B as a crucial domain for its in-trans function in mice, and indicate that autosomal targeting can be disrupted by a small molecule inhibitor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Xist RNA</kwd><kwd>Repeat B</kwd><kwd>X1 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>autosomal targets</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-HD097665</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jeannie T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM58839</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jeannie T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Xist RNA’s influence extends beyond the X-chromosome and its autosomal influence can be perturbed genetically and pharmacologically.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The unequal sex chromosome composition between male (XY) and female (XX) placental mammals necessitates dosage compensation of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Payer and Lee, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Disteche, 2016</xref>). XCI specifically evolved to ensure equal X-linked gene dosage between the sexes. During early embryogenesis, one of the two X chromosomes in female cells is randomly silenced, leading to a mosaic of cells in which X-linked genes can be expressed from either the maternal or paternal X chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lyon, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee, 2011</xref>). The long non-coding RNA <italic>Xist</italic> is an essential regulator of the XCI process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Penny et al., 1996</xref>). At the onset of XCI, <italic>Xist</italic> is expressed exclusively from the future inactive X chromosome (Xi) and then selectively spreads in cis along the chromosome to initiate the formation of heterochromatin via association with chromatin-modifying complexes and alterations in 3D chromosome structure (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Disteche, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jégu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balaton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martitz and Schulz, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sahakyan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dixon-McDougall and Brown, 2021</xref>). From early RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments, it was shown at a cytological level that <italic>Xist</italic> binds only to the X-chromosome which transcribes the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clemson et al., 1996</xref>). In <italic>Xist</italic> transgenesis studies, the RNA is also observed to localize exclusively in cis to the transgene, even on autosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wutz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohlmaier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelsey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Minks and Brown, 2009</xref>). In more recent years, technical advances in epigenomic mapping of RNA confirmed the early cytological data and provided a map of <italic>Xist</italic> binding sites in cis at kilobase resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engreitz et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, genetic analysis of the X-inactivation center revealed a Xi-specific nucleation site for the initial binding of <italic>Xist</italic> that then enabled the RNA to spread exclusively in cis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeon and Lee, 2011</xref>). Altogether, these studies solidified the view that <italic>Xist</italic> RNA is a cis-acting RNA.</p><p>However, studies have long documented the potential for <italic>Xist</italic> to spread beyond the X-chromosome under various non-physiological conditions. When <italic>Xist</italic> is overexpressed, the RNA can diffuse to bind neighboring chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeon and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jachowicz et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, when <italic>Xist</italic>’s nucleation site is mutated, <italic>Xist</italic> will diffuse and bind other chromosomes in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeon and Lee, 2011</xref>). A recent study has also pointed to broad <italic>XIST</italic> binding patterns outside of the Xi in human naïve stem cells and suggested autosomal targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>). These findings prompt interesting questions about the binding dynamics and properties of <italic>Xist</italic> on autosomes, its potential to spread locally in autosomal domains, and its impact on gene regulation and cellular physiology. To investigate, here we examine the capacity for <italic>Xist</italic> to spread beyond traditional boundaries. We use mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) and MEF in order to capture both the establishment and maintenance phases of XCI. Intriguingly, we identify about 100 binding sites on autosomes in cells undergoing XCI as well as post-XCI cells. We demonstrate discrete binding sites, rather than broad binding domains. Transcriptomic analysis reveals a selective downregulation, but not silencing, of associated genes. We also probe a requirement for <italic>Xist</italic>’s Repeat B (RepB) motif and the ability to perturb autosomal effects by treating cells with a small molecule inhibitor of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epigenomic mapping of <italic>Xist</italic> binding reveals autosomal targets in mouse cells</title><p>To explore the possibility of <italic>Xist</italic> extending its binding to autosomal sites beyond the X chromosome, we conducted CHART (Capture Hybridization of Associated RNA Targets) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simon, 2013</xref> in female ES cells. To capture <italic>Xist</italic> RNA, we used oligoprobes antisense to <italic>Xist</italic> and then pulled down interacting chromatin for deep sequencing of the associated DNA. To control for any direct hybridization to DNA that could occur independently of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA, we conducted CHART in parallel using ‘sense’ probes that should not hybridize to <italic>Xist</italic>. This helps us distinguish signals genuinely due to <italic>Xist</italic> RNA from those that could arise from non-specific probe binding to DNA. We note that some of the sense probes could hybridize to <italic>Tsix</italic> RNA, but <italic>Tsix</italic> expression is normally down-regulated by day 4 of ES differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Lu, 1999</xref>). We also performed CHART using male ES cells, which do not upregulate <italic>Xist</italic> expression, to define the background level of binding. Notably, male ES cells express <italic>Tsix</italic> RNA at day 0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee and Lu, 1999</xref>) and, therefore, also assist in excluding non-<italic>Xist</italic> RNA binding during analysis. Together the male and sense controls allowed us to account for non-specific interactions and background noise. In addition to these controls, we performed two biological replicates and analyzed only overlapping signals between the two replicates to ensure the reliability and reproducibility of our results. The Pearson and Spearman correlation analysis showed good reproducibility between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also normalized to input DNA to account for differences in chromatin preparation and sequencing depth.</p><p><italic>Xist</italic> RNA is transcriptionally upregulated during female ES cell differentiation when XCI is induced. To profile the dynamics during cell differentiation and XCI, we examined wild-type (WT) female ES cells in the undifferentiated state (day 0) and at three differentiated stages (day 4, 7, and 14). Antisense oligonucleotides targeting <italic>Xist</italic> efficiently pulled down <italic>Xist</italic> RNA and associated chromatin targets, in excess of the ‘background’ observed with the sense probe, and male control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) of CHART-seq data from day 4 and <italic>Xist</italic> coverage on X-linked genes revealed that <italic>Xist</italic> CHART signals in female cells were distinct from those of sense probe and male controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This PCA separation indicates a clear difference in <italic>Xist</italic> binding in females as compared to controls. As expected, the <italic>Xist</italic> CHART signal in WT female ES cells displayed strong binding at the <italic>Xist</italic> locus and genes subject to XCI, such as <italic>Cdkl5</italic> and <italic>Mecp2</italic>, while showing significantly weaker binding at the escapee gene, <italic>Kdm6a</italic>. In contrast, CHART experiments using sense probes and male ES cells, which lack <italic>Xist</italic> expression, showed minimal binding to these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Because <italic>Xist</italic> spreads in cis along the Xi to cover much of the chromosome, we first examined total <italic>Xist</italic> coverage (normalized to input), rather than calling peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinter et al., 2012</xref>). Day 0 ES cells showed no enrichment for <italic>Xist</italic> binding, consistent with <italic>Xist</italic> being in the uninduced state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon cell differentiation, enriched binding of <italic>Xist</italic> was consistently observed across all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Greatest enrichment on the X chromosome was observed on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in agreement with de novo XCI when <italic>Xist</italic> is needed at highest concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sunwoo et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Capture hybridization analysis of RNA targets (CHART)-seq reveals ~100 discrete binding sites in autosomal genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top: Heatmaps of <italic>Xist</italic> coverage on autosomes and chromosome X genes in wild-type (WT) female embryonic stem (ES) cells at day 0, day 4, day 7, and day 14.

Indeed, although the X chromosome was most enriched for <italic>Xist</italic>, we noticed that autosomes also showed highly reproducible peaks, beginning at day 4 and increasing across the differentiation time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to broad binding pattern covering the entire X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>), <italic>Xist</italic> binding patterns on autosomes trended towards sharp peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

We used <italic>bedtools intersect</italic> to identify significant peaks that overlapped between the two replicates and only used overlapping peaks in subsequent analyses. Overall, <italic>Xist</italic> coverages in significant peaks of female cells were substantially greater than in the negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, we found hundreds of significant peaks across autosomes between days 4–14 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2 supp3 supp4 supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 1-6</xref>). Notably, <italic>Xist</italic> binding sites on autosomes were disproportionately located in promoter regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and G</xref>), hinting at a potential role for <italic>Xist</italic> in autosomal gene regulation. We conclude that, in addition to the Xi of differentiating ES cells, mouse <italic>Xist</italic> RNA selectively binds ~100 autosomal targets, preferentially at promoter regions. This promoter-dominant profile contrasts with <italic>XIST</italic> patterns identified in human cells, which tend to demonstrate broad regions of coverage over genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>). Although the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of these <italic>Xist</italic> autosomal target genes did not yield statistically significant enrichment for specific biological processes or pathways, a closer examination reveals that these genes have diverse functions. They are involved in processes such as cancer development (<italic>Bcl7b</italic>), POLII transcription regulation (<italic>Med16</italic>), amino acid transport (<italic>Slc36a4</italic>), RNA binding (<italic>Rbm14</italic> and <italic>Stau2</italic>), among other processes. Together with previously published work in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>), our findings suggest that <italic>Xist</italic> may have a broad regulatory impact on a variety of autosomal genes, extending its influence beyond X-chromosome inactivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Deleting RepB causes a loss of binding to autosomal target genes</title><p>Prior work showed that <italic>Xist</italic>’s Repeat B (RepB) element is essential for Polycomb recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almeida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pintacuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colognori et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colognori et al., 2020</xref>).

Given the partial loss of attachment to the Xi, here we asked if the <italic>Xist</italic> diffusion could lead to enhanced binding to autosomal targets. We conducted CHART experiments in RepB deletion (ΔRepB) female ES cells at various differentiation stages and quantitated the degree of X-linked versus autosomal binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although <italic>Xist</italic> retained partial binding to the X-chromosome, there was a significant decrease in localization along X-linked genes along all differentiation days, especially at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), consistent with RepB being essential for attachment of <italic>Xist</italic> to the Xi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colognori et al., 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, however, the loss of Xi binding was not accompanied by any significant increase in <italic>Xist</italic> coverage at the same autosomal targets, at any differentiation day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In fact, there appeared to be decreased binding to the ~100 autosomal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C-D</xref>).

To analyze the characteristics of genes bound by <italic>Xist</italic> on autosomes, we categorized all refSeq genes based on their expression levels at each differentiation day.

We performed RNA-seq analysis in two biological replicates in the ES differentiation time series. First, we profiled gene expression in female ES cells relative to male ES cells, reasoning that the lack of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA in male ES cells might lead to a difference in female versus male expression of autosomal target genes. Indeed, among the ~100 target genes, there was significantly greater expression in male cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Xist</italic> might also negatively regulate the select genes on autosomes. To test this idea, we took advantage of the ∆RepB mutation, as RepB is required for proper silencing of Xi genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colognori et al., 2019</xref>). Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that perturbing RepB resulted in loss of repression of autosomal targets. A detailed examination focusing on the top 100 peaks of <italic>Xist</italic>-bound genes on autosomes unveiled a down-modulation especially evident on days 4 and 7 of ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). The <italic>Xist</italic>-bound autosomal genes on day 14 of ES cell differentiation like <italic>Ces1l</italic> or non-targets of <italic>Xist</italic> on autosomes such as <italic>Kmt2c</italic> did not demonstrate significant changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E–F</xref>). We note, however, that unlike on the Xi, autosomal binding of <italic>Xist</italic> did not lead to full silencing of the target gene. Rather, the effect was a partial repression. In ∆RepB cells, reduced autosomal binding resulted in a blunting of this repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). On the other hand, at day 0 when <italic>Xist</italic> had yet to be upregulated, ∆RepB female and male ES cells showed no significant expression changes at <italic>Xist</italic>-autosomal targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To confirm that the observed changes in autosomal genes are due to <italic>Xist</italic> binding, we performed a similar analysis on 100 randomly selected autosomal genes that did not have <italic>Xist</italic> binding (‘on-targets’). The non-targets did not show a preference for specific autosomal gene region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>) and showed no significant difference in Polycom enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>) or gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>).

To address this, we turned to MEF, where XCI is well established. We first conducted CHART assays to determine whether <italic>Xist</italic> binds to the Xi and autosomes in a similar way in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Because the autosomal signals displayed peak-like characteristics, we used MACS software to call significant peaks on autosomes to determine if there was an increase in promoter-specific binding of the autosomal genes. We observed that, while <italic>Xist</italic> continued to favor targeting promoter regions in both WT and ∆RepB MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>), <italic>Xist</italic> peaks did not increase in size in ∆RepB MEFs; rather, the peaks decreased in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>) — a result similar to that in ∆RepB ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

During the differentiation process of female embryonic stem (ES) cells, the <italic>Xist</italic> is specifically expressed from the <italic>Xist</italic> loci of one X chromosome (Xi). It then binds to the <italic>Xist</italic> loci of the Xi in cis, spreading across this chromosome and effectively silencing the expression of most of its genes. Additionally, some <italic>Xist</italic> complexes will also bind to hundreds of loci on autosomes, thereby inhibiting the expression levels of target genes located there.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101197-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We then asked if the retention of some <italic>Xist</italic> binding on the Xi could explain the lack of transcriptomic difference in ∆RepB MEFs. To investigate, we utilized a deletion of <italic>Xist</italic>’s Repeat E (∆RepE), which was previously demonstrated to severely abrogate localization of <italic>Xist</italic> to the Xi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sunwoo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ridings-Figueroa et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that the severe loss of <italic>Xist</italic> binding might unmask a transcriptomic difference. As expected, we observed that <italic>Xist</italic> signals were somewhat more reduced on the Xi in ΔRepE MEFs compared to ΔRepB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). Despite this reduction, peak coverages in autosomal target genes did not increase in ΔRepE MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). However, there was an overall decrease in the number of significant autosomal peaks in ∆RepE MEFs relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Regardless, we observed no significant transcriptomic differences in ∆RepE MEFs relative to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). Additionally, further examination of RNA sequencing data from male and female MEF cells in two published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mizukami et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belužić et al., 2024</xref>) corroborated that the expression levels of these autosomal <italic>Xist</italic> targets did not exhibit significant changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). Altogether, the analysis in MEFs demonstrates that <italic>Xist</italic> continues to bind autosomal genes in post-XCI somatic cells. However, autosomal binding of <italic>Xist</italic> in post-XCI cells does not overtly impact the expression of the associated autosomal genes. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude more subtle changes that do not meet the significance cut-off.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Together with a backdrop of studies on ability of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA to diffuse and bind chromatin in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jeon and Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jachowicz et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>), the results of our current work challenge the conventional narrative that <italic>Xist</italic> operates exclusively in cis on the Xi. We find that autosomal <italic>Xist</italic> targets are not numerous, possibly limited to only ~100 in both pluripotent stem cells and in somatic cells. On autosomes, <italic>Xist</italic> does not spread and instead covers only a narrow region corresponding to single genes. The genes tend to be active genes, with <italic>Xist</italic> specifically targeting the promoters of those genes. Genetic analysis coupled to transcriptomic analysis showed that <italic>Xist</italic> down-regulates the target autosomal genes without silencing them. This effect leads to clear sex difference — where female cells express the ~100 or so autosomal genes at a lower level than male cells in the mouse ES cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Thus, our findings redefine the scope of <italic>Xist</italic>’s functional repertoire and provide insights into the broader landscape of epigenetic regulation during cellular differentiation. <italic>Xist</italic> RNA, therefore, plays a more complex role than previously envisaged, with several implications and caveats.</p><p>First, the observed consistent binding of <italic>Xist</italic> to both the X chromosome and autosomes in female ES cells prompted further exploration of the intricate dynamics of <italic>Xist</italic> during cellular differentiation. Our categorization of genes based on their expression levels revealed a compelling correlation between <italic>Xist</italic> binding on autosomes and the expression levels of associated genes. Notably, <italic>Xist</italic> exhibited a preference for binding to active gene regions, as evidenced by the significantly higher expression of genes within the 10 kb range of <italic>Xist</italic> binding regions. The parallel upregulation of X-linked and autosomal genes in ΔRepB and male ES cells suggests a regulatory role of <italic>Xist</italic> in gene expression beyond its canonical function on the X chromosome. Therefore, the precise temporal modulation of <italic>Xist</italic> binding merits further investigation to elucidate its regulatory significance and during distinct stages of cell differentiation or development, particularly in understanding its autosomal targets which could have implications for gene regulation and cellular function.</p><p>Second, a recent study using an alternative <italic>Xist</italic> pulldown method, RAP-seq, also revealed the capability of <italic>Xist</italic> to bind to autosomes in naive human pluripotent stem cells (naive hPSCs) and mediate gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>). While we found that, on autosomes, <italic>Xist</italic> does not spread and instead covers only a narrow region corresponding to single genes, the previous study demonstrated broader regions of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>). Furthermore, our CHART experiments demonstrate <italic>Xist</italic> binding to autosomes in post-XCI cells (e.g. MEF), whereas the previous study found no significant binding beyond the stem cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>). Our analysis also indicates that <italic>Xist</italic>’s autosomal targets tend to be Polycomb-depleted relative to neighboring genes, whereas the prior human study observed a positive correlation between <italic>XIST</italic> RNA and PRC2 marks. These discrepancies may arise from differences in the <italic>Xist</italic> pulldown methods (CHART versus RAP) employed by the two studies or from inherent differences between mouse and human systems.</p><p>Third, we considered the possibility that the binding of <italic>Xist</italic> to autosomes could merely be a consequence of <italic>Xist</italic> diffusion following saturation of binding sites on the Xi, rather than any programmed event during development. We are inclined to reject this notion and propose that <italic>Xist</italic> binding to autosomes is specifically programmed. Upon deleting RepB, the binding of <italic>Xist</italic> to the X chromosome weakens, but concomitantly, its binding to autosomal targets also diminishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Xist</italic> binding to autosomes is contingent upon Repeat B and is deliberate, rather than due to random <italic>Xist</italic> diffusion alone (in which case we would have expected increased autosomal binding). Additionally, following treatment with the <italic>Xist</italic> inhibitor X1, an increase in the expression of autosomal targets is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), implying that the regulation of autosomes by <italic>Xist</italic> is not merely an overflow effect of <italic>Xist</italic> saturating the X chromosome.</p><p>In summary, our study advances understanding of <italic>Xist</italic>-mediated epigenetic regulation by highlighting unexplored interactions with autosomes. The identified correlations between <italic>Xist</italic> binding and gene expression involvement pose intriguing questions regarding the regulatory mechanisms governing these processes. These insights contribute to the evolving paradigm of <italic>Xist</italic> biology, underscoring the need for continued exploration of the complexity of epigenetic control mechanisms. Future investigations will delve deeper into the functional consequences of <italic>Xist</italic> binding on autosomes and explore the potential downstream effects on cellular differentiation, development, and diseases associated with its dysregulation, such as cancer, immunity, and neuron development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dror et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forsyth et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pyfrom et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yildirim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carrette et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hajdarovic et al., 2022</xref>). A comprehensive understanding of <italic>Xist</italic>’s influence beyond X chromosomes is crucial, particularly laying the groundwork for future exploration of <italic>Xist</italic> as a potential therapeutic target.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Subsequently, cross-linking was performed using 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, followed by quenching with 0.125 M glycine for an additional 10 min. After two washes with ice-cold PBS, cells were pelleted and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For CHART, 25 million cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold sucrose buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.3 M sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM potassium acetate, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 1 mM DTT, 1 x protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 U/mL SUPERase•In RNase Inhibitor). The cell suspension was rotated at 4 °C for 10 min, followed by dilution with 2 mL of cold sucrose buffer. Douncing was performed using an RNaseZAP-treated 15 mL glass Wheaton Dounce tissue grinder 20 times with a tight pestle. The nuclear suspension was carefully layered on top of a cushion of 7.5 ml glycerol buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 25% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 100 mM potassium acetate, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 1 mM DTT, 1 x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, and 5 U/mL RNase inhibitor) in a new 15 ml tube, and centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 3 mL of PBS and cross-linked with 3 ml 6% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature with rotation. Afterwards, nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 mL ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM DTT, 10 U/mL RNase inhibitor), rotated for 10 min at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 400 g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 230 μL cold sonication buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM DTT, 10 U/mL RNase inhibitor) to a final volume of ~270 μL. The nuclei were sonicated in a microtube using a Covaris E220 sonicator (140 W peak incident power, 10% duty factor, 200 cycles/burst, 4 °C, 300 s). Sonicated chromatin was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, and transfer the supernatant (~220 μL) to new tube and add 170 μL sonication buffer to a final volume of ~390 μL, which was pre-cleared by 60 uL MyOne Streptavidin C1 beads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 640 μL 2 x hybridization buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.0, 750 mM NaCl, 1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 15% formamide, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 x cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, 100 U/mL RNase inhibitor) at room temperature for 1 hr with rotation. Pre-cleared chromatin was divided into two CHART reactions for <italic>Xist</italic> and control capture, and 1% was saved as an input sample. For each CHART reaction, 36 pmol of antisense (<italic>Xist</italic>) or sense (control) biotinylated capture probes (pooled probe as previously described) were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simon et al., 2013</xref>). Hybridization was performed at room temperature with rotation overnight, and 120 μL C1 beads were added to the samples and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr with rotation. The beads were washed once with 1 x hybridization buffer (33% sonication buffer, 67% 2 x hybridization buffer) at 37 °C for 10 min, five times with wash buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 2% SDS, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT) at 37 °C for 5 min, and twice with elution buffer (10 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 3 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT) at 37 °C for 5 min. 1% of the final wash was saved as an ‘RNA pulldown’ sample. CHART-enriched DNA was eluted twice in 200 μL of elution buffer supplemented with 5 U/μL RNase H (New England BioLabs) at room temperature for 20 min. The ‘input’ sample and CHART DNA were treated with 0.5 mg/mL RNase A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C for 1 hr with rotation and then incubated with 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5 mg/mL proteinase K (Sigma) at 55 °C for 1 hr. Reverse crosslinking was performed using 150 mM NaCl (final concentration 300 mM) at 65 °C overnight. DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform and further sheared to ~300 bp fragments using Covaris E220e (140 W peak incident power, 10% duty factor, 200 cycles/burst, 120 s, 4 °C). Sonicated DNA was purified using 1.8 x Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter). Input and CHART DNA libraries were prepared according to the protocol of the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB E7645S). Libraries were sequenced on Novaseq S4, generating approximately 30 million 150-nt paired-end reads per sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data source and processing</title><p>Raw data for CHART-seq and bulk RNA-seq generated in this study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GSE271096 and GSE271097, respectively.

Subsequently, trimmed reads were prepared for alignment. Alignment of the genomes of <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (mus) and Mus castaneus (cas) was performed using NovoAlign (version 4.03). Aligned reads were then mapped back to the reference mm10 genome using SNPs to generate a BAM file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pinter et al., 2012</xref>). Samtools (version 1.11) was employed for random sampling to ensure uniform library sizes across the samples. Utilizing DeepTools (version 3.1.2), input-subtracted ChIP and CHART coverage profiles were created, resulting in bigwig. To discern the peaks of <italic>Xist</italic> CHART on the autosomes, chrX reads were initially excluded from the BAM file. MACS2 (version 2.1) was used for peak calling using default parameters. The resultant peak files from two replicates were merged using bedtools (version 2.30) intersect. Bedtools window (version 2.30) facilitated the creation of gene lists based on peak sizes, spanning 10, 20, 50, and 100 kilobases. Deeptools was used to conduct comparative analyses of coverage, replicate correlation analysis, represented through either profile or heatmap plots, for genomic regions associated with <italic>Xist</italic>, H3K27me3, or H2A119ub across distinct categories of gene lists. IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate, version 2.0.2) was used to check the reproducibility of peaks identified in replicates. Intervene (version 6.0.2) was used to generate the Venn diagram of the peak.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and rRNA was selectively removed using the NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit (New England BioLabs), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

It has recently become apparent that in the human system, Xist RNA can not only spread in cis on the future inactive X chromosome but also reach some autosomal regions where it recruits transcriptional repression and Polycomb marking. Previous work has also reported that Xist RNA can show a diffused signal in some biological contexts in FISH experiments.</p><p>In this study, the authors investigate whether Xist represses autosomal loci in differentiating female mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and somatic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). They perform a time course of ESC differentiation followed by Capture Hybridization of Associated RNA Targets (CHART) on both female and male ESCs, as well as pulldowns with sense oligos for Xist. The authors also examine transcriptional activity through RNA-seq and integrate this data with prior ChIP-seq experiments. Additional experiments were conducted in MEFs and Xist-ΔB repeat mutants, the latter fails to recruit Polycomb repressors.</p><p>Based on this experimental design, the authors make several bold claims:</p><p>(1) Xist binds to about a hundred specific autosomal regions.</p><p>(2) This binding is specific to promoter regions rather than broad spreading.</p><p>(3) Xist autosomal signal is inversely correlated with PRC1/2 marks but positively correlated with transcription.</p><p>(4) Xist targeting results in the attenuation of transcription at autosomal regions.</p><p>(5) The B-repeat region is important for autosomal Xist binding and gene repression.</p><p>(6) Xist binding to autosomal regions also occurs in somatic cells but does not lead to gene repression.</p><p>Together, these claims suggest that Xist might play a role in modulating the expression of autosomal genes in specific developmental and cellular contexts in mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper deals with an interesting hypothesis that Xist ncRNA can also function at autosomal loci.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The revised manuscript now includes many additional bioinformatic analyses to support the premise that Xist RNA targets a specific set of about 100 promoters and attenuates their expression in the early stages of differentiation. I have previously raised significant concerns about the bioinformatic analyses and the robustness of the data, especially those linked to CHART-seq datasets. Despite some improvements, fundamental problems with the analysis remain, precluding a conclusion on whether Xist RNA binds specific autosomal promoters. The main concerns include:</p><p>(1) The authors nicely explain the use of biological replicates; however, they still fail to provide the sufficient analysis I requested on d0 and sense probes. While some quantification is presented in Figures 1E and 1F, the peak calling I asked for has still not been performed. In the response document, the authors report that about 600 peaks were identified in d0 female ESCs compared to about 100 in differentiated conditions. They explain this by the well-known phenomenon of having a background of differentiated cells in d0. In my opinion, this reasoning is flawed. With 98% of cells not inducing Xist in the culture, it is unimaginable why 600 peaks would be detected in the peak calling analysis. Rather, this demonstrates a high background in the CHART peak calling. To assess this further, I have reanalyzed d7 CHART datasets and found robust enrichment of the sense probe on promoters of genes, even stronger than the antisense probe. MACS peak calling also identifies a robust number of peaks on the sense probe. Indeed, even though Figure 1F shows low sense probe enrichment, this is because it focuses on the anti-sense peaks only. An opposite effect is observed when focusing on all genes or on sense peaks. Thefore it is tough to decide which of the signal is truelly due to Xist binding and what is an inherent problem with the CHART signal. These results cast serious doubts on the biological conclusions of this work and point to a very high background level of promoter signal in both sense and antisense samples.</p><p>(2) The authors do not address the conundrum of their results: how is it possible to have a genome-wide autosomal accumulation of Xist signal at promoters (see Figures 1A and 1B), while simultaneously specifically affecting only 100 promoters in the genome? The signal is either general (as Figures 1A and 1B suggest) or specific (as implied by the peak calling), but it cannot be both. Current data points to the fact that CHART has a bias for the most open parts of the chromatin.</p><p>(3) The text is still very confusing when it comes to Polycomb. Some experiments point to the fact that there are few PRC1/2 marks at putative Xist autosomal binding sites (Figure 3C), while the use of X1 induces the loss of PRC2 marks. I still find this internally contradictory. The authors sadly do not address my concerns with additional analysis. Their current data indicate that upon Xist upregulation, Xist-RNA binds to autosomal regions that are highly expressed and devoid of Polycomb. These loci then become transcriptionally attenuated and gain some (but low) level of PRC2 in a Xist-dependent fashion. If this model is true, then all these regions should not have Xist in d0 of differentiation and should also have slightly lower levels of PRC2. The argument that there is a low level of Xist in 2-5% of cells should not be a problem because most of the signal will come from the 98% of cells not expressing Xist (as seen in Figure 1A). Without timepoint 0, the whole premise of the paper is difficult to interpret. Either the d0 samples are good enough, or the system is so leaky that it is nearly impossible to identify Xist-specific effects. Males are a useful control but are obviously a genetically very different line with distinct epigenetic and signaling statuses. It is crucial to compare the timing of repression/PRC accumulation to conclude if and how Xist is functional on these loci.</p><p>(4) The authors did not address my concerns about the transcriptional analysis. I belive that the control genes are not selected properly. This analysis should not have been performed on just 100 randomly selected regions/genes. Instead, bootstrapping of 100 randomly selected regions/genes should be done, e.g., 1000 times. Additionally, one should only sample from expressed genes to have a comparable control gene set. For example, in Figures 4D and 4E, the distribution of control regions is entirely different. To stress again, relying on a set of 100 randomly selected genes/regions is not statistically robust; controls have to be matched, and bootstrapping has to be performed. Finally, each timepoint uses a different set of autosomal targets. There is a need to visualize the same set of genes across all timepoints (including d0). For example, are genes bound by Xist at d7 highly expressed at d0 and then attenuated only at d7? What happens to them at d14 (see points from 3)? The arguments about d0 heterogeneity are again not convincing (nor is Figure 3H, which shows a different set of genes).</p><p>(5) Transcriptional analysis is often shown only as tracks however the reads for key example genes have to be quantified properly and not just visualized or amalgamated in a violin plot.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101197.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>To follow-up on recent reports of Xist-autosome interaction the authors examine female (and male transgenic) mESCs and MEFs by CHARTseq.

Besides binding of Xist to X chromosome regions they found significant binding to autosomes, concentrating mostly on promoter regions of around 100 autosomal genes, as elucidated by MACS. The authors went on to show that the RepB repeat is mostly responsible for these autosomal interactions using a female ESC line in which RepB is deleted. Evidence is provided that Xist interacts with active autosomal genes containing lower coverage of repressive marks H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub and that RepB dependent Xist binding leads to dampening of expression, but not silencing of autosomal genes. These results were confirmed by overexpression studies using transgenic ESCs with doxycycline-inducible Xist as well as via a small molecule inhibitor of Xist (X1), inducing/inhibiting the dampening of autosomal genes, respectively. Finally, using MEFs and Xist mutants RepB or RepE the authors provide evidence that Xist is bound to autosomal genes in cells after the XCI process but appears not to affect gene expression. The data presented appear generally clear and consistent and indicate some differences between human and mouse autosomal regulation by Xist. Thus, these results are timely and should be published.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Regulation of autosomal gene expression by Xist is a &quot;big deal&quot; as misregulation of this lncRNA causes developmental defects and human disease. Moreover, this finding may explain sex-specific developmental differences between the sexes. The results in this manuscript identify specific mouse autosomal genes bound by Xist and decipher critical Xist regions that mediate this binding and gene dampening. The methods used in this study are appropriate, and the overall data presented appear convincing and are consistent, indicating some differences between human and mouse autosomal regulation by Xist.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>In the revised manuscript, the authors have addressed my previous criticisms satisfactorily. Moreover, the manuscript has been much improved with new confirmatory results and additional control experiments. This, combined with more detailed descriptions/explanations facilitates data interpretation, making the paper more transparent and easier to read.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101197.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yao</surname><given-names>Shengze</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Massachusetts</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jeon</surname><given-names>Yesu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kesner</surname><given-names>Barry</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Jeannie T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Massachusetts General Hospital</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Boston</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Yao S. and colleagues aims to monitor the potential autosomal regulatory role of the master regulator of X chromosome inactivation, the Xist long non-coding RNA. It has recently become apparent that in the human system, Xist RNA can not only spread in cis on the future inactive X chromosome but also reach some autosomal regions where it recruits transcriptional repression and Polycomb marking. Previous work has also reported that Xist RNA can show a diffused signal in some biological contexts in FISH experiments.</p><p>In this study, the authors investigate whether Xist represses autosomal loci in differentiating female mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and somatic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). They perform a time course of ESC differentiation followed by Capture Hybridization of Associated RNA Targets (CHART) on both female and male ESCs, as well as pulldowns with sense oligos for Xist. The authors also examine transcriptional activity through RNA-seq and integrate this data with prior ChIP-seq experiments. Additional experiments were conducted in MEFs and Xist-ΔB repeat mutants, the latter fails to recruit Polycomb repressors.</p><p>Based on this experimental design, the authors make several bold claims:</p><p>(1) Xist binds to about a hundred specific autosomal regions.</p><p>(2) This binding is specific to promoter regions rather than broad spreading.</p><p>(3) Xist autosomal signal is inversely correlated with PRC1/2 marks but positively correlated with transcription.</p><p>(4) Xist targeting results in the attenuation of transcription at autosomal regions.</p><p>(5) The B-repeat region is important for autosomal Xist binding and gene repression.</p><p>(6) Xist binding to autosomal regions also occurs in somatic cells but does not lead to gene repression.</p><p>Together, these claims suggest that Xist might play a role in modulating the expression of autosomal genes in specific developmental and cellular contexts in mice.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper deals with an interesting hypothesis that Xist ncRNA can also function at autosomal loci.</p><p>Weaknesses: The claims reported in this paper are largely unsubstantiated by the data, with multiple misinterpretations, lacking controls, and inadequate statistics. Fundamental flaws in the experimental design/analysis preclude the validity of the findings. Major concerns are listed below: (1) The entire paper is based on the CHART observation that Xist is specifically targeted to autosomal promoters. Overall, the data analysis is flawed and does not support such conclusions. Importantly the sense WT and the 0h controls are not used, nor are the biological replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with Rev1 but nevertheless thank the reviewer for making some suggestions that helped to strengthen our manuscript. We have provided new experiments and analyses in the revised manuscript. Please see responses below.</p><p>Rev1 seems to have missed or misunderstood some key experiments. In fact, the sense WT and 0 hr controls were shown. Furthermore, we included at least two biological replicates for each experiment.</p><p>We used both male ES cells (which do not express Xist) and sense probes as key negative controls, as outlined in Figure S1. Crucially, we only analyzed peaks that were reproducible between biological replicates. The Xist CHART peaks in differentiating female ES cells were significantly enriched above the “background” defined by the sense probe and male controls. Specifically, in comparison to undifferentiated female ES cells (day 0) where both X chromosomes are active and Xist is not induced, Xist CHART robustly pulled down the X chromosome during cell differentiation (day 4, day 7, and day 14). In contrast, male ES cells showed no significant pull-down of the X chromosome, and the sense group also exhibited markedly reduced binding (new Figure S1B). Furthermore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of CHART-seq reads (day 4 as an example) include Xist, sense, and input in WT and ΔRepB female, further confirmed that the sense probe CHART was clearly distinguishable from Xist CHART signals. Please see revised Figure S1C. Together, these findings underscore the specificity and robustness of our CHART results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data is typically visualized without quantification, and when quantified, control loci/gene sets are erroneously selected. Firstly, CHART validation on the X in FigS1 is misleading and not based on any quantifications (e.g., see the scale on Kdm6a (0-190) compared to Cdkl5 (0-40)). If scaled appropriately, there is Xist signal on the escapee.</p></disp-quote><p>Rev1 may have misread the presented data. In the example raised by Rev1, Fig. S1 is inherently quantitative: e.g., a ratio is a number in Fig. S1A (now Fig. S1B) and all gene tracks in Fig. 1B-E are shown with scales. We showed X-linked genes in Fig. S1 (now Fig. S2) as a control to demonstrate that the CHART worked and that Xist accumulated over time from day 0 to day 14. Our new Figure 1B demonstrates the Xist accumulation in graph format.</p><p>Our paper focuses on Xist autosomal binding sites. Thus, the X-linked examples were placed in the supplement. Escapee genes do in fact accumulate Xist at their promoter regions and this finding is consistent with data published by Simon et al. (2013, Nature). It was therefore not desirable in this paper to reanalyze X-linked genes, including escapees. Nevertheless, to address the reviewer’s concerns, we present new data in new Figure S3A. Here we analyzed the density of Xist binding across X-linked genes, including both active and inactive genes, as well as escapee genes. From this quantitative analysis, it should be clear that escapees do bind Xist. However, from the metagene plots in Figure S3B, we confirm the previous conclusion that escapees bind Xist at high levels just upstream of the promoter and that there is a depletion of Xist in the escapee gene body, consistent with a barrier preventing Xist from moving into the active gene.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All X-linked loci should have been quantified and classified based on escape status; sense control should also be quantified, and biological replicates should be shown separately.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see above response.</p><p>Additionally, in the revised manuscript, we have examined the Irreproducible Discovery Rate (IDR) to validate the reproducibility of peaks between the two replicates in the revised version, and we included a representative example from female WT ES cells at day 4 (revised Figure S4A). The results showed a strong correlation between the replicates, with an IDR threshold of 0.05 (red point &gt; 0.05). As described in the Methods section, to ensure reliable and robust peak identification, we performed peak calling (MACS2) separately on each replicate, and then used <italic>bedtools intersect</italic> to identify peaks that overlapped between the two replicates. This stringent process, including strict q-value settings in MACS2, ensures the reliability and reproducibility of the peaks presented in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, and most importantly, Figure 1 does not convincingly show specific Xist autosomal binding. Panel A quantification is on extremely variable y-scales and actually shows that Xist is recruited globally to nearly all autosomal genes, likely indicating an unspecific signal. Again, the sense and 0h controls should have been quantified along with biological replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 shows heatmaps and corresponding metagenes for d0, d4, d7, and d14 female ES cells. Two biological replicates are analyzed. In our revised manuscript, we have used Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients to measure the strength and direction of a relationship between two biological replicates and shown that the two replicates have high reproducibility (new Figure S1A). On d0, the Xist coverage on autosomes and X chromosome is low, but there is a clear increase on d4, d7, and d14, particularly at the TSS of autosomal genes, as shown by the metagene plots on in Figure 1A-B and the CHART density maps in new Figure 1E-F. We also show relative depletion of Xist signals in the male and sense negative controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Upon inspecting genome browser tracks of all regions reported in the manuscript (Rbm14, Srp9, Brf1, Cand2, Thra, Kmt2c, Kmt2e, Stau2, and Bcl7b), the signal is unspecific on all sites with the possible exception of Kmt2e. On all other loci, there is either a strong signal in the 0h ESC controls or more signal in some of the sense controls. This implies that peak calling is picking up false positive regions. How many peaks would have been picked up if the sense or the 0h controls were used for peak calling? It is likely that there would be a lot since there are also possible &quot;peaks&quot; (e.g., Fzd9) in control tracks.</p></disp-quote><p>The analysis cannot be performed by visual inspection. A statistical analysis must be performed to call signal above noise. This is why we performed peak-calling on two biological replicates and identified overlapping peaks using <italic>bedtools intersect</italic> to improve reliability. Significant peaks are noted as black bars under each track. As mentioned above, for our analysis, we focused on the top 100 peaks based on peak scores to ensure robustness. Xist has significantly higher signal compared to the sense probe in the Xist-autosomal peak regions (revised Figure 1E-F). Additionally, we conducted peak calling on undifferentiated ES cells (d0) and detected a significantly higher number of peaks (~600) compared to the differentiated states (d4 or d7) (~100).</p><p>Single-cell sequencing studies have shown that about 2% of undifferentiated mESCs express detectable Xist (Pacini et al., <italic>Nat Commun</italic>, 2021). The Xist peaks in “day 0” cells may be due to the differentiating population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further inspection of the data was not possible as the authors did not provide access to the raw fastq files. When inspecting results from past published experiments {Engreitz, 2013 #1839} reported regions were not bound by Xist.</p></disp-quote><p>On the contrary, we deposited the raw data files to GEO prior to the submission of the paper and included the reviewer link to access them. As of August 24, 2024, GEO publicly released these files, allowing for full inspection of the data.</p><p>Regarding the Engreitz publication, it is not recommended to compare our current study to their analysis for the crucial reason that the Engreitz study was not conducted under physiological conditions. The authors overexpressed the <italic>Xist</italic> gene in male ES cells. Because Xist RNA can silence genes in male cells as well, this ectopic overexpression normally leads to cell death — thus forcing examination of effects in a narrow time window before Xist can fully spread and act across the genome. Comparing our experiments (endogenous Xist expression in female ES cells) to the ectopic overexpression in male ES cells of Engreitz et al. should therefore not be undertaken.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thirdly, contrary to the authors' claim, deleting the B repeat does not lead to a loss of autosomal signal. Indeed, comparing Fig1A and Fig2B side by side clearly shows no difference in the autosomal signal, likely because the autosomal signal is CHART background. Properly quantifying the signal with separate replicates as well as the sense and 0h controls is vital. Overall current data together with published results indicate that CHART peak calling on autosomes is due to technical noise or artefacts.</p></disp-quote><p>In our revised manuscript, we have included the quantitative results as mentioned above in the main and supplementary figure (new Figure 1E-F, Figure 2E-F, and S3A). The data clearly show an enrichment in the Xist CHART samples in differentiating female ES cells.</p><p>We believe the reviewer may be comparing the original Figure 1A and Figure 2A (not Figure 2B). As mentioned above, the analysis cannot be performed by visual inspection. Please see new Figure 2E and 2F. From these data, it should be clear that deleting RepB causes a decrease in Xist targeting to autosomal loci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The RNA-seq analysis is also flawed and precludes strong statements. Firstly, the analysis frequently lacks statistical analysis (Fig3B, FigS2B-C) and is often based on visualizations (Fig 3D-G) without quantifications. Day 4 B-repeat deletion does not lead to a significant change in the expression of genes close to Xist signal (Fig3H, d14 does not fully show).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see new revised Figure 3B and Figures S2B-C (now revised as Figures S6A and S6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, for all transcriptional analysis, it is important to show autosomal non-target genes, which is not always done.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we included non-target genes for each analysis (new Figure 4E-F, 5D and 5F, 7C and 7E, S7F, S8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indeed, both males and B repeat deletion will lead to transcriptional changes on autosomes as a secondary effect from different X inactivation status. The control set, if used, is inappropriate as it compares one randomly selected set of ~100 genes. This introduces sampling error and compares different classes of genes. Since Xist signal targets more active genes, it is important to always compare autosomal target genes to all other autosomal genes with similar basal expression patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see new Figure S8. We included 100 randomly selected non-target sites on autosomes for this comparative analysis. For consistency, we applied the same flanking regions (10 kb) in the analysis of both target and non-target genes. We believe that this selection method for nontargets is appropriate for two reasons: first, it allows us to control for Xist binding and non-binding; second, it ensures a similar number of genes in both groups, providing a robust foundation for statistical analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The ChIP-seq analysis also has some problems. The authors claim that there is no positive correlation between genes close to Xist autosomal binding (10kb) compared to those 50kb away (Fig 3C, S2D); however, this analysis is based entirely on metagene visualization. Signal within the Xist binding sites should be quantified (not genes close by) and compared to other types of genomic loci and promoters. Focusing on the 50kb group only as controls is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe the reviewer may have misunderstood our conclusions. As stated in the paper, we observed lower coverage of the histone marks H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub, associated with PRC2 and PRC1, respectively. Our conclusions regarding PRC1/2 support the RNA-seq results, indicating that Xist tends to bind to actively expressed genes. In other words, these genes exhibit lower levels of PRC-mediated silencing signals. This observation underscores the relationship between Xist binding and gene activity, highlighting that Xist preferentially associates with regions that are less subject to silencing by polycomb repressive complexes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the authors only look at PRC mark signal upon differentiation; what about the 0h timepoint, i.e., is there pre-marking?</p></disp-quote><p>Day 0 is not an appropriate timepoint for this analysis because Xist is not yet induced. There is also a small fraction of cells (&lt;5%) that spontaneously differentiate and start to undergo XCI. Because of these reasons, the day 0 timepoint is considered somewhat heterogeneous and it would be difficult to make conclusions regarding Xist peaks in these samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most worryingly, the data analysis is not consistent between figures (see Fig3C vs 5H-I). In Fig5, the group of Xist targets was chosen as those within 100kb of Xist binding, which would encompass all the control regions from Fig3C. In this analysis, the authors report that there is Xist-dependent H3K27me3 deposition, and in fact, here the Xist autosomal targets have more of it than the controls. Overall, all of this analysis is misleading, and clear conclusions cannot be made.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the reviewer may have also misunderstood the analysis in Figure 5. Figure 5 shows the effect of the Xist inhibitor, X1, on H3K27me3 and gene expression. X1 blocks reduces PRC2 targeting and gene silencing — consistent with X1’s effect on RepA as published in Aguilar et al. 2022.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All in all, because the fundamental observation is not robust (see point 1), all subsequent analyses are also affected. There are also multiple other inconsistencies within the analysis; however, they have not been included here for brevity.</p></disp-quote><p>We again respectfully disagree with Rev1 but thank the reviewer for making suggestions that helped to strengthen our manuscript. We believe that the revised manuscript with new analyses is improved in part because of the reviewer’s critical comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>To follow-up on recent reports of Xist-autosome interaction the authors examine female (and male transgenic) mESCs and MEFs by CHARTseq.

The figure legends are limited, and sample size and/or source of control is not always clear.

Thus, two biological replicates are typically considered acceptable.</p><p>Additionally, we performed reanalysis of published datasets to test whether — <italic>in the hands of other investigators</italic> — cell lines expressing Xist also supported autosomal targeting. Figure 4 is a case in point. Here we examined Tg1 and Tg2, which respond to doxycycline to overexpress Xist from an ectopic site. Transcriptomic analysis showed significant downregulation of autosomal Xist targets, as exemplified by <italic>Rbm14</italic> and <italic>Bcl7b</italic> (new Figure 4C, S9B). In contrast, non-targets of Xist such as <italic>Stau1</italic> did not demonstrate significant changes in gene expression (new Figure 4E and 4G). Looking across all autosomal target genes, we observed a significant decrease in mean expression in the Xist overexpressing cell lines (new Figure 4D). The fact that the autosomal changes were also observed in datasets generated by other investigators greatly strengthen our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Aim achievement:</p><p>The authors do identify autosomal sites with enrichment of chromatin marks and evidence of silencing.

Some quantitative statistics would assist in determining impact, both on autosomes and also X; perhaps similar to the quintile analysis done for expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the Xist coverage panel for day 4 and 7 in the identified Xist-autosomal peak regions (new Figure 1E-F, Figure 2E-F), as mentioned above. The results clearly demonstrate that the deletion of RepB decreases Xist binding to autosomes. Also, we showed that ΔRepB increased X-linked genes expression in our revised Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is stated that there is a significant suppression of X-linked genes with the autosomal transgenes; however, only an example is shown in Figure 4B. To support this statement, a full X chromosomal geneset should be shown in panels F and G, which should also list the number of replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see new Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As these are hybrid cells, perhaps allelic suppression could be monitored? Is Med14 usually subject to X inactivation in the Ctrl cells, and is the expression reduced from both X chromosomes or preferentially the active (or inactive) X chromosome?</p></disp-quote><p>If Rev2 is referring to Figure 4, the dataset used in Figure 4 comes from another research group and was previously published (Loda, A. et al. Nat Commun, 2017).</p><p>If Rev2 is referring to our ES cells, they are N2 cell lines. The X chromosomes are fully hybridized (Cas/Mus), but the autosomes are not fully hybridized (Ogawa et al., Science, 2008). <italic>Med14</italic> is subject to XCI and is expressed from the Xa, silenced on the Xi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The expression change for autosomes after transgene induction is barely significant; and it was not clear what was used as the Ctrl? This is a critical comparator as doxycycline alone can change expression patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there was a modest change in expression after transgene induction, but it is a significant change. Again, the dataset is from a published study where the authors generated doxycycline-responsive Xist transgenes (see above). The control in this case is Dox-treated wildtype cells. We now clarify these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion there is the statement. &quot;Genetic analysis coupled to transcriptomic analysis showed that Xist down-regulates the target autosomal genes without silencing them. This effect leads to clear sex difference - where female cells express the ~100 or so autosomal genes at a lower level than male cells (Figure 7H).&quot; This sweeping statement fails to include that in MEFs there is no significant expression difference, in transgenics only borderline significance, and at d14 no significant expression difference. The down-regulation overall seems to be transient during development while targeting is ongoing?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the Xist effects on autosomes seem to occur during cell differentiation in ES cells. While there is no apparent effect in MEFs, we cannot exclude effects on other somatic cells. Regardless of whether the effects are in early development or throughout life, the sex differences may have life-long effects in mammals. The study conducted in human cells by the Plath lab also concluded that the differences primarily affect stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, I would have liked to see discussion of the consistency of the identified genes to support the conclusion that the autosomal sites are not merely the results of Xist diffusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We address this in the third paragraph of the Discussion. Our main argument is that if autosomal binding were caused by diffusion, then RepB deletion or X1 treatment would have led to increased binding at autosomal sites, as Xist would bind less to the X chromosome. However, as demonstrated in our study, both treatments resulted in reduced Xist binding on both the X chromosome and autosomes. This finding suggests that the binding is specific and reliant on Xist's RepA and RepB domains, rather than being a passive diffusion process.</p><p>To examine overlap between the conditions (days of differentiation and WT/RepB cells), we generated Venn Diagrams as now shown in Figure S4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The impact of Xist on autosomes is important for consideration of impact of changes in Xist expression with disease (notably cancers). Knowing the targets (if consistent) would enable assessment of such impact.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Rev2 for the very helpful review and for the forward-looking experiments. Indeed, the physiological changes brought on by autosomal targeting will be of future interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Yao et al use CHART to identify chromatin associated with Xist in female mouse ESCs, and, as control, male ESCs at various timepoints of differentiation. Besides binding of Xist to X chromosome regions they found significant binding to autosomes, concentrating mostly on promoter regions of around 100 autosomal genes, as elucidated by MACS. The authors went on to show that the RepB repeat is mostly responsible for these autosomal interactions using a female ESC line in which RepB is deleted. Evidence is provided that Xist interacts with active autosomal genes containing lower coverage of repressive marks H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub and that RepB dependent Xist binding leads to dampening of expression, but not silencing of autosomal genes. These results were confirmed by overexpression studies using transgenic ESCs with doxycycline-inducible Xist as well as via a small molecule inhibitor of Xist (X1), inducing/inhibiting the dampening of autosomal genes, respectively. Finally, using MEFs and Xist mutants RepB or RepE the authors provide evidence that Xist is bound to autosomal genes in cells after the XCI process but appears not to affect gene expression. The data presented appear generally clear and consistent and indicate some differences between human and mouse autosomal regulation by Xist. Thus, these results are timely and should be published.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Rev3 for the positive remarks and great suggestions. We have amended the manuscript per below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>Regulation of autosomal gene expression by Xist is a &quot;big deal&quot; as misregulation of this lncRNA causes developmental defects and human disease. Moreover, this finding may explain sexspecific developmental differences between the sexes. The results in this manuscript identify specific mouse autosomal genes bound by Xist and decipher critical Xist regions that mediate this binding and gene dampening. The methods used in this study are appropriate, and the overall data presented appear convincing and are consistent, indicating some differences between human and mouse autosomal regulation by Xist.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The figure legends and/or descriptions of data are often very short lacking detail, and this unnecessarily impedes the reading of the manuscript, in particular the figures would benefit not only from more detailed descriptions/explanations of what has been done but also what is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more detailed descriptions in the figure legends and throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This will facilitate the reading and overall comprehension by the reader. One out of many examples: In Fig S1B in the CHART data at d4 and d7 there is not only signal in female WT Xist antisense but also in female sense control. For a reader that is not an expert in XCI it would be helpful to point out in the legend that this signal corresponds to the lncRNA Tsix (I suppose), that is transcribed on the other strand.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent point. We have amended the Results section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Different scales are used in the lower panels of Figures 1A and 2A, which makes it difficult to directly compare signals between the different differentiation stages.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a figure combining all timepoints — d0, d4, d7, and d14 WT female Xist CHART signals — on the X chromosome and autosomes to support our thesis. Please see new Figure 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In this study some of the findings on mouse cells contrast previously published results in human ESCs: (1) Xist binding occurs preferentially to promoters in mice, not in human. (2) Binding of Xist is mostly detected in polycomb-depleted regions in mice but there is a positive correlation between Xist RNA and PRC2 marks in human ESCs. These differences are surprising but may be very interesting and relevant. While I am aware that this might be a difficult task, it would be helpful to experimentally address this issue in order to distinguish whether species specific and/or methodological differences between the studies are responsible for these differences.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, our findings in mouse cells contrast with those observed in humans. As discussed in the manuscript, this discrepancy may be attributed to factors such as cell type, differentiation methods, and the Xist pull-down technique employed (our CHART method utilizes a 20 nt oligo library, whereas RAP uses long oligos). We agree that future work should investigate the underlying causes of these differences between mouse and human systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>For Figure 2: labelling ∆B on the panel A timeline (e.g. d0-∆B) would make the results clearer for the audience. Panel B makes most sense beside panel E of Figure 1, so combine here and skip in Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 2A and thank Rev2 for this suggestion. As for the embedded tables: since we performed peak calling for WT and ∆B separately, we believe that showing both the peak numbers and their corresponding peak patterns provides a clearer representation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I agree that at day 7 there appears to be a difference in X; but by day 14 this looks much more minimal - is it just time-shifted rather than altered? Perhaps this could be discussed. Autosomal binding sites show no change in number.</p></disp-quote><p>Day 7 exhibits the strongest Xist binding on the X chromosome, consistent with the de novo establishment phase of XCI when Xist is expressed at the highest levels 300 copies/cell during de novo XCI versus ~100 copies/cell during maintenance [Sunwoo et al., 2015 as cited]. Per our RNA-seq analysis here, we also observed highest Xist expression on day 7 and reduced levels on day 14 (Fig. S5A). This expression difference explains the reduced Xist CHART levels on day 14 compared to day 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the X has previously been examined, it would seem beneficial to conduct the same expression analyses (Figure 3) for the X (perhaps supplemental), as the authors have the data 'in hand'. I feel comparison to X in the main figure for panels A and B would fit, while a similar analysis for the X for panel C could be supplemental, presumably supporting the published data to which this data is currently compared.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion. Please find the new data in Figures 2E-F and 3D, which demonstrate that the RepB deletion inhibits Xist binding on the X chromosome, resulting in increased X-linked gene expression, as previously mentioned. Since Xist binds across the X chromosome, we did not perform peak calling as we did for the autosomes. Therefore, applying a similar analysis as in Figures 3A-B may not be appropriate in this case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Such a direct comparison to X-data from the same study would be important. For panel H: How many replicates (2)? This should be in the legend. What is the change in median expression? Again, a supplemental figure showing impact on X-linked targets would be useful. Do male and female ESCs show an expression difference prior to differentiation (ie d0)? The data underlying this Figure should be in one of the supplementary tables, showing the full statistical tests and average change. The supplementary tables 8-12 list the WT target genes, not expression differences with the deletion. Again, given that the difference appears transient, might the ∆B cells be altered in rate of differentiation?</p></disp-quote><p>Panel H (revised Figure 3G) includes two replicates, and this has been added to the legends. We have provided a supplementary figure demonstrating that RepB increases the expression levels of X-linked genes on days 4, 7, and 14 (revised Figure 3D). Male and female ESCs show differences in the expression of X-linked genes, as both X chromosomes are active in females at this stage prior to differentiation (revised Figure S5C).</p><p>A supplementary table with statistical tests and average change information has been included in our revised version (Table S11).</p><p>On the other hand, these Xist-autosomal target genes displayed no significant differences between WT male, female, or ∆B female cells on day 0 — prior to onset of XCI and Xist expression. Please see new Figure 3H.</p><p>As for whether ∆B cells are altered in their rate of differentiation, the analysis by Colognori et al. 2019 indicates that ∆B cells differentiate similarly to WT cells. (In Figure 6 of Colognori et al. 2019, autosomal genes expressed similarly in WT and ∆B cells, whereas XCI is affected only in ∆B cells)</p><p>We have also modified the legends for our supplementary tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why were the transgene lines examined upon neuronal differentiation rather than the same approach as in Figures 1-3? I would have thought neuronal differentiation might be more similar to d14, where limited changes remain? Could the authors clarify and discuss?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The Tg lines in Figure 4 came from a previously published study. We performed reanalysis of published datasets because we wanted to test whether — in the hands of other investigators — cell lines expressing Xist also supported autosomal targeting. Here we examined Tg1 and Tg2, which respond to doxycycline to overexpress Xist from an ectopic site. Transcriptomic analysis showed significant downregulation of autosomal Xist targets, as exemplified by <italic>Bcl7b</italic> and <italic>Rbm14</italic> (Figure 4C and S9B). In contrast, non-targets of Xist such as <italic>Stau1</italic> did not demonstrate significant changes in gene expression (Figure 4E and 4F). Looking across all autosomal target genes, we observed a significant decrease in mean expression in the Xist overexpressing cell lines (Figure 4D). The fact that the autosomal changes were also observed in datasets generated by other investigators greatly strengthen our conclusions. We have clarified this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 - the legend should specify the number of replicates and clarify the blue/green (intuitive, but not specified). Are the 'target' / 'non-target' genes from d4 Chart (but the RNA from d5)? How are 'non-targets' defined - do they match the 'targets' in certain criteria (expression level, chromatin features, GC content)? Do they change per differentiation protocol?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the legends to clarify that the 'target' and 'non-target' genes are derived from the day 4 CHART-seq data, while the RNA data is from day 5, as that study sequenced day 5 and not day 4. Non-targets were randomly chosen based on (i) the absence of Xist binding and (ii) similar expression levels. Please see revised Figure S8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to compare Xist expression levels across the various models, and the MEF model could be better described - are they polyploid as often happens?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the Xist expression levels of ES cells and MEF cells in the revised version (revised Figure S5A, 6D). The transformed MEFs are indeed tetraploid, as is typical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For 6A to be informative, one needs to know % mapping to X in ES timeline, which is in supplemental, so perhaps 6A should also be supplemental?</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved 6A to the supplemental figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is odd that ∆B seems to have had more impact in MEFs, and I would like more discussion - but I also think I am missing something: &quot;We observed that Xist signals were more substantially reduced on both the Xi and autosomal regions in ΔRepE MEFs compared to ΔRepB cells&quot;, yet in lower panel 6 G it looks like ∆B is LOWER than ∆E? Am I misinterpreting?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusing writing. The revised text now reads: “To investigate, we utilized a deletion of Xist’s Repeat E (∆RepE), which was previously demonstrated to severely abrogate localization of Xist to the Xi 41,42. We reasoned that the severe loss of Xist binding might unmask a transcriptomic difference. As expected, we observed that Xist signals were somewhat more reduced on the Xi in ΔRepE MEFs compared to ΔRepB cells (Figure 6E-6F). Despite this reduction, peak coverages in autosomal target genes did not increase in ΔRepE MEFs (Figure 6E-6F). However, there was an overall decrease in the number of significant autosomal peaks in ∆RepE MEFs relative to WT cells (Figure 6A). Regardless, we observed no significant transcriptomic differences in ∆RepE MEFs relative to WT MEFs (Figure 7A-7E). Additionally, further examination of RNA sequencing data from male and female MEF cells in two published studies 43,44 corroborated that the expression levels of these autosomal Xist targets did not exhibit significant changes (Figure 7F and 7G). Altogether, the analysis in MEFs demonstrates that Xist continues to bind autosomal genes in post-XCI somatic cells. However, autosomal binding of Xist in post-XCI cells does not overtly impact expression of the associated autosomal genes. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude more subtle changes that do not meet the significance cut-off.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I would like to see how consistent these autosomal peaks are - I shudder to suggest Venn diagrams, but something to show whether there are day/lineage specific peaks and/or ∆repeat B/E resistant peaks.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present Venn diagrams comparing MEF, ES_d4, and ES_d7, showing approximately 50% overlap between MEF and ES cells (revised Figure S10B). This may be expected, as each timepoint is a different developmental stage of XCI, with expected gene expression differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Very minor comments:</p><p>It would be easier if the supplemental tables were tabs in 1 file!</p></disp-quote><p>We will defer to the editor on how best to format the supplemental tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar to the text, could gene names be included in the supplemental?</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided gene names in the supplemental files.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 legend: should 'representing' be representative?</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Xist patterns identified in human cells&quot; p 5; it is challenging to follow human versus mouse, so specify or ensure correct use of XIST/Xist Indeed, we edited the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Gene names should be italicized.</p><p>We have italicized gene names in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ref. 38 lacks details (...).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Peak-like characters - perhaps characteristics?
