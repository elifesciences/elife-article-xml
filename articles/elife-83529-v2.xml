Lphn2 acts as a repulsive receptor in distal CA1 neurons to direct their axons to the proximal subiculum, and as a repulsive ligand in the proximal subiculum to direct proximal CA1 axons to the distal subiculum. It remains unclear if Lphn2-mediated intracellular signaling is required for its role in either context. Here, we show that Lphn2 couples to Gα<sub>12/13</sub> in heterologous cells; this coupling is increased by constitutive exposure of the tethered agonist. Specific mutations of Lphn2’s tethered agonist region disrupt its G protein coupling and autoproteolytic cleavage, whereas mutating the autoproteolytic cleavage site alone prevents cleavage but preserves a functional tethered agonist. Using an in vivo misexpression assay, we demonstrate that wild-type Lphn2 misdirects proximal CA1 axons to the proximal subiculum and that Lphn2 tethered agonist activity is required for its role as a repulsive receptor in axons. By contrast, neither tethered agonist activity nor autoproteolysis were necessary for Lphn2’s role as a repulsive ligand in the subiculum target neurons. Thus, tethered agonist activity is required for Lphn2-mediated neural circuit assembly in a context-dependent manner.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The complex brain circuits that allow animals to sense and interact with their environment start to form early during development. Throughout this period, neurons extend fiber-like projections to establish precise wiring patterns. Various types of proteins at the surface of both incoming fibers and target cells ensure that only the right partners will connect together.</p><p>Latrophilin-2, for example, is a neuronal surface protein essential for the formation of accurate connections in the hippocampus, a brain region important for memory. Studded through the membrane of certain neurons, it acts as a signal-sending ligand to direct incoming fibers, with neurons that carry Latrophilin-2 repelling projections from cells that display certain protein partners.</p><p>At the same time, Latrophilin-2 also allows neurons to receive chemical signals by working with intracellular signaling proteins known as G proteins, which help to relay information between cells. It remained unclear how this role as a signalling receptor participates in the wiring of the hippocampus during development.</p><p>To explore this question, Pederick, Perry-Hauser et al. examined the impact of Latrophilin-2 on the connection patterns of mouse hippocampal neurons that do not normally carry this protein. Introducing Latrophilin-2 into these ‘proximal CA1 cells’ misdirected them away from their usual partners – unless Latrophilin-2 was altered so that it could not interact with G proteins. In contrast, forcing the connecting partners of CA1 cells to display normal or altered versions of Latrophilin-2 did not interfere with the protein acting as a repulsive ligand. Taken together, these results suggest that the ability of Latrophilin-2 to signal through G proteins is important for neurons that are attempting to project their fibers onto other cells, but not important when Latrophilin-2 acts in targets to direct incoming fibers from other neurons.</p><p>These results show that a single protein can shape neural circuits by acting both as a signal-receiving receptor and a signal-sending ligand depending on the context. In the future, Pederick, Perry-Hauser et al. hope that their findings will shed new light on how the wiring of the brain is disrupted in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuronal circuit assembly</kwd><kwd>G protein signaling</kwd><kwd>latrophilin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-MH015144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perry-Hauser</surname><given-names>Nicole A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS050835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Liqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH54137</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Javitch</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006346</institution-id><institution>Hope for Depression Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Javitch</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30EY012196</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Zhigang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Latrophilin-2 G protein coupling is required in axons but not target neurons for neural circuit assembly in the mouse hippocampus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Latrophilins (Lphn1–3) are highly expressed in the brain and were originally identified as responders to ɑ-latrotoxin, a neurotoxin from black widow spider venom that causes the profound release of neurotransmitters from nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davletov et al., 1996</xref>).

While hippocampal <italic>Lphn2</italic> is preferentially expressed in the distal CA1 and the proximal subiculum, <italic>Ten3</italic> is enriched in the proximal CA1 and the distal subiculum. These expression patterns and reciprocal repulsions mediated by Ten3-Lphn2 interactions instruct proximal CA1 axons to target the distal subiculum, and more distal CA1 axons to target more proximal subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, Lphn2 acts as a ‘receptor’ in more distal CA1 axons that is repelled by Ten3 expressed from the distal subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At the same time, Lphn2 acts as a repulsive ‘ligand’ in the proximal subiculum to repel Ten3-expressing (Ten3+) proximal CA1 axons; this action requires Lphn2’s teneurin-binding domain but not its FLRT-binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pederick et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, Lphn2 is required cell autonomously as a receptor in more distal CA1 axons for their precise target selection, and non-autonomously in target neurons as a ligand for precise target selection of proximal CA1 axons.

Here, we modified our previous hippocampal model to develop an Lphn2 misexpression assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We misexpressed Lphn2 in either CA1 axons or the subiculum target and assessed the impact on normal proximal CA1→distal subiculum axon targeting. We found that ectopically expressing wild-type Lphn2 in proximal CA1 axons causes their mistargeting to the proximal subiculum. This provided us with a robust platform to interrogate whether tethered agonist activity or autoproteolytic cleavage is required for axon mistargeting in this Lphn2 ectopic expression system. When misexpressed in CA1, Lphn2 tethered-agonist activity was required for Lphn2-mediated axon mistargeting. By contrast, when we misexpressed Lphn2 in subiculum target neurons, both tethered agonist activity and autoproteolysis were dispensable for Lphn2-mediated axon repulsion. Thus, our data support that Lphn2 G-protein coupling is required in axons but not target neurons during precise circuit assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Misexpression of wild-type Lphn2 in proximal CA1 leads to axon mistargeting in the subiculum</title><p>To investigate the role of Lphn2-mediated G protein activity in hippocampal axon targeting, we first designed a gain-of-function assay in which we misexpressed Lphn2 in proximal CA1 neurons. We hypothesized that this ectopic expression would cause proximal CA1 axons to avoid the Ten3+ distal subiculum and incorrectly target the proximal subiculum. If so, this platform could provide us with an assay to test Lphn2 mutants with defects in various functions to determine whether wild-type Lphn2 mistargeting is compromised.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we used a dual injection strategy to ectopically express Lphn2 in proximal CA1 and trace its axons into the subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At postnatal day 0 (P0), lentivirus expressing <italic>Cre</italic> (LV-Cre) (control) or Cre-Lphn2 (LV-Cre-P2A-Lphn2) was injected into proximal CA1, followed by injection of a Cre-dependent membrane-bound mCherry (AAV-DIO-mCherry) into proximal CA1 in the same mice at approximately P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We confirmed the expression of Lphn2 in CA1 axons by the presence of FLAG immunostaining in the subiculum and that ectopic expression levels were higher than that of endogenous Lphn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, C and D</xref>). As expected, in control animals (Cre), Cre expressing (Cre+) proximal CA1 axons targeted the most distal parts of the subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). By contrast, when Lphn2 was misexpressed in proximal CA1 (Cre-Lphn2), Cre+ proximal CA1 axons targeted the most proximal parts of the subiculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). To analyze the location of proximal CA1 axons in the subiculum, we calculated the fraction of axon intensity within thirds of the subiculum across the proximal/distal axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Proximal CA1 axons misexpressing Lphn2 are located significantly more in the proximal third of the subiculum and significantly less in the distal third of the subiculum when compared to control axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p><p>These data supported our hypothesis that ectopic expression of Lphn2 in proximal CA1 axons causes mistargeting to the proximal subiculum. Importantly, the phenotype observed when overexpressing Lphn2 in pCA1 axons is more severe than that observed when Ten3 is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berns et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that mistargeting is not caused by disruption of Ten3 expression alone. Having established the effect of wild-type Lphn2 misexpression in proximal CA1 axons, we next sought to characterize G protein coupling of wild-type Lphn2 and generate Lphn2 mutants to test the requirement of G protein signaling in Lphn2 mediated neural circuit assembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Lphn2 signals through Gα<sub>12/13</sub></title><p>The G protein interaction partners for Lphn2 have not been previously established. We recently showed that Lphn3, another member of the latrophilin family of aGPCRs, couples principally to Gα<sub>12/13</sub>, and also more weakly to Gα<sub>q</sub>, using a combination of gene expression assays and an activation strategy that permitted acute exposure of the tethered agonist in a live-cell system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mathiasen et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, we began our signaling characterization of Lphn2 similarly using a wild-type full-length Lphn2 construct, and a constitutively active construct termed Lphn2-CTF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The wild-type Lphn2 construct comprises all extracellular elements including the RBL, OLF, HRM, and GAIN domains, in addition to the seven transmembrane helix domain. The Lphn2-CTF lacks the entire NTF up to the GPS and instead has only a methionine residue before the tethered agonist. We tested the expression of these constructs in mammalian cells using immunoblotting and showed that both full-length Lphn2 and Lphn2-CTF ran at the expected truncated position (~72 kDa) suggesting that full-length Lphn2 undergoes normal proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In our assay design, SRE action is coupled to the transcription and translation of firefly luciferase; this readout is then normalized to the control reporter, <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase, expressed from the same plasmid under a constitutive promoter. We found that Lphn2-CTF significantly enhanced signaling over wild-type Lphn2 for SRE gene expression at varying levels of cDNA transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since the SRE assay reports on signaling by Gα<sub>12/13</sub> as well as Gα<sub>q</sub> we tested whether Gα<sub>12/13</sub> or Gα<sub>q</sub> was the primary contributor to this response using a selective Gα<sub>q</sub> inhibitor, YM-254890 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not observe a significant effect upon the addition of the inhibitor, suggesting that Lphn2 signals through Gα<sub>12/13</sub>.</p><p>To verify our result in the context of acute G protein activation, we next tested how tethered agonist exposure affects G protein activation in a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We designed a synthetically-activatable Lphn2 construct based on a recent publication that took advantage of the protease enterokinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lizano et al., 2021</xref>). Enterokinase selectively recognizes the trypsinogen substrate sequence DDDDK and cleaves after the lysine residue, thereby exposing the native tethered agonist. Thus, we cloned an Lphn2 construct that included a modified hemagglutinin signal peptide, the P2Y12 N-terminal extracellular sequence (amino acids 1–24), a flexible linker (GGSGGSGGS), the enterokinase recognition site (DYKDDDDK), and the truncated Lphn2-CTF sequence. We tested this construct in a Gβγ-release assay where energy transfer was monitored between the membrane-anchored luminescent donor, GRK3-ct-Rluc8, and the fluorescent acceptor, Gγ-Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hollins et al., 2009</xref>).

As expected, in the absence of Gα subunits no BRET signal was observed; however, when Gα<sub>12</sub> or Gα<sub>13</sub> was re-introduced to cells expressing the Lphn2 construct there was a significant increase in the BRET signal upon treatment with enterokinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This increase was not observed upon co-expression of the receptor with Gα<sub>s</sub>, Gα<sub>i1,</sub> or Gα<sub>q</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the increase in cAMP reported previously for the Lphn2 CTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sando and Südhof, 2021</xref>) may not result from the direct activation of Gα<sub>s</sub>, but rather from some other form of signaling crosstalk. Alternatively, it is possible that our <italic>Lphn2,</italic> which was isolated from the P8 hippocampus and lacks exons 19 and 20, may represent a different transcript variant in the brain that activates distinct signaling pathways.

First, we showed that Lphn2 misexpression can cell-autonomously misdirect proximal CA1 axons to the proximal subiculum, establishing an assay to test the requirements of Lphn2 G protein signaling when it acts as a receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, we identified the G protein interaction partners of Lphn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and validated point mutations that disrupt tethered agonist activity and/or autoproteolysis of the GPS region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of Lphn2 G protein signaling during precise circuit assembly in a context-specific manner. Our results also support that while aGPCR GPS cleavage is dispensable for Lphn2’s role as a receptor to direct axon targeting, an intact tethered agonist is essential.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of autoproteolytic cleavage and tethered agonism in aGPCR activation</title><p>Upon aGPCR biosynthesis, the conserved GAIN domain undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage at the GPS to generate N- and C-terminal fragments that remain non-covalently bound during trafficking to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araç et al., 2012</xref>). Crystal structures of GAIN domains from Lphn1 and ADGRB3 (BAI3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araç et al., 2012</xref>), ADGRG1 (GPR56) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Salzman et al., 2016</xref>), and ADGRG6 (GPR126) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leon et al., 2020</xref>), revealed that in an intact aGPCR, the tethered agonist is buried as a β-strand in the GAIN domain, forming an extensive network of conserved hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic side chains. This suggests that when the complex between aGPCR’s NTF and CTF remains intact the tethered agonist is inaccessible for engagement with its binding site in the 7TM domain. However, several studies have reported that naturally cleavage-resistant aGPCRs can still function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liebscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilde et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that the tethered agonist can in fact interact with the 7TM independent of cleavage, although the efficacy of this interaction is likely to be diminished, as we see in the present study. Thus, the relative contributions and/or necessity of autoproteolytic cleavage and the tethered agonist to aGPCR activity remain an area of active study.</p><p>Recent efforts reported the structures of eight aGPCRs, seven of which were truncated up to the GPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barros-Álvarez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ping et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>). While most discussions from the structural aGPCR studies argued that NTF dissociation is required for tethered agonist interaction with the receptor, the structure of autoproteolysis-deficient ADGRF1 supported the possibility of the cleavage-independent manner of receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qu et al., 2022</xref>). The density for the tethered agonist of ADGRF1 was well-resolved and bound in an α-helical structure within the orthosteric site of the 7TM bundle. This interaction was like that of the cleaved structures, and ADGRF1 was also observed to be bound to a miniG<sub>i1</sub>, supporting that receptor cleavage and tethered agonist exposure are not absolutely required for G protein coupling. One caveat, however, is that there is little density for the NTF in this structure, suggesting that the structure obtained may result from a fraction of receptor where cleavage has still occurred and the NTF has dissociated.</p><p>As mentioned above, not all aGPCRs are auto-proteolytically cleaved; therefore, activation cannot be fully dependent on tethered agonist exposure through the removal of the NTF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kishore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liebscher et al., 2022</xref>). In this regard, it is possible that full-length aGPCRs exist in multiple conformational states that include receptor molecules in which the tethered agonist is unmasked from the GAIN domain. In fact, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of spontaneous tethered agonist exposure were recently reported for five intact aGPCR homologs (ADGRB3, ADGRE2, ADGRE5, ADGRG1, and Lphn1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beliu et al., 2021</xref>). Here, the authors show that tethered agonist exposure occurs due to the high intrinsic flexibility of the GAIN domain. They also used biorthogonal labeling of conserved positions within the tethered agonist to show that large portions (+6 residues) of the tethered agonist can become solvent accessible in the context of the GAIN domain. They argue that tethered agonist exposure likely occurs in a stepwise mechanism where the tethered agonist is uncovered along its N→C axis. Thus, it is possible that an intact complex of aGPCR’s NTF and CTF could unmask the tethered agonist sufficiently for interaction with the 7TM, resulting in receptor activation.</p><p>The ability of tethered agonist exposure to occur in intact aGPCRs could provide an explanation for why our Lphn2_T829G mutant displays a partial axon mistargeting phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Even though the Lphn2_T829G mutant cannot undergo autoproteolytic cleavage, it still retains a functional tethered agonist that is able to initiate G protein signaling if transiently unmasked. This is likely why activation of full-length Lphn2_T829G is less robust than the wild-type Lphn2, which can more readily unmask the TA. We also cannot rule out the possibility that a small amount of cleavage, although undetectable in the HEK cells immunoblotting, nonetheless contributes to the partial mistargeting phenotype in vivo.</p><p>Like the Lphn2_T829G mutant, Lphn2_F831A/M835A cannot undergo autoproteolytic cleavage. However, this mutant also has impaired G protein coupling activity even with full exposure of the TA. This explains why we observed close-to-normal axon targeting when we overexpressed Lphn2_F831A/M835A in proximal CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Even if the tethered agonist of Lphn2_F831A/M835A becomes unmasked it still cannot initiate tethered agonist-mediated receptor. However, given the statistically significant difference in total axon intensity in dSub between control and Lphn2_F831A/M835A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), we cannot rule out some residual tethered agonist-independent, G protein-mediated signaling or an Lphn2 function independent of G protein signaling, at least in the context of overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implication of Lphn2 signaling in neural circuit assembly</title><p>How could Lphn2-mediated G protein signaling in the CA1 axons lead to axon repulsion? We show here that Lphn2 primarily signals through Gα<sub>12</sub> and Gα<sub>13</sub> in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Gα<sub>12</sub>/Gα<sub>13</sub> are known to regulate Rho GTPase; for example, Gα<sub>13</sub> binds to and activates p115RhoGEF, an exchange factor for and activator of the small GTPase RhoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kozasa et al., 2011</xref>). RhoA activation is known to cause growth cone collapse and neuronal process retraction via its regulation of the actin-myosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spillane and Gallo, 2014</xref>). Thus, if Lphn2 coupling to Gα12/Gα13 also applies to CA1 neurons, as suggested by our results in heterologous cells, Gα12/Gα13→RhoGEF→RhoA may be a plausible pathway for Lphn2 to mediate its function as a receptor for axon repulsion.</p><p>Interestingly, neither autoproteolytic cleavage nor tethered agonist activity is required for Lphn2 to act cell non-autonomously as a repulsive ligand in subiculum target neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This suggests that cleavage of Lphn2 is not required for repulsion in this context and implies that another mechanism mediates the disassembly of the extracellular binding complex, which is required for retracting axons to pull away from the targets. Other potential mechanisms to disassemble the extracellular binding complex include Ten3 cleavage (teneurins are known to also undergo proteolytic cleavage at its extracellular domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sita et al., 2019</xref>), endocytosis of the adhesion complex as in the case of ephrin/Eph receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egea and Klein, 2007</xref>), or forces produced by actin-myosin contractility in axon terminals induced by repulsive signaling. Indeed, since Lphn2 also acts as a repulsive ligand and Ten3 as a repulsive receptor, extracellular binding of Lphn2 to Ten3 should also trigger a repulsive response in Ten3+ axon terminals, but the signaling mechanism is completely unknown. Future studies on the mechanisms that disassemble the extracellular complex and intracellular signaling in the axon downstream of Ten3 will increase our understanding of how the interaction of these two molecules can lead to repulsive outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

All mice that fulfilled these criteria are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and were included in quantifications. Images of injection sites (5x magnification) and projections (10x magnification) were acquired for every other 60 μm sagittal section using a Zeiss epifluorescence scope. Due to variations in injection sites within each mouse, exposure was adjusted for each mouse to avoid saturation. Fluorescence intensity measurements on unprocessed images were taken using FIJI and data processing was performed using MATLAB.</p><p>For injection site quantification, a 30-pixel-wide segmented line was drawn from proximal CA1 to distal CA1 using the DAPI signal as a guide. For projection quantification in the subiculum, a 200-pixel-wide segmented line was drawn from the proximal subiculum to the distal subiculum through the cell body layer using only DAPI as a guide. From this point, injection site and projection images were processed the same. Segmented lines were straightened using the ‘Straighten’ function, background subtraction was performed using the ‘Subtract’ function and intensity values were measured using the ‘Plot Profile’ command (FIJI). For injections that labeled both CA2 and proximal CA1, CA2 axons were present near the distal border of CA1 and spilled into the proximal subiculum. These axons had their intensity set to zero by using area selection and the clear function (FIJI). The intensity plots were resampled into 100 equal bins using a custom MATLAB code.</p><p>For trace quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> the axon intensity was combined for all sections by summing all intensity values at each binned position. To calculate the fraction of axon intensity across proximal, mid, and distal subiculum the total axon intensity in bins 1–33, 34–66, and 67–100 were summed, respectively. The summed value from each of these regions was then divided by the total sum of axons from bins 1–100 to obtain the fraction of axons intensity within the proximal, mid, and distal subiculum. Fractions of axon intensities were compared using a two-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparisons tests using Prism 9 (GraphPad). The mean position of the injection sites was calculated by generating a summed intensity trace as above and then multiplying the intensity value by the bin position, summing across the entire axis, and dividing by the sum of the intensity values. Representative images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) were taken using a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope (20×magnification, tile scan, max projection).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the experimental and data analysis procedures were identical to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pederick et al., 2021</xref> and, therefore, we used <italic>LV-GFP</italic> and <italic>LV-GFP-P2A-Lphn2-FLAG</italic> from that study to compare with <italic>LV-GFP-P2A-Lphn2_F831A/M831A-FLAG</italic> and <italic>LV-GFP-P2A-Lphn2_T828G-FLAG</italic> data generated from this study.</p><p>To quantify average axon intensity in GFP+ and adjacent GFP– regions in subiculum targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), we restricted the analysis to the most distal 20% of the subiculum. To determine the GFP+ region we identified the intensity-weighted central row using the summed fluorescence of each row and determined the minimal symmetric window of rows around the central row that encompassed at least 50% of the total intensity in the restricted GFP image. This defined a rectangle in the original image that we designated as the GFP+ region. We then computed the mean fluorescence intensity in this region for the mCh channel. We used the two rows above and below (lateral and medial) the designated GFP+ region as the adjacent GFP– region and computed the mean mCh fluorescence across these four rows. To determine mCh fluorescence differences in GFP+ versus GFP– regions, we divided the mCh intensity in the GFP+ region by the mCh intensity in the GFP– region for each mouse (i.e. GFP+/GFP–). mCh fluorescence intensity GFP+/GFP– was compared across groups using a one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons tests using Prism 9 (GraphPad). Three-dimensional mountain plots were generated using the ‘surf’ function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification of overexpressed Lphn2 in CA1</title><p>P0 neonatal injections into CA1 and immunostaining were performed as stated above. 16-bit images were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Imager Z2 confocal microscope.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yimin Zou (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Examine ectopic Lphn2 expression, including the F831A/M835M mutant, and its impact on endogenous Ten3 expression.</p><p>2) Confirmation of Lphn2 localization in axons.</p><p>3) Clarify in the text that the presented results strongly suggest, but do not necessarily prove, that Lphn2 specifically couples with G-α 12/13 signaling in CA1, as this link has only been demonstrated in heterologous cells.</p><p>The authors can also consider the remaining reviewer comments, though these were not deemed to be essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 1—figure supplement 1: The F831A/M835A mutant expression looks qualitatively and quantitatively different from wt Lphn2 and T829G mutant (i.e., lower expression). If this is truly a representative image, it is problematic for interpreting these experiments since this is the mutant that fails to induce axon mistargeting. Could a more representative image be found? Or can the authors explain why this is not a problem?</p><p>– Figure 2B, 3B, 4A: The western blots in these figures contain many bands in addition to the expected cleaved and uncleaved Lphn2 protein. Do the authors have an explanation for this? Is this the result of Lphn2 proteolysis or aggregation? Can the western blot be cleaned up?</p><p>– Figure 5: Were all of the experiments in Figure 5 done at the same time? It seems that if any significant time passed between the experiments shown in 5B/C and 5D/E, then the latter pair are uncontrolled. (See legend to Figure 5. where the authors state that data from 5 B and C are from a previous publication).</p><p>– Figure 2-4. While these experiments convincingly show that Lphn2 can couple to Gα12/13 in heterologous cells, it is possible that they do not in neurons, or that they do in subiculum, but not (as expected) in CA1. As mentioned in the public review, the finding in this manuscript that Lphn2 signaling is context-dependent underscores the importance of this issue. While it is not reasonable to request a repeat of all the BRET experiments in neurons, much less in vivo, providing some type of evidence that Lphn2 couples to Gα12/13 in CA1 would strengthen this manuscript substantially. This could be done in a number of ways, including:</p><p>– Showing an interaction between Lphn2 and Gα12/13 (testing for other G-proteins) in neurons or in hippocampus via co-immunoprecipitation.</p><p>– Demonstrating an Lphn2-mediated increase in RhoA in neurons or hippocampus.</p><p>– Inhibiting RhoA and demonstrating that the ability of Lphn2 to redirect axons is compromised.</p><p>– Creating an Lphn2 mutant that does not interact with Gα12/13 and testing its ability to redirect axons.</p><p>– Creating an Lphn2 chimera that interacts with a different G-protein and tests its ability to redirect axons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific recommendations related to presentation of data:</p><p>– Figure 1A – unclear what unlabeled red objects are meant to represent.</p><p>– Figure 2B/C -It's not clear to the specificity of Flag detection in the shown western blots. Could benefit from providing a negative control alongside Lphn2 transfected cells.</p><p>– Figure 2E – Graph is labelled &quot;enterokinase-induced BRET&quot;, but enterokinase is only added to Lphn2 assay, correct? Signaling induction is relatively weak in comparison to their &quot;control&quot; Endothelin receptor, but this is activated by optimized ligand ET-1 induction. Based on this presentation, it is unclear as to the rationale for focus on Gq/G12/G13 signaling activation. Supplemental figure 2 better demonstrates G-protein selectivity, and as such would suggest remodeling main figure to include this data.</p><p>– Figure 3- From the quantifications, it appears that the mutant blocks GPCR signaling, but still has an impact on the axon targeting specificity. This suggests that there are GPCR signaling independent mechanisms that are also at work? This is briefly mentioned in the text, but could use additional discussion. Additionally, representative images of subiculum targeting for all conditions are not included, and should be provided.</p><p>– Figure 5 – Lack of representative images makes it difficult to assess quality and interpretability of experiment.</p><p>– Supplemental Figure 2S2 – Panel B mislabeled D1R?

We found there to be no significant differences between expression levels after accounting for the injection efficiency.</p><p>Briefly, we injected <italic>LV-GFP-P2A-Lphn2-FLAG</italic>, <italic>LV-GFP-P2A-Lphn2_F831A/M835A-FLAG</italic> or <italic>LVGFP-P2A-Lphn2_T829G-FLAG</italic> into CA1 and quantified mean expression of GFP in CA1 cell body layer and mean expression of Lphn2, via FLAG, in the molecular layer of CA1. To account for injection variation, we calculated the amount of FLAG staining relative to GFP in the same section. We found no significant differences between Lphn2, Lphn2_F831A/M835A and Lphn2_T829G. Representative images and quantification can be found in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B.</p><p>In addition, we performed immunostaining with a Lphn2 antibody that detects both overexpressed and endogenous Lphn2. We found that the laser power required to visualize endogenous Lphn2 in the molecular layer of CA1 was ~19x of that required to observed overexpressed wild-type and mutant Lphn2. This suggests that even with variations of injection efficiency, the levels of overexpressed Lphn2 are likely substantially above that of endogenous Lphn2. Representative images can be found in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-D.</p><p>b) Does ectopic expression of Lphn2 impact endogenous expression of Ten3?</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and agree that it is an important question. We performed additional experiments to address this, but unfortunately technical limitations prevented us from reaching a clear-cut conclusion.</p><p>Ten3 immunostaining in CA1 is located within the molecular layer and is contributed both by Ten3 from proximal CA1 dendrites and from medial entorhinal cortex axons. This makes it extremely difficult to determine if changes in Ten3 protein are related to CA1 dendrites or invading axons. We previously showed that ectopic expression of Lphn2 causes repulsion of Ten3 axons, which would lead to a decrease of Ten3 immunostaining due to the absence of Ten3 positive axons. Therefore, by looking at Ten3 protein in the molecular layer we cannot determine if ectopic expression of Lphn2 impacts local expression of Ten3 or Ten3 expression from invading axons.</p><p>To overcome this issue, we aimed to analyze Ten3 expression in the cell body layer of CA1.</p><p>Unfortunately, we found that expression levels assayed by Ten3 antibody staining were very low in the cell body layer and comparable to background staining. This was also true even after performing Ten3 antibody adsorption on <italic>Ten3</italic> knockout brain sections.</p><p>Although we cannot rule out that Lphn2 ectopic expression cell-autonomously impacts Ten3 protein, we want to clarify that the proximal CA1 axon targeting phenotypes between Lphn2 OE and Ten3 KO conditions are different. When Ten3 is deleted from pCA1 axons in Ten3 conditional or whole animal knockout, pCA1 axons spread more proximally in subiculum while retaining reduced level in distal subiculum, compared to being restricted to distal subiculum in control animals. In contrast, when Lphn2 is ectopically expressed in pCA1 the axons completely shift and almost entirely target the most proximal part of subiculum.</p><p>The more severe mistargeting of pCA1 axons observed with Lphn2 overexpression compared to Ten3 KO suggests that the phenotype observed when Lphn2 is overexpressed in pCA1 axons is not due to impacting Ten3 expression alone. We have clarified this in the revised text (page 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Confirmation of Lphn2 localization in axons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed that FLAG staining is present in CA1 axons that target the subiculum in wild type Lphn2 and both mutant conditions.

Can the western blot be cleaned up?</p></disp-quote><p>To address Reviewer 1’s concerns about the quality of the immunoblots, we re-ran the experiment alongside an empty vector control. We also treated the samples for 1 hr with PNGase F (NEB, P0704S), an enzyme that removes <italic>N</italic>-linked oligosaccharides from proteins, to collapse bands with heterogeneous glycosylation and thereby “clean up” the blot. We observed that some of the additional bands in the gel were also present in the empty vector transfected cell line, suggesting that these were nonspecific interactions with our primary antibody. The new blots are found in Figure 2B, Figure 3B, Figure 4A, and Figure 2–4 – Source Data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 5: Were all of the experiments in Figure 5 done at the same time?

We did not repeat the experiments shown in 5B/C as these experiments, involving matching two injections performed at different developmental stages, are very inefficient and take a large number of animals to complete. In addition, the data analysis is performed with internal normalization for each animal, where we assess the amount of mCh fluorescence in GFP-positive and GFP-negative areas for each animal.</p><p>All experimental and analysis steps were kept the same regardless of when the experiments were performed.</p><p>For the above reasons we thought it was unnecessary and unethical to repeat these control experiments in new animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2-4.

We acknowledge that using heterologous cell lines comes with limitations, as there may be context related differences in signaling that emerge in neurons. For this revision, we have clarified that our in vitro findings are suggestive but do not prove this signaling also takes place in vivo (see our response to Essential Revision #3). We strongly agree that studying signaling in neurons and even better in slice or in vivo is important for the future. Unfortunately performing the additional experiments Reviewer 1 suggested is not straightforward, as we outlined below; however, we are working toward moving our research into a more native system for future efforts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This could be done in a number of ways, including:</p><p>– Showing an interaction between Lphn2 and Gα12/13 (testing for other G-proteins) in neurons or in hippocampus via co-immunoprecipitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Co-immunoprecipitation is unlikely to work for testing Lphn2 interaction with Gα12/13. This is because recruitment of G protein to Lphn2 would require activating the receptor and we currently do not have a way to activate these receptors in vivo. The interaction is also unlikely to be sufficiently stable to persist throughout the necessary purification steps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Demonstrating an Lphn2-mediated increase in RhoA in neurons or hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several commercially-available kits for detecting RhoA activation following pull-down analysis. In brief, these kits use proteins that bind specifically to active RhoA to capture the protein for immunoblot analysis. While it is possible that we could test activation of RhoA in neuronal populations that have Lphn2 and corresponding mutants overexpressed, it will likely require extensive optimization to complete this series of experiments. Furthermore, again we have no way to activate in vivo, so we would only be assessing the impact of overexpression and not receptor activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Inhibiting RhoA and demonstrating that the ability of Lphn2 to redirect axons is compromised.</p></disp-quote><p>This experimental design, while interesting, will take many animals to complete and is outside the scope of the current manuscript. Additionally, RhoA activation is downstream of many different signaling events and it will be difficult to attribute any biological effect directly to Lphn2 G protein signaling. We would also have to consider the experiment above to determine normal RhoA activity and likely RhoA expression prior to making any meaningful conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Creating an Lphn2 mutant that does not interact with Gα12/13 and testing its ability to redirect axons.</p></disp-quote><p>While structural work has revealed coupling information for Gα12- and Gα13-bound Lphn3 (Qian et al., 2022), it is still unclear which mutations/residues selectively activate one pathway over the other. This is something that we are trying to achieve but is beyond the scope of the current study. It is possible that we could fully disrupt G-protein interaction by introducing T4 lysozyme into an intracellular loop or by truncating the cytoplasmic C-terminal sequences; however, this will likely also disrupt other signaling pathways (e.g., arrestin recruitment) and cannot be directly linked to one G protein (12/13) over another (q/s/o/i).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Creating an Lphn2 chimera that interacts with a different G-protein and tests its ability to redirect axons.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, it remains unclear which mutations/residues selectively activate one pathway over another for Lphn2. Thus, this experiment is currently outside the scope of the submitted manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific recommendations related to presentation of data:</p><p>– Figure 1A – unclear what unlabeled red objects are meant to represent.</p></disp-quote><p>The red labels represent our previous finding of repulsive mechanisms that guide CA1 targeting in the subiculum. We have added additional text to the legend of Figure 1 to clarify this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2B/C -It's not clear to the specificity of Flag detection in the shown western blots.

This can be found in Figure 2–4 – Source Data corresponding to the immunoblot. All immunoblots have been replaced with the re-run blot where the samples were treated for 1 hr with PNGase F to collapse bands with heterogenous glycosylation. The unspecified bands in the gel also present in the mock transfected lane likely result from nonspecific interactions with our primary antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2E – Graph is labelled &quot;enterokinase-induced BRET&quot;, but enterokinase is only added to Lphn2 assay, correct?

Supplemental figure 2 better demonstrates G-protein selectivity, and as such would suggest remodeling main figure to include this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for noticing the error in the y-axis of Figure 2E. We have now changed the label to ‘ligand-induced BRET.” We have also added the data for the remaining G proteins to better demonstrate selectivity as suggested. We also want to note that the purpose of the controls was to demonstrate that our experimental setup was working, not to compare signaling induction across receptors. To emphasize that the focus should be on Lphn2 activation, we modified the y-axis to better reflect the Lphn2 data, which clearly shows that G12 and G13 are far more actively activated compared to the other G proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 3- From the quantifications, it appears that the mutant blocks GPCR signaling, but still has an impact on the axon targeting specificity.

In light of this, we have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“However, given the statistically significant difference in total axon intensity in dSub between control and Lphn2_F831A/M835A (Figure 3E), we cannot rule out some residual tethered agonist-independent, G protein-mediated signaling or a Lphn2 function independent of G protein signaling, at least in the context of overexpression.”</p><p>The LV-Cre and LV-Cre_Lphn2 conditions are presented in Figure 1.
