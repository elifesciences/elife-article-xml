disorders. Müller glia (MG), the primary glial cell type in the retina, exhibit extraordinary regenerative abilities in zebrafish, proliferating and differentiating into neurons post-injury. However, the regenerative potential of mouse MG is limited by their inherent inability to re-enter the cell cycle, constrained by high levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and low levels of cyclin D1. Here, we report a method to drive robust MG proliferation by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated cyclin D1 overexpression and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown. MG proliferation induced by this dual targeting vector was self-limiting, as MG re-entered cell cycle only once. As shown by single-cell RNA-sequencing, cell cycle reactivation led to suppression of interferon signaling, activation of reactive gliosis, and downregulation of glial genes in MG. Over time, the majority of the MG daughter cells retained the glial fate, resulting in an expanded MG pool. Interestingly, about 1% MG daughter cells expressed markers for retinal interneurons, suggesting latent neurogenic potential in a small MG subset. By establishing a safe, controlled method to promote MG proliferation in vivo while preserving retinal integrity, this work provides a valuable tool for combinatorial therapies integrating neurogenic stimuli to promote neuron regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>Müller glia</kwd><kwd>cell cycle regulator</kwd><kwd>cyclin D1</kwd><kwd>p27<sup>kip1</sup></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11103819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11102922</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11100723</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>05160276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005847</institution-id><institution>Health and Medical Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>06172466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007567</institution-id><institution>TUNG Biomedical Sciences Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ming Wai Lau Center for Reparative Medicine Research Associate Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel strategy is described for stimulating a large number of Müller glia to proliferate in mice by manipulating cell cycle components without a damage stimulus.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Müller glia (MG) are the last cell type generated by the retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) during development and exhibit a gene expression profile similar to that of late RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Roesch et al., 2012</xref>). In teleost fish and amphibians, MG respond rapidly to retinal injury, undergoing robust proliferation and regenerating lost retinal neurons from MG-derived progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Todd and Reh, 2022b</xref>). In contrast, the proliferative and neurogenic ability of MG in response to injury in mammals is severely limited, failing to mediate retinal self-repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Karl et al., 2008</xref>). Recent investigations have achieved great success in mammalian retinal regeneration by stimulating MG reprogramming through a single or combination of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le et al., 2024a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Le et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Todd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Todd et al., 2022a</xref>). Other studies have shown that the quiescent state of MG can be overridden by upstream signaling pathways such as Wnt and Hippo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>). Activation of Wnt signaling by forced expression of β-catenin in adult mouse MG promoted spontaneous cell cycle re-entry in uninjured retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, it was demonstrated that bypassing the Hippo pathway in mouse MG led to spontaneous re-entry into the cell cycle and reprogramming into a progenitor cell-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that the re-entry of MG into the cell cycle, which is the first step of MG-mediated retinal regeneration in zebrafish, could be unlocked in mammalian retinas.</p><p>The cell cycle of MG is mainly regulated by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins bind to CDKs to form cyclin-CDK complexes to promote cell cycle progression. During retinal development, the expression of D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2, and D3) is tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dyer and Cepko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trimarchi et al., 2008</xref>). Among these, cyclin D1, encoded by the <italic>Ccnd1</italic> gene, is the predominant D-type cyclin in the developing retina and is highly expressed in the RPCs but absent in differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barton and Levine, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trimarchi et al., 2008</xref>). Mice lacking <italic>Ccnd1</italic> have small eyes and hypocellular retinas due to reduced RPC proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fantl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sicinski et al., 1995</xref>), which cannot be compensated by <italic>Ccnd2</italic> and <italic>Ccnd3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Das et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Das et al., 2009</xref>). Negative regulators of the cell cycle are CDK inhibitors (CDKIs), which include the INK4 (p16<sup>INK4a</sup>, p15<sup>INK4b</sup>, p18<sup>INK4c</sup>, and p19<sup>INK4d</sup>) and CIP/KIP families (p21<sup>Cip1</sup>, p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, and p57<sup>Kip2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reynisdóttir et al., 1995</xref>). The CDKIs inhibit cell cycle progression by binding to and inactivating the cyclin-CDK complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Besson et al., 2008</xref>), and they regulate the proliferation in distinct RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dyer and Cepko, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dyer and Cepko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levine et al., 2000</xref>). P27<sup>Kip1</sup> inhibits the cyclin D-CDK complex to enter the S phase. Following acute retinal damage in mice, a very small number of MG re-enter the cell cycle, coincident with the downregulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> or upregulation of cyclin D1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dyer and Cepko, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). However, this process is transient, as cyclin D1 expression rapidly returns to the basal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we propose that targeting the two key regulators of the cell cycle, cyclin D1 and p27<sup>kip1</sup>, can effectively induce MG cell cycle re-entry. Our findings demonstrate that simultaneously reducing p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and increasing cyclin D1 in MG using a single AAV vector has a strong synergistic effect on promoting MG proliferation in uninjured adult mouse retinas. MG proliferation induced by this treatment is robust and self-limiting, as MG undergo a single round of cell division rather than unlimited proliferations. Through single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we observed that cell cycle reactivation leads to the downregulation of the interferon (IFN) pathways in the MG and suppression of the MG genes. By RNA in situ hybridization and immunostaining, we showed that MG partially and temporally suppressed their glial cell fate, while the majority of MG regained the normal glial identify by 4 months post-CCA treatment. A few EdU+ MG daughter cells in the inner nuclear layer (INL) express the bipolar cell marker Otx2 or the amacrine cell marker HuC/D, suggesting rare de novo neurogenesis from MG. Importantly, MG cell cycle reactivation does not disrupt retinal structure or impair retinal function, as the treatment did not deplete the MG from the retina or cause neoplasia. In summary, our results showed that downregulating p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and upregulating cyclin D1 stimulate MG proliferation, and it is possible to combine this approach with other factors that promote regeneration to enhance retinal repair mediated by MG.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simultaneous p27<sup>Kip1</sup> downregulation and cyclin D1 overexpression drive robust MG proliferation in the uninjured mouse retina</title><p>To test the hypothesis that adult mouse MG are kept in a quiescent state by high levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and low levels of cyclin D1, we examined whether spontaneous MG proliferation could be activated by directly changing the levels of these two downstream cell cycle regulators.

In the control retinas that were infected by AAV<sub>7m8</sub>-GFAP-GFP-non-target (NT) shRNA, all MG, which were positive of Sox9 expression, were negative of EdU labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When the retina was infected by AAV<sub>7m8</sub>-GFAP-mCherry-p27 shRNA1, which expressed a highly efficient <italic>p27</italic> shRNA1, a small number of MG cells re-entered the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); however, the vast majority of MG remained in a quiescent state. Overexpressing cyclin D1 alone through AAV<sub>7m8</sub>-GFAP-cyclin D1 infection stimulated a subset of MG cells to proliferate, resulting in a threefold increase in the number of EdU+ MG cells compared to p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Due to the uneven efficiency of AAV infection across the retina, quantification was performed in the region with the highest infection levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, the AAV<sub>7m8</sub>-GFAP-cyclin D1-p27 shRNA1 vector, which simultaneously overexpressed cyclin D1 and suppressed p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, had the most significant impact on MG proliferation, with a fivefold increase in EdU+Sox9+ cells compared to cyclin D1 overexpression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). The differences in MG proliferation across groups were not due to variations in virus infection efficacy, as confirmed by measuring p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown and cyclin D1 overexpression levels by quantitative PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). A transgenic mouse line <italic>Glast<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>; Rosa26<sup>LSL-Sun1:GFP</sup></italic>, in which MG nuclei were labeled by nuclear membrane-bound GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6A–C</xref>), was used to quantify the percentage of MG that re-entered the cell cycle. In the retinal area where viral infection rate was the highest, approximately 45% of Sun1:GFP+ MG were EdU positive, and the total number of MG increased by about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6D–H</xref>), indicating that nearly half of the MG cells re-entered the cell cycle. As the AAV<sub>7m8</sub>-GFAP-cyclin D1-p27 shRNA1 vector enables such robust MG proliferation, we refer to it as the cell cycle activator (CCA) for short.</p><p>Previous research has shown that the ability of retina to regenerate by various stimuli declines with the age of the mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Löffler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ueki et al., 2015</xref>). We compared the efficiency of CCA in driving MG proliferation in young (P28) and older adult mouse (P255-P347) retinas to that in P6 pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Remarkably, MG proliferation induced by CCA remained robust in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These findings suggest that CCA efficiently drives MG proliferation irrespective of the age of the mice. The synergistic effect of cyclin D1 overexpression and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown on MG proliferation suggest that both low levels of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and high levels of cyclin D1 are required for postmitotic MG to re-enter the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MG proliferation driven by CCA is self-limiting</title><p>Concerned that p27<sup>Kip1</sup> suppression and cyclin D1 overexpression may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and retinal tumorigenesis, we analyzed the proliferative capacity of MG driven by CCA. First, we examined the duration of MG proliferation after CCA treatment by a time-course EdU incorporation assay. Starting on various days after the CCA treatment, mice received two injections of EdU to label the cells that were undergoing proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The result revealed that MG proliferation started as quickly as the third day after CCA injection, reached its peak around the fifth day, followed by a gradual decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By 2 weeks post-CCA injection, only a few MG were observed re-entering the cell cycle. Two months post-CCA injection, MG proliferation had mostly ceased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These findings suggest that MG proliferation was largely completed within 2 weeks post-CCA treatment. In addition, an EdU/5-bromo-2' deoxyuridine (BrdU) double-labeling assay was performed to examine whether MG undergoes one or multiple cell divisions after CCA treatment. Five injections of EdU were given from day 1 to 5 post-CCA treatment, followed by five BrdU injections from day 6 to 10 post-CCA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Retinas were collected 1 day after the last BrdU injection to evaluate if any MG continuously entered the S phase of the cell cycle. While there were a number of cells positive for EdU or BrdU, no cells were co-labeled with EdU and BrdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), indicating that no MG underwent two cell divisions. Finally, we utilized the <italic>Glast<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>; Rosa26<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic> mouse line to label MG sparsely with a low dose of tamoxifen induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). At 4 weeks post-CCA injection, we observed either single MG or pairs of MG in close proximity, but no clusters of three or more cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).

Reactive gliosis genes (<italic>Gfap</italic> and <italic>Vim</italic>) were upregulated while other MG genes (<italic>Kcnj10</italic>, <italic>Glul</italic>, <italic>Rlbp1</italic>, and <italic>Aqp4</italic>) were downregulated in the reactivated MG compared with the quiescent MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).

In the CCA-treated retinas, there was a significant expansion in the number of Sox9+ MG cells, distributed across the ONL, OPL, and INL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). The larger population of Sox9+ MG remained to support the retinal structure and homeostasis, which explains the relatively unaffected retinal structure and function observed on the CCA-treated eyes.

The total numbers of Sox+ cells were similar between these two time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), indicating no significant MG loss after MG proliferation. To directly assess whether CCA treatment may lead to the cell death of the MG, especially the MG displaced in the ONL and OPL, we examined the CCA-treated retinas with TUNEL assay and did not observe any obvious TUNEL+ MG at 3 or 6 weeks post-CCA injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since we could only examine cell death at single time points, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that there were small numbers of MG-derived cells dying without being detected.

Previously, it was shown that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by AAV-mediated overexpression of β-catenin stimulates MG proliferation through the Lin28/let7 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>), and cyclin D1 is a direct target gene of both Wnt signaling and Lin28/let7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shtutman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tetsu and McCormick, 1999</xref>). Suppression of the Hippo pathway by transgenic expression of YAP<sup>5SA</sup>, a dominant-active form of YAP, induces MG proliferation, accompanied by an increase in cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>). However, the Hippo and Wnt pathways have downstream genes besides cyclin D1 and serve different cellular functions. It remains unclear whether cyclin D1 activation is necessary or sufficient to drive MG proliferation in these contexts. In this study, we demonstrate that cyclin D1 overexpression alone leads to limited MG proliferation and that the combination of cyclin D1 overexpression and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> knockdown is the most potent strategy to drive MG proliferation in mouse retina without injury stimulus.</p><p>Our results showed that CCA effectively promoted MG proliferation in both P6 and adult mouse retinas; however, the timing of MG proliferation differed between the two age groups. Following CCA treatment on P6, MG proliferation started as early as day 3–4 post-CCA injection and largely finished by 2 weeks, peaking around 1 week after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast, following CCA treatment on P28, MG proliferation started later, as not many mitotic MG had migrated to the ONL at 1-week post-CCA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">4</xref>). Moreover, proliferating MG were still present 3 weeks post-treatment, as shown by scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). We speculate that the differences in MG proliferation time are due to variations in AAV transduction efficiencies of retinal cells at different ages. AAV<sub>7m8</sub> vectors delivered by intravitreal injections transduce MG more efficiently at P6 before the inner limiting membrane is fully developed. The level of cyclin D1 and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> may reach the thresholds permissive for MG cell cycle re-entry faster following CCA treatment on P6 compared to the same treatment in adult mice. This hypothesis is supported by the immunostaining results of both cyclin D1 and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This finding also emphasizes the importance of using high CCA titer (&gt;5 × 10<sup>13</sup> genome copies/ml) in adult mice to effectively stimulate MG proliferation.</p><p>P27<sup>Kip1</sup> and cyclin D1 serve as critical regulators of cell cycle progression, and any abnormalities in their expression may impact cell division, potentially leading to tumor development. Previous studies have shown that mice lacking p27<sup>Kip1</sup> are approximately 30% larger and develop pituitary tumors spontaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fero et al., 1996</xref>). Cyclin D1 is frequently upregulated in a significant fraction of human cancers, such as breast and respiratory tract tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Callender et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zukerberg et al., 1995</xref>). The strategy to stimulate MG proliferation for the purpose of retinal regeneration must be carefully weighed against the potential risk of tumorigenesis. In this study, we carefully evaluated the tumorigenic potential of CCA and made the following observations: First, the rate of MG proliferation gradually decreased and ceased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Second, MG appeared to undergo only a single round of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–F</xref>); and lastly, the retinal structure remained normal without signs of neoplasia even 1 year post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The absence of continuous MG proliferation may be partly attributed to the non-integrating nature of the recombinant AAV genomes, which become diluted after cell division, leading to reduced transgene expression. Notably, the loss of cyclin D1 overexpression and the recovery of high-level p27<sup>Kip1</sup> did not occur simultaneously. The former was observed much earlier than the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This is also supported by the scRNA-seq data, which showed that <italic>Ccnd1</italic> upregulation was lost in the MG 3 weeks after CCA treatment while <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> suppression was still evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). These findings suggest that the rapid cessation of cyclin D1 overexpression may be regulated by additional mechanisms. For instance, the antiproliferative gene <italic>Btg2</italic>, known to suppress cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wei et al., 2012</xref>), was upregulated in the proliferating and reactivated MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). In summary, the risk of tumor formation associated with CCA is minimal.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed significant downregulation of IFN pathway genes in reactivated MG, a finding consistent with their known antiproliferative role in immune surveillance and tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durbin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaplan et al., 1998</xref>). The suppression of IFN pathway may reflect a mechanism by which CCA overcomes intrinsic barriers to proliferation. Our results align with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>, who reported that forced YAP<sup>5SA</sup> expression in NMDA-treated MG similarly downregulated IFN pathway genes in the proliferative MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>). Given that cyclin D1, a key Hippo pathway target, is upregulated in both paradigms, we propose a shared mechanism of IFN suppression. In addition to regulating cell cycle, cyclin D1 may indirectly control the transcription of <italic>Stat1</italic> and <italic>Stat2</italic> and/or other IFN pathway genes by interacting with other transcriptional cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMahon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zwijsen et al., 1998</xref>). Notably, <italic>Stat3</italic> levels remained stable in the reactivated MG. STAT3 activation, which is primarily induced by cytokines (e.g. IL-6) and growth factors (e.g. EGF), promotes cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirano et al., 2000</xref>), but it inhibits neurogenesis of mouse and avian MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jorstad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Todd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Todd et al., 2020</xref>). Sustained <italic>Stat3</italic> level in our system could explain both the proliferative competence of reactivated MG and their failure to differentiate to neurons. The divergent regulation of <italic>Stat1</italic>/2 (suppressed) versus <italic>Stat3</italic> (sustained) highlights that these pathways are differentially modulated by the cell cycle regulators, warranting further investigation into their different functions in MG reprogramming.</p><p>The rods and rod-MG were two unexpected clusters in the scRNA-seq analysis. Upon close examination of the retina of <italic>Glast<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup>; Rosa26<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice without Tamoxifen induction, we found that very few rods (14 tdTomato+ rods in 128 whole retinal sections of eight mouse retina samples screened) were mislabeled by leaky tdTomato expression in a Cre-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The small rod clusters are likely the native rods mislabeled by tdTomato, appearing in all three groups at similar proportions. The rod-MG cluster, which was characterized by high levels of both MG and rod genes, was located between the rod cluster and the reactivated MG cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). This rod-MG cluster was enriched in the CCA and CCANT groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Initially, we speculated that this rod-MG cluster might represent MG that had upregulated rod genes. To investigate this, we performed RNA in situ hybridization to assess the levels of <italic>Gnat1</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic> mRNAs in MG freshly isolated from the mouse retina 3 weeks post-CCA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Despite slight increases of <italic>Gnat1</italic> and <italic>Rho</italic> mRNA signals in the CCA-treated sample compared to the untreated control retina, some MG from the control retina also exhibited some signals of both genes, suggesting that these signals resulted from rod contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The enrichment of rod gene expression in CCA-treated MG, as indicated by the scRNA-seq data and RNA in situ hybridization data, may result from a greater number of MG migrating to the ONL and closely contacting with surrounding rods, leading to higher levels of rod contamination. Moreover, we did not observe many cells overexpressing neurogenic genes, such as <italic>Ascl1, Neurog2,</italic> and <italic>Dll3</italic>, or rod precursor gene <italic>prdm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Therefore, we cautiously conclude that CCA alone does not reprogram MG toward a rod cell fate. The lack of MG reprogramming toward rod may be due to the sustained Notch signaling or Stat3 signaling in the reactivated MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>Following cell division, the majority of the MG retained their glial identity, with around 1% of MG daughter cells expressing markers of bipolar or amacrine cells. This aligns with prior reports showing that a small subset of MG daughter cells expressed the markers of retinal interneurons after cell cycle reactivation either by inhibition of the Hippo pathway or by activation of Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rueda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yao et al., 2016</xref>). The rarity of neurogenesis raises critical questions about intrinsic heterogeneity within the MG population. We speculate that a small subset of MG may exist in a ‘primed’ state, either expressing elevated levels of neurogenic factors or having a more permissive chromatin state for neurogenic gene expression, which predispose them to differentiate to neurons. However, the inefficiency of neurogenesis driven solely by cell cycle reactivation underscores a key translational barrier. To achieve functional regeneration, future strategies should combine MG cell cycle activation with neurogenic reprogramming factors (e.g. ASCL1) and/or suppression of anti-neurogenic pathways (e.g. Notch, STAT3). Such combinatorial approaches could redirect MG daughter cells from a default glial fate toward neuronal differentiation, offering a viable path for treating retinal degenerative diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild type C57BL/6J mice (Jax strain #000664), <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-tdTomato</sup></italic> reporter mice (Jax strain #007914), <italic>Rosa26<sup>LSL-Sun1:GFP</sup></italic> reporter mice (Jax strain #030952), and <italic>Glast<sup>Cre-ERT2</sup></italic> reporter mice (Jax strain #012586) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and were kept on a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle.

In brief, retinas were dissected, 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixed, dehydrated in sucrose solution, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium. Retinas were cryosectioned into 20-μm-thick sections and mounted on SuperFrost Plus glass slides (Epredia). The uninjected eye and CCA-injected eye from the same animal were sectioned on the same slide and processed together. After OCT removal with PBS and further dehydration by ethanol, retinal sections were stained with GFP antibody (AB_2307313; Aves Labs) at 4°C overnight. After three times wash with PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween-20), retinal sections were hybridized with RNA probes (Advanced Cell Diagnostics Cat.No. 426231-C2 for Mm <italic>Glul</italic>) at 40°C for 2 hr. Following in situ RNA hybridization steps, slides were stained using secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and DAPI for 2 hr at room temperature. The fluorescent signals were visualized and captured using Nikon A1HD25 High speed and Large Field of View Confocal Microscope. The mRNA levels were quantified by measuring signal intensity level by ImageJ. Pixel intensity of MG treated with CCA was normalized to the average pixel intensity of MG in the uninjected eye of the same animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA in situ hybridization on dissociated retinal cells</title><p>Fresh retina was dissociated in Papain (Worthington) and gently pipetting using a 1 ml pipette tip, and the dissociated retina cells were then filtered with 40 µm strainer (pluriStrainer).

Detected duplicates were excluded from the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>).</p><p>For the remaining cells, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimension reduction based on eight principal components (PCs) was applied, and cells were clustered using the graphical clustering method in Seurat. Cell types were identified using known marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>).

Testing was done with a grating of 12 degrees/s drifting speed and 100% contrast. The injected right eyes (CCA-treated) and uninjected left eyes (Ctrl) were tested independently for counterclockwise and clockwise grating rotations, respectively.

Animals were dark-adapted overnight before the test. After inducing anesthesia with a ketamine:xylazaine injection intraperitoneally, the pupils of both eyes were dilated using Mydrin-P Ophthalmic Solution. Once the pupils were fully dilated, the eyes were maintained moist using a topical gel. The measurement electrodes were then applied to the cornea of both eyes, while the ground electrodes were attached to the mouth and tail. All these steps were performed in the darkroom under dim red light. For scotopic ERG recordings, a multiple 530 nm light with different intensities (increments from 0.01 to 30 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>) were elicited to stimulate scotopic responses in a specific time interval. For photopic ERG recordings, 5 min exposure under 10 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> light intensity was adopted to inhibit the rod function. The photopic response was measured by multiple flashes of 30 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> intensity in the illuminated background (10 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup>). The average amplitude and implicit time of a- and b-wave were recorded and exported for further analysis. The b-wave amplitude of the stepwise scotopic responses and that of photopic response at 30 cd.s/m<sup>2</sup> were shown in figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were presented as mean ± SEM in all figures.

Interestingly, reactivation of the Muller glia cell cycle downregulates IFN pathway, which may contribute to the induced retinal regeneration.

There is intense interest in reprogramming mammalian muller glia into a source for neurogenic progenitors, in the hopes that these cells could be a source for neuronal replacement in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous work in the field has shown ways in which mouse Muller glia can be neurogenically reprogrammed and these studies have shown cell cycle re-entry prior to neurogenesis. In other works, typically, the extent of glial proliferation is limited, and the authors of this study highlight the importance of stimulating large numbers of Muller glia to re-enter the cell cycle with the hopes they will differentiate into neurons.</p><p>The authors have satisfactorily responded to all my previous reviewer comments. The authors have significantly improved their imaging quality in Figure 1 and 4. The authors have admirably re-considered their FISH and scRNA-seq data and performed critical control experiments. They now provide a more nuanced interpretation of their data by removing reference to MG-inducing rod genes which is now interpreted as ambient contamination. Taken together, this manuscript now provides strong evidence of a viral way to induce large numbers of MG to re-enter the cell cycle without a damage stimulus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100904.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Zhifei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>City University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liao</surname><given-names>Baoshan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>City University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ying</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>City University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Keung</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ming Wai Lau Centre for Reparative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Zongli</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>City University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kowloon Tong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ahola</surname><given-names>Virpi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Biomedicine, University of Eastern Finland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kuopio</named-content></addr-line><country>Finland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wenjun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>City University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kowloon Tong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Wu et al. introduce a novel approach to reactivate the Muller glia cell cycle in the mouse retina by simultaneously reducing p27Kip1 and increasing cyclin D1 using a single AAV vector. The approach effectively promotes Muller glia proliferation and reprograming without disrupting retinal structure or function. Interestingly, reactivation of the Muller glia cell cycle downregulates IFN pathway, which may contribute to the induced retinal regeneration. The results presented in this manuscript may offer a promising approach for developing Müller glia cell-mediated regenerative therapies for retinal diseases.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The data are convincing and supported by appropriate, validated methodology. These results are both technically and scientifically exciting and are likely to appeal to retinal specialists and neuroscientists in general.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are some data gaps that need to be addressed.</p><p>(1) Please label the time points of AAV injection, EdU labeling, and harvest in Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of clarity in our experimental design. We have labeled all experiment timelines in the figures where appropriate in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) What fraction of Müller cells were transduced by AAV under the experimental conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not clearly explaining the AAV transduction effeciency. AAV transduction efficiency was not uniform across the retinas. The retinal region adjacent to the optic nerve exhibits a transduction efficiency of nearly 100%. In contrast, the peripheral retina shows a lower transduction efficiency compared to the central region. The representative retinal sections with typical infection pattern are shown in Supplementary figure 4. The quantification of Edu+ MG or other markers was conducted in a 250 µm region with the highest efficiency. For scRNA-seq experiment, retinal regions with high AAV transduction efficiency were dissected with the aid of a control GFP virus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It seems unusually rapid for MG proliferation to begin as early as the third day after CCA injection. Can the authors provide evidence for cyclin D1 overexpression and p27 Kip1 knockdown three days after CCA injection?</p></disp-quote><p>We included the data that GFP expression is evident at 3 days post AAV-GFP-GFP injection (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Additionally, we performed immunostaining and confirmed cyclin D1 overexpression at 3 days post CCA injection (Fig. 2E) as well as qPCR analysis to confirm cyclin D1 overexpression and p27kip1 knockdown at the same time point (Supplementary Fig. 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors reported that MG proliferation largely ceased two weeks after CCA treatment. While this is an interesting finding, the explanation that it might be due to the dilution of AAV episomal genome copies in the dividing cells seems far-fetched.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that dilution of AAV episomal genomes is unlikely to be the sole reason for the stop of MG proliferation. By staining cyclin D1 at various days post CCA injection, we found that cyclin D1 is immediately downregulated in the mitotic MG undergoing interkinetic nuclear migration to the outer nuclear layer (Fig. 2G-I). In contrast, the effect of p27<sup>kip1</sup> knockdown by CCA lasted longer (Supplementary Figure 9-10). It is possible that other anti-proliferative genes are involved in the immediate downregulation of Cyclin D1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This manuscript by Wu, Liao et al. reports that simultaneous knockdown of P27Kip1 with overexpression of Cyclin D can stimulate Muller glia to re-enter the cell cycle in the mouse retina. There is intense interest in reprogramming mammalian muller glia into a source for neurogenic progenitors, in the hopes that these cells could be a source for neuronal replacement in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous work in the field has shown ways in which mouse Muller glia can be neurogenically reprogrammed and these studies have shown cell cycle re-entry prior to neurogenesis. In other works, typically, the extent of glial proliferation is limited, and the authors of this study highlight the importance of stimulating large numbers of Muller glia to re-enter the cell cycle with the hopes they will differentiate into neurons. While the evidence for stimulating proliferation in this study is convincing, the evidence for neurogenesis in this study is not convincing or robust, suggesting that stimulating cell cycle-reentry may not be associated with increasing regeneration without another proneural stimulus.</p><p>Below are concerns and suggestions.</p><p>Intro:</p><p>(1) The authors cite past studies showing &quot;direct conversion&quot; of MG into neurons. However, these studies (PMID: 34686336; 36417510) show EdU+ MG-derived neurons suggesting cell cycle re-entry does occur in these strategies of proneural TF overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have revised the statement to &quot;MG reprogramming&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Multiple citations are incorrectly listed, using the authors first name only (i.e. Yumi, et al; Levi, et al;). Studies are also incompletely referenced in the references.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the mistakes in reference. We have corrected the reference mistakes in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1:</p><p>(3) When are these experiments ending? On Figure 1B it says &quot;analysis&quot; on the end of the paradigm without an actual day associated with this. This is the case for many later figures too. The authors should update the paradigms to accurately reflect experimental end points.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of clarity in our experimental design. We have labeled all experiment timelines in the figures where appropriate in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Are there better representative pictures between P27kd and CyclinD OE, the EdU+ counts say there is a 3 fold increase between Figure 1D&amp;E, however the pictures do not reflect this. In fact, most of the Edu+ cells in Figure 1E don't seem to be Sox9+ MG but rather horizontally oriented nuclei in the OPL that are likely microglia.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for pointing this out. We have replaced the image of cyclin D1 OE retina which a more representative image.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Is the infection efficacy of these viruses different between different combinations (i.e. CyclinD OE vs. P27kd vs. control vs. CCA combo)? As the counts are shown in Figure 1G only Sox9+/Edu+ cells are shown not divided by virus efficacy. If these are absolute counts blind to where the virus is and how many cells the virus hits, if the virus efficacy varies in efficiency this could drive absolute differences that aren't actually biological.</p></disp-quote><p>Rule out the possibility that the differences in MG proliferation across groups are due to variations in viral efficacy, we have examined the p27<sup>kip1</sup> knockdown and cyclin D1 overexpression efficiencies for all four groups by qPCR analysis. The result showed that cyclin D1 overexpression efficiency by AAV-GFAP-Cyclin D1 virus alone or P27 knockdown efficiency by AAV-GFAP-mCherry-p27kip1 shRNA1 is comparable to, if not even higher than, those by CCA virus (Supplementary Fig 5). Therefore, the virus efficacy cannot explain the drastic increase in MG proliferation by CCA.</p><p>As the central retina usually had 100% infection efficacy (Supplementary Fig. 4), we quantified the Edu+Sox9+ cell number in the 250µm regions next to the optic nerve.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) According to the Jax laboratories, mice aren't considered aged until they are over 18months old. While it is interesting that CCA treatment does not seem to lose efficacy over maturation I would rephrase the findings as the experiment does not test this virus in aged retinas.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. We have changed to “older adult mice” in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Supplemental Figure 2c-d. These viruses do not hit 100% of MG, however 100% of the P27Kip staining is gone in the P27sh1 treatment, even the P27+ cell in the GCL that is likely an astrocyte has no staining in the shRNA 1 picture. Why is this?</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the images in Supplementary Fig. 2B-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2</p><p>(8) Would you expect cells to go through two rounds of cell cycle in such a short time? The treatment of giving Edu then BrdU 24 hours later would have to catch a cell going through two rounds of division in a very short amount of time. Again the end point should be added graphically to this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We repeated the Edu/BrdU colabelling experiment with extended periods of Edu/BrdU injections. Based on the result of the MG proliferation time course study (Fig. 2A), we injected 5 times of Edu from D1 to D5 and 5 times of BrdU from D6 to D10 post-CCA injection, which covered the major phase of MG proliferation (Fig. 2B-C). Consistent with the previous findings, we did not observe any BrdU&amp;EdU double positive MG cells.</p><p>Additionally, we showed that cyclin D1 overexpression immediately ceased in migrating mitotic MG (Fig. 2G-I), which may explain why CCA-treated MG do not progress to the second round of cell division.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3</p><p>(9) I am confused by the mixing of ratios of viruses to indicate infection success. I know mixtures of viruses containing CCA or control GFP or a control LacZ was injected. Was the idea to probe for GFP or LacZ in the single cell data to see which cells were infected but not treated? This is not shown anywhere?</p></disp-quote><p>The virus infection was not uniform across the entire retina (Supplementary Fig. 4). To mark the infection hotspots, we added 10% GFP virus to the mixture. Regions of the retina with low infection efficiency were removed by dissection and excluded from the scRNA-seq analysis. Therefore, we assumed that the vast majority of MG were infected by CCA. We apologize for not clearly explaining this methodological detail in the original text. We have added the experimental design to Fig. 3A and revised the result part (line 191-196) accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) The majority of glia sorted from TdTomato are probably not infected with virus. Can you subset cells that were infected only for analysis? Otherwise it makes it very hard to make population judgements like Figure 3E-H if a large portion are basically WT glia.</p></disp-quote><p>This question is related to the last one. Since the regions with high virus infection efficiency were selectively dissected and isolated for analysis, the CCA-infected MG should constitute the vast majority of MG in the scRNA-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 3C you can see Rho is expressed everywhere which is common in studies like this because the ambient RNA is so high. This makes it very hard to talk about &quot;Rod-like&quot; MG as this is probably an artifact from the technique. Most all scRNA-seq studies from MG-reprogramming have shown clusters of &quot;rods&quot; with MG hybrid gene expression and these had in the past just been considered an artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the high rod gene expression in the rod-MG cluster is an artifact. We have performed multiple rounds of RNA in situ hybridization on isolated MG nuclei. The counts of Gnat1 and Rho mRNA signal are largely overlapped between the two samples with and without CCA treatment (Supplementary Fig 14). Some MG in the control retinas without CCA treatment had up to 7 or 8 dots per cell, suggesting contamination of attached rod cell debris during retina dissociation (Supplementary Fig 14). Therefore, the result did not support that rod-MG is a reprogrammed MG population with rod gene upregulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) It is mentioned the &quot;glial&quot; signature is downregulated in response to CCA treatment. Where is this shown convincingly? Figure H has a feature plot of Glul, which is not clear it is changed between treatments. Otherwise MG genes are shown as a function of cluster not treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added box plots of several MG-specific genes to illustrate the downregulation of the glial signature in the relevant cell cluster in the revised manuscript (Supplementary Fig. 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4</p><p>(13) The authors should be commended for being very careful in their interpretations. They employ the proper controls (Er-Cre lineage tracing/EdU-pulse chasing/scRNA-seq omics) and were very careful to attempt to see MG-derived rods. This makes the conclusion from the FISH perplexing. The few puncta dots of Rho and GNAT in MG are not convincing to this reviewer, Rho and GNAT dots are dense everywhere throughout the ONL and if you drew any random circle in the ONL it would be full of dots. The rigor of these counts also comes into question because some dots are picked up in MG in the INL even in the control case. This is confusing because baseline healthy MG do not express RNA-transcripts of these Rod genes so what is this picking up? Taken together, the conclusion that there are Rod-like MG are based off scRNA-seq data (which is likely ambient contamination) and these FISH images. I don't think this data warrants the conclusion that MG upregulate Rod genes in response to CCA.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the results of RNA in situ hybridization on isolated MG, we revisited the result of the RNA in situ hybridization on retinal sections as well. We performed RNA in situ in the retinal section at 1 week post CCA treatment, expecting to see lower Gnat1 and Rho signals in the ONL-localizing MG compared to 3 weeks and 4 months post CCA treatment. However, we observed similar levels across all three time points (data not shown). The lack of dynamic changes in rod gene expression levels also suggests contamination from tightly surrounding neighboring rods. Consequently, we have reinterpreted the scRNA-seq and RNA FISH data and withdrawn the conclusion that MG upregulated rod genes after CCA treatment. We thank the reviewer for pointing out this potential issue and helping us avoid an incorrect conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5</p><p>(14) Similar point to above but this Glul probe seems odd, why is it throughout the ONL but completely dark through the IPL, this should also be in astrocytes can you see it in the GCL? These retinas look cropped at the INL where below is completely black. The whole retinal section should be shown. Antibodies exist to GS that work in mouse along with many other MG genes, IHC or western blots could be done to better serve this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the images in Figure 4 in the revised manuscript. Additionally, we have performed the Sox9 antibody staining to demonstrate partial MG dedifferentiation following CCA treatment (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6</p><p>(15) Figure 6D is not a co-labeled OTX2+/ TdTomato+ cell, Otx2 will fill out the whole nucleus as can be seen with examples from other MG-reprogramming papers in the field (Hoang, et al. 2020; Todd, et al. 2020; Palazzo, et al. 2022). You can clearly see in the example in Figure 6D the nucleus extending way beyond Otx2 expression as it is probably overlapping in space. Other examples should be shown, however, considering less than 1% of cells were putatively Otx2+, the safer interpretation is that these cells are not differentiating into neurons. At least 99.5% are not.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the image of Otx2+ Tdt+ Edu+ cell, which shows the whole nucleus filled with strong Otx2 staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) Same as above Figure 6I is not convincingly co-labeled HuC/D is an RNA-binding protein and unfortunately is not always the clearest stain but this looks like background haze in the INL overlapping. Other amacrine markers could be tested, but again due to the very low numbers, I think no neurogenesis is occurring.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we didn’t find HuC/D+Tdt+EdU+ cells at 3 weeks post CCA treatment, we believe that the weak HuC/D+ staining in the MG daughter cells at 4 months is not background, but rather reflects an incomplete neurogenic switch. This suggests that the process of neurogenesis may be ongoing but not fully realized within the observed timeframe without additional stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(17) In the text the authors are accidently referring to Figure 6 as Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the mistake. We will correct the mistake in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7</p><p>(18) I like this figure and the concept that you can have additional MG proliferating without destroying the retina or compromising vision. This is reminiscent of the chick MG reprogramming studies in which MG proliferate in large numbers and often do not differentiate into neurons yet still persist de-laminated for long time points.</p><p>General:</p><p>(19) The title should be changed, as I don't believe there is any convincing evidence of regeneration of neurons. Understanding the barriers to MG cell-cycle re-entry are important and I believe the authors did a good job in that respect, however it is an oversell to report regeneration of neurons from this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have changed the title to “Simultaneous cyclin D1 overexpression and p27kip1 knockdown enable robust Müller glia cell cycle reactivation in uninjured mouse retina” in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(20) This paper uses multiple mouse lines and it is often confusing when the text and figures switch between models. I think it would be helpful to readers if the mouse strain was added to graphical paradigms in each figure when a different mouse line is employed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have labeled the mouse lines used in each experiment in the figures where appropriate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
