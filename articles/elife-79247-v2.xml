Craniofacial disorders further increase facial variation. To understand craniofacial variation and how it can be buffered, we analyzed the zebrafish <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant. When this transcription factor encoding gene is mutated, zebrafish develop dramatically variable craniofacial phenotypes. Years of selective breeding for low and high penetrance of mutant phenotypes produced strains that are either resilient or sensitive to the <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutation. Here, we compared gene expression between these strains, which revealed that selective breeding enriched for high and low <italic>mef2ca</italic> paralog expression in the low- and high-penetrance strains, respectively. We found that <italic>mef2ca</italic> paralog expression is variable in unselected wild-type zebrafish, motivating the hypothesis that heritable variation in paralog expression underlies mutant phenotype severity and variation. In support, mutagenizing the <italic>mef2ca</italic> paralogs, <italic>mef2aa</italic>, <italic>mef2b</italic>, <italic>mef2cb</italic>, and <italic>mef2d</italic> demonstrated modular buffering by paralogs. Specifically, some paralogs buffer severity while others buffer variability. We present a novel, mechanistic model for phenotypic variation where variable, vestigial paralog expression buffers development. These studies are a major step forward in understanding the mechanisms of facial variation, including how some genetically resilient individuals can overcome a deleterious mutation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>paralogs</kwd><kwd>gene duplication</kwd><kwd>craniofacial development</kwd><kwd>developmental buffering</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>variability</kwd><kwd>robustness</kwd><kwd>compensation</kwd><kwd>subfunctionalization</kwd><kwd>vestigial expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DE029193</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>James T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowships Program 201569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bailon-Zambrano</surname><given-names>Raisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DE029995</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Jennyfer M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008982</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowships Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mumme-Monheit</surname><given-names>Abigail</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Within populations, there is standing variation in paralog expression levels, paralog expression levels are heritable, and variation in paralog expression can modify the phenotypes associated with mutation of one of the paralogs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Human faces are variable</title><p>Human craniofacial variation allows us – and even computers – to identify specific individuals. A recent study indicated that human facial structures are more variable than other human anatomical features and that evolution selected for increased variation in craniofacial-associated genomic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheehan and Nachman, 2014</xref>). While human genomic variation contributes to craniofacial phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paternoster et al., 2012</xref>), facial variation persists among more genetically homogeneous populations such as Finnish people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sheehan and Nachman, 2014</xref>) and even monozygotic twins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kohn, 1991</xref>). Therefore, even among individuals with similar genomes, craniofacial development may remain noisy or sensitive to minor fluctuations, compared with other developmental processes.</p><p>Phenotype severity and variation can be measured in different ways. Penetrance is the frequency of a phenotype associated with a genotype. Expressivity is different degrees of the same phenotype associated with a genotype. Here, we use both penetrance and average expressivity to measure phenotype severity. We also use the distribution in expressivity to measure phenotypic variation. Furthermore, there are two types of variation. Among-individual variation can be quantified by measuring differences between individuals. Within-individual variation is measured by quantifying departures from symmetry on left versus right sides of an individual known as fluctuating asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valen, 1962</xref>). It is unknown if among- and within-individual variation are products of the same biological mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hallgrimsson et al., 2019</xref>). There is evidence to support that these two types of variation are associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Breuker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Santos et al., 2005</xref>); however, other studies indicate that they are independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Debat et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Breno et al., 2011</xref>). Further work is needed to resolve this question.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Variability in human craniofacial disease</title><p>In the 1940s, Waddington observed that mutant organisms are often associated with increased phenotypic variation compared to wild types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waddington, 1942</xref>), and more recent studies support this finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fish, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hallgrímsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scharloo, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parsons et al., 2008</xref>). Human genetic craniofacial disease phenotypes also appear more variable than normal human facial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ward et al., 2000</xref>). For example, facial clefting among monozygotic twins can be incompletely penetrant or unilateral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Trotman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Young et al., 2021</xref>), demonstrating both among- and within-individual variation. How the same genetic disease allele can have devastating consequences in some individuals, while other resilient individuals can overcome the deleterious mutation is not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>One human genetic disease that presents variable craniofacial phenotypes is <italic>MEF2C</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome. Patients heterozygous for mutations affecting the transcription factor encoding gene <italic>MEF2C</italic> show variable facial dysmorphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Meur et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zweier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tonk et al., 2011</xref>). To our knowledge, no <italic>MEF2C</italic> homozygous mutant patients have been identified, likely due to embryonic lethality. Additionally, craniofacial asymmetry is documented in some patients with this disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nowakowska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Novara et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, both among- and within-individual variation are present in <italic>MEF2C</italic> haploinsufficiency syndrome patients. Numerous <italic>MEF2C</italic> mutant alleles cause this disorder. Therefore, a model system in which the same allele can be studied in many different individuals is needed.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Variable buffering by gene family members might underlie among-individual variation</title><p>During evolution, whole genome duplications produced multiple <italic>mef2</italic> genes, or paralogs, in vertebrate genomes. Thus far, no <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs are associated with craniofacial development besides <italic>mef2c</italic>. When whole genome duplications occur, the most likely outcome is the loss of one of the duplicate genes through the accumulation of deleterious mutations and eventual nonfunctionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takahata and Maruyama, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Watterson, 1983</xref>). However, sometimes mutations occur in gene regulatory elements partitioning gene expression domains among the new duplicates. This preserves both copies and is called subfunctionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Force et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ohno, 2013</xref>). Subfunctionalized duplicates may experience only partial loss of expression subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Force et al., 1999</xref>), retaining relics of their ancestral expression pattern even if the gene is no longer required for the original function.</p><p>Compensation, or the ability of paralogs or gene family members to make up for the loss of a gene due to an overlap in function, has long been recognized as a source of genetic robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wagner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirschner and Gerhart, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conant and Wagner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kamath et al., 2003</xref>). Robustness is defined as the ability of a biological system to overcome genetic or environmental perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Visser et al., 2003</xref>). Buffering lessens the impact of perturbation on a system. Although buffering by paralogs has long been proposed, whether paralogs retain buffering capacity after subfunctionalization has not been sufficiently addressed.</p><p>We hypothesize that vestigial expression can buffer against loss of another paralog and that variation in vestigial expression underlies phenotypic variation. This hypothesis is supported by work in systems ranging from yeast to human cells demonstrating that paralogs contribute to genetic robustness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Kegel and Ryan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dandage and Landry, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsiao and Vitkup, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wagner, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dean et al., 2008</xref>). However, whether paralog expression variation underlies phenotypic variation has not been directly tested. Finally, whether variation in paralogous compensation is subject to selection is unknown.</p><p>We previously found evidence to support this hypothesis in zebrafish. <italic>mef2ca</italic> single mutants produce dramatically variable craniofacial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nichols et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>mef2cb</italic> is the most closely related <italic>mef2ca</italic> paralog. However, <italic>mef2cb</italic> is not required for craniofacial development, and homozygous mutants are viable and indistinguishable from wild types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinits et al., 2012</xref>). However, we reported that ventral cartilage defects associated with <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutation become more severe when we removed a single functional copy of <italic>mef2cb</italic> from <italic>mef2ca</italic> homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Laurier et al., 2014</xref>). Our vestigial buffering hypothesis predicts that although <italic>mef2cb</italic> is no longer overtly required for craniofacial development, remaining <italic>mef2cb</italic> expression in neural crest cells might partially substitute for <italic>mef2ca</italic> loss. There is further evidence from mouse mutants that <italic>Mef2</italic> paralogs can functionally substitute for one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Majidi et al., 2019</xref>). Because mutations in none of the other four zebrafish paralogous <italic>mef2</italic> genes have been reported, their function is unknown. These paralogs have human orthologs, <italic>MEF2A</italic>, <italic>MEF2B</italic>, and <italic>MEF2D</italic>. None of these genes have been associated with human craniofacial development or disease.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>We developed a system for understanding craniofacial development and variability</title><p>One prominent phenotype in zebrafish <italic>mef2ca</italic> homozygous mutants is expansion of the opercle, a bone supporting the gill flap. This phenotype is remarkably variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Laurier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kimmel et al., 2003</xref>); <italic>mef2ca</italic> homozygous mutants have many opercle shapes, and some even develop wild-type-looking opercle bones; the phenotype is incompletely penetrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nichols et al., 2016</xref>). With some genes, mutants encoding a premature termination codon (PTC) upregulate compensating genes through transcriptional adaptation, explaining why some mutant alleles do not produce a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rossi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>). Transcriptional adaptation does not contribute to incomplete penetrance in our system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sucharov et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, we pharmacologically inhibited transcriptional adaptation (by inhibiting RNA decay) and did not observe changes in penetrance.</p><p>We demonstrated that the factors underlying opercle variation are heritable through selective breeding, which shifted the penetrance of the expanded bone phenotype to generate strains with consistently low or high penetrance of this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nichols et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike traditional mutagenesis modifier screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">St Johnston, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kile and Hilton, 2005</xref>), our selective breeding paradigm likely enriched for standing genetic variation without the need for further mutagenesis. Thus, we likely bred naturally occurring genetic modifiers in our background to fixation. Similar approaches have proven successful in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasch et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>mef2ca</italic> is pleiotropic, and although we only selected on opercle bone penetrance, nearly all <italic>mef2ca</italic>-associated phenotypes increased or decreased penetrance in the high- and low-penetrance strains, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sucharov et al., 2019</xref>). The only phenotype remaining fully (100%) penetrant in the low- and high-penetrance strains is a shortened symplectic cartilage, a linear, rod-shaped cartilage that functions as a jaw support structure. In unselected lines, <italic>mef2ca</italic>-associated phenotypes are only found in <italic>mef2ca</italic> homozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2007</xref>). However, in high-penetrance heterozygotes, we observed the shortened symplectic cartilage, suggesting this phenotype is highly sensitive to <italic>mef2ca</italic> loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sucharov et al., 2019</xref>). Penetrance is a binary measurement (a shortened symplectic is present or not), and we have not yet examined expressivity (to what extent a mutant symplectic is shortened). We do not know if the average length of the shortened symplectic or the distribution of symplectic length is different between low- and high-penetrance strains.</p><p>Here, we capitalize on the strengths of our zebrafish system to address the mechanisms underlying craniofacial variation. We quantified expressivity by taking linear measurements of the symplectic cartilage, allowing us to measure severity, among-individual variation, and within-individual variation in the zebrafish craniofacial skeleton. Combining these measurements with penetrance scoring, we compared phenotype severity and variation between selectively bred strains. We found that increased severity is associated with increased variation. In the high-penetrance strain, we found a more severe symplectic phenotype, and more among-individual variation but not within-individual variation compared to the low-penetrance strain.</p><p>What factors were selected upon from the original genetic background to increase or decrease penetrance? Work in nematodes demonstrates that expression variation in otherwise redundant genes contributes to variable penetrance in mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Raj et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that one or more of the five zebrafish <italic>mef2ca</italic> paralogs might be redundant with <italic>mef2ca</italic> and ameliorate the phenotype in the low-penetrance line or reciprocally intensify the phenotype in the high-penetrance line. We compared the expression of the <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs between selectively bred strains and found that many of the paralogs are more highly expressed in the low-penetrance strain compared to the high-penetrance strain. Furthermore, we uncovered standing variation in paralog expression in unselected strains. To determine if the increased paralog expression we discovered in the low-penetrance strain buffers the <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant phenotype, we mutagenized the <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs. Double mutant analyses indicate that the different paralogs modularly buffer different aspects of the pleiotropic <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant phenotype: some affect severity, while others affect variation and some affect both. These findings demonstrate that heritable, variable paralog expression is a major factor affecting phenotype severity and among-individual phenotypic variation but does not contribute to within-individual variation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Craniofacial phenotypes are more variable in <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutants compared with wild types</title><p>The phenotypic variation often associated with human genetic diseases might be partially due to individuals inheriting different mutant alleles retaining different levels of functional activity, expression domains, and/or transcriptional levels.

These highly conserved domains mediate dimerization, DNA binding, and co-factor interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Potthoff and Olson, 2007</xref>). The <italic>mef2ca<sup>b1086</sup></italic> mutant allele arose from a forward genetic screen and produces a PTC just downstream of the MADS box. This mutant allele variably displays phenotypes including ectopic bone near the opercle, interhyal joint fusion, dysmorphic ceratohyal, reduced Meckel’s cartilage, jaw joint fusion, and shortened symplectic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Skeletal preparations from two full-sibling individuals illustrate both among- and within-individual variation easily observed in <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Comparing the two mutant individuals (B3 and B4) demonstrates among-individual variation associated with the opercle bone phenotype; one individual (B3) has phenotypically wild-type opercles, while the other individual has bilateral mutant phenotypes (B4). Meanwhile, within-individual (left-right) symplectic cartilage phenotype variation is present in one of the <italic>mef2ca<sup>b1086</sup></italic> animals (B4); in this animal, the symplectic cartilage is longer on one side than the other.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant craniofacial phenotypes are more variable than wild types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of <italic>mef2ca</italic> exonic structure.

Work from budding yeast demonstrates that gene duplication contributes to genetic robustness against null mutations and that the probability of compensation by gene duplicates is correlated with sequence similarity among the gene duplicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2003</xref>).

To determine which are the most similar to <italic>mef2ca</italic> and therefore more likely to compensate for its loss, we used Clustal Omega to compare the amino acid sequences of <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs.

In zebrafish, both co-orthologs (<italic>mef2ca</italic> and <italic>mef2cb</italic>) function redundantly in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinits et al., 2012</xref>), while craniofacial function has been subfunctionalized to just <italic>mef2ca</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Consistently, with the exception of <italic>mef2ca</italic>, the <italic>mef2</italic> paralog mutants we analyzed here do not have an overt single mutant skeletal phenotype but do modify <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant phenotypes. In our system, selective breeding likely fixed existing paralog expression variation. Thus, in the low-penetrance strain, selection may replicate paralog ancestral expression, restoring near full redundancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for <italic>mef2</italic> gene duplicate evolution and replication of ancestral, redundant expression via selective breeding.</title><p>In our model, an ancestral <italic>mef2</italic> gene existed with distinct expression domains.

In this example, <italic>mef2cb</italic> expression is dampened in the head. These gene expression changes result in subfunctionalization but with vestigial retention of the original expression. <italic>mef2cb</italic> is no longer required for craniofacial development, yet traces of the original craniofacial expression remain. The amount of vestigial expression is variable among individuals, resulting in variable buffering against <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant phenotypes across a population. Our selective breeding selected on this variable expression resulting in higher paralog expression in the low-penetrance strain compared with the high-penetrance strain. Thus, <italic>mef2</italic> paralog expression in the low-penetrance strain resembles the ancestral condition following whole genome duplication, when both copies’ expression profiles were highly similar, and the genes were redundant for craniofacial development.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79247-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our experiments support a model where we selected upon pre-existing alleles that either amplify or dampen existing vestigial paralog expression variation, depending on the direction of selection.

To account for this paradox, we propose that a few shared genetic factors regulate paralog expression. By selecting for penetrance, expression of several paralogs was increased or decreased via selection for these shared genetic factors. In support, we found evidence of shared gene regulation in our experiments examining <italic>mef2</italic> gene expression dynamics. The expression dynamics of paralogs closely related in sequence and phylogeny are similar, suggesting shared regulatory modules. In this model, few factors are inherited that control the expression of many paralogs.

We previously observed a similar phenomenon with heterozygotes in the high-penetrance strain and proposed that this is a form of genetic assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sucharov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Waddington, 1953</xref>).

Following selective breeding, the phenotypes arose without the perturbation. Similarly, we studied phenotypes that were originally only present in perturbed conditions, <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutants. Following selective breeding, the phenotypes arose without the perturbation, in wild types. We offer a mechanistic explanation for our findings. Analyzing craniofacial skeletons in the context of the <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutation revealed cryptic paralog expression variation. Specifically, in wild types, paralog expression variation does not impact phenotype. However, in mutants, the consequences of variable expression levels are unveiled, allowing us to select upon them. Because the paralogs seem to have shared regulatory systems, we enriched for variants producing lower expression of several paralogs, including <italic>mef2ca</italic>, by selective breeding for high penetrance. This pan-paralog expression decrease led the high-penetrance strain to be both extremely sensitive to coding mutations in <italic>mef2ca</italic> and to manifest <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant-associated phenotypes in <italic>mef2ca</italic> wild types from this strain. The latter is likely due to decreased <italic>mef2ca</italic> expression in high-penetrance <italic>mef2ca</italic> wild types.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Decoupling buffering mechanisms</title><p>We found that paralogs modularly buffer the <italic>mef2ca</italic> homozygous mutants. For example, disabling <italic>mef2cb</italic> affects most <italic>mef2ca</italic>-related craniofacial phenotypes, while <italic>mef2d</italic> mutations primarily affect penetrance of ventral cartilage phenotypes, and only variation is affected when <italic>mef2b</italic> function is removed. Although we were unable to mutagenize <italic>mef2ab</italic>, despite significant effort, this is not likely to affect our general conclusions. Similar to work in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gu et al., 2003</xref>), the paralog with the highest expression (<italic>mef2ca</italic>) is the one associated with a single mutant phenotype, and the paralog with the most sequence similarity (<italic>mef2cb</italic>) is the one playing the largest buffering role. However, others have reported that partial gene expression overlap is also predictive of buffering capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kafri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kafri et al., 2006</xref>), in line with our results that even distantly related paralogs with more dissimilar expression profiles (<italic>mef2d</italic>) can modify penetrance in our system. Different types of compensation events have previously been classified as either active or passive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diss et al., 2014</xref>). In our system, compensation is likely passive, but subject to selection, which can change robustness across generations.</p><p>Determining whether the specific portion of the phenotype that each paralog buffers is related to that paralog’s wild-type expression pattern would expand our understanding of modularity. Unfortunately, in situ gene expression protocols were not sensitive enough to detect the low expression of the individual paralogs. Moreover, the quantitative phenotyping in this study was limited to the symplectic cartilage, as a proxy for the whole system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, quantitative phenotyping of other parts of the developing craniofacial complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kimmel et al., 2015</xref>) might reveal more information about modular buffering of severity and variation by paralogs.

Examining selectively bred strains and the different paralog mutants demonstrates that buffering in our system only regulates among-individual variation, not within-individual variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These two types of variation are buffered by different mechanisms in our system. Our results shed some light on the long-standing debate surrounding similarities and differences between mechanisms buffering these two types of variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hallgrimsson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These studies advance our understanding of craniofacial variation.

Briefly, we designed sgRNAs(Single-guide RNA) within or just downstream of the MADS or MEF2 domain. The XbaI-digested pT3TS-nCas9n plasmid (Addgene plasmid #46757) was used as a template to transcribe Cas9 mRNA with the T3 mMESSAGE kit (Invitrogen). We transcribed sgRNAs (see table below) from PCR-generated templates using the MEGAscript T7 Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). One cell-stage embryos were injected with a mix of 200 ng/µl Cas9 mRNA and 50 ng/µl of each gene-specific sgRNA. Injected embryos were raised, and founders identified by amplifying the genomic region containing the sgRNA site and identifying banding size shifts indicating insertions and/or deletions (see genotyping assay table for primers). All new paralog mutants were originally generated in the low-penetrance strain and were subsequently maintained on the AB background for at least three generations.

In the interest of strong rigor and reproducibility, phenotypes were scored by three observers blinded to genotype. All three agreed with the number of animals in each phenotypic class, indicating that phenotype penetrance can be reproducibly identified by different observers. For symplectic cartilage measurements, whole mount Alcian blue- and Alizarin red-stained skeletons were imaged under a transmitted light dissecting scope. Images were captured with Zeiss ZEN software. This software was then used to measure the linear distance in microns from the posterior most point of the interhyal cartilage and the distal tip of the symplectic cartilage similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Talbot et al., 2016</xref>). For each individual, the total symplectic length was calculated by summing the measurements from the left and right side.

For the time course study from unselected AB and for comparing low- and high-penetrance wild types, live individual 24 hpf embryos from each strain had their heads removed. Decapitated bodies were genotyped to identify homozygous wild types. Heads from five to six identified homozygous wild types were pooled, and total RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent. cDNA was prepared with Superscript III from Invitrogen. qPCR experiments utilized a real-time PCR StepOnePlus system from Applied Biosystems and SYBR green. A standard curve was generated from serially diluted (1:2:10) cDNA pools, and primers with a slope of –3.3 ±0.3 were accepted. The relative quantity of target cDNA was calculated using Applied Biosystems StepOne V.2.0 software and the comparative Ct method. After surveying the expression of many housekeeping genes at multiple stages, we determined that <italic>rps18</italic> expression was the most consistent across stages, genotypes, and strains.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Landry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers agree that the question addressed is of great interest to evolutionary and developmental biologists in general and to those studying the evolution of developmental mechanisms in particular. The manuscript reports substantial and interesting advances, but in its current form it is difficult to read, which led to significant frustration among the reviewers. The manuscript needs to be substantially rewritten and shortened. The writing and interpretation of the results needs to be clarified as many statements are perceived as lacking precision. One of many examples is the statement that each selected strain has similar inbredness. However, there is no evidence that this was actually tested. The authors should also ensure that their conclusions match the results and are not over interpreted, pointing out explicitly caveats where necessary. Finally, the results need to be discussed in relation to what has been published, for example how does the phenomenon studied here relate to studies of genetic modifiers and what has been learned there.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>P3 abstract: 'In support, mutagenizing all mef2ca paralogs in the low penetrance strain'</p><p>But one wasn't mutated.

Both of course are correct but phrase below says it in this order and biologically it seems to make more sense to me that the severity is a property of the allele and that the variation is a property of the biology arising from the altered protein function.</p><p>P9 'we hypothesized that [a single] mutant allele, mef2cab1086,'</p><p>P9 'shortened symplectic cartilages and fused interhyal joints, were occasionally observed'</p><p>In nearly all of the alcian-alizarin stains, the length of the symplectic is difficult to see due to interference at the rostral end by overlap with the palatoquadrate.

That requires data on heterozygosity. It could be that for one of the strains, for some reason selection was for stronger heterozygosity across the genome than the other strain, that you tended to select for heterozygotes because, for example, inbreeding depresses health subtly in ways that affect the manifestation of the phenotype.</p><p>P10 'to generate a 'natural knock down' in mef2ca wild types'</p><p>Maybe it doesn't knockdown the mef2ca gene function or expression, maybe it alters the related phenotypes in some other way, in an independent pathway.</p><p>P10 'Six <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs in the zebrafish genome share highly conserved amino acid sequences'</p><p>Has no one done this type of analysis before that the text could cite?

And the resolution of the scRNA-seq results into anterior arches, frontonasal, posterior arches, and melanocytes seems to come from a method with much less resolution than in situ hybridization to mRNAs would provide.</p><p>The selection of crest cells and excluding endodermal and ectodermal cells, which signal to the developing cartilages, removed cells that might very well be contributing to the selected phenotypes because the selection experiments might have altered genes in the signaling pathway that are expressed in these epithelial cell types.</p><p>P11 'When we demonstrated that paralog transcriptional adaptation does not account</p><p>for the phenotypic differences between the low- and high-penetrance strains34, we did</p><p>not examine if selective breeding changed paralog expression between strains in</p><p>mef2ca wild types'</p><p>Consider change to: 'Data showing that paralog transcriptional adaptation does not account for the phenotypic differences between the low- and high-penetrance strains34 do not rule out the possibility that selective breeding changed paralog expression between strains in mef2ca wild types</p><p>P11 'cranial neural crest cells between unselected wild types and high-penetrance wild types'</p><p>Were these wild type siblings from an unselected mef2ca mutant line?

It seems like this experiment doesn't utilize the advantages of scRNA-seq and instead uses it for something the method is not well suited for. Visual comparison of the plots requires that the same number of cells are present in each of the two samples. Was that true?</p><p>Furthermore, for comparison to Figure 4B, it would be better to show the data in Figure 4C divided into the same four 'cell types'. And even better if shown in the context of all clusters that came out of the experiment.</p><p>P11 'all significantly downregulated in high-penetrance heads compared'</p><p>Should it read: '…downregulated in the heads of wild-type siblings from high-penetrance lines'? Or were these selected heads that were mutant with high expressivity? I'm just not sure what a 'high penetrance head' is.</p><p>P11 'paralogs. We next used RT-qPCR to compare <italic>mef2</italic> paralog expression between highand low-penetrance wild types.'</p><p>This experiment would be more interpretable if, like the scRNA-seq experiments, wild types from an unselected line of mef2ca mutants were used.

But because that control is missing, the conclusion does not seem to be justified, only that the two selected lines differ from each other. While selecting on phenotypes, not expression patterns, both selected lines could be up or both down in paralog expression from the data presented.</p><p>Figure S3. Expression of the housekeeping genes was normalized to rps18. Were the <italic>mef2</italic> expression levels normalized to the same gene?</p><p>In addition, the conclusion from these data is that there's no difference between low and high lines for these two genes, but no statistical test is given and the standard deviations do not overlap. A statistical test would seem useful, even though the data would seem to show as the authors concluded that the low line is not higher than the high line for these two genes.</p><p>P12 'we systematically removed functional copies of mef2ca paralogs from this strain'</p><p>This is indeed the best way to address the hypothesis above. The phrase 'from this strain', however, should probably be replaced by 'the low-penetrance strain'.</p><p>P12 'is most closely related to'</p><p>In what way? In sequence? In expression patterns?

But the Mef2cb protein apparently doesn't provide an essential unique non-redundant function because the mutant has no phenotype.</p><p>P12 'when we removed one copy of mef2cb'</p><p>Good that the reciprocal experiment was done.</p><p>P12 'Removing both copies of mef2cb from mef2ca homozygous mutants IN THE LOW-PENETRANCE STRAIN produces severe'</p><p>P12 'there is no difference in symplectic length between wild types and mef2ca heterozygotes (wild type vs. mef2ca+/-;mef2cb+/+)'</p><p>Specify genetic background.</p><p>P12 'Removing copies of mef2cb from mef2ca wild types does not significantly change'</p><p>Again, specify strain/background. Is it the low background in the whole paragraph?</p><p>P12 Did the authors also remove mef2cb activity in unselected and high-penetrance lines? If not, then it would be helpful to motivate why choosing one line and not the others.</p><p>P12 'We conclude that mef2cb buffers against mef2ca-associated phenotype severity, and</p><p>among-individual variation, but not within-individual variation IN THE LOW-PENETRANCE LINE.'</p><p>I think that's right, or were all three lines checked? It's hard to tell because the text does not always clearly specify which lines is used.</p><p>P13 'mef2d mutant allele in the low-penetrance strain (Figure 6A). Homozygous mef2d mutants did not develop any overt skeletal phenotypes in an otherwise wild-type background'</p><p>This is confusing. Is the background the low-penetrance strain, which is not the same as a wild-type background because it has been selected for likely rare alleles in the original background, or is the mef2d mutant in an 'otherwise wild-type background' as the sentence says?</p><p>P13 'mef2d, and further increased in double homozygous mutants (Figure 6C)'</p><p>This is difficult to follow. This paragraph says that the mef2d mutants were made in the low line, but then Figure 6C indicates it's the unselected strain. Which is correct?</p><p>P13 'but mef2ca heterozygotes are more variable when mef2d is disabled (Figure 6E).'</p><p>Which phenotype is examined here? The previous sentence makes me think it's only symplectic length variation, but because neither the sentence nor the figure panel nor the figure legend says, it's impossible to know.</p><p>P13. 'mef2b is the most divergent mef2ca paralog,'</p><p>By what criterion? Sequence? Length? Time at which this variant appeared in phylogeny? Expression pattern?</p><p>P14 'Both of these phenotypes are never seen in unselected'</p><p>Change to: 'Neither of these phenotypes are ever seen in unselected'</p><p>P15 'Our experiments support a model where we selected upon alleles that either amplify or dampen existing vestigial expression'</p><p>Are those selected alleles at the mef2ca locus? Or at the <italic>mef2</italic> paralog loci? Or in trans acting genes, presumably transcription factors or their partners, that regulate mef2ca or cb or other genes?</p><p>P15 'and is what we selected upon in mef2ca mutants'</p><p>This sentence implies that the selection was on variation at the mef2ca mutant locus. Either some mapping data need to be presented (maybe I missed it) that support where the responding loci were in the genome of the selected lines, or some discussion is warranted about where the variation might be in the genome and what types of gene variants might have responded. Maybe this is later in the discussion.</p><p>P15 'For example, disabling mef2cb affects most phenotypes'</p><p>I think this means 'For example, disabling mef2cb affects most MEF2CA-RELATED CRANIOFACIAL phenotypes.</p><p>P15 'primarily affect penetrance of ventral cartilages'</p><p>Should be: 'primarily affect penetrance of ventral cartilage PHENOTYPES'.</p><p>P15 'Further, expression of all the paralogs was affected by selection, indicating that they all contribute to buffering.'</p><p>Not necessarily. It could be that selection acted on a single factor that alters the expression of all of the paralogs in the same way even though the protein of only one or two contributes to the selected phenotype; the others are just along for the ride because of shared upstream regulatory mechanisms, not because of shared downstream functions.</p><p>P15 'Closely related paralog expression dynamics are similar'</p><p>I guess closely related expression dynamics are of course similar. But I think what the text meant to say was that 'The expression dynamics of paralogs closely related in sequence and phylogeny are similar'</p><p>P15 'In this model, few enhancers are inherited that control the expression of many paralogs.'</p><p>Again, it would be helpful to reader to know whether the authors think these selected enhancers are in the <italic>mef2</italic> genes themselves or in transcription factors that might regulate coordinately all of the <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs.</p><p>P15 'Determining whether the aspect of the mef2ca phenotype buffered by each</p><p>paralog is related to their wild type expression pattern'</p><p>Consider: 'Determining whether the SPECIFIC PORTION of the mef2ca phenotype THAT EACH PARALOG BUFFERS is related to THAT PARALOG'S wild-type expression pattern'</p><p>P16 'phenotyping in this study was limited to the symplectic cartilage.'</p><p>Remind reader why this specific element makes the best proxy for the whole system and focusing on it is unlikely to lead to wrong conclusions even if several other phenotypes had been studied additionally.</p><p>16 'buffering in our system only regulates among-individual variation, not within-individual variation'</p><p>Tell reader why this is an important finding. Why should I care if these two types of variation are regulated by distinct or common mechanisms.</p><p>P16 'We propose that cryptic variation in vestigial paralog expression is the noise underlying variable craniofacial development'</p><p>Here, come back to the motivation in the beginning about variation in human facial structure. Sceptics might say that, well this doesn't apply to humans because the effects these authors found are mostly related to genes from a fish-specific gene duplication, the a and b copy of mef2c, and because humans just have one MEF2C gene, this is irrelevant. Text could readily disabuse sceptics of this notion and the symmetry of returning to the original motivation would make this more fun.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) I found this manuscript difficult to read. In large part, my difficulty was due to finding vague phrases throughout that I would linger over to try to interpret. I will list some of these below, but they were sufficiently numerous as to lessen the impact of this cool work!</p><p>Page 1 (the Abstract): &quot;Here we used the zebrafish mef2ca mutant, which produces variable phenotypes, to understand craniofacial variation.&quot; This is difficult to understand – is there one mutant or different alleles collectively produce a range of phenotypes.</p><p>Page 2: &quot;facial variation persists among genetically homogeneous populations&quot; Does &quot;genetically homogeneous&quot; mean twins or clones? If not, is this useful?</p><p>Page 2: &quot;Thus, it is possible that high human facial variability is heritable, and under selection.&quot; Do the authors mean that variability is heritable? or that features are heritable and variability of features is under selection?</p><p>2) I question whether the study of the penetrance and variability of expression associated with the different mef2ca alleles adds to the study or diverts attention from the take-home messages. In particular, the authors claim that the data presented in Figure 1C shows that mef2caco3008 and mef2cab1086 alleles are associated with different penetrance. This just does not seem to be true from the data – or at least the authors do not indicate what criteria they use to say there is a significant difference.</p><p>3) The authors emphasize that a deletion mutation of <italic>mef2</italic> in mammals has a mild phenotype compared with the phenotype of other mutant alleles. Then they sort of suggest that the mef2caco3008 is of particular interest because it is a deletion of the entire coding sequence of mef2ca. I think the strong implication is that the two mutations are equivalent. Nevertheless, the mef2caco3008 zebrafish deletion has a strong phenotype. And then no comment. I think this discussion in the Results section is a distraction. I think too little is known about each mutation to even compare them and suggest they are similar. This is an example of the lack of focus that diminishes the strong points of the manuscript.</p><p>4) The authors are not sufficiently careful about their use of and the meanings of the words &quot;up-regulation&quot; and &quot;down-regulation&quot; with respect to paralog expression. One might imagine that selecting for high or low penetrance would select for new mutations that modify expression of the paralogs. Or, more likely in my opinion, that different animals in the starting population have higher or lower expression of the paralogs and the breeding scheme isolates these genomes into lower penetrance or higher penetrance strains. The authors MUST make clear what they mean by these terms. It is not clear in fact whether there ever is a change in gene expression of a paralog. Selection of higher-expressing alleles or lower-expressing alleles from a starting population is not the same as selecting for their up- or down-regulation. The authors really should investigate how much standing variation exists in their populations of fish, especially the unselected starting population.</p><p>5) Throughout, the authors make conclusions that are based on assumptions that are not sufficiently supported by data. For example:</p><p>On page 6: &quot;transcriptional adaptation is not a major factor underlying phenotypic variation in our system; the PTC (mef2cab1086) allele would be expected to be more mild than the full deletion (mef2caco3008) allele if transcriptional adaptation was a factor.&quot; I don't think we fully understand the triggers of transcription adaptation to make this conclusion – especially when it could have been measured directly!</p><p>On page 8: &quot;Because the low- and high penetrance strains are both similarly inbred, it is unlikely that there is more genetic variation in the high-penetrance strain background accounting for the increased variation in this strain.&quot; This would not be correct if breeding for phenotypic variability turns out to be a selection for genetic variability.</p><p>As mentioned above, the authors claim the paralogs have no function in craniofacial development and yet they suggest that diminished expression of the paralogs leads to the expression of mutant phenotypes in the high penetrance strain. They need to clarify and explain.</p><p>6) I am concerned that the newly engineered mutations in the paralogs might trigger &quot;transcriptional adaptation&quot; as they each produce premature termination codons – early stops. This would be easy to test.</p><p>7) There are lots of places where the authors need to be clearer.</p><p>On page 7: the authors discuss the establishment of high penetrance and low penetrance strains – they need to remind us that the mutation is lethal and so they propagate these strains as crosses between heterozygotes (I think?). and they need to remind us or refer to the Methods section to tell us how many generations of selective breeding have taken place.</p><p>On page 8: &quot;The zebrafish <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs each encode a MADS box and <italic>MEF2</italic> domain which are remarkably similar (Figure 3B and S1),&quot; – similar to what?</p><p>On page 9: &quot;early&quot; and &quot;late&quot; stages of expression should be defined or clarified</p><p>8) The entire discussion of &quot;buffering&quot; in the Introduction, etc. is concerning to me. How is the phenotypic buffering that occurs because of vestigial expression of a paralog different than partial &quot;redundancy&quot;? The authors write &quot;To our knowledge, this vestigial buffering hypothesis has not been previously proposed or tested.&quot; And yet certainly the work of Yitzhak Pilpel (Nature Genetics 2005; PNAS, 2006) and others very specifically hypothesize that paralogs function as &quot;backup circuits&quot;. Further, how does the phenomenon studied here relate to studies of genetic modifiers and what has been learned there. The current work does not operate in isolation, and the Introduction seems to imply that.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. A conclusion drawn from the results in Figure 4 is that selecting for high penetrance led to decreased expression of <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs in wild-type embryos, whereas selecting for low penetrance led to increased expression. However, direct comparisons are only made between the unselected vs. high-penetrance strains, and the high-penetrance vs. low-penetrance strains. Without explicitly showing that paralogs are also upregulated in the low-penetrance strain vs. unselected, it can't be fairly concluded that selection for low penetrance worked through this mechanism.</p><p>2. The authors note that they removed functional copies of <italic>mef2</italic> paralogs from the low penetrance mef2cab1086 strain, but then used the published fh288 allele for mef2cb. I assume they crossed this line into the low penetrance strain, but for how many generations? The penetrance of the mef2ca phenotypes for this new combination in Figure 5D seem considerably higher than they previously reported (Sucharov et al. 2019), so whether it is still technically &quot;low penetrance&quot; seems questionable. Similarly, the authors initially state that they made the new mef2d and mef2b alleles (co3013, co3012) on the low-penetrance strain (as suggested in the Materials and methods), but then Figure 6C/7C implies that they are assessing phenotypes on an &quot;unselected&quot; strain (the penetrance values listed support that this is not the original low penetrance strain). Please correct this discrepancy. Presumably, the predicted phenotypes and interpretations would be different depending on strain background, though possibly not, given my previous point.</p><p>3. Regarding the mild(er) phenotype of the b631 allele: Ensembl and UCSC genome browser list multiple transcripts for mef2ca, some of which have distinct transcriptional and translational start sites. Are any of these alternate forms present in the zebrafish neural crest, and, if so, could they be ameliorating the b631 phenotype? Would all transcripts be impacted by the b1086 mutation?</p><p>4. In the discussion on decoupling buffering mechanisms, the authors note that paralogs can share enhancer sequences dating back to before duplication, which is indisputable, but then seem to imply either that each paralog's version of the enhancer has evolved in parallel under selection for high or low penetrance or that a single (or few) enhancer(s) is regulating other paralogs in trans (?). If I am interpreting correctly, more evidence should be provided for each of these claims. This section requires further clarification.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Variable paralog expression underlies phenotype variation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Three important take home lessons of this work are:</p><p>1) Within populations there is existing (standing) variation in the expression levels of a set of paralogous genes;</p><p>2) Control over the expression levels of these paralogues is heritable;</p><p>3) Variations in the level of expression of paralogues can modify the expressivity and penetrance associated with a mutant allele of one of the paralogues. The authors use these observations to support a very interesting model they propose in which over evolution as a paralogue loses one of its functions, perhaps by acquiring diminished expression in a particular tissue, it may retain a vestigial capacity to support that function, which may be uncovered by boosting its expression in that tissue. The data presented appear consistent with the hypothesis that the levels of expression of each paralogue may be coordinately regulated, a model that could be readily addressed here but is not directly addressed in this study.</p><p>The work is valuable. Its impact is dampened by four factors:</p><p>1) The work makes two very different points that are not yet clearly related: the first portion of the manuscript deals with a purported relation between the strength of a mutant allele causing a developmental phenotype and the amount of variability in the structures that are formed abnormally, whereas the second portion of the manuscript deals with the idea that paralogue expression may mitigate or exaggerate the expression of the phenotype associated with a single mutation.</p><p>2) The writing is often unclear: terms are used that are poorly defined or incorrectly applied; interpretations are freely mixed with presentations of results; paragraphs often have multiple ideas intermingled leading to a lack of clarity and repetition of ideas in different paragraphs.</p><p>3) There are outright mistakes in the use of some references or the descriptions of some past work.</p><p>4) Descriptions of the precise experimental approach taken should be made clearer in some cases.</p><p>Bailon-Zambrano et al. study factors that influence the expression of phenotype associated with a mutation. In one portion of the work they study a series of alleles of the zebrafish mef2ca gene, which is necessary for normal craniofacial development. They demonstrate that recessive putative loss-of-function mutant alleles of the mef2ca gene of zebrafish are associated with a range of expressivity. By focusing on one aspect of the mutant phenotype, the length of the symplectic cartilages that support the jaw, they find a correlation between the average strength of the phenotype of an allele (measured as reduction in length) and the extent of variability between mutant individuals that carry the allele. This is an interesting idea, but it is not fully explored or proven by their study. Because it is not clear how the various alleles affect expression or function of the gene's protein product, and because the precise function of the gene in shaping craniofacial structures is not clear, it is difficult to derive a mechanistic understanding of their observation and it is not possible to extrapolate from this study to other genes.</p><p>The findings that associate individual mef2ca alleles with variability in the severity of the craniofacial phenotype are difficult to interpret. The authors order the &quot;strength&quot; of an allele based on the overall severity of the phenotype, but the molecular reason why the different alleles have different &quot;strengths&quot; is completely unclear. The mildest allele has a mutation affecting the initiation codon, and so presumably it produces a protein utilizing a different initiation point. However it is not clear why the deletion of almost the entire locus leads to an intermediate phenotype, whereas a mutation introducing a premature termination causes the most severe phenotype. Perhaps the severe allele produces a product that interferes with the activity of paralogous products or interacting proteins? Who knows? In addition, since we don't know the precise cellular functions regulated by the gene, it is impossible to generalize from this case and conclude, as the authors do, that there is a general correlation between severity of an allele and the variability in phenotype that results. Finally, this reviewer is concerned about this conclusion and generalizations that may be drawn from focus on a single quantifiable character, the symplectic cartilage. Perhaps there is always a fixed amount of variation in the length of this cartilage. As stronger alleles produce shorter cartilage pieces, similar absolute variations in length may appear to be of greater significance when affecting structures of shorter average length.</p><p>In contrast with the first portion of the work, the second portion of the work makes truly valuable and mechanistic contributions to our understanding of how genetic background might modify the phenotypic expression of a particular mutation. The second portion investigates one mechanism that may contribute to the oft-observed phenomenon that a single mutation may be associated with different expressions of a phenotype in a manner that is dependent on the genetic background. The authors focus on loss-of-function of the mef2ca gene of zebrafish, which is needed for the normal development of several craniofacial structures. They find expression levels of <italic>mef2</italic> paralogues may modify the phenotype associated with the mef2ca mutation. Three important take home lessons of this work are:</p><p>1) Within populations there is existing (standing) variation in the expression levels of a set of paralogous genes;</p><p>2) Control over the expression levels of these paralogues is heritable;</p><p>3) Variations in the level of expression of paralogues can modify the expressivity and penetrance associated with a mutant allele of one of the paralogues. The authors use these observations to support a very interesting model they propose in which over evolution as a paralogue loses one of its functions, perhaps by acquiring diminished expression in a particular tissue, it may retain a vestigial capacity to support that function, which may be uncovered by boosting its expression in that tissue.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) I think the work is important, I would like to see it published, but I found the manuscript very difficult to read.</p><p>2) Perhaps one reason it is difficult to follow is that the work described here is composed of two very different studies, one describing the phenotypic effects of three different alleles and the other describing the effects of genetic background on the expression of one allele. This is reflected in the presence of two independent sections in the Introduction. Because we don't understand how the three different mutations affect generation of a protein product, or how they might affect the expression of paralogues (which are shown to be very important in the second half of this work), we cannot understand what a &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; allele is. IF the deletion completely removes gene function, then from a molecular point of view, it is a complete loss of function, and thus the premature termination mutation is a &quot;special&quot; type of allele that is more than simply completely loss of function. In any case, without insight into how these alleles work, I don't think it is fair to make generalizations about strengths of alleles and variability in the expression of a phenotype.</p><p>On the other hand, there are clear statements in the Introduction that could really be used as the crux of an entire paper: &quot;whether paralog expression variation underlies phenotypic variation has not been directly tested. Finally, whether variation paralogous buffering is subject to selection is unknown.&quot; Personally, I suggest focusing on the effects of paralogues to buffer phenotype – it makes for a crisp introduction and focused story.</p><p>3) There are assertions that I believe are incorrect.</p><p>For example, lines 110-113: &quot;Because mutations in none of the other four zebrafish paralogous <italic>mef2</italic> genes have been reported, their function is unknown. These paralogs have human orthologs, MEF2A, MEF2B and MEF2D, that do not appear to be critical for craniofacial development46-48.&quot; Reference 46 and perhaps the others does NOT address the question of whether these genes are required for craniofacial development – ref 46 says mef2d fusion proteins are associated with cancer. These are somatic gain-of-function mutations and irrelevant to the matter at hand, which is complete whole animal loss of function.</p><p>Another example, lines 307-311: &quot;Data showing that paralog transcriptional adaptation does not account for the phenotypic differences between the low- and high-penetrance strains34 do not rule out the possibility that selective breeding changed paralog expression between strains in mef2ca wild types.&quot; Reference 34 is the classic Force et al. paper and is not the correct reference – I think you meant to use reference 52.</p><p>Another example, lines 364-367: &quot;We detected mef2d transcripts in the anterior arch population of 24 hpf wild-type cranial neural crest cells, and mef2d expression is significantly lower in the high-penetrance strain compared with the high-penetrance strain&quot; I think you meant to compare high and low penetrance strains.</p><p>There are other examples of assertions that are a bit glib and that distract from the strength of the work.</p><p>4) Terminology is used loosely or incorrectly.</p><p>I find in the literature the use of between-individual as well as among-individual, and that between-individual is used more often. Personally I find between-individual easier to keep in my mind what the comparison being described is, but both are legit I guess.</p><p>In many cases I believe it would be clearer to say that there are differences in expression levels among members of a population and that these levels are heritable – rather than saying &quot;variability is heritable&quot; (line 42 and elsewhere), which is a difficult concept to grasp precisely.</p><p>Lines 17-18: &quot;Craniofacial disorders further increase this variability.&quot; &quot;this variability&quot; is ill-defined – perhaps it is more useful to speak of &quot;range of variability&quot;</p><p>Line 44: &quot;Finish people&quot; should be &quot;Finnish people&quot;.</p><p>Lines 63-64: &quot;Human genetic craniofacial disease phenotypes also appear more variable than normal human facial phenotypes.&quot; What is the actual comparison that is being made? I can't reconstruct this experiment.</p><p>Lines 70-71: &quot;Patients heterozygous for mutations affecting the transcription factor encoding gene MEF2C show variable facial dysmorphologies19-21.&quot; This is relevant to the present study if you are describing variability associated with a single mutation – if that is true, make it explicit.

What one would like to measure is whether the paralogues are expressed in the same cells as the gene of interest and at a time when they are performing a function of interest.

Please be explicit about what these experiments let you conclude and why.</p><p>Line 296-297: this paragraph is ended with a summary sentence: &quot;Of note, previous work indicates that partially shared regulatory motifs are predictive of robustness66.&quot; Neither the meaning of this nor its relevance is clear to me. whose robustness? And in what context?</p><p>5) Some things can just be made simpler:</p><p>Lines 32-34: &quot;We present a novel, mechanistic model for phenotypic variation where cryptically variable, vestigial paralog expression buffers development.&quot; I don't think the Reader will understand &quot;cryptically variable&quot; at this point of the paper (the Abstract).</p><p>Line 61 and elsewhere: &quot;genetic mutations&quot; could be simply &quot;mutations&quot;.</p><p>6) Experiments and Models that need to made clearer:</p><p>A critical series of experiments involves study of mutant alleles of the paralogues that are thought to be insufficient to have a dramatic effect on the craniofacial phenotype, but are thought to modify this phenotype in the context of mef2ca or other paralogue mutations. The authors at one point talk about this experiment as simply &quot;removing&quot; the paralogue (line 343). At that point, I had assumed the new mutations were being generated within the strain that was being studied – that is the easiest way to interpret &quot;remove&quot;. Instead, paralogue mutations are induced elsewhere and bred into strains for study. The rationale for the experimental design is complicated and should be explicitly set forward. I would ask the authors to make clearer within the Results section how they generated the new mutations in the paralogues and how these were introduced into various strains and what precisely was examined. The entire exposition is a bit buried in Lines 336 – 338 paralogs. &quot;For all paralog functional experiments, we introduced the relevant paralog mutation into the low-penetrance strain, then maintained by outcrossing to unselected AB.&quot; This is not a complete sentence. The details of this experiment are really important.</p><p>The other point that needs to be better explained and clarified is their model in Figure 9. The mechanistic implications of the illustration are vague, but to me there appears to be focus on the roles of enhancers – the figure seems to imply (i) that enhancers acquire mutations that diminish expression of the paralogue and (ii) that under selection the enhancer acquires mutations that result in increased expression of the gene. I would think rather that standing variation arises prior to the selection – and this might be illustrated in the figure. Nevertheless, it seems from the data that the expression levels of all the paralogues may be coordinately regulated – and this idea seems to supported in the Discussion. If all the paralogues are expressed at low levels in the high penetrance strain and at higher levels in the low penetrance strain, then it is more likely that variation is not being driven at the level of each paralogue's enhancer but rather by some factor working in trans. That idea is really missing from Figure 9 – and since it is a summary illustration of what the authors think, getting this Figure right is important. In truth, I would have liked to see a few crosses between strains to test the idea that a single modifier working in trans is responsible for all the effects – THAT would have been both relatively easy to test and killer interesting as a result. But without such an experiment, the authors need to be very clear about alternate possible interpretations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have extensively revised and added new data to their manuscript in response to the initial round of reviews.

In large part, my difficulty was due to finding vague phrases throughout that I would linger over to try to interpret. I will list some of these below, but they were sufficiently numerous as to lessen the impact of this cool work!</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for appreciating our work. Your comments and those of the other reviewers led us to considerably revise the manuscript striving for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 1 (the Abstract): &quot;Here we used the zebrafish mef2ca mutant, which produces variable phenotypes, to understand craniofacial variation.&quot; This is difficult to understand – is there one mutant or different alleles collectively produce a range of phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 2: &quot;facial variation persists among genetically homogeneous populations&quot; Does &quot;genetically homogeneous&quot; mean twins or clones?

In particular, the authors claim that the data presented in Figure 1C shows that mef2caco3008 and mef2cab1086 alleles are associated with different penetrance. This just does not seem to be true from the data – or at least the authors do not indicate what criteria they use to say there is a significant difference.</p></disp-quote><p>By our statistical analyses, the b1086 allele has a higher penetrance of ectopic op and ih joint fusion (Figure 1C) compared with b631. In contrast penetrance of these phenotypes in the co3008 allele is not significantly different from the mildest b631 allele. Furthermore, the total sy length (Figure 1E) is significantly shorter in b1086 compared with co3008. These lines of evidence indicate that b1086 is more severe than co3008. This is clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors emphasize that a deletion mutation of mef2 in mammals has a mild phenotype compared with the phenotype of other mutant alleles. Then they sort of suggest that the mef2caco3008 is of particular interest because it is a deletion of the entire coding sequence of mef2ca. I think the strong implication is that the two mutations are equivalent. Nevertheless, the mef2caco3008 zebrafish deletion has a strong phenotype. And then no comment. I think this discussion in the Results section is a distraction. I think too little is known about each mutation to even compare them and suggest they are similar. This is an example of the lack of focus that diminishes the strong points of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and changed the language describing this allele indicating that it approximates the human deletion allele. Furthermore, we include new data addressing the protein produced from these alleles which increase our understanding of each mutation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors are not sufficiently careful about their use of and the meanings of the words &quot;up-regulation&quot; and &quot;down-regulation&quot; with respect to paralog expression. One might imagine that selecting for high or low penetrance would select for new mutations that modify expression of the paralogs. Or, more likely in my opinion, that different animals in the starting population have higher or lower expression of the paralogs and the breeding scheme isolates these genomes into lower penetrance or higher penetrance strains. The authors MUST make clear what they mean by these terms. It is not clear in fact whether there ever is a change in gene expression of a paralog. Selection of higher-expressing alleles or lower-expressing alleles from a starting population is not the same as selecting for their up- or down-regulation. The authors really should investigate how much standing variation exists in their populations of fish, especially the unselected starting population.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer proposes the excellent hypothesis that “different animals in the starting population have higher or lower expression of the paralogs and the breeding scheme isolates these genomes into lower penetrance or higher penetrance strains.” In response we directly tested this model and found that there is significant standing variation in paralog expression in the unselected strains (Figure 4D). We would like to thank this reviewer for motivating this very important experiment that dramatically improved the manuscript and clarified our model. This amended model is now clearly conveyed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Throughout, the authors make conclusions that are based on assumptions that are not sufficiently supported by data. For example:</p><p>On page 6: &quot;transcriptional adaptation is not a major factor underlying phenotypic variation in our system; the PTC (mef2cab1086) allele would be expected to be more mild than the full deletion (mef2caco3008) allele if transcriptional adaptation was a factor.&quot; I don't think we fully understand the triggers of transcription adaptation to make this conclusion – especially when it could have been measured directly!</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this reviewer comment. Our previous work (Sucharov 2019) extensively tested the hypothesis that differences in transcriptional adaptation account for differences in our selectively bred strains finding that it is not a major factor in our system. Nevertheless, we qualify this statement in the text by stating that we did not directly test if the deletion allele induces transcriptional adaptation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On page 8: &quot;Because the low- and high penetrance strains are both similarly inbred, it is unlikely that there is more genetic variation in the high-penetrance strain background accounting for the increased variation in this strain.&quot; This would not be correct if breeding for phenotypic variability turns out to be a selection for genetic variability.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and edited the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As mentioned above, the authors claim the paralogs have no function in craniofacial development and yet they suggest that diminished expression of the paralogs leads to the expression of mutant phenotypes in the high penetrance strain. They need to clarify and explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and edited the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) I am concerned that the newly engineered mutations in the paralogs might trigger &quot;transcriptional adaptation&quot; as they each produce premature termination codons – early stops. This would be easy to test.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is correct, the new paralog mutations might trigger transcriptional adaptation. However, determining if they do is beyond the scope of this work, and not critical to the conclusions we draw. Future studies will test this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are lots of places where the authors need to be clearer.</p><p>On page 7: the authors discuss the establishment of high penetrance and low penetrance strains – they need to remind us that the mutation is lethal and so they propagate these strains as crosses between heterozygotes (I think?). and they need to remind us or refer to the Methods section to tell us how many generations of selective breeding have taken place.</p></disp-quote><p>We have gone to great lengths to make this manuscript clearer, including the breeding methods description.

The authors write &quot;To our knowledge, this vestigial buffering hypothesis has not been previously proposed or tested.&quot; And yet certainly the work of Yitzhak Pilpel (Nature Genetics 2005; PNAS, 2006) and others very specifically hypothesize that paralogs function as &quot;backup circuits&quot;. Further, how does the phenomenon studied here relate to studies of genetic modifiers and what has been learned there. The current work does not operate in isolation, and the Introduction seems to imply that.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.

Our study is placed in much better context following this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. A conclusion drawn from the results in Figure 4 is that selecting for high penetrance led to decreased expression of mef2 paralogs in wild-type embryos, whereas selecting for low penetrance led to increased expression. However, direct comparisons are only made between the unselected vs. high-penetrance strains, and the high-penetrance vs. low-penetrance strains. Without explicitly showing that paralogs are also upregulated in the low-penetrance strain vs. unselected, it can't be fairly concluded that selection for low penetrance worked through this mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, our new unselected AB paralog expression study (Figure 4D) strengthens our conclusion (see above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors note that they removed functional copies of mef2 paralogs from the low penetrance mef2cab1086 strain, but then used the published fh288 allele for mef2cb. I assume they crossed this line into the low penetrance strain, but for how many generations? The penetrance of the mef2ca phenotypes for this new combination in Figure 5D seem considerably higher than they previously reported (Sucharov et al. 2019), so whether it is still technically &quot;low penetrance&quot; seems questionable. Similarly, the authors initially state that they made the new mef2d and mef2b alleles (co3013, co3012) on the low-penetrance strain (as suggested in the Materials and methods), but then Figure 6C/7C implies that they are assessing phenotypes on an &quot;unselected&quot; strain (the penetrance values listed support that this is not the original low penetrance strain). Please correct this discrepancy. Presumably, the predicted phenotypes and interpretations would be different depending on strain background, though possibly not, given my previous point.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these points. We now clarify that the fh288 allele was crossed to low penetrance which is, as you state, no longer low penetrance. We then maintained by outcrossing to AB. Thus, we consider it to be unselected. Similarly, the new CRISPR mutants were originally created on the low-penetrance strain, but maintained by outcrossing these alleles to unselected AB. We also consider them to be unselected. We now clearly describe our allele generation and maintenance strategy in the methods and text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Regarding the mild(er) phenotype of the b631 allele: Ensembl and UCSC genome browser list multiple transcripts for mef2ca, some of which have distinct transcriptional and translational start sites. Are any of these alternate forms present in the zebrafish neural crest, and, if so, could they be ameliorating the b631 phenotype? Would all transcripts be impacted by the b1086 mutation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. We include new Mef2c protein (immunostaining) data indicating that protein is produced from the b631 allele, as this reviewer hypothesizes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The protein we detect is likely from the downstream in frame ATGs that the reviewer mentions. Future protein study (Western blot) will be informative. We also include new protein data with the deletion allele. Together with our previous report (Sucharov 2019), these data indicate that the two more severe alleles (b1086 and co3008) do not produce meaningful amount of Mef2ca protein but b631 does. We incorporated these new data and interpretations into the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the discussion on decoupling buffering mechanisms, the authors note that paralogs can share enhancer sequences dating back to before duplication, which is indisputable, but then seem to imply either that each paralog's version of the enhancer has evolved in parallel under selection for high or low penetrance or that a single (or few) enhancer(s) is regulating other paralogs in trans (?). If I am interpreting correctly, more evidence should be provided for each of these claims. This section requires further clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We improved the discussion related to this including that the differences between strains might be either in cis (enhancers) or trans (upstream activators) to the paralogs.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Please make it clear throughout the intro and text that the manuscript consists of two components that are not yet clearly related.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the first component, the allelic series study, at the suggestion of reviewer 2.

The authors use these observations to support a very interesting model they propose in which over evolution as a paralogue loses one of its functions, perhaps by acquiring diminished expression in a particular tissue, it may retain a vestigial capacity to support that function, which may be uncovered by boosting its expression in that tissue. The data presented appear consistent with the hypothesis that the levels of expression of each paralogue may be coordinately regulated, a model that could be readily addressed here but is not directly addressed in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for appreciating this work.

Its impact is dampened by four factors:</p><p>1) The work makes two very different points that are not yet clearly related: the first portion of the manuscript deals with a purported relation between the strength of a mutant allele causing a developmental phenotype and the amount of variability in the structures that are formed abnormally, whereas the second portion of the manuscript deals with the idea that paralogue expression may mitigate or exaggerate the expression of the phenotype associated with a single mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>Per this reviewer’s suggestion, we removed the allelic series experiment and all interpretations purporting relation between the strength of a mutant <italic>mef2ca</italic> allele and the amount of variation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The writing is often unclear: terms are used that are poorly defined or incorrectly applied; interpretations are freely mixed with presentations of results; paragraphs often have multiple ideas intermingled leading to a lack of clarity and repetition of ideas in different paragraphs.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully edited to ensure that terms are clearly defined and correctly used. We added a paragraph in which we defined some of the major terms, including robustness, compensation, and buffering. We are careful with our usage thereafter. We have taken great care to save interpretations for the discussion rather than mix with presentations of results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are outright mistakes in the use of some references or the descriptions of some past work.</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected these, thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Descriptions of the precise experimental approach taken should be made clearer in some cases.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made clearer how different mutant lines were generated and maintained in the appropriate Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Bailon-Zambrano et al. study factors that influence the expression of phenotype associated with a mutation. In one portion of the work they study a series of alleles of the zebrafish mef2ca gene, which is necessary for normal craniofacial development. They demonstrate that recessive putative loss-of-function mutant alleles of the mef2ca gene of zebrafish are associated with a range of expressivity. By focusing on one aspect of the mutant phenotype, the length of the symplectic cartilages that support the jaw, they find a correlation between the average strength of the phenotype of an allele (measured as reduction in length) and the extent of variability between mutant individuals that carry the allele. This is an interesting idea, but it is not fully explored or proven by their study. Because it is not clear how the various alleles affect expression or function of the gene's protein product, and because the precise function of the gene in shaping craniofacial structures is not clear, it is difficult to derive a mechanistic understanding of their observation and it is not possible to extrapolate from this study to other genes.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we removed the first portion containing the allelic series from this study. The result is a streamlined body of work focusing on the paralogs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The findings that associate individual mef2ca alleles with variability in the severity of the craniofacial phenotype are difficult to interpret. The authors order the &quot;strength&quot; of an allele based on the overall severity of the phenotype, but the molecular reason why the different alleles have different &quot;strengths&quot; is completely unclear. The mildest allele has a mutation affecting the initiation codon, and so presumably it produces a protein utilizing a different initiation point. However it is not clear why the deletion of almost the entire locus leads to an intermediate phenotype, whereas a mutation introducing a premature termination causes the most severe phenotype. Perhaps the severe allele produces a product that interferes with the activity of paralogous products or interacting proteins? Who knows? In addition, since we don't know the precise cellular functions regulated by the gene, it is impossible to generalize from this case and conclude, as the authors do, that there is a general correlation between severity of an allele and the variability in phenotype that results.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the allelic series from this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, this reviewer is concerned about this conclusion and generalizations that may be drawn from focus on a single quantifiable character, the symplectic cartilage. Perhaps there is always a fixed amount of variation in the length of this cartilage. As stronger alleles produce shorter cartilage pieces, similar absolute variations in length may appear to be of greater significance when affecting structures of shorter average length.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the allelic series from this study. In the remaining phenotypic characterizations, we always include penetrance scoring of all <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant-associated phenotypes to assay all <italic>mef2ca</italic> mutant-associated phenotypes.</p><p>We use the coefficient of variation to compare symplectic length variation between the high- and low-penetrance strains. We have confirmed with a statistician and coauthor (K. Colborn) that this value is appropriate for comparing variation in symplectic cartilage length because it uses a ratio of the variation and the mean, which allows you to compare variables of different scales or magnitude. Also, because the measurements are from a ratio scale, they are appropriate variables for estimating the coefficient of variation (for example, an ordinal or nominal variable would be inappropriate).</p><p>Finally, we also use the F-test to determine significant differences in variation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast with the first portion of the work, the second portion of the work makes truly valuable and mechanistic contributions to our understanding of how genetic background might modify the phenotypic expression of a particular mutation. The second portion investigates one mechanism that may contribute to the oft-observed phenomenon that a single mutation may be associated with different expressions of a phenotype in a manner that is dependent on the genetic background. The authors focus on loss-of-function of the mef2ca gene of zebrafish, which is needed for the normal development of several craniofacial structures. They find expression levels of mef2 paralogues may modify the phenotype associated with the mef2ca mutation. Three important take home lessons of this work are:</p><p>1) Within populations there is existing (standing) variation in the expression levels of a set of paralogous genes;</p><p>2) Control over the expression levels of these paralogues is heritable;</p><p>3) Variations in the level of expression of paralogues can modify the expressivity and penetrance associated with a mutant allele of one of the paralogues. The authors use these observations to support a very interesting model they propose in which over evolution as a paralogue loses one of its functions, perhaps by acquiring diminished expression in a particular tissue, it may retain a vestigial capacity to support that function, which may be uncovered by boosting its expression in that tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that the reviewer thinks that “the work makes truly valuable and mechanistic contributions”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) I think the work is important, I would like to see it published, but I found the manuscript very difficult to read.</p></disp-quote><p>By removing the allelic series, we made the paper clearer and more concise. We have also clarified language and edited the manuscript according to this reviewer’s suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Perhaps one reason it is difficult to follow is that the work described here is composed of two very different studies, one describing the phenotypic effects of three different alleles and the other describing the effects of genetic background on the expression of one allele. This is reflected in the presence of two independent sections in the Introduction. Because we don't understand how the three different mutations affect generation of a protein product, or how they might affect the expression of paralogues (which are shown to be very important in the second half of this work), we cannot understand what a &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;intermediate&quot; allele is. IF the deletion completely removes gene function, then from a molecular point of view, it is a complete loss of function, and thus the premature termination mutation is a &quot;special&quot; type of allele that is more than simply completely loss of function. In any case, without insight into how these alleles work, I don't think it is fair to make generalizations about strengths of alleles and variability in the expression of a phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and removed the allelic series component of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, there are clear statements in the Introduction that could really be used as the crux of an entire paper: &quot;whether paralog expression variation underlies phenotypic variation has not been directly tested. Finally, whether variation paralogous buffering is subject to selection is unknown.&quot; Personally, I suggest focusing on the effects of paralogues to buffer phenotype – it makes for a crisp introduction and focused story.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, in this revised version we focus “on the effects of paralogues to buffer phenotype”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are assertions that I believe are incorrect.</p><p>For example, lines 110-113: &quot;Because mutations in none of the other four zebrafish paralogous mef2 genes have been reported, their function is unknown. These paralogs have human orthologs, MEF2A, MEF2B and MEF2D, that do not appear to be critical for craniofacial development46-48.&quot; Reference 46 and perhaps the others does NOT address the question of whether these genes are required for craniofacial development – ref 46 says mef2d fusion proteins are associated with cancer. These are somatic gain-of-function mutations and irrelevant to the matter at hand, which is complete whole animal loss of function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that only “complete whole animal loss of function” is relevant to the matter at hand and have revised this section accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example, lines 307-311: &quot;Data showing that paralog transcriptional adaptation does not account for the phenotypic differences between the low- and high-penetrance strains34 do not rule out the possibility that selective breeding changed paralog expression between strains in mef2ca wild types.&quot; Reference 34 is the classic Force et al. paper and is not the correct reference – I think you meant to use reference 52.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this – thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example, lines 364-367: &quot;We detected mef2d transcripts in the anterior arch population of 24 hpf wild-type cranial neural crest cells, and mef2d expression is significantly lower in the high-penetrance strain compared with the high-penetrance strain&quot; I think you meant to compare high and low penetrance strains.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this – thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are other examples of assertions that are a bit glib and that distract from the strength of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully edited and revised the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Terminology is used loosely or incorrectly.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include a section defining terms and have taken great care to use them correctly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I find in the literature the use of between-individual as well as among-individual, and that between-individual is used more often.

The authors at one point talk about this experiment as simply &quot;removing&quot; the paralogue (line 343). At that point, I had assumed the new mutations were being generated within the strain that was being studied – that is the easiest way to interpret &quot;remove&quot;. Instead, paralogue mutations are induced elsewhere and bred into strains for study. The rationale for the experimental design is complicated and should be explicitly set forward. I would ask the authors to make clearer within the Results section how they generated the new mutations in the paralogues and how these were introduced into various strains and what precisely was examined. The entire exposition is a bit buried in Lines 336 – 338 paralogs. &quot;For all paralog functional experiments, we introduced the relevant paralog mutation into the low-penetrance strain, then maintained by outcrossing to unselected AB.&quot; This is not a complete sentence. The details of this experiment are really important.</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified in the Results section how each paralog was mutagenized and maintained and provide details of the experiment in the relevant section. While we agree that a more elegant approach would be to perform the experiments in true breeding low-penetrance strains, this was not feasible due to time and space constraints (for example, rederiving new low-penetrance strain after crossing in the <italic>mef2cb</italic> allele). We are careful with our language to indicate that the <italic>mef2cb</italic> allele needed to be introduced by crossing into the low-penetrance background. Further we describe how after initially introducing the CRISPR/Cas9 lesions in the low-penetrance strain they were maintained outcrossing to an unselected AB background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other point that needs to be better explained and clarified is their model in Figure 9. The mechanistic implications of the illustration are vague, but to me there appears to be focus on the roles of enhancers – the figure seems to imply (i) that enhancers acquire mutations that diminish expression of the paralogue and (ii) that under selection the enhancer acquires mutations that result in increased expression of the gene. I would think rather that standing variation arises prior to the selection – and this might be illustrated in the figure. Nevertheless, it seems from the data that the expression levels of all the paralogues may be coordinately regulated – and this idea seems to supported in the Discussion. If all the paralogues are expressed at low levels in the high penetrance strain and at higher levels in the low penetrance strain, then it is more likely that variation is not being driven at the level of each paralogue's enhancer but rather by some factor working in trans. That idea is really missing from Figure 9 – and since it is a summary illustration of what the authors think, getting this Figure right is important. In truth, I would have liked to see a few crosses between strains to test the idea that a single modifier working in trans is responsible for all the effects – THAT would have been both relatively easy to test and killer interesting as a result. But without such an experiment, the authors need to be very clear about alternate possible interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that getting this figure right is important. We completely revised our graphical model to summarize and illustrate the conclusions from this work.</p><p>Regarding crosses between strains: We previously published the hybridization experiment this reviewer suggests (Nichols et al. <italic>Development,</italic> 2016). Briefly, we crossed low- and high-penetrance individuals to each other. In this experiment: “We found that the F1 progeny had a mean phenotype between that of the parental lines, although the distribution of penetrance in the two F1 families differed slightly and both were skewed towards higher penetrance.” We further interpreted these data (and other data in the 2016 manuscript) to indicate that penetrance is inherited as a threshold character. In this model, inheritance of continuous variables results in an outwardly discontinuous phenotypic value. Our new work here indicates that the continuous variables we predicted are paralog expression levels, and the discontinuous phenotype is penetrance (a phenotype is present or not).</p><p>Finally, in that work our data supported a model where a few genetic factors control penetrance. In other words, it is oligogenic inheritance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have extensively revised and added new data to their manuscript in response to the initial round of reviews. The language is generally more precise and concise, and sections lacking clarity are improved or have been removed. I especially appreciate that they now explain the breeding scheme by which the paralog mutant alleles were established and maintained, as the phenotype prevalences are now better in line with what the reader is led to predict.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments which improved the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
