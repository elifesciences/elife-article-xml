feature in gene regulatory networks, how it evolves and affects network structure and function is not well understood. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the phosphate starvation (PHO) responsive transcription factors Pho4 and Pho2 are required for gene induction and survival during phosphate starvation. In the related human commensal <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, Pho4 is required but Pho2 is dispensable for survival in phosphate starvation and is only partially required for inducing PHO genes. Phylogenetic survey suggests that reduced dependence on Pho2 evolved in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and closely related species. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, less Pho2-dependent Pho4 orthologs induce more genes. In <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, its Pho4 binds to more locations and induces three times as many genes as Pho4 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> does. Our work shows how evolution of combinatorial regulation allows for rapid expansion of a gene regulatory network’s targets, possibly extending its physiological functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The diversity of life on Earth has intrigued generations of scientists and nature lovers alike. Research over recent decades has revealed that much of the diversity we can see did not require the invention of new genes. Instead, living forms diversified mostly by using old genes in new ways – for example, by changing when or where an existing gene became active. This kind of change is referred to as “regulatory evolution”.</p><p>A class of proteins called transcription factors are hot spots in regulatory evolution. These proteins recognize specific sequences of DNA to control the activity of other genes, and so represent the “readers” of the genetic information. Small changes to how a transcription factor is regulated, or the genes it targets, can lead to dramatic changes in an organism. Before we can understand how life on Earth evolved to be so diverse, scientists must first answer how transcription factors evolve and what consequences this has on their target genes.</p><p>So far, most studies of regulatory evolution have focused on networks of transcription factors and genes that control how an organism develops. He et al. have now studied a regulatory network that is behind a different process, namely how an organism responds to stress or starvation. These two types of regulatory networks are structured differently and work in different ways. These differences made He et al. wonder if the networks evolved differently too.</p><p>The chemical phosphate is an essential nutrient for all living things, and He et al. compared how two different species of yeast responded to a lack of phosphate. The key difference was how much a major transcription factor known as Pho4 depended on a so-called co-activator protein named Pho2 to carry out its role. Baker’s yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), which is commonly used in laboratory experiments, requires both Pho4 and Pho2 to activate about 20 genes when inorganic phosphate is not available in its environment. However, in a related yeast species called <italic>Candida glabrata</italic>, Pho4 has evolved to depend less on Pho2. He et al. went on to show that, as well as being less dependent on Pho2, Pho4 in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> activates more than three times as many genes as Pho4 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> does in the absence of phosphate. These additional gene targets for Pho4 in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> are predicted to extend the network’s activities, and allow it to regulate new process including the yeast’s responses to other types of stress and the building of the yeast’s cell wall.</p><p>Together these findings show a new way that regulatory networks can evolve, that is, by reducing its dependence on the co-activator, a transcription factor can expand the number of genes it targets. This has not been seen for regulatory networks related to development, suggesting that different networks can indeed evolve in different ways. Lastly, because disease-causing microbes are often stressed inside their hosts and <italic>C. glabrata</italic> sometimes infects humans, understanding how this yeast’s response to stress has evolved may lead to new ways to prevent and treat this infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phosphate starvation response</kwd><kwd>evolution of gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>Hemiascomycetes</kwd><kwd><italic>C. glabrata</italic></kwd><kwd>other Hemiascomycete yeast species</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>Bin Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><name><surname>O’Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The phosphate starvation response network in a commensal yeast evolved to expand its downstream targets via changes in the main transcription factor's dependence on its co-activator, potentially altering the physiological response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolution of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is a major source of phenotypic diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wray, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stern and Frankel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prud'homme et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gompel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 1999</xref>). One common feature of GRNs is combinatorial regulation by multiple transcription factors (TFs) – for example, the co-regulation of circadian gene expression in cyanobacteria by both the cell-autonomous clock and the external conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Espinosa et al., 2015</xref>), and the determination of cell fates by multiple ‘selector genes’ in animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mann and Carroll, 2002</xref>). Not only is combinatorial regulation important for GRN function, it also contributes to its evolution through changes in protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kirschner and Gerhart, 2006</xref>, chap. 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tsong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brayer et al., 2011</xref>). The consequences of such changes can be either conserved network output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsong et al., 2006</xref>) or evolution of new network function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tuch et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite a rich literature on GRN evolution, few studies have documented the evolution of combinatorial regulation and its influence on network structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tuch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the existing literature on GRN evolution is strongly biased towards developmental networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stern, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peter and Davidson, 2011</xref>). While such networks provide attractive attributes, such as visible phenotypes and well-resolved genetic underpinning, it has been suggested that network architecture strongly influences the tempo and mode of its evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erwin and Davidson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wittkopp, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear whether all GRNs follow similar or different rules during their evolution.</p><p>To approach this question we studied the regulatory divergence in the phosphate starvation (PHO) response network in yeast. For three reasons, this system is well suited for our question. First, starvation/stress response networks differ in architecture from developmental networks, leading us to expect differences in their evolutionary patterns. Second, the GRN controlling the PHO response has been well studied in the model yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, providing a solid foundation for comparative analyses. Third, the two species we focus on, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and a human commensal and opportunistic pathogen <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, occupy distinct ecological niches but share ~90% of their gene repertoire and have an average of ~67% protein sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabaldón et al., 2013</xref>), enabling us to trace the evolution of the network by studying the function of orthologous regulatory proteins.</p><p>Phosphate is an essential nutrient for all organisms. To maintain phosphate homeostasis, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> activates a phosphate starvation pathway in response to limitation for inorganic phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ogawa et al., 2000</xref>). In phosphate replete conditions, the transcription factor Pho4 is phosphorylated and localized to the cytoplasm, and phosphate response genes (PHO genes) are not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Neill et al., 1996</xref>). As the concentration of extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi) drops, cells activate the phosphate starvation response and the dephosphorylated Pho4 is imported into the nucleus, where it functions together with the homeodomain transcription factor Pho2 to activate PHO gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Neill et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vogel et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbarić et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbaric et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shao et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Although Pho4 binds to ~100 locations in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, it regulates fewer than 30 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). Only genes at which Pho2 and Pho4 bind cooperatively in the promoter region are activated, indicating that Pho2 increases the selectivity of the gene set induced in response to phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, Pho4 and Pho2 orthologs (hereinafter referred to as CgPho4 and CgPho2) exist, but unlike Pho4 and Pho2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (hereinafter referred to as ScPho4 and ScPho2), CgPho4 can induce gene expression in the absence of CgPho2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerwin and Wykoff, 2009</xref>). This change in the dependence on the co-activator is not due to a higher expression level of CgPho4 or changes in the promoter regions of its target genes, and therefore is likely the result of alterations in the function of CgPho4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerwin and Wykoff, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We investigated the evolution of the PHO pathway in a diverse group of yeast species known as Hemiascomycetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Knop, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diezmann et al., 2004</xref>), which includes but is not limited to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, <italic>K. lactis</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>Y. lypolitica</italic>, and found that <italic>PHO4</italic> and <italic>PHO2</italic> are conserved as single copy genes in this group. We first evaluated Pho4 orthologs from a representative set of this group of species for their ability to activate gene expression in the absence of Pho2 in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> background – this allowed us to establish that the reduced dependence on Pho2 evolved in a species clade that includes <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, two other human commensal yeasts and an environmental species. We then used functional genomics to assess the consequence of reduced Pho2 dependence on gene expression. Finally, we identified the <italic>bona fide</italic> targets of Pho4 in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and compared them to Pho4 targets in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Our results show that evolution of combinatorial regulation, in terms of dependence of the major transcription factor on the co-activator, contributes significantly to the evolution of a gene regulatory network’s targets and functions, and as a result may lead to a new physiological response to the stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evolution of Pho2-dependence among Pho4 orthologs in Hemiascomycetes</title><p>We first confirmed the previously reported result that deleting <italic>PHO2</italic> in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> does not eliminate expression of the secreted phosphatase encoded by <italic>PMU2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orkwis et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and then demonstrated that, in contrast to ScPho2, CgPho2 is dispensable for survival in phosphate-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). It has been shown that CgPho4 is able to induce phosphatase expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> without ScPho2, strongly suggesting that changes in Pho4 are primarily responsible for the difference in Pho2-dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kerwin and Wykoff, 2009</xref>). To understand whether dependence on Pho2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is the ancestral or the derived state and how this property of Pho4 evolved among related species, we surveyed the activity of Pho4 orthologs from 16 species in the Hemiascomycete class. To isolate the changes in Pho4 activity from the genomic background (e.g. promoter and Pho2 changes), we inserted coding sequences (CDSs) of the 16 Pho4 orthologs into an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> background lacking both the endogenous ScPho4 CDS and the negative regulator of the PHO pathway, Pho80, under the control of the endogenous ScPho4 promoter. Deletion of <italic>PHO80</italic>, the cyclin component of the cyclin-dependent-kinase complex, causes constitutive nuclear localization of Pho4 and de-repression of PHO genes, mimicking phosphate starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O'Neill et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2005</xref>).

To test this prediction, we quantified the number of genes induced by different Pho4 orthologs expressed in an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> background lacking the negative regulator Pho80, which allowed us to focus on Pho4-dependent genes but ignore starvation-induced, Pho4-independent genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). We identified a total of 247 genes that were significantly induced by at least one of the eight Pho4 orthologs in the presence of ScPho2 (False discovery rate &lt; 0.05, fold change &gt; 2). Pho4 from <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, <italic>C. bracarensis</italic>, <italic>N. delphensis</italic> and <italic>C. nivariensis</italic> induced more genes than the Pho2-dependent Pho4 orthologs did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D</xref>), and genes induced by these Pho4 orthologs are largely unaffected when ScPho2 is absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Therefore, DNA binding specificity is conserved between ScPho4 and CgPho4. In contrast, ScPho4 and CgPho4 differ in their dependence of DNA binding on Pho2 – ScPho4 binding is significantly lower when ScPho2 is absent, but CgPho4 binding is largely unaffected by the deletion of ScPho2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

It is therefore plausible that CgPho4 is able to bind to more locations because it can access sites normally occupied by nucleosomes or competitors. To test if nucleosome exclusion plays a role, we mapped the published nucleosome occupancy in phosphate-replete (high Pi) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), where Pho4 is inactive, to the binding peaks identified in this study.

It is worth noting, however, that the small sample size in the CgPho4 bound only class (11) may have precluded us from detecting small differences.

We identified a total of 100 binding peaks for CgPho4 in the presence of CgPho2 under phosphate-limited conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). CgPho4 recognizes the same ‘CACGTG’ motif as it does in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Materials and methods), and the consensus motif is present in 51 of the 100 peaks, with the rest containing a one-bp mismatch (46) or two-bp mismatches (3).

In terms of constraint, the core transcriptional regulator Pho4 is conserved as a single copy gene and regulates the phosphate starvation response in distantly related species such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeh et al., 2016</xref>). Second, the mechanism for regulating Pho4 activity in response to phosphate starvation is conserved between <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> – in both species, Pho4 nuclear localization is phosphorylation-dependent, controlled by homologous cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kerwin and Wykoff, 2012</xref>). Third, both CgPho4 and ScPho4 recognize the E-box motif ‘CACGTG’ (Materials and methods). Together, these results show that the master TF – its identity, DNA-binding specificity and the mechanism of its regulation – are highly constrained during evolution. This is consistent with previous findings showing that the identity and sequence specificity of a TF evolve much more slowly compared to its target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>What has changed throughout evolution in the PHO response network is the combinatorial regulation by Pho4 and Pho2, leading to changes in the network targets. Specifically, while <italic>PHO2</italic> as a gene is conserved among all 16 species examined, its functional role in the regulation of the PHO network has been dramatically reduced in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>. This, in turn, led to a dramatic expansion of the targets of CgPho4, potentially extending the function of the network beyond phosphate homeostasis. While the mechanism for this reduction in co-activator dependence is not clear, both transcriptional and binding assays are consistent with the hypothesis that CgPho4 evolved to be stronger in DNA-binding and in inducing gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Compared to previous findings in GRN evolution, two differences are worth noting. Unlike previous studies which found conserved network output despite regulatory rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Habib et al., 2012</xref>), we observed a significant change in the size of the regulon (~20 target genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> vs.~70 in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>), despite a significantly shorter evolutionary time between the two focal species in this study compared to one of the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tsong et al., 2006</xref>). This may be attributable to the different properties of the GRNs: previous studies have focused on developmental GRNs, whose target genes often constitute a cohesive module that function collectively to specify cell fates. By contrast, the target genes of stress response networks are more independently organized, either acting alone or in small subgroups, e.g. polyphosphate synthesis and phosphate transporters. The organization of a stress response GRN may allow it to be more evolutionarily plastic in acquiring and shedding targets as the environment shifts, creating new demands while eliminating old ones. Consistent with this view, previous studies showed that expression divergence evolves more readily among stress responsive genes compared to growth control and general metabolism genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thompson and Regev, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A second difference worth noting is the mechanism by which the target expansion occurred. Because the DNA sequence specificity of a TF is highly constrained during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maerkl and Quake, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Struhl, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nitta et al., 2015</xref>), it is traditionally thought that gain and loss of targets occurs primarily through <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory evolution via gain or loss of DNA motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peter and Davidson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ihmels et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wittkopp and Kalay, 2011</xref>). However, we find that <italic>trans</italic> evolution in CgPho4, which conserved the core DNA binding specificity and thus the existing targets, altered its dependence on the co-activator, and resulted in a dramatic expansion in its targets. Compared to target turnover via <italic>cis</italic> regulatory changes, this <italic>trans</italic> evolutionary mechanism is likely much more rapid, and may allow natural selection to quickly sample many potential targets at once. However, it should be noted that the reduction in Pho2-dependence likely evolved gradually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>), which means <italic>cis</italic> evolution could have accompanied the <italic>trans</italic> – while Pho4 expands its targets, promoter evolution could result in fixation of beneficial targets while removing spurious, non-beneficial ones. Thus, the full picture is likely far more complex.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that evolution of combinatorial regulation can lead to rapid rewiring of a gene regulatory network. In the PHO network, this could provide a convenient ‘switch’ for evolution to rapidly alter the size of the network output instead of relying on individual promoter alterations. More generally, changes affecting the interaction between transcription factors and their cofactors may be an important yet underappreciated mechanism underlying gene regulatory network evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Slattery et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Expansion in the function of the PHO regulon and its implication for the stresses faced by <italic>C. glabrata</italic></title><p>Only 16 of the 79 genes directly induced by CgPho4 in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> are involved in maintaining phosphate homeostasis. Among the remaining genes, a significant number (25 genes) are predicted to be involved in responses to non-phosphate related stresses, including osmotic (seven genes) and oxidative (seven genes) stresses. In addition to roles in other stress responses, a smaller group of CgPho4 targets (9 and 3 genes) have potential functions in cell wall synthesis and cell adhesion, two traits that were known to be relevant for survival and virulence in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atanasova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Las Peñas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luo and Samaranayake, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jawhara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fabre et al., 2014</xref>). A similar observation has been made before in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, where limitation of nicotinic acid was sufficient to induce genes mediating a cellular adhesion phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Domergue et al., 2005</xref>). Intriguingly, Pho4 in <italic>C. albicans</italic> has been shown to be important for survival under particular types of osmotic and oxidative stresses, suggesting a similar functional expansion as we observed in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikeh et al., 2016</xref>). Also in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, phosphate starvation was linked to enhanced virulence, and a strain lacking Pho4 displayed extensive filamentation in response to phosphate limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Romanowski et al., 2012</xref>). Combining these observations, we speculate that stress responses in the commensal species may have evolved to be more coordinated, and may have acquired new targets linked to virulence, to cope with the distinct stress profiles in the host, such as spatiotemporally overlapping challenges exerted by the host immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kasper et al., 2015</xref>). Characterizing other stress response pathways in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, and in other commensal species such as <italic>C. albicans</italic>, can test this hypothesis and will shed further light on the architectural differences in the stress and starvation response network compared to that in the free-living species.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains</title><p>All <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains were generated from EY0057 (K699 <italic>ade2-1 trp1-1 can1-100 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ura3</italic> GAL+), using a standard high efficiency transformation protocol with ~ 40 bp homology sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gietz and Schiestl, 2007</xref>).

De novo motif discovery using RSAT (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008560">SCR_008560</ext-link>) Peak-motifs algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomas-Chollier et al., 20112012</xref>) identified ‘CACAGA’ as the top motif, which appears in 126 of the 380 (33.16%) peaks that have FE &gt; 4. It bears no similarity with the in vitro identified ScPho2 motif (‘ATTA’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhao et al., 2009</xref>). Nor did it match any known motifs of yeast transcription factors (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006893">SCR_006893</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Boer and Hughes, 2012</xref>). In subsequent analyses, we used CgPho2 ChIP peaks for categorizing CgPho4 binding sites into ones co-bound by CgPho2 or those bound by CgPho4 only.</p><p>After the automatic peak calling, we manually curated the peaks with visual help from a genome browser tool, MochiView (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000259">SCR_000259</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Homann and Johnson, 2010</xref>). We calculated a fold enrichment trace for each ChIP sample by comparing it to its matching input (or mock, in case of ChIP-exo), using MACS2 following <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/wiki/Build-Signal-Track">https://github.com/taoliu/MACS/wiki/Build-Signal-Track</ext-link>.

We also imported previously published datasets for ScPho4 occupancy in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> with or without ScPho2 in no Pi conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). We then examined each GEM identified ChIP peak, using the height and peak shape to identify spurious binding peaks and false negative ones. The curated datasets are presented as source data accompanying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>To estimate the ratio of ScPho4 and CgPho4 occupancy without vs with Pho2 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we combined the published ScPho4 binding occupancy in no phosphate conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>) with our data for CgPho4 in the <italic>pho80∆</italic> background. For the former, we downloaded the WIG files from the NCBI GEO database for series GSE29506, sample GSM730517 (Pho4_ChIP_NoPi) and GSM730527 (Pho4_ChIP_dPho2_NoPi), and scaled the raw library sizes so that the average coverage per base pair is 1. Then these were analyzed along with our CgPho4 ChIP enrichment in <italic>pho80∆</italic>. For each of the ScPho4 (74) and CgPho4 (115) ChIP peaks, we recorded the maximum value of the normalized read counts for ScPho4 and CgPho4, with or without Pho2, and calculated the ratio between the two. Then the -log<sub>2</sub> transformed values were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A two-sided Student’s t-test was performed to assess the significance of the difference in the group means.</p><p>To investigate the nucleosome and Cbf1 occupancy in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> at sites either bound by CgPho4 only or by both ScPho4 and CgPho4, we used the published data from Table S2 of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>). We first translated the coordinates in the table from sacCer1 into sacCer3 using the Galaxy (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_006281">SCR_006281</ext-link>) tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afgan et al., 2016</xref>). We then identified all ‘CACGTG’ motifs overlapping with the ChIP peaks for ScPho4 or CgPho4 identified in this study using GenomicsRanges package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>), and extracted the corresponding ‘Nucleosomes.High.Pi’ and ‘Cbf1.Enrichment.High.Pi’ values from the table. Finally, the occupancy or enrichment are plotted separately for sites bound by both ScPho4 and CgPho4, and sites bound by only CgPho4. A two-sided Student’s t-test was performed to assess the significance of the difference in the group means.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Identification of CgPho4 targets in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. glabrata</italic></title><p>To identify ScPho4 and CgPho4 induced genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and CgPho4 induced genes in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, we assigned each ChIP peak to the nearest gene(s) on both sides, provided that the ChIP peak is upstream (in the 5’ UTR) of the gene, and queried the gene induction results from the RNA-seq experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper presents a nice set of experiments describing functional divergence of a specific transcription factors activity (Pho4) is budding yeast, and show that this divergence results from differential dependence on its co-activator. Both reviewers appreciated the topic and your study. However, they also noted that, as written, the study appears very specific and is unlikely to appeal to a broad audience.</p><p>This can be addressed through modified writing, which will introduce, motivate and explain your study in a broader context, perhaps including some of the suggestions given by reviewer #2.</p><p>In addition, please address all other comments by the reviewers, as described below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, He, Zhou and O'Shea investigate the evolution of Pho-pathway regulation by comparing Pho4 transcription factors from several different yeast species in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> background. They use traditional assays (Figures 1, 2) as well as genomic approaches such as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq. Overall, the experimental approach seems solid and the claims and conclusion in the paper are generally very well supported by the data. Moreover, the statistical analysis of the genomics data seems solid as well.</p><p>The main conclusion is that losing a dependence on the transcription factor Pho2 allowed the transcription factor Pho4 to activate more genes and possibly also other stress response pathways in addition to the phosphate starvation pathway and this seems well supported by the data. However, although technically sound the authors could do more to make observations of general interest which is appropriate for a journal such as <italic>eLife</italic> with a wide readership. That is, it would be great if the authors could better explain what general implications losing the Pho2-dependence has and what readers, who do not work on phosphate, can learn from this?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors examine the role of the transcription factors Pho4 and Pho2 in the yeast phosphate response pathways. In the model <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the activity of Pho4 is dependent on its co-activator Pho2. In the <italic>Candida glabrata</italic>clade, this dependency appears to be lost and Pho4 has an expended set of target genes, including genes that are not directly related to phosphate starvation. The authors conclude that the loss of dependency has allowed for the gain of new target genes by this transcriptional regulator. The study is well performed and the evidence is based on several types of experiments that support the underlying model, including the comparison of several species in parallel. The manuscript is well written and the flow is smooth and clear.</p><p>My major concern is the lack of larger perspective on evolution or cell biology that would make the paper appealing to the larger audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. Although the title is broad and suggests that the authors study a general phenomenon, the Abstract and the article are narrowed down on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the specific PHO pathway. Unless one is interested in the biology of yeast or of this pathway, the interest for the findings could be limited because it may be difficult to see how this relates to larger questions. I do not question the fact that the findings have broader impacts (and exciting) but I could appreciate the broader impact because of my scientific background, not because of the way the paper is presented. I believe this can be largely easily answered by first stating what we know about the evolution of regulatory pathways, what we do not know and why we need to address this lack of knowledge. Then, present the evolution of this pathway across yeast species as an opportunity to address it. For instance, how transcriptional regulators gain new target genes is a very important question, particularly in the view of the constraints that the authors mention in the Discussion (subsection “Evolutionary constraint and plasticity in the PHO response network”, third paragraph).

Although the title is broad and suggests that the authors study a general phenomenon, the Abstract and the article are narrowed down on S. cerevisiae and the specific PHO pathway. Unless one is interested in the biology of yeast or of this pathway, the interest for the findings could be limited because it may be difficult to see how this relates to larger questions. I do not question the fact that the findings have broader impacts (and exciting) but I could appreciate the broader impact because of my scientific background, not because of the way the paper is presented. I believe this can be largely easily answered by first stating what we know about the evolution of regulatory pathways, what we do not know and why we need to address this lack of knowledge. Then, present the evolution of this pathway across yeast species as an opportunity to address it. For instance, how transcriptional regulators gain new target genes is a very important question, particularly in the view of the constraints that the authors mention in the Discussion (subsection “Evolutionary constraint and plasticity in the PHO response network”, third paragraph). Maybe the impact of the paper would be broadened if these questions were addressed in the Introduction. For instance, combinatorial TF regulation may actually allow for rapid rewiring of transcription programs by changing TF-TF interactions rather than changing many binding sites or the binding specificity of specific TFs.</italic> </p><p>We agree that placing our work in the broad context of regulatory evolution, and discussing the implications to other systems will greatly improve the appeal and impact of our work. To achieve this, we modified the Abstract and the beginning paragraph of the Introduction to place our work in the backdrop of gene regulatory evolution in general. After framing the importance of the problem and challenges, we focus on the central theme of our work – combinatorial regulation. We explained two shortcomings in the literature: few studies have analyzed evolutionary changes in combinatorial regulation and its effects on network function; and a strong bias in previous studies towards developmental networks. Our work targets these gaps by dissecting a known regulatory divergence involving combinatorial control in the phosphate starvation (PHO) response network in yeast. As starvation and stress response networks have very different architectures compared to developmental networks, our study will help identify shared and distinct evolutionary patterns across these two network types. We also significantly modified the first section of Discussion – instead of focusing on the PHO network itself, we compared our findings to existing knowledge of gene regulatory network evolution, pointing out similarities and differences from other types of GRNs. In particular, we focused on two topics – constraint and plasticity in GRN evolution – where we proposed that evolution of co-activator dependence provides a mechanism for rapid gain or loss of network targets compared to individual promoter evolution.</p><p>We hope that these revisions have improved our manuscript, helping it to reach a broad audience and resonate with researchers studying regulatory evolution in other systems.</p><p><italic>Other comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>Several experiments are performed in genetic backgrounds in which PHO80 is deleted but I could not find the justification for this nor if this had an impact on the results and their interpretation.</italic> </p><p><italic>PHO80</italic> encodes the cyclin component of the cyclin-dependent-kinase (CDK) complex Pho80-Pho85, which negatively regulates Pho4 nuclear localization through phosphorylation (Kaffman et al. 1994; O’Neill et al. 1996). <italic>pho80∆</italic> thus genetically mimics the effect of phosphate starvation by causing Pho4 to be dephosphorylated and constitutively localized inside the nucleus in its functional form (Huang and O’Shea 2005).</p><p>The use of <italic>pho80∆</italic> instead of phosphate starvation serves two purposes in our study. First, for the phosphatase assay (Figure 2), it allowed us to decouple the activity of Pho4 orthologs from the viability of the strain carrying them. This means we can measure Pho4 ortholog activity even if the ortholog cannot activate the PHO response and therefore does not support growth on phosphate-limited medium. Second, because the central goal of our study is to dissect the evolution of Pho4 activity and how it influences network output, <italic>pho80∆</italic> allowed us to focus on the downstream targets of Pho4, ignoring starvation-induced but Pho4-independent genes.</p><p>To help explain the use of <italic>pho80∆</italic> in place of starvation, we described the role of phosphorylation in regulating Pho4 activity in the Introduction, added two sentences at the end of the first paragraph in the Results section, and explained the reason for using <italic>pho80∆</italic> in the second Results section.</p><p>We also verified that in the <italic>pho80∆</italic> background we can recapitulate the genes induced by ScPho4 under phosphate starvation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Four of the 28 genes previously identified as ScPho4 targets (Zhou and O’Shea 2011) are not included because of updated annotation in the latest genome release. Twenty of the 24 remaining genes are induced in <italic>pho80∆</italic> in a ScPho4-dependent manner. Three of the remaining four genes show more than two-fold induction by Pho4 in <italic>pho80∆</italic>, with <italic>P</italic>-values just over the threshold (0.05 after multi-test correction). We conclude that Pho4 targets identified in <italic>pho80∆</italic> closely recapitulate those identified under phosphate starvation.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><bold/>Venn diagram showing overlap of genes induced by ScPho4 in the <italic>pho80∆</italic> vs. in phosphate starvation conditions (data from Zhou and O’Shea 2011).</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-25157-resp-fig1-v3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></fig><p><italic>Subsection “In C. glabrata CgPho4 binds to DNA and activates gene expression largely independent of Pho2”, first paragraph: It could be useful to discuss the fact that the dependency does not need to be qualitative but could be quantitative.

In fact, our phylogenetic survey using the quantitative phosphatase assay revealed substantial variation in the extent of Pho2 dependence among Pho4 orthologs from the <italic>glabrata</italic>clade species (Figure 2B). Treated as a quantitative trait, the extent of Pho2-dependence strongly correlates (negatively) with the number of genes induced in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> background (Figure 3C, D). To emphasize the quantitative nature of the trait, we added a sentence at the end of the first Results section – “Notably, the extent of the reduction varies between the <italic>glabrata</italic>clade Pho4 orthologs, suggesting that the strength of combinatorial regulation is a quantitative trait that can be fine-tuned by mutations during evolution.” We also mentioned this in the Discussion section titled “Evolutionary Constraint and Plasticity in the PHO response network” – “However, it should be pointed out that the reduction in Pho2-dependence likely evolved gradually (Figure 2B, 3C), which means <italic>cis</italic> evolution could have accompanied the <italic>trans</italic> – while Pho4 expands its targets, promoter evolution could result in fixation of beneficial targets while removing spurious, non-beneficial ones.”</p><p><italic>Subsection “Pho4 direct targets in C. glabrata may function beyond phosphate homeostasis”: A great addition to the novelty of the paper and its impact on evolution would be to see whether the genes that are specifically regulated by Pho4 in the C. glabrata clade were &quot;ready&quot; to be Pho4 regulated. For instance, if these genes had already Pho4 binding sites before the loss of Pho2 dependency, this would show that the recruitment of new genes in a circuit proceeds first by the gain of TF binding sites and then by changes in trans-regulators. The authors discuss this possibility but it seems that a simple reconstruction of the history of the TF binding sites through bioinformatics analysis could be enough to test this model, at least partly.</italic> </p><p>This is an intriguing question. To rephrase it, the question is “Does CgPho4 gain its new targets by exploiting cryptic DNA motifs not accessible to the ancestral Pho4?” We have considered this question and performed an analysis similar to what reviewer #2 suggested. Specifically, we took CgPho4 direct targets identified both in its own genome and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and looked for gene orthology relationships. We found that the only CgPho4 targets that are orthologous with one another in the two species backgrounds were those involved in phosphate homeostasis, e.g. <italic>PHO84</italic>.</p><p>Does this mean all of CgPho4’s new targets in its own genome were de novo gains through promoter evolution? We think not. Then why can’t we identify <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genes that are orthologs of CgPho4 targets in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and still retain the ability to be regulated by CgPho4? We think this is most likely because short DNA sequence motifs are rapidly gained and lost during evolution. Cryptic motifs – those that are inaccessible to the TF – are especially vulnerable to such a turnover process due to lack of purifying selection. As a result, the ancestral cryptic Pho4 motifs that were exploited by CgPho4 are almost certainly lost in the modern <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, explaining our observation of no overlap in this case.</p><p>In the text, we included a section at the end of the Results section to explain the logic above. “It is worth mentioning that, although CgPho4 induces more genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as well as in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, there is virtually no overlap between its targets in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>, except for those involved in phosphate homeostasis (as shown in Figure 6A).”</p><p><italic>Finally, it would be interesting to know how the dependency of TF evolves, is it by gain and losses of protein-protein interactions among TFs? It is known for instance that Pho4 and Pho2 interact with each other in S. cerevisiae – was this interaction lost in C. glabrata? This is not required for the paper to be complete but would be a great addition.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this an outstanding question, and we are actively planning on resolving it. At the moment, although the detailed molecular mechanism of how CgPho4 became less Pho2-dependent is not clear, both our transcriptional and binding assay results are consistent with the hypothesis that CgPho4 evolved to be stronger in DNA-binding and in inducing gene expression, making it less dependent on Pho2 (Figure 4).</p><p>Regarding the interaction between CgPho4 and CgPho2, it is clearly not lost – our ChIP-exo data showed co-localization of CgPho2 to the majority of CgPho4 bound sites, and that in a small fraction of CgPho4 bound sites, its binding is weakened or lost when CgPho2 is deleted. In fact, loss or reduction of Pho4-Pho2 interaction is not likely to be behind the observed reduced dependence, because a mutant of ScPho4 unable to interact with ScPho2 has significantly decreased, rather than enhanced activity (Springer et al. 2003).</p><p>In the Discussion section titled “Evolutionary Constraint and Plasticity in the PHO response network”, we added a sentence explaining our favored hypothesis – “While the mechanism for this reduction in co-activator dependence is not clear, both transcriptional and binding assays are consistent with the hypothesis that CgPho4 evolved to be stronger in DNA-binding and in inducing gene expression (Figure 4).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
