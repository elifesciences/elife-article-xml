Heterozygous mutations in the PHOX2B coding region are responsible for the occurrence of Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS), a rare neurological disorder characterised by inadequate chemosensitivity and life-threatening sleep-related hypoventilation. Animal studies suggest that chemoreflex defects are caused in part by the improper development or function of PHOX2B expressing neurons in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), a central hub for CO<sub>2</sub> chemosensitivity. Although the function of PHOX2B in rodents during development is well established, its role in the adult respiratory network remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether reduction in PHOX2B expression in chemosensitive neuromedin-B (NMB) expressing neurons in the RTN altered respiratory function. Four weeks following local RTN injection of a lentiviral vector expressing the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting <italic>Phox2b</italic> mRNA, a reduction of PHOX2B expression was observed in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons compared to both naive rats and rats injected with the non-target shRNA. PHOX2B knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but ventilation was significantly impaired during hypercapnia. PHOX2B knockdown did not alter <italic>Nmb</italic> expression but it was associated with reduced expression of both <italic>Task2</italic> and <italic>Gpr4</italic>, two CO<sub>2</sub>/pH sensors in the RTN. We conclude that PHOX2B in the adult brain has an important role in CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception and reduced PHOX2B expression in CCHS beyond the developmental period may contribute to the impaired central chemoreflex function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PHOX2B</kwd><kwd>shRNA</kwd><kwd>retrotrapezoid nucleus</kwd><kwd>chemoreception</kwd><kwd>plethysmography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Scheme Grant 486764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagliardini</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Women and Children Health Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Innovation Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pagliardini</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Lung Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardani</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janes</surname><given-names>Tara A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Knockdown of PHOX2B in the chemosensitive area of the retrotrapezoid nucleus of adult rats reduces CO<sub>2</sub> responses and the expression of the proton sensors TASK2 and GPR4.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Paired Like Homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) is a transcription factor essential for embryonic differentiation and for the maintenance of the neuronal phenotype of different classes of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and Pattyn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pattyn et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pattyn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stanke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tiveron et al., 1996</xref>). In recent years, the PHOX2B gene has been extensively investigated, not only for its neurodevelopmental role, but also because its heterozygous mutation leads to Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS, OMIM 209880; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>), Hirschsprung’s disease (HSCR; OMIM 142623; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry-Kravis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trochet et al., 2005</xref>), and neuroblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourdeaut et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Limpt et al., 2004</xref>).

The most frequent PHOX2B mutation is an expansion of a polyalanine repeat, ranging from +5 to +13 residues on the C-terminal of PHOX2B, an area that regulates DNA binding affinity and protein solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Lascio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weese-Mayer et al., 2003</xref>). CCHS symptoms present with varying degrees of severity depending on the expansion of the mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berry-Kravis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Di Lascio et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matera et al., 2004</xref>). In most mild cases, patients display normal ventilation during wakefulness, hypoventilation during sleep leading to hypercarbia and hypoxemia, as well as a lack of sensitivity and discomfort to these challenges. In the most severe of cases, hypoventilation may also be present while awake.</p><p>Respiratory disturbances resulting from the PHOX2B mutations appear to stem from its widespread expression in respiratory-related neurons both during development and into adulthood. Although PHOX2B is absent in respiratory rhythmogenic neurons of the preBötzinger complex, it is highly expressed in adult neurons that are responsible for CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> chemoreflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2007</xref>). Among those are the neurons of the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN), the locus coeruleus, the carotid bodies and the nucleus of the solitary tract that, together with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve and the area postrema, make up to the dorsal vagal complex, a structure that provides the major integrative centre for the mammalian autonomic nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cutsforth-Gregory and Benarroch, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zoccal et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work by our group and others specifically investigated the role of PHOX2B-expressing RTN neurons by either selective lesions or inactivation of neuronal activity of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marina et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nattie and Li, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Souza et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janes et al., 2024</xref>) and showed that RTN neurons have a key role in central CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreception.</p><p>Defects observed in the CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreflex of CCHS transgenic rodent models are primarily caused by the improper development or function of PHOX2B-expressing neurons in the RTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>), although anatomo-pathological studies in CCHS patients suggest that the respiratory impairment may be caused by a more widespread brain dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nobuta et al., 2015</xref>). Transgenic mice born with PHOX2B knockout fail to develop the RTN, the locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>) and catecholaminergic groups in A1, A2, A5, and A7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pattyn et al., 2000</xref>), as well as neurons of the nucleus of the solitary tract and the carotid bodies. Mice harbouring heterozygous PHOX2B knockout develop apparently normal but have depressed responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dauger et al., 2003</xref>) and sleep disordered breathing in the perinatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Durand et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of the most common heterozygous PHOX2B mutation found in CCHS patients (PHOX2B+7 Ala expansion) in mice results in a near complete loss of RTN neurons, impaired CO<sub>2</sub> response and consequent death in the newborn period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takakura et al., 2008</xref>). More selective expression of the mutant PHOX2B in the RTN neurons allowed for survival in the neonatal period and partial recovery of the CO<sub>2</sub> response in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ramanantsoa et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Multiple potential cellular mechanisms have been implicated in the aetiology of CCHS, from loss of PHOX2B function in development due to heterozygous mutant PHOX2B expression, to gain of function of the mutated protein that may alter transcriptional activity in neurons, as well as aggregate formation and premature cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachetti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Lascio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubreuil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Durand et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goridis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trochet et al., 2005</xref>). While its role during embryonic neurodevelopment is established, PHOX2B is still expressed in selected neuronal populations in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>) and its function, with the exception of the contribution to the maintenance of the noradrenergic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fan et al., 2011</xref>), is not yet fully understood. Considering the fundamental role of PHOX2B in CCHS pathogenesis and its expression in key structures for CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex responses, it is essential to understand how both wild-type and mutant PHOX2B proteins impact CO<sub>2</sub> homeostasis and ventilation not only across development, but also in adulthood.</p><p>In order to have a better understanding of the role of PHOX2B in the CO<sub>2</sub> homeostatic processes, we used a non-replicating lentivirus vector of two short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones targeting selectively <italic>Phox2b</italic> mRNA to knockdown the expression of PHOX2B in the RTN of adult rats and tested ventilation and chemoreflex responses. In parallel, we also determined whether knockdown of PHOX2B in adult <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN negatively affected their cell survival. Finally, we sought to provide a mechanistic link between PHOX2B expression and the chemosensitive properties of <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN, which have been attributed to two proton sensors, the proton-activated G-protein-coupled receptor (GPR4) and the proton-modulated potassium channel (TASK-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gestreau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guyenet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>). The expression of these sensors is partially overlapping in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN and the genetic deletion of either one impairs the central respiratory chemoreflex with maximal impairment when both sensors are eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gestreau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guyenet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that progressive knockdown of PHOX2B in RTN causes a reduction in the chemoreflex response that was proportional to the decrease in the fraction of <italic>Nmb</italic>/PHOX2B expressing RTN neurons. This effect was associated with a reduction in the expression of <italic>Gpr4</italic> and <italic>Task2</italic> mRNA in <italic>Nmb</italic> expressing cells of the RTN in which PHOX2B was knocked down, suggesting a role for PHOX2B in the transcription of the proton sensors in RTN neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To directly investigate the role of PHOX2B in RTN neurons, we performed selective knockdown of this protein in adult rats through local injection of a non-replicating lentiviral vector of two short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) clones targeting two different sequences of the <italic>Phox2b</italic> mRNA (n=25) or non-target shRNA as control (NT-shRNA; n=23). Initial experiments utilized 200 nl/injection at each of four stereotaxic coordinates (1x10<sup>9</sup> VP/ml; n=14). Four weeks post injection, we assessed ventilatory parameters in room air, hypercapnia, and hypoxia. Interestingly, a small but significant impairment in the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex was observed not only in PHOX2B-shRNA but also in NT-shRNA rats compared to pre-surgical baseline (allometric V<sub>E</sub> in 7% CO<sub>2</sub>: –21% and –24%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Overall, we observed little change in respiration at this time point. During room air, as well as in 5% and 7.2% CO<sub>2</sub>, frequency (ƒ<sub>R</sub>), was reduced in every experimental group (naive, NT-shRNA, PHOX2B-shRNA) compared to baseline (Air: p=0.014; 5% CO<sub>2</sub>: p&lt;0.001; 7.2% CO<sub>2</sub> p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) but no effect on treatment was observed, suggesting that these changes were likely due to the increase in age and body weight during the long-term experiment (naive:+32.2%; NT-shRNA:+27.8%; PHOX2B-shRNA:+28.6% change in body weight).

Two weeks after viral infection, we observed a modest reduction of PHOX2B/<italic>Nmb</italic> expressing neurons in the RTN but no significant changes in basal V<sub>E</sub> or in the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex. Four weeks after shRNA infection, we observed a further reduction in the expression of PHOX2B in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons and a significant reduction of the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex, while ventilation in normoxia or hypoxia was unaffected.

Genetic loss of <italic>Phox2b</italic> expression in mice shows that PHOX2B is essential for the correct development of all autonomic ganglia in sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous system and the distal ganglia of the facial (VII), glossopharyngeal (IX), and vagus (X) cranial nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>), in addition to carotid bodies and the solitary tract nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dauger et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, PHOX2B is involved in the formation of all branchial and visceral hindbrain motor neurons and its absence during the embryonic period impairs the development of motoneurons of the facial, trigeminal, ambiguus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve. PHOX2B is also necessary for the specification and differentiation of the noradrenergic phenotype in multiple centres in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brunet and Pattyn, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pattyn et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the expression of PHOX2B persists into adulthood in selected neuronal populations, such as the ones involved in peripheral and central chemoreception, that is the carotid bodies, the solitary tract nucleus and the RTN, in addition to neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, the area postrema, the nucleus ambiguus, C1 catecholaminergic neurons and other scattered neurons throughout the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stornetta et al., 2006</xref>). Such widespread expression within the adult brain suggests an important transcriptional role in neuronal survival and/or function. With the exception of its role in maintaining the noradrenergic phenotype, its function in the postnatal brain is unknown, in part because a full investigation of its transcriptional activity in neurons has not yet been performed.</p><p>Heterozygote polyalanine expansion mutations in the exon 3 of <italic>PHOX2B</italic> are responsible for the majority of cases of CCHS, a rare genetic disease that affect the autonomic nervous system and central CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Lascio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weese-Mayer et al., 2017</xref>).

Interestingly, despite the small reduction in total <italic>Nmb</italic> cells of the RTN in both NT-shRNA and PHOX2B-shRNA injected rats, possibly due to some off-target effects due to activation of innate immunity or saturation of the microRNA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McBride et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van Gestel et al., 2014</xref>), no significant impairment in ventilation was observed. Even though PHOX2B may be critical for chemosensory function in RTN neurons, the lack of significant ventilatory impairment with a modest reduction of PHOX2B expressing neurons is not surprising.

To support the lack of significant alterations associated with the possible loss of C1 function was the lack of significant changes in the hypoxic response that has been shown to be dependent on C1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although we did not specifically quantify the relative mRNA expression change in intracellular <italic>Phox2b</italic> levels within infected neurons, we measured the success of PHOX2B knockdown by assessing the overall change in the number of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells that had no detectable levels of PHOX2B protein in the nuclei.

When tested in hypercapnia though, PHOX2B-shRNA rats displayed a reduced HCVR compared to both baseline (i.e. pre-surgery), naive and NT-shRNA rats. The impairment of V<sub>E</sub> Allo was primarily a result of blunted V<sub>T</sub>, and analysis of the convective exchange ratio (i.e. V<sub>E</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> ALLO) confirmed hypoventilation in 5% and 7.2% CO<sub>2</sub> only for PHOX2B-shRNA rats, suggesting a specific impairment of chemosensitive properties in RTN neurons with PHOX2B knockdown. These results are in line with previous studies in which medium RTN lesions (i.e. loss of &gt;60% <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup> cells) elicited by saporin toxin injection resulted in a significant CO<sub>2</sub>-chemoreflex impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janes et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Souza et al., 2018</xref>).

These transcriptional changes could also affect neuronal survival. In fact, a small but significant loss of NMB expressing RTN neurons may contribute to the reduction in the CO<sub>2</sub> response, although multiple studies have demonstrated that significant cell loss must occur in the RTN in order to show a respiratory function impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janes et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nattie and Li, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takakura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Takakura et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In our experiments, we observed a 35% reduction in total <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup> cells compared to naive rats and 23% compared to NT-shRNA, possibly due to cell death within the first 14 days post-infection. Interestingly the loss of <italic>Nmb</italic> cells did not increase with time (although the fraction of Nmb<sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> neurons decreased) and the central chemoreflex at 2 weeks post-surgery was not impaired, suggesting that: (i) the observed reduction in overall <italic>Nmb</italic> cell number in RTN occurring in the first 2 weeks is not responsible for the CO<sub>2</sub> chemoreflex impairment that emerges 4 weeks post-infection; (ii) PHOX2B expression is most likely not necessary for neuronal survival of adult <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons of the RTN; (iii) a large reduction in <italic>Nmb</italic> neurons expressing PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> is necessary to impair the HCVR (as we observed at 4 weeks). The interpretation that PHOX2B expression contributes positively to the chemoreflex is further supported by our linear regression analysis showing that <italic>Nmb</italic><sup>+</sup>/PHOX2B<sup>+</sup> cell number was the best predictor of the HCVR (r<sup>2</sup>=0.739).

Rats were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (100 mg/kg+10 mg/kg, respectively; i.p.); the anaesthetic level was assessed by lack of paw pinch reflex and maintenance of a regular breathing rate. Additional anaesthesia was administered as needed. The rat was positioned on a stereotactic apparatus (Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA, USA) and a total of four microinjections (200 or 100 nL per injection; two rostro-caudally aligned injections per side) were made lateral to the midline and ventral to the facial motor nucleus under aseptic conditions.

Injections were made using a glass microelectrode (30  μm diameter tip, Drummond Scientific, PA, USA). Twenty-five rats (8 rats 200 nl/injection; 17 rats 100 nl/injection) underwent shRNA viral injection (PHOX2B-shRNA) and 23 rats (6 rats 200 nl/injection; 17 rats 100 nl/injection) received a non-target shRNA viral injection (NT-shRNA; SHC016: MISSION pLKO.1-puro non-Target shRNA Control Plasmid DNA; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MA, USA) to determine any effects of surgery and viral constructs on respiratory behaviour. Rats were randomly assigned to treatment group. Eight naive rats, receiving no surgery and maintained in the same housing conditions, were used as additional controls for both respiratory function and anatomical experiments. Following each injection, the glass electrodes were left in place for 3–5 min to minimize backflow of virus up the electrode track. At the end of the surgery, the incision was sutured, and rats received local anaesthetic bupivacaine (0.1 mL, s.c.) and were treated with metacam analgesic for 72 hr. Rats recovered for 7 days before the next respiratory function testing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data acquisition and analysis of respiratory measurements</title><p>Rats were habituated to whole-body plethysmography chambers (Buxco, 5 L) once, 3–4 days before baseline recordings.

PHOX2B has an important transcriptional role in neuronal survival and/or function, and mutations of PHOX2B severely impair the development and function of the autonomic nervous system and RTN, resulting in the developmental genetic disease congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) in neonates, where the RTN may not form and is functionally impaired. The function of the wild-type PHOX2B protein in adult RTN neurons that continue to express PHOX2B is unknown. By utilizing a viral PHOX2B-shRNA approach for the knockdown of PHOX2B specifically in RTN neurons, the authors' solid results show impaired ventilatory responses to elevated inspired CO2, measured by whole-body plethysmography in freely behaving adult rats, that develop progressively over a four-week period in vivo, indicating effects on RTN neuron transcriptional activity and associated blunting of the CO2 ventilatory response.

Dysfunction in this area is associated with the neuropathology of congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS). The subsequent examination of these rats aimed to shed light on the intricate aspects of RTN and its implications for central chemoreception and disorders like CCHS in adults. They found that using the short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting Phox2b mRNA, a reduction of Phox2b expression was observed in Nmb neurons. In addition, Phox2b knockdown did not affect breathing in room air or under hypoxia, but the hypercapnia ventilatory response was significantly impaired. They concluded that Phox2b in the adult brain has an important role in CO2 chemoreception. They thought that their findings provided new evidence for mechanisms related to CCHS neuropathology. The conclusions of this paper are well supported by data, but careful discussion seems to be required for comparison with the results of various previous studies performed by different genetic strategies for the RTN neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The most exciting aspect of this work is the modelling of the Phox2b knockdown in one element of the central neuronal circuit mediating respiratory reflexes, that is in the RTN. To date, mutations in the PHOX2B gene are commonly associated with most patients diagnosed with CCHS, a disease characterized by hypoventilation and absence of chemoreflexes, in the neonatal period, which in severe cases can lead to respiratory arrest during sleep. In the present study, the authors demonstrated that the role of Phox2b extends beyond the developmental period, and its reduction in CCHS may contribute to the respiratory impairment observed in this disorder.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Whereas the most exciting part of this work is the knockdown of the Phox2b in the RTN in adult rodents, the weakness of this study is the lack of a clear physiological, developmental, and anatomical distinction between this approach and similar studies already reported elsewhere (Ruffault et al., 2015, DOI: 10.7554/eLife.07051; Ramanantsoa et al., 2011, DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1721-11.2011; Huang et al., 2017, DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.06.027; Hernandez-Miranda et al., 2018, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1813520115; Ferreira et al., 2022 DOI: 10.7554/eLife.73130; Takakura et al., 2008 DOI: 10.1113/jphysiol.2008.153163; Basting et al., 2015 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2923-14.2015; Marina et al., 2010 DOI: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3141-10.2010). In addition, several conclusions presented in this work are not directly supported by the provided data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the feedback on or manuscript. We have further highlighted in our discussion the previous developmental work aimed at determining the role of PHOX2B in embryonic development. Our study was triggered by the fascinating observations that despite its important role in development of the central and peripheral nervous system, PHOX2B is still present in the adult brain and its function in adult neurons is unknown, thus we aimed to investigate its role in the adult RTN by knocking down its expression with a shRNA approach. Therefore, in our model knockdown of PHOX2B does not affect development of the RTN. Previous studies (mentioned by the reviewer, as well as cited in the manuscript) have focused on investigating (1) the role of PHOX2B in the developmental period, (2) the physiological changes associated with the transgenic expression of mutant forms of PHOX2B in relation to CCHS, (3) the killing or the acute silencing/excitation of neuronal activity of PHOX2B+ RTN neurons. Our study had a different aim: to test whether the transcription factor PHOX2B had a physiologically relevant role in adult RTN neurons. In this experimental approach PHOX2B is not altered throughout embryonic or postnatal development. By knocking down PHOX2B in the Nmb+ cells of the RTN our results show a reduction in chemoreflex response and mRNA expression of protein sensors. Hence, we conclude that PHOX2B alters the function of Nmb+ RTN neurons, possibly through transcriptional changes including the reduction in Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>A brain region called the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) regulates breathing in response to changes in CO2/H+, a process termed central chemoreception.

We carefully quantified the impact of PHOX2B knockdown on Nmb expressing neurons, as well as the effects on the adjacent TH expressing C1 population and FN neurons (figure 5). As reported in the results section, significant changes in the numbers of PHOX2B expressing neurons was only observed at the site of injection in PHOX2B+/Nmb+ neurons. We did not observe changes in the total number of C1 cells (TH+/PHOX2B+), in the number of TH cells coexpressing PHOX2B, or in the hypoxic ventilatory response (which is dependent on the health status of C1 neuron). We have updated figure 5 to show representative expression of PHOX2B in TH+ neurons in the ventral medulla to complement our cell count analysis. To address potential effects on other cell populations we have edited our discussion as follows:</p><p>“PHOX2B knockdown was also restricted to RTN neurons, as adjacent C1 TH+ neurons did not show any change in number of TH+/PHOX2B+ expressing cells, although we cannot exclude that some C1 cells may have been infected and their relative PHOX2B expression levels were reduced. To support the lack of significant alterations associated with the possible loss of C1 function was the absence of significant changes in the hypoxic response that has been shown to be dependent on C1 neurons (Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017).”</p><p>Where appropriate, we have substituted “RTN” with “Nmb expressing neurons of the RTN” throughout the manuscript.</p><p>We have clarified in the methods and results section how we quantified Task2 and Gpr4 mRNA expression. The quantification was performed on a pool of single cells (200-250/rat) expressing Nmb. Hence, the overall reduction is not a result of general fluorescence loss in the RTN region, but specifically assessed in single cells expressing Nmb. This is therefore independent of the reduction of the total number of Nmb cells.</p><p>We propose that cell death is not a direct effect of PHOX2B knockdown, but rather it is associated with the injection of the viral constructs that have been already reported to promote some off-target effects (as reported in the manuscript). While modest cell death is observed only in the first two weeks post-infection, it does not increase further between 2 and 4 weeks post infection, when the reduction in PHOX2B (not associated with a further reduction in Nmb+ cells, hence no further cell death in RTN) is evident and the respiratory chemoreflex is impaired. These results suggest that (1) reduction of PHOX2B is not responsible for cell death; (2) it is the reduction of PHOX2B levels that promotes chemoreflex impairment. Given the observation that Nmb cells with no detectable PHOX2B protein show reduced expression of Task2 and Gpr4 mRNA, we propose that one of the possible mechanisms of chemoreflex impairment in PHOX2B shRNA rats is the reduction of Task2 and Gpr4. In the discussion we also suggest possible additional mechanisms that can be investigated in further studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold>.</p><p>In revising this manuscript, the authors should carefully address the issues raised by the reviewers to substantially improve the manuscript and solidify the reviewers' general assessment of the potential importance of this work.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) The cell counts for Nmb+/PHOX2B+ and Nmb+/PHOX2B- RTN neurons are a critical component of the study, and it is unclear how the tissue sampling procedures (eight sections per animal) for quantifying numbers of cells expressing proteins/mRNAs throughout the extended RTN region bilaterally has been validated to accurately represent the full expression patterns in the RTN under the experimental conditions.

Briefly, a Leica TCS SP5 (B-120G) Laser Scanning Confocal microscope was used to acquire images of the tissue. Exposure time and acquisition parameters were set for the naïve group and kept unchanged for the entire dataset acquisition. The collected images were then analysed by selecting a single cell at a time and measuring the area, integrated density and mean grey value (McCloy et al., 2014). For each image, three background areas were used to normalize against autofluorescence. We used 4 sections/rat (210 µm interval) to count Nmb, Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA CTCF in the core of the RTN area where several Nmb cells could be identified. For each section two images were acquired with a 20× objective, so that at least fifty cells per tissue sample were obtained for the mRNA quantification analysis. To evaluate changes in Nmb mRNA expression levels following PHOX2B knockdown at the level of the RTN, we compared, the fluorescence intensity of each RTN Nmb+ cell (223.2 ± 37.1 cells/animal) with the average fluorescent signal of Nmb+ cells located dorsally in the NTS (4.3 ± 1.2 cells/animal) (Nmb CTCF ratio RTN/NTS) as we reasoned that the latter would not be affected by the shRNA infection and knockdown.</p><p>To quantify Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA expression in Nmb cells of the RTN, we first quantified single cell CTCF for either Gpr4 (200.7 ± 13.2 cells/animal) or Task2 (169.6 ± 10.3 cells/animal) mRNA in Nmb+ RTN neurons in the 3 experimental groups (naïve, NT shRNA and PHOX2B shRNA) independent of their PHOX2B expression.

Finally, we sought to provide a mechanistic link between PHOX2B expression and the chemosensitive properties of RTN neurons, which have been attributed to two proton sensors, the proton-activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPR4) and the proton-modulated potassium channel (TASK-2).”</p><p>The rationale for running these experiments is based on the fact that it is well known in the literature that PHOX2B is an important transcription factor for the development of several neuronal populations. PHOX2B Knockout mice die before birth and heterozygous mice have some anatomical defects, but respiration is only impaired in the early post-natal period. While many developmental transcription factors are generally downregulated in the post-natal period, PHOX2B is still expressed in some neurons into adulthood. What is the function of PHOX2B in these fully developed neurons? We do not know as we do not yet know the entire set of target genes that PHOX2B regulates in the adult brain. Hence we decided to test what would happen if we knocked down the PHOX2B protein in the Nmb neurons of the RTN, an area that is critical for central chemoreception and involved in the presentation of CCHS. Our results show that reduction of PHOX2B blunts the CO2 chemoreflex response and reduces mRNA expression of Task2 and Gpr4, two pH sensors that have been shown to be key for RTN chemosensitive properties. We also show that the Nmb mRNA and cell survival are not affected by PHOX2B knockdown and we propose that the reduced CO2 chemoreflex may be attributed to a reduction of chemosensory function of Nmb neurons of the RTN due to partial loss of Gpr4 and Task2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is imperative for the authors to enhance the description of their hypothesis, as, from my perspective, the contribution of the data to the field is not clearly articulated. Numerous more selectively designed experiments were conducted to investigate the role of Phoxb-expressing neurons at the RTN level and their involvement in respiratory activity. In summary, the current study appears to lack novelty.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with this statement. We believe we have adequately summarized previous work, although we realize we can’t reference every single publication on this topic. As described above, the developmental role of PHOX2B has been elegantly investigated in mouse embryonic studies (extensively cited in the manuscript). Furthermore, very interesting studies have shown that when the CCHS defining mutant PHOX2B protein (+7Ala PHOX2B) and other mutations linked to CCHS have been transgenically expressed in mice through development, severe anatomical defects are observed and respiratory function is impaired (extensively cited in the manuscript). We have also cited papers relevant to this study that describe the role of PHOX2B/Nmb RTN neurons and the pH protein sensors in the CO2 chemoreflex. If we missed some papers that the reviewer deems essential in the context of this study we will be happy to include them.</p><p>We are not aware of other studies that have investigated the specific role of the PHOX2B protein in the adult RTN in the absence of confounding developmental pathogenesis (i.e. in an otherwise ‘healthy’ animal), and of no other studies that looked at the effects on the RTN proton sensors and Nmb expression following PHOX2B knockdown. Hence we believe that our results are novel and, in our opinion, very interesting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) On pages 13 and 14 (Results section), I am seeking clarity on the novelty of the findings. Doug Bayliss's prior work has already demonstrated the role of Gpr4 and Task2 on Phox2b neurons in regulating ventilation in conscious rodents.</p></disp-quote><p>Bayliss’ group has elegantly demonstrated that Gpr4 and Task2 are the two proton sensors in the PHOX2B/Nmb neurons of the RTN that have a key role in chemoreception (cited in the manuscript). The novelty of our findings is that we show that a reduction in PHOX2B protein is associated with a reduction of mRNA levels of Gpr4 and Task2. This is a novel finding. Currently, we do not know what transcriptional activity PHOX2B has in adult RTN neurons (i.e., what gene targets PHOX2B has in this cell population and many others) and here we propose that Nmb is not a gene target of PHOX2B while Gpr4 and Task2 are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors assert that the transcription factor Phox2b remains not fully understood. While I concur, the present study falls short of fully investigating the actual contribution of Phox2b to breathing regulation. In other words, the knockdown of Phox2b neurons did not add much to the knowledge of the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. With the exception of very few target genes, the transcriptional role of PHOX2B beyond the embryonic development is poorly understood. No mechanistic connection has been made before between the transcriptional activity of PHOX2B with the expression of proton sensors in the RTN. Other groups have investigated the role of stimulating or depressing the neuronal activity of PHOX2B/NMB neurons in the RTN showing a key role of RTN on respiratory control, but these prior studies did not test whether changing the expression of the PHOX2B protein in these neurons had a role on respiratory control and the central chemoreflex. No other study has investigated the role of the PHOX2B protein within the RTN cells, with the exception of PHOX2B knockout mice or transgenic expression of the mutated PHOX2B that are relevant for CCHS. Again, these previous studies were done on a background of developmental impairment and to the best of our knowledge did not seek to show any association between PHOX2B expression and expression of Gpr4 or Task2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) I recommend removing the entire section entitled &quot;The role of Phox2b in development and in the adult brain.&quot; The authors merely describe Phox2b expression without contextualizing it within the obtained data.</p></disp-quote><p>Because reviewers raised the issue about not including important information about the role of PHOX2B in development and respiratory control we prefer to keep the section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Are the authors aware of whether the shRNA in Phox2b/Nmb neurons truly induced cell death or solely depleted the expression of the transcription factor protein? Do the chemosensitive neurons persist?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question that we tried to address with our study. As we report in figures 2 and 3, we propose that some cell death is occurring as an off-target effect within the first 2 weeks post-infection, likely due to off-target action of the shRNA approach and not dependent on the reduction of PHOX2B expression (discussed in the manuscript). This is further evidenced by our Fig.S1 data in which higher concentrations of shRNA led to more cell death, indicative of off-target effects. We do not believe it is a consequence of our surgical procedure as we do not see similar cell loss when injecting vehicle or other control solutions (unpublished work; Janes et al., 2024).</p><p>During the first 2 weeks post-surgery the proportion of Nmb+/PHOX2B- cells does not change compared to control rats or non-target shRNA (knockdown is not yet visible at protein level). Four weeks post-injection, there is no further cell death (assessed by the total number of NMB cells), whereas the fraction of NMB cells that express PHOX2B is reduced (and the fraction of NMB not expressing PHOX2B is increased), suggesting that the reduction of PHOX2B protein in Nmb cells is not correlated with cell loss/survival whereas the impairment that we observe in terms of central chemoreception is possibly due to the progressive decrease of PHOX2B expression in these neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figures 2 and 3, it is noteworthy that the authors observe peak expression at a very caudal level. In rats, the RTN initiates at the caudal end of the facial, approximately 11.6 mm, and should exhibit a rostral direction of about 2 mm.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience the Nmb cells on the ventral surface of the medulla peak in number around the caudal tip of the facial nucleus in adult SD rats (Janes et al., 2024). To add clarity to the figure we reported cell count distribution data in relation to the distance from caudal tip of the facial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(1) I would like to suggest that the authors correct the recurring statement throughout the manuscript that Phox2b is essential only for the development of the autonomic nervous system. In my view, it also plays a crucial role in certain sensory and respiratory systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 4, lines 59-60: Out of curiosity, do the data include information from different countries?</p></disp-quote><p>This data refers to information from France and Japan. Currently it is estimated that there are 1000-2000 CCHS patients worldwide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Page 7, lines 129-131: In my understanding, the sentence is quite clear; if we knock down the PHOX2B gene, we are expected to reduce or even eliminate the expression of Gpr4 or Task2. Am I right?</p></disp-quote><p>This is what we propose from the results of this study. We would like to point out that the transcriptional activity of PHOX2B (i.e., what genes PHOX2B regulate) in adult neurons has not yet been fully investigated. With the exception of few target genes (e.g., TH, DBH) the transcriptional activity of PHOX2B in neurons is not yet known. Here we report novel findings that suggest that Gpr4 and Task2 are potential target genes of PHOX2B in RTN neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors mentioned that NT-shRNA also impacts CO2 chemosensitivity. Could this effect be attributed to mechanical damage of the tissue resulting from the injection?</p></disp-quote><p>Just to clarify, we observe some impairment in chemosensitivity when NT-shRNA was injected in “larger” (2x 200ul/side) volume. No impairment was observed in NT-shRNA when we injected smaller volumes (2x 100ul/side). Physical damage could be a possibility although in our experience (unpublished work; Janes et al, 2024, Acta Physiologica) injections of similar volume of solution performed by the same investigator in the same brain area and experimental settings did not produce a physical lesion associated with respiratory impairment. Hence we attribute the unexpected results with larger volumes to toxic effects associated with the shRNA viral constructs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In the reference section, the authors should review and correct some entries.

We focused our small volume injection in the core of the RTN to target Nmb cells but we also assessed PHOX2B knockdown in TH C1 cells by counting the PHOX2B/TH cells across treatment groups. Although we can’t exclude subtle changes in the C1 population, we did not observe changes in the total number of C1 cells (TH+/PHOX2B+), in the number of TH cells expressing PHOX2B, or in the hypoxic ventilatory response (which is dependent on the health status of C1 neuron). We have updated figure 5 to show representative expression of PHOX2B in TH+ neurons in the ventral medulla to complement our cell count analysis. To address potential effects on other cell populations we have edited our discussion as follows:</p><p>“PHOX2B knockdown was also restricted to RTN neurons, as adjacent C1 TH+ neurons did not show any change in number of TH+/PHOX2B+ expressing cells, although we cannot exclude that some C1 cells may have been infected and their relative PHOX2B expression levels were reduced. To support the lack of significant alterations associated with the possible loss of C1 function was the absence of significant changes in the hypoxic response that has been shown to be dependent on C1 neurons (Malheiros-Lima et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To confirm, Nmb is not expressed in the NTS, and this region was chosen as a background, right?</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>In order to systematically analyze Nmb mRNA expression we decided to use measurement of fluorescence relative to Nmb neurons present in the dorsal brainstem.

Basically, our results show that we have less Nmb cells that express PHOX2B but the overall Nmb mRNA fluorescence (expression) in Nmb cells relative to Nmb fluorescence in cells of the dorsal brainstem is the same.</p><p>We have edited the methods as follows:</p><p>“The Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) signal for Nmb, Gpr4 and Task2 mRNAs was quantified as previously described (Cardani et al., 2022; McCloy et al., 2014). Briefly, a Leica TCS SP5 (B-120G) Laser Scanning Confocal microscope was used to acquire images of the tissue. Exposure time and acquisition parameters were set for the naïve group and kept unchanged for the entire dataset acquisition. The collected images were then analysed by selecting a single cell at a time and measuring the area, integrated density and mean grey value (McCloy et al., 2014). For each image, three background areas were used to normalize against autofluorescence. We used 4 sections/rat (210 µm interval) to count Nmb, Gpr4 and Task2 mRNA CTCF in the core of the RTN area where several Nmb cells could be identified. For each section two images were acquired with a 20× objective, so that at least fifty cells per tissue sample were obtained for the mRNA quantification analysis. To evaluate changes in Nmb mRNA expression levels following PHOX2B knockdown at the level of the RTN, we compared the fluorescence intensity of each RTN Nmb+ cell (223.2 ± 37.1 cells/animal) with the average fluorescent signal of Nmb+ cells located dorsally in the NTS ( 4.3 ± 1.2 cells/animal) (Nmb CTCF ratio RTN/NTS) as we reasoned that the latter would not be affected by the shRNA infection and knockdown. “</p><p>A single cell qPCR analysis would be definitely ideal but a qPCR from dissected tissue would not help us determine whether within a cell there was a reduction in Nmb mRNA levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The boxed RTN region in these examples is all over the place.
