The checkpoint is maintained by Aurora B kinase, which phosphorylates multiple targets, including CHMP4C, a regulatory ESCRT-III subunit necessary for this checkpoint. We now report the discovery that cytoplasmic abscission checkpoint bodies (ACBs) containing phospho-Aurora B and tri-phospho-CHMP4C develop during an active checkpoint. ACBs are derived from mitotic interchromatin granules, transient mitotic structures whose components are housed in splicing-related nuclear speckles during interphase. ACB formation requires CHMP4C, and the ESCRT factor ALIX also contributes. ACB formation is conserved across cell types and under multiple circumstances that activate the checkpoint. Finally, ACBs retain a population of ALIX, and their presence correlates with delayed abscission and delayed recruitment of ALIX to the midbody where it would normally promote abscission. Thus, a cytoplasmic mechanism helps regulate midbody machinery to delay abscission.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a cell divides, it must first carefully duplicate its genetic information and package these copies into compartments housed in the two new cells.

The abscission (NoCut) checkpoint is active during cytokinesis when cells are connected by a narrow intercellular bridge containing a microtubule-rich structure termed the midbody. Abscission checkpoint signaling ceases if no errors are detected, reflecting checkpoint satisfaction. However, if residual mitotic errors are detected, then the checkpoint remains unsatisfied and the final cut of cytokinesis is delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Norden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>). To date, this checkpoint has been shown to be responsive to four error conditions: chromatin bridges within the midbody, reduced levels of particular nuclear pore proteins, tension at the intercellular bridge, and previous DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lafaurie-Janvore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mackay and Ullman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Petsalaki and Zachos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>). Left unchecked, these conditions have the potential to disrupt new daughter cell functions. This is most clear in the case of chromatin bridges, which can break under tension forces in the absence of the abscission checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Petsalaki and Zachos, 2021</xref>) and even break and re-fuse in the absence of p53, ultimately leading to chromothripsis, a mutational signature commonly found in cancer genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maciejowski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Umbreit et al., 2020</xref>). Loss of the abscission checkpoint accelerates the time to abscission and induces genomic instability in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadler et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the abscission checkpoint appears to protect cells from accumulating damage arising from mitotic errors, which otherwise have the potential to promote tumorigenesis.</p><p>Once the abscission checkpoint is satisfied, cytokinetic abscission is mediated by the Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) pathway, at least in transformed, cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gatta and Carlton, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vietri et al., 2020</xref>). The ESCRT adaptor protein CEP55 provides an ESCRT recruiting platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastos and Barr, 2010</xref>) at a protein-rich structure called the Flemming body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capalbo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skop et al., 2004</xref>) centrally located within the midbody. CEP55 forms rings on either side of the Flemming body and recruits the early-acting ESCRT factors, TSG101 (a component of the ESCRT-I complex) and ALIX, through a shared binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). SEPT9 has also recently been implicated as a second, TSG101/ESCRT-I-specific midbody adaptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karasmanis et al., 2019</xref>). ALIX and TSG101/ESCRT-I, in turn, ultimately recruit late-acting ESCRT-III factors, including CHMP4B and IST1 through two parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christ et al., 2016</xref>). ESCRT-III subunits polymerize into membrane-constricting filaments and interact with the AAA-ATPase VPS4 to sever membranes in abscission zones on either side of the Flemming body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christ et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2007</xref>). The abscission checkpoint must, therefore, inhibit ESCRT recruitment, polymerization and/or constriction to delay abscission.</p><p>Aurora B kinase (<bold>AurB</bold>) functions as the master regulator of the abscission checkpoint. AurB phosphorylates many different targets at the midbody, and thereby enforces abscission delay and stabilizes the midbody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hegemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>). AurB is activated by phosphorylation (<bold>pAurB</bold>), both by the collective action of CLK1, 2, and 4 kinases and by autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petsalaki and Zachos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yasui et al., 2004</xref>). When the abscission checkpoint is satisfied, AurB is dephosphorylated and abscission proceeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhowmick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capalbo et al., 2019</xref>). Many pAurB targets likely remain to be identified, but one significant target is the regulatory ESCRT-III subunit, CHMP4C, a factor required for abscission checkpoint activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capalbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>). pAurB phosphorylates three sites within a region unique to CHMP4C that is required for the abscission checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capalbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>), and the ESCRT-binding kinase ULK3 phosphorylates other site(s) outside this insert region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caballe et al., 2015</xref>). A naturally occurring variant allele of CHMP4C that reduces ALIX binding abrogates the abscission checkpoint, induces DNA damage accumulation, and correlates with increased susceptibility to several different cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pharoah et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadler et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, CHMP4C phosphorylation and its ALIX binding activity are necessary for abscission checkpoint function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>System for abscission checkpoint enrichment.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the CHMP4C protein.

Yet, the finding that CHMP4C must be able to bind ALIX for the checkpoint to function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadler et al., 2018</xref>) suggests additional crucial roles for CHMP4C. It remains unknown, however, where such interactions take place and whether cytoplasmic checkpoint regulatory mechanisms complement those at the midbody.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Synchronization of cells with an active abscission checkpoint</title><p>The abscission checkpoint is normally active in only a small fraction of cultured cells because at any given time, few cells are in the cell cycle phase of cytokinesis and, further, because checkpoint activity is normally transient. We have overcome these experimental hurdles by combining treatments that (1) prevent checkpoint satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackay et al., 2010</xref>), using siRNA-mediated depletion of the nuclear pore basket proteins Nup153 and Nup50 (referred to throughout as siNups) and (2) synchronize the cell cycle, using thymidine addition to arrest cells in G1/S phase, followed by release and synchronous progression through the remaining cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). These conditions elicited an active checkpoint in up to ~80% of HeLa cells in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). We did not observe increased chromatin bridges in these checkpoint-active samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), indicating that lagging chromatin did not significantly contribute to sustained checkpoint activity. Importantly, cells enriched with an active abscission checkpoint by this method remained competent for abscission, as they all completed division within 60 min following deactivation of the checkpoint with an AurB inhibitor (<bold>AurBi</bold>, ZM 447439) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) or after &gt;5 hr without treatment (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Abscission checkpoint activity delays ALIX recruitment to the midbody</title><p>Using this new checkpoint enrichment protocol, we tested whether ESCRT factor recruitment to midbodies was altered by the abscission checkpoint. The ESCRT adaptor CEP55 and one of the two early-acting ESCRT factors, TSG101/ESCRT-I, localized normally to midbodies when the checkpoint was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In contrast, checkpoint activity significantly delayed midbody recruitment of the other early-acting ESCRT factor, ALIX. This delay was particularly pronounced in early-stage midbodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) and was still striking when all midbodies were tracked over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), despite a similar decrease in abundance of early-stage midbodies in both siCon and siNups samples (e.g., 15 hr post-thymidine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To control for potential cell-to-cell variation, we also quantified CEP55 and ALIX intensity within the same cells to determine their relative ratios at individual midbodies. This experiment confirmed that an active checkpoint delays recruitment of ALIX to the midbody relative to CEP55, with an approximately threefold decrease in the relative ratio 11 hr post-thymidine release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and an approximately threefold decrease relative to TSG101/ESCRT-I in an analogous experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). By 16 hr after thymidine release, ALIX levels at the midbody had largely, but not completely recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2D</xref>). This is consistent with the duration of abscission delay under these conditions, which starts to lift after 16 hr (not shown). AurBi treatment rapidly rescued ALIX recruitment at 11 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), confirming that delays in ALIX recruitment were checkpoint dependent. We also found that checkpoint activity delayed recruitment of IST1, an ESCRT-III subunit that functions downstream of ALIX and is required for abscission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bajorek et al., 2009</xref>). IST1 recruitment was likewise restored by brief AurBi treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Taken together, these observations reveal a new dimension of regulation that helps explain why abscission is delayed when this checkpoint is not satisfied. Both ALIX and IST1 localize to midbodies and are required for cytokinesis in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agromayor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bajorek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2007</xref>), and abscission timing is therefore expected to be delayed when their recruitment is delayed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Abscission checkpoint activity delays ALIX recruitment to the midbody.</title><p>Immunofluorescence and time course quantifications of CEP55 (<bold>A, B</bold>) and ALIX (<bold>C, D</bold>) recruitment to early-stage midbodies in control and checkpoint-active cells.

We have previously shown that cells expressing CHMP4C with mutations that inhibit ALIX binding bypass the abscission checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadler et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that interaction of CHMP4C and ALIX is key to checkpoint activity. We therefore first tested whether CHMP4C localization was also altered. Stably expressed HA-CHMP4C localized to midbodies regardless of checkpoint status, whereas ALIX recruitment was again delayed when the checkpoint was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Thus, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadler et al., 2018</xref>), bulk CHMP4C protein localization does not change with checkpoint activity. We next examined the localization of specific AurB-activated phospho-isoforms of endogenous CHMP4C using phospho-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capalbo et al., 2016</xref>). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capalbo et al., 2016</xref>), singly phosphorylated CHMP4C (pCHMP4C) formed a single ring at the Flemming body and was recruited with the same timing whether or not the checkpoint was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Tri-phosphorylated CHMP4C (pppCHMP4C) also formed single Flemming body rings and, additionally, formed double rings, one on either side of the Flemming body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capalbo et al., 2016</xref>), particularly when the checkpoint was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, checkpoint-dependent changes in pppCHMP4C distribution were much more dramatic at cytoplasmic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In control midbody-stage cells, pppCHMP4C exhibited a granular nuclear localization, whereas cells with sustained checkpoint activity accumulated pppCHMP4C in 0.5–2 µm diameter cytoplasmic foci that we have named Abscission Checkpoint Bodies (<bold>ACB</bold>s). Pan-CHMP4C antibodies decorated ACBs, whereas antibodies specific to singly phosphorylated pCHMP4C did not, consistent with the tri-phosphorylated subpopulation of CHMP4C preferentially localizing to this site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Note, however, that detection of endogenous CHMP4C in ACBs with the pan-antibody required removing soluble cytoplasmic proteins by pre-fixation treatment with buffer (PHEM) to preserve general cell morphology followed by detergent to pre-permeabilize cell membranes. This treatment leaves larger cellular structures, including ACBs, intact while removing cytoplasmic background to increase ACB staining clarity. ACBs were observed in the majority of checkpoint-active cells throughout the entire post-thymidine time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). ACBs were abundant (26 ± 14 per midbody-stage cell), and the number of ACBs per midbody-stage cell remained constant throughout the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

In the absence of checkpoint activation, CHMP4B exhibited a punctate cytoplasmic distribution in pre-permeabilized cells, but these puncta were significantly smaller than ACBs and did not colocalize with either pppCHMP4C or pAurB. Hence, in addition to pppCHMP4C, pAurB and CHMP4B are ACB components, and in each case, their ACB localization was strongly checkpoint dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>ACBs are derived from mitotic interchromatin granules</title><p>We further characterized ACBs by testing whether they corresponded to a variety of known cellular assemblies and organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Both MIGs and nuclear speckles are compartments with liquid–liquid phase separation characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strom and Brangwynne, 2019</xref>), and they primarily contain factors that function in mRNA biogenesis, particularly splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mintz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saitoh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uversky, 2017</xref>). After being released from nuclei upon mitotic nuclear envelope disassembly, these factors associate into small cytoplasmic MIG foci during the metaphase to anaphase transition. MIGs then normally disappear in late telophase, concomitant with stepwise reassembly of nuclear speckles within newly formed nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prasanth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reuter et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spector and Lamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Spector and Smith, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tripathi and Parnaik, 2008</xref>). In contrast, extended abscission checkpoint activity promoted the appearance of ACBs, which are larger than MIGs and become apparent in late midbody-stage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

This was accomplished by inhibiting DYRK3, a kinase that prevents premature MIG formation in metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rai et al., 2018</xref>), or by inhibiting CLK1, a kinase that promotes component release from nuclear speckles and thus may similarly regulate MIG stability, allowing them to persist and at least partially mimic their maturation into ACBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colwill et al., 1996</xref>). CLK inhibition was previously reported to accelerate abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petsalaki and Zachos, 2016</xref>), but our studies employed a CLK1/2-specific inhibitor (CLK1i) rather than a pan-CLK inhibitor, and our treatment windows were much shorter than those employed previously (30 min vs. 5 hr). For our studies, we treated with CLK1 inhibitor or DYRK3 inhibitor for 30 min to limit effects on preceding cell-cycle stages. Under these conditions, inhibition of either CLK1 or DYRK3 kinase increased the percentage of midbody-stage cells with SC35-positive cytoplasmic foci from 13% (control) to 23% (DYRK3i) or 21% (CLK1i) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>) and increased median abscission times in the bulk population by 11 min (DYRK3i, 19% delay) or 6 min (CLK1i, 10% delay), as measured in live cell imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Similarly, the time course of midbody resolution in a synchronized cell population was delayed upon treatment with either inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Conversely, when we overexpressed CLK1 in a background of Nup153/50 depletion, midbody-stage cells decreased ~25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). CLK1 overexpression did not completely dissolve ACBs, but did decrease the number of ACBs per midbody pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>), and concomitantly increased the proportion of SRRM2 nuclear staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B,C</xref>), indicating that CLK1 overexpression induced SRRM2 relocalization from ACBs into nuclei. Thus, treatments that promote MIG/ACB formation and maintenance delay abscission in cells independently of perturbations that prevent the abscission checkpoint from being satisfied, and treatments that promote ACB dissolution accelerate abscission, even when the abscission checkpoint is active. These effects are modest, but the experiments target just one aspect of abscission regulation in isolation and therefore support the model that ACBs have a functional role in abscission delay.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>ACB formation and ALIX recruitment delay occur in response to multiple mitotic errors and in different cell types</title><p>To confirm that ACBs are a broadly relevant component of the abscission checkpoint, we investigated their formation under the three other conditions known to prevent abscission checkpoint satisfaction: replication stress, intercellular tension, and lagging chromatin bridges within the midbody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lafaurie-Janvore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mackay and Ullman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steigemann et al., 2009</xref>).

This response was less robust than observed in HeLa cells, suggesting that corrective or compensatory pathways may mitigate errors that keep the abscission checkpoint from being satisfied or that RPE1 cells may be less dependent on the ESCRT pathway for abscission. Nonetheless, ACBs were once again detected in nearly all midbody-stage RPE1 cells subjected to the checkpoint enrichment protocol and contained pppCHMP4C, pAurB, CHMP4B, and splicing factors recognized by mAb SC35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D</xref>).

This treatment also significantly reduced the percentage of midbody-stage cells with ACBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, shaded regions). The dependence of ACB formation on CHMP4C reinforces the connection between abscission checkpoint signaling and ACB appearance. The suppression of ACB formation in the absence of CHMP4C, despite Nup depletion, also demonstrates that ACBs do not form due to altered function of the nuclear pore per se (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>ACBs contain ALIX, and ALIX depletion reduces ACB size</title><p>To investigate the connection between the presence of ACBs and the delay of ALIX recruitment to the midbody, we tested whether ALIX itself might target to ACBs. To avoid the strong signal for ALIX present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), we again used pre-permeabilization treatment to remove soluble cytoplasmic content. Using this method, we detected ALIX in ACBs in both HeLa and RPE1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). To determine whether this localization was specific, we performed a co-depletion with siALIX and siNups, which was informative at several levels. First, as previously established, ALIX depletion alone resulted in cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), and when abscission checkpoint satisfaction was prevented by concurrent treatment with siNups, enrichment of midbody-stage cells still took place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, full bars). This checkpoint activity corresponded to a significant reduction in cytokinesis failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). These observations are consistent with the conclusion that reduced ALIX activity prevents abscission during checkpoint regulation. Second, depletion of ALIX confirmed its localization to ACBs as its detection at ACBs diminished concordantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Third, in the absence of ALIX, although ACB-like structures still persist in late midbody-stage cells in response to checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, shaded regions), the average cross-sectional area of these structures decreased by ~35% (corresponding to ~50% reduction in volume), as measured using two different ACB markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Concomitantly, the number of the focal ACB-like structures increased in checkpoint-active midbody-stage cells depleted of ALIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, ALIX is a component of ACBs and is required to create full-sized ACBs or to maintain their integrity.

Employing this assay, we found that abscission checkpoint activity can delay ALIX recruitment to the midbody and identified ACBs as a previously uncharacterized cytoplasmic body that contributes a new facet of abscission regulation. Specifically, we find that the abscission checkpoint restrains recruitment of ALIX and the downstream factor IST1 to the midbody, helping to explain how abscission is stalled in response to mitotic errors. Furthermore, we identified ACBs as a checkpoint-dependent compartment that concentrates splicing, checkpoint, and abscission factors, including mAb SC35-reactive splicing factors, pAurB, pppCHMP4C, CHMP4B, and ALIX. ACBs appear to be derived from MIGs, a compartment whose components and cell cycle behavior had previously been partially characterized, but whose functional role(s) is unknown at a mechanistic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferreira et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prasanth et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reuter et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spector and Lamond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tripathi and Parnaik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Turner and Franchi, 1987</xref>). ACBs also share similarities with cytoplasmic granules that have been observed in mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saitoh et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, the presence of splicing factor-enriched cytoplasmic granules was found to correlate with decreased levels of particular nucleocytoplasmic transport factors. In light of our findings here, it will be of interest to resolve whether the cytoplasmic granules seen in spermatids are ACBs and, further, whether similar alteration of nucleocytoplasmic transport factors prevents abscission checkpoint satisfaction. Although much remains to be learned about MIG/ACB architecture and function, we found here that ACB formation/maintenance requires the abscission checkpoint factor CHMP4C and that the cytokinesis factor ALIX plays a distinct role in their maturation. CHMP4C and pAurB colocalize within ACBs, which may favor formation and maintenance of the pppCHMP4C isoform because CHMP4C is an AurB substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capalbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>). At least two ACB components, CHMP4C and CHMP4B, can bind ALIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCullough et al., 2008</xref>), and CHMP4C mutations that cripple or eliminate ALIX binding impair the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sadler et al., 2018</xref>), highlighting the functional importance of the CHMP4C–ALIX interaction in checkpoint maintenance, and raising the possibility that this interaction could target either the CHMP4 proteins or ALIX to ACBs.</p><p>In functional terms, targeting of ALIX to ACBs may sequester a particular subpopulation of this protein away from the midbody, contributing to the checkpoint-dependent abscission delay. Sequestration may serve to prevent both ALIX-mediated ESCRT-III recruitment to the midbody and stimulation of VPS4 activity, a role for ALIX that is suggested by recent results focused on its orthologue in yeast, Bro1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tseng et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that in order to bind CHMP4 proteins and function in abscission, ALIX must be activated by phosphorylation of two serine residues in its autoinhibitory C-terminal tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhai et al., 2011</xref>). Phospho-activated ALIX is therefore an attractive candidate for the subpopulation of ALIX that is sequestered within ACBs. Interestingly, the distal end of this autoinhibitory tail also houses an intrinsically disordered region capable of higher order interactions that can form amyloids and viscous gels in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Elias et al., 2020</xref>). This property may contribute to ALIX targeting to ACBs and/or its role in ACB growth.</p><p>The key role of ALIX in the abscission of cultured, transformed cells is now well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christ et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morita et al., 2007</xref>) and is reinforced by recent studies elucidating its stepwise recruitment to the abscission zone, where it works in a complex with syndecan4 and syntenin to recruit other ESCRT factors required for the scission event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addi et al., 2020</xref>). However, mouse knockout models reveal a more complex picture in vivo. In these mouse models, ALIX and CEP55 were found to be required for normal brain and kidney development and cell division, whereas other organs appear largely unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tedeschi et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, humans without functional ALIX display microcephaly and kidney defects but are otherwise healthy and can live into their 20's (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2020</xref>). We reconcile these observations with our model of the abscission checkpoint in the following ways: (1) Redundant pathways may ensure that abscission (and an abscission checkpoint) takes place in vivo; indeed, a recent report argues that ESCRT proteins, including ALIX, are still recruited to the midbody in the CEP55 knockout mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Little et al., 2021</xref>), and in cases where ALIX is absent, TSG101 may dominate in driving ESCRT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Christ et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karasmanis et al., 2019</xref>). (2) It is also possible that tumor-derived cells are more dependent on the ESCRT pathway for abscission than non-cancerous cells, albeit with the exception of the developing brain and kidney. In line with this, ESCRT factors are often overexpressed in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeffery et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin et al., 2020</xref>), and our results show a more robust abscission checkpoint response in HeLa cells compared to non-transformed RPE1 cells. This important issue requires further study, but could potentially be used to advantage in therapeutic approaches.</p><p>ALIX targeting to ACBs is the first known cytoplasmic mechanism for abscission checkpoint regulation, but several lines of evidence indicate that this is just one of a repertoire of mechanisms that can be integrated to accomplish abscission delay. For example, the ACB mechanism does not function measurably when the checkpoint is induced by lagging chromatin bridges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Consistent with that observation, ALIX does not appear delayed in its recruitment to the midbody under these circumstances. Thus, the chromosomal bridge structure appears to connect to AurB-dependent abscission delay via distinct mechanisms. Indeed, a histone acetyltransferase complex plays an integral role in response to chromatin in the cell cleavage plane in the analogous NoCut checkpoint in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mendoza et al., 2009</xref>), and condensin has been proposed to contribute to abscission delay in the presence of chromatin bridges in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bembenek et al., 2013</xref>). There is also other precedent for modularity in abscission checkpoint mechanisms elicited by different cues. For example, although phosphorylation of IST1 by ULK3 is required for an abscission delay in response to chromatin bridges or Nup depletion, it does not appear to be required for tension-mediated abscission regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caballe et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, other abscission delay mechanisms, such as ANCHR-dependent sequestration of the ATPase VPS4 away from the abscission zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thoresen et al., 2014</xref>), may be deployed in particular combinations depending on the error present.</p><p>Finally, our demonstration that late midbody-stage ACBs are derived from telophase MIGs begs the question of why these bodies colocalize factors that function in both abscission and mRNA biogenesis. Interphase nuclear speckles are hypothesized to be transcription hubs that mediate efficient splicing especially of active genes, and molecular detail of their function is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2020</xref>). The functional roles of MIGs are currently less clear. Abnormal MIG assembly triggers metaphase arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>), implying a role in mitotic progression, but the mechanism is not yet understood. We have shown that artificially promoting ACB assembly triggers an abscission delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) and that reducing ACB formation accelerates abscission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that ACBs have a functional role in cytokinetic progression. Intriguingly, our observations suggest that ACBs are normally remodeled and nuclear speckle reformation initiated before abscission takes place. It will therefore be of interest to determine whether sequestration and coordinated release of the splicing factors or other regulatory factors present within ACBs are required for abscission regulation and cytokinetic progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HeLa-N</td><td valign="top">Maureen Powers Lab</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">HeLa cells selected for transfectability, <break/>ID confirmed by STR profiling</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">RPE1</td><td valign="top">Bruce Edgar Lab</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_4388">CVCL_4388</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Non-transformed, <break/>ID confirmed by STR profiling</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">pLVX-CLK1</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">Addgene Cat#:174088</td><td valign="top">Lentiviral construct to inducibly express <break/>CLK1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-ALIX (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Covance (This Lab)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2892637">AB_2892637</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:500), WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-pAurB (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Rockland</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 600-401-677 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2269474">AB_206164</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-pppCHMP4C (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Pier Paolo D’Avino</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-SC35 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#: ab18826 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_298608">AB_298608</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-SRRM2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Thermofisher</td><td valign="top">Cat#: PA5-66827 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2665182">AB_2665182</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">siNup153</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackay et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top">siRNA</td><td valign="top">GGACUUGUUAGAUCUAGUU</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">siNup50</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mackay et al., 2010</xref></td><td valign="top">siRNA</td><td valign="top">GGAGGACGCUUUUCUGGAU</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">CLK1/2 Inhibitor</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">534350</td><td valign="top">1 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">DYRK3 Inhibitor</td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top">GSK 626616</td><td valign="top">1 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">AurB Inhibitor</td><td valign="top">Bio-Techne</td><td valign="top">ZM 447439</td><td valign="top">2 µM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Thymidine</td><td valign="top">CalBiochem</td><td valign="top">CAS 50-89-5</td><td valign="top">2 mM</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Fiji</td><td valign="top">NIH</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002285">SCR_002285</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Details regarding antibodies used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Details regarding plasmids used in this study can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Cell populations were counted and sorted into interphase, midbody-stage, mitotic, recently abscised pair (counted as one cell), multinucleate, and failed bridge (counted as one cell). Cells were counted unblinded while on the microscope.</p><p>Midbodies were designated as ‘early’ or ‘not early’ using α-tubulin staining before scoring for the examined phenotype. Midbodies were classified as early based on midbody width, level of midbody-pinching, nuclear area, and flatness of cells, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> for illustration.</p><p>Midbodies were scored as having ACBs if they had at least one ACB. However, most midbody-stage cells with ACBs had 10–40 ACBs. For most figures, cells were counted as having or not having ACBs, unblinded while on the microscope. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, ACBs were counted from images using ‘Find Maxima’ with Fiji software (NIH). To quantify ALIX signal in ACBs, deconvolved z-slices were stacked and then uniformly adjusted for brightness and contrast. The SC35 or pAurB channels were uniformly thresholded, and then cytoplasmic objects between 0.025 and 5 µm<sup>2</sup> were marked as regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs were used to measure individual ACB intensity and area in the non-thresholded ALIX channel. Values were background corrected with large ROIs in the cytoplasm that excluded ACBs.</p><p>Quantification of fluorescence staining intensity at the midbody was also done with Fiji software (NIH). The freehand selection tool was used to outline the region of interest at the midbody, and staining intensity within this area was measured. Signals were background corrected using measurements from adjacent regions. In cases where the protein was not visible at the midbody, these methods sometimes generated a small negative intensity value after background correction because the Flemming body is a natural dark zone. In these cases, intensity was valued at zero.</p><p>To quantify SRRM2 subcellular distribution, the DAPI channel was used to threshold the nuclei and create ROIs using Fiji software. These ROIs were then used to determine the mean SRRM2 nuclear intensity. For each midbody-stage cell, an N:C ratio was determined by dividing the average mean nuclear intensity by the baseline cytoplasmic signal (the mean cytoplasmic intensity measured in an area devoid of ACBs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.02% NaN<sub>3</sub>, with freshly added PMSF [1 mM], aprotinin, leupeptin) for 30 min, 4°C, vortexing every 10 min.

The abscission checkpoint was initially described in HeLa cells as a stabilization of intercellular canals formed during late cytokinesis in response to the presence of chromatin bridges in the cleavage site, to avoid &quot;cutting&quot; through the DNA, which could cause genomic instability. Intercellular canal stabilization, and thus inhibition of abscission, depends on Aurora B and Aurora B-mediated phosphorylation of the ESCRT-III subunit CHMP4C. It was later found that Aurora B-dependent abscission inhibition also occurs in response to other cellular stresses, including mechanical tension at the bridge and depletion of basket nucleoporins. The present study investigates the role of cytoplasmic aggregates containing phosphor Aurora B (active), tri-phospho CHMP4C, and the ESCRT-III component ALIX, in abscission checkpoint control. The authors start by implementing a robust method to enrich (up to 80%) for cells with an &quot;activated abscission checkpoint&quot;, based on previous findings from the same group, in which interference with specific NUPs prevents the recruitment of nuclear basket components (e.g. Tpr) and causes a delay in abscission. The reasons and mechanism leading to this delay remain unknown, but it has been proposed that cells actively monitor proper nuclear pore assembly before cells complete division. With this synchronization protocol at hand, the authors investigate the recruitment of midbody components under conditions of an &quot;activated abscission checkpoint&quot; (i.e. abscission delay) and found that recruitment of the ESCRT components ALIX and IST1, but not CHMP4C, to early stage midbodies was delayed. Tri-phospho CHMP4C, which binds to ALIX, was found enriched into insoluble cytoplasmic granules under conditions of &quot;abscission checkpoint activation&quot;. The authors named these granules &quot;Abscission Checkpoint Bodies&quot; or ACBs. CHMP4B and phosphor Aurora B also localize to ACBs in a &quot;checkpoint-dependent manner&quot;. ACBs contained bona fide markers of mitotic interchromatin granules (MIGs) enriched of splicing factors that normally reside in the nucleus during interphase. Based on this, the authors propose that ACBs derive from MIGs. Interference with MIG formation caused a slight delay in abscission in HeLa cells. Other conditions that cause &quot;abscission checkpoint activation&quot; also increase the levels of ACBs, with the noticeable exception of chromatin bridges. Importantly, the increase in ACBs after &quot;abscission checkpoint activation&quot; is not a HeLa cell peculiarity and was also observed in non-transformed RPE1 cells, although to a reduced extent. The authors further suggest that ACB formation depends on CHMP4C, although this might be indirect. ALIX is also found at ACBs and ALIX depletion reduces the size of ACBs. Lastly, the presence of ALIX on ACBs correlated with its reduction at midbodies, suggesting that sequestration of ALIX into ACBs is a key step in the mechanism inducing a delay in abscission.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting paper, which brings new insights into abscission control based on the very provocative idea that cytoplasmic factors regulate the timing of abscission in response to mitotic errors. However, it was consensual amongst the 3 reviewers that compelling evidence is still lacking to justify the claim that ACBs are formed in response to conditions that delay abscission, or that they regulate abscission timing. In particular, there are gaps in the interpretation of the results that should be addressed experimentally and additional data must be provided to support the main conclusions, as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. One of the main concerns relates with the interpretation of the concept behind the Abscission Checkpoint. While evidence from several works exist in support of conditions that cause a delay in abscission, and thus support the existence of checkpoint control, the idea that these conditions &quot;activate&quot; or &quot;induce&quot; this abscission checkpoint is misleading. As the authors properly cite, the concept of checkpoints proposed by Hartwell and Weinert in 1989 implies the existence of surveillance mechanisms that are active by default and are external to the process being monitored. Only in such way errors can be effectively monitored and cell cycle progression (including completion of abscission) can be delayed to allow for eventual correction. Thus, checkpoints are satisfied, not activated. In the present work, the authors suggest that they can synchronously &quot;activate&quot; the abscission checkpoint, which could alternatively be interpreted as they can synchronously cause a delay in abscission that prevents its satisfaction due to unmet conditions supervised by the abscission checkpoint. In this case, the default condition used in this work was the constitutive depletion of some NUPs, whose link to mitotic errors remains unknown, i.e. why and how does this cause a delay in completing abscission? This becomes even more complicated if other prototype mitotic errors causing an abscission checkpoint response, such as lagging chromatin bridges, do not seem to cause an increase in ACBs, suggesting that ACB formation might be an epiphenomenon, rather than a key component of the mechanism underlying the abscission checkpoint. As so, the authors must clarify the differences between the cellular response to NUPs depletion and lagging chromatin. One possibility is that the conditions underlying NUPs depletion prevent proper nuclear pore function and could for example be a mere consequence of partially defective nuclear import, since nuclear speckle components are normally re-imported after nuclear envelope reformation. The authors try to rule out this possibility with co-depletion of CHMP4C, which reverses the formation of ACBs. They should nevertheless show by western blot that this triple depletion allows sufficient depletion of NUPs to the level required to prevent checkpoint satisfaction. Another possibility would be to show that depleting other NUPs that do not affect checkpoint response does not trigger the formation of ACBs. Lastly, inhibiting Aurora B activity should dissolve the ACBs, since it would impair CHMP4C phosphorylation. Is it the case?</p><p>2. Related to the previous point, the aphidicolin experiments are important to support the conclusion that ACBs are caused by conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction, and not by defective nuclear import. However, it is possible that aphidicolin does not delay abscission under the conditions used. Instead, aphidicolin could just delay S-phase and thus all subsequent cell cycle stages without affecting the duration of abscission itself. To test this, the fraction of midbody-stage cells with and without ACBs should be determined for the entire duration of the time course after aphidicolin addition, and not only for the interval between 12 and 18 hours after thymidine release (Figure 5 supplement 1B-D). This would also reveal if ACBs appear in unchallenged cells earlier in the cell cycle, which would be useful to understand their origin.</p><p>3. On the true existence of a &quot;checkpoint&quot; in the sense of a truly external mechanism that oversees abscission vs. the lack of a key structural component necessary to complete abscission. Given the observed accumulation of ACBs and their proposed origin from MIGs, it could be that some splicing event of a rate limiting mRNA/protein necessary to complete abscission is flawed. Given that the authors can synchronize cells in such delayed abscission condition, it would be instrumental to investigate whether splicing (by RT-PCR) and production of key proteins (by western blot) involved in abscission is taking place normally.</p><p>4. Are ACBs functionally involved in the abscission checkpoint? ACBs appear upon conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction, disappears when the checkpoint component CHMP4C is depleted and correlates with decreased levels of ALIX in the intercellular bridge. These are interesting but correlative evidence for a function of ACBs in the checkpoint. The authors conclude that ACBs regulate abscission timing (Figure 4), since stimulating their formation/maintenance (through DYRK3 or CLK1/2 inhibition) delays abscission in normal cells. This raises several questions. First, the abscission delay is rather modest and could only partially explain the abscission delay observed upon conditions that preclude checkpoint satisfaction. Second, this is different from previous studies (e.g. PMID 27126587), which, on the contrary, it was found that CLK inhibition accelerated abscission. The authors argue that they used a more specific inhibitor and for a shorter period of time. A simple test would be to use the same treatment as in PMID 27126587 (5h, pan-CLK inhibitor) and to show that in these conditions ACBs are dissolved. Third and more importantly, one would be fully convinced that ACBs regulate the abscission checkpoint if abscission timing is restored to normal upon conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction when ACBs are experimentally dissolved. For instance, overexpression of CLK (but not a kinase dead CLK) was previously found to dissolve MIGs (PMID 11827980). Would the abscission delay be abolished by ACBs dissolution in NUP-depleted cells? What is the effect of CLK inhibition in RPE1 cells? These or equivalent experiments would greatly enhance the mechanistic implications and of ACBs and their general role in the abscission checkpoint.</p><p>5. The existence of ACBs (positive for pppCHMP4C, pAuroraB and CHMP4B) is demonstrated in fixed cells that have been pre-permeabilized before fixation. Nobody has reported so far the existence of CHMP4B aggregates in the cytoplasm upon conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction. In addition, the midbody staining of CHMP4B is unusual (Figure 3D), perhaps as a consequence of pre-permeabilization. Can the authors find a way to show that ACBs exist in NUP-depleted cells without pre-permeabilization (which might induce phase separation in these cells)? Showing ACBs in live cells (no fixation) using CHMP4B-LAP-GFP, CHMP4C-LAP-GFP and speckle markers (e.g. SC35-YFP as in PMID 20926517 Figure 2) would be even better than after fixation. One would expect cytoplasmic dots in live cells upon NUP depletion using these makers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63743.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Is it the case?</p></disp-quote><p>a) As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed western blots to demonstrate that both Nup153 and Nup50 are efficiently knocked down in the triple depletion (as is CHMP4C). These data are now presented in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 5, and they clearly show that Nup153 and Nup50 are knocked down to levels that induce abscission delays in the presence of CHMP4C. Importantly, under these conditions, CHMP4C depletion significantly decreases ACB-formation and prevents midbody arrest (Figure 5D). We also refer reviewers to a previous publication, PMID: 30181294, in which we showed that midbody arrest is rescued by re-expression of exogenous CHMP4C following depletion of endogenous CHMP4C.</p><p>b) As suggested, we also performed experiments with AurB inhibitors (AurBi), and have enclosed the data for the reviewers’ information (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We found that Aurora B inhibition does not completely dissolve ACBs (1A) but does decrease ACB numbers (1B). An important point is that although the AurB inhibitor allosterically prevents AurB from phosphorylating its targets, it does not reverse AurB phospho-status. When we treat with AurBi, we find that phospho-AurB signal at the midbody decreases &gt;10-fold whereas the phospho-AurB signal in ACBs remains unchanged (1C). It seems likely that phosphatases at the midbody dephosphorylate AurB to destabilize the midbody and eventually enable abscission, whereas AurB remains phosphorylated in ACBs. We hypothesize that disassembly of ACBs requires an active process that is likely to involve recruitment of additional factors. Thus, this line of experiments generated useful information but we have not included it in the revised manuscript because it did not address the question that prompted it.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>AurB inhibition decreases but does not completely dissolve ACBs.</title><p>(A) Quantification of midbody-stage cells (Intact) and recently-abscised midbody pairs (Cut) with ACBs marked by α-pAurB after treatment with siCon or siNups and thymidine synchronization.

We note that lagging chromatin, which does not support ACB formation, creates a unique cellular structure that is located proximal to the abscission site. Thus, we hypothesize that unlike the other known signals that maintain NoCut activation, lagging chromatin maintains NoCut signals without promoting ACB formation, although these different upstream scenarios share a reliance on Aurora B and ultimately converge on events at the midbody that delay abscission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to the previous point, the aphidicolin experiments are important to support the conclusion that ACBs are caused by conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction, and not by defective nuclear import. However, it is possible that aphidicolin does not delay abscission under the conditions used. Instead, aphidicolin could just delay S-phase and thus all subsequent cell cycle stages without affecting the duration of abscission itself. To test this, the fraction of midbody-stage cells with and without ACBs should be determined for the entire duration of the time course after aphidicolin addition, and not only for the interval between 12 and 18 hours after thymidine release (Figure 5 supplement 1B-D). This would also reveal if ACBs appear in unchallenged cells earlier in the cell cycle, which would be useful to understand their origin.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we performed live-imaging experiments in which we measured the time from midbody formation to scission (i.e., abscission time) in DMSO vs aphidicolin-treated cells. These data are presented in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C. Importantly, we observe that aphidicolin treatment delays specifically abscission timing by ~21 minutes, consistent with a previously published result (PMID: 25904336). Thus, the duration of abscission is significantly delayed by aphidicolin treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. On the true existence of a &quot;checkpoint&quot; in the sense of a truly external mechanism that oversees abscission vs. the lack of a key structural component necessary to complete abscission. Given the observed accumulation of ACBs and their proposed origin from MIGs, it could be that some splicing event of a rate limiting mRNA/protein necessary to complete abscission is flawed. Given that the authors can synchronize cells in such delayed abscission condition, it would be instrumental to investigate whether splicing (by RT-PCR) and production of key proteins (by western blot) involved in abscission is taking place normally.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that an RNA splicing event could indeed be required for abscission to take place, and we view this as one of the possible mechanisms by which checkpoint signaling could delay abscission (and this possibility is now discussed explicitly). Whether or not this intriguing possibility is correct, however, we believe that assaying RNA splicing and identifying a (putative) regulated splicing target is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Are ACBs functionally involved in the abscission checkpoint? ACBs appear upon conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction, disappears when the checkpoint component CHMP4C is depleted and correlates with decreased levels of ALIX in the intercellular bridge. These are interesting but correlative evidence for a function of ACBs in the checkpoint. The authors conclude that ACBs regulate abscission timing (Figure 4), since stimulating their formation/maintenance (through DYRK3 or CLK1/2 inhibition) delays abscission in normal cells. This raises several questions. First, the abscission delay is rather modest and could only partially explain the abscission delay observed upon conditions that preclude checkpoint satisfaction. Second, this is different from previous studies (e.g. PMID 27126587), which, on the contrary, it was found that CLK inhibition accelerated abscission. The authors argue that they used a more specific inhibitor and for a shorter period of time. A simple test would be to use the same treatment as in PMID 27126587 (5h, pan-CLK inhibitor) and to show that in these conditions ACBs are dissolved. Third and more importantly, one would be fully convinced that ACBs regulate the abscission checkpoint if abscission timing is restored to normal upon conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction when ACBs are experimentally dissolved. For instance, overexpression of CLK (but not a kinase dead CLK) was previously found to dissolve MIGs (PMID 11827980). Would the abscission delay be abolished by ACBs dissolution in NUP-depleted cells? What is the effect of CLK inhibition in RPE1 cells? These or equivalent experiments would greatly enhance the mechanistic implications and of ACBs and their general role in the abscission checkpoint.</p></disp-quote><p>a) We agree that the abscission delay under DYRK3 or CLK1/2 inhibition is modest. We also observe that the enhancement of ACB formation under these conditions is modest compared to what we see with Nup depletion (likely because this is just one arm of a complex signaling pathway). Multiple mechanisms are known to halt abscission when the checkpoint is active, so even under the best of circumstances, inducing just one of these mechanisms would not be expected to recreate the strength of a coordinated checkpoint response. Therefore, in our view, the effect on abscission seen with DYRK3 or CLK1/2 inhibition – in the absence of other signals and components- provides significant support for our model.</p><p>b) As suggested, we compared our specific CLK1/2 inhibitor to the previously-used pan-CLK inhibitor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). In parallel experiments, we find that the specific CLK1/2 inhibitor induces mild abscission arrest and ACB formation while the pan-CLK inhibitor has no effect either on abscission timing or ACB formation. We conclude that the pan-CLK inhibitor may have a different potency or that the lack of effects could potentially reflect opposing roles of CLK family members. Regardless, the experiments did not change our conclusions about CLK1.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Specific CLK1/2 inhibition delays abscission timing.</title><p>(A) Quantification of midbody-stage cells after 5 h asynchronous treatment with DMSO, 0.5 – 10 µM Pan-CLK inhibitor (Pan-CLKi, TG003, Sigma), or 1 µM specific CLK1/2 inhibitor (CLK1i, 534350, Millipore).

We find that overexpressing WT CLK1 consistently and significantly decreases midbody-stage cells and correspondingly decreases ACB numbers. ACB disassembly corresponds to increased nuclear signal, further supporting the conclusion that CLK1 encourages ACB factors to leave this site and become available for nuclear entry. These data are now presented in new Figures 4H-I and Figure 4—figure supplement 4.</p><p>In summary, we find that CLK1 inhibition increases ACB numbers and frequency, and correspondingly increases midbody numbers. Conversely, overexpressing CLK1 decreases ACB numbers, and correspondingly decreases midbody-stage cells. While these effects are modest, they are proportional to the extent that we can manipulate ACB formation/dissolution and the effects of manipulating this regulatory mechanism in isolation, and collectively support the conclusion that ACBs contribute directly to abscission regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The existence of ACBs (positive for pppCHMP4C, pAuroraB and CHMP4B) is demonstrated in fixed cells that have been pre-permeabilized before fixation. Nobody has reported so far the existence of CHMP4B aggregates in the cytoplasm upon conditions that prevent checkpoint satisfaction. In addition, the midbody staining of CHMP4B is unusual (Figure 3D), perhaps as a consequence of pre-permeabilization. Can the authors find a way to show that ACBs exist in NUP-depleted cells without pre-permeabilization (which might induce phase separation in these cells)? Showing ACBs in live cells (no fixation) using CHMP4B-LAP-GFP, CHMP4C-LAP-GFP and speckle markers (e.g. SC35-YFP as in PMID 20926517 Figure 2) would be even better than after fixation. One would expect cytoplasmic dots in live cells upon NUP depletion using these makers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for giving us an opportunity to clarify this point. We did, in fact, initially show that each of the above markers localizes to ACBs in non-permeabilized cells (pppCHMP4C: Figure 3A; SC35: Figure 4B; pAurB: Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, CHMP4B: Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) before using pre-permeabilization to aid in staining clarity for ease of quantification. We have clarified this point in the text. We also agree that pre-permeabilization does disrupt midbody staining for some proteins (e.g., CHMP4B) more than others (e.g., pAurB). Finally, we have included new data in Figure 4C showing that in live cells, SRRM2-mCherry localizes strongly to ACBs under checkpoint active conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
