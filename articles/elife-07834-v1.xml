Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is critical for maintenance of these cells; however, the perinatal source of Shh is enigmatic. In the present study, we examined the role of Shh expressed by hair follicles (HFs) that expand perinatally in temporal concordance with the proliferation of Shh-responding dentate stem cells. Specific inhibition of Shh from HFs or from epithelial sources in general hindered development of Shh-responding dentate stem cells. We also found that the blood–brain barrier (BBB) of the perinatal dentate gyrus (DG) is leaky with stem cells in the dentate exposed to blood-born factors. In attempting to identify how Shh might be transported in blood, we found that platelets contain epithelial Shh, provide Shh to the perinatal DG and that inhibition of platelet generation reduced hedgehog-responsive dentate stem cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07834.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07834.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07834.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although most of the neurons in the brain have been made by the time we are born, new neurons develop throughout life in part of the brain called the hippocampus. These neurons are thought to help with learning and forming memories. Conditions such as depression and Alzheimer's disease have been linked to not being able to produce enough new neurons.</p><p>The neurons develop from a pool of stem cells in part of the hippocampus. A protein called Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) helps to ensure there are enough stem cells and control when they develop into new neurons. The brain cells that produce Shh in adult mice do not appear until a week after birth, by which point the stem cells are already present and generating neurons. This has led scientists to question where these cells get Shh from around the time of birth.</p><p>One idea is that cells outside of the brain contribute the Shh such as hair follicles—the structures that hairs grow out of—in the scalp. Hair follicles produce Shh, develop at around the same time as the brain stem cells, and are known to regulate the development of other nearby stem cells. So, Choe et al. conducted a series of experiments in genetically engineered newborn mice and found that the brain stem cells multiply at around the same time that the hair follicles start to produce Shh. Furthermore, reducing the amount of Shh produced by the hair follicles hampered the growth of these stem cells and caused fewer neurons to develop from the stem cell pool.</p><p>These results raised the question of how Shh gets from the hair follicles to the stem cell pool in the developing brain. In adult animals, a barrier exists between the brain and the blood supply to protect the brain from infection. However, parts of this barrier are still leaky before birth, which might allow blood cells to carry Shh to the brain. Cloe et al. found that platelets—the blood cells responsible for clotting—are able to carry Shh to the brain stem cell pool. Further experiments showed that preventing platelets from forming caused fewer stem cells to develop.</p><p>The suggestion that Shh from the epithelium—the tissue layer that hair follicles are found in—is able to signal to the brain during a specific window of time raises several questions that require further study. Does epithelial Shh also signal to other organs during embryonic or postnatal development? Does injury to the nervous system that increases the permeability of the blood–brain barrier lead to the delivery of Shh to the brain via the circulation in adult animals?</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07834.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07834.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>Shh</kwd><kwd>platelet</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS075188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pleasure</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>KBRI basic research program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2231-415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choe</surname><given-names>Youngshik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003710</institution-id><institution>Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HI14C1135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choe</surname><given-names>Youngshik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014R1A1A2053419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Choe</surname><given-names>Youngshik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During development the Sonic Hedgehog protein is produced by epithelial structures and acts at a distance in the brain and perhaps in other organs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural stem cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) consistently provide new excitatory neurons to modulate hippocampal circuitry and disrupted neurogenesis is linked to multiple neurological and psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Stem cell niches in the adult dentate subgranular zone are established primarily by Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-responsive radial glial cells, which appear at embryonic day (E) 17 in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li and Pleasure, 2014</xref>). In the adult, Shh plays a crucial role in maintaining the dentate stem cell niche and driving neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Machold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Favaro et al., 2009</xref>). Starting at the end of the first week of life in mice, Shh is provided locally by cells in the dentate hilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>); however, Shh-expressing cells are not present in the DG when dentate stem cells first appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>). There are several ways by which Shh-responsive cells might be found in the dentate prior to birth. Our previous work showed that Shh from outside the dorsal forebrain is crucial for the establishment of the dentate stem cells in the dentate, and that at earlier embryonic stages, the Shh ligand is produced by the amygdala and supplied to the adjacent ventral dentate neuroepithelium and these stem cells then migrate to populate both the temporal and septal dentate just before birth in mice (at E17.5–18.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Since the postnatal dentate stem cells require Shh signaling to maintain stemness and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choe and Pleasure, 2012</xref>), the dentate stem cell niche should employ ways of supplying Shh from different sources after establishing the stem cells in the germinal area before birth. What structures supply Shh to the dentate after stem cells leave the germinative zone in the ventral dentate neuroepithelium and before the hilar mossy cells begin to produce Shh at the end of the first week of life?</p><p>Skin morphogenesis and homeostasis are regulated by hair follicles (HFs), each of which is a small structure stocked with cells producing factors such as platelet-derived growth factors (Pdgfs) and Shh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">St-Jacques et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karlsson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2009</xref>). The perinatal interaction of the epithelial and dermal mesenchymal cells establishes the stem cell niche for the HFs through crosstalk of a variety of signaling molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rendl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nowak et al., 2008</xref>), and the development of HFs exposes new morphogens to nearby stem cell niches including mesenchymal stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Adult HSC niches form from embryonic HSCs that transiently reside in the liver by migration of the stem cells into the bone marrow. During late embryonic development, the skull is an active site for hematopoiesis, temporally coinciding with neurogenesis in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Medvinsky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Calvarial mesenchymal cells condense to form the skull vault through intramembraneous ossification, and bone marrow mesenchymal cells play a critical role of recruiting HSCs from the circulation by secreting Cxcl12, a critical homing signal for HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Méndez-Ferrer and Frenette, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lo Celso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Greenbaum et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the osteoblastic cells in the skull niche control hematopoiesis including megakaryopoiesis in the context of skeletal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pallotta et al., 2009</xref>). Megakaryocytes, one of the HSC lineages, produce bone matrix components, cytokines and growth factors and mutant mice, which fail to release platelets from megakaryocytes such as <italic>Gata1</italic> and <italic>Nfe2</italic> knockout mice have abnormal bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kacena et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2006</xref>). Activation of platelets leads to release of contents including Tgfβ1, implying a messenger role for megakaryocytes to convey signals from the bone marrow and mesenchymal stem cell niches into the rest of the organism, particularly in places and locations with leaky blood vessels during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Levine et al., 1993</xref>). Interestingly, morphogens like Shh are also carried by blood-derived cells. T lymphocytes shed microvesicles containing Shh and Shh anchored in the microvesicles is functionally active in new blood vessel formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agouni et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soleti and Martinez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benameur et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the HSC generated cells may be critical for delivery of morphogens via the developing vascular system.</p><p>HFs in the head skin are established perinatally, coinciding with expansion of calvarial and dermal mesenchymal cells covering the developing brain. The blood–brain barrier (BBB) matures as early as embryonic day (E) 15.5 in most forebrain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>) except for a few areas, including the DG where the BBB matures postnatally. This raises a possibility that the HF stem cell niche signals interact with dermal/calvarial HSCs and the developing neurovascular units of the DG. In the present study, we provide evidence that HF stem niche signals such as Shh control the dentate stem cells by utilizing platelets as a delivery system in the early postnatal period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of Shh in developing HFs temporally coincides with Shh signaling in the dentate</title><p>Shh signaling is critical for ventral forebrain development in early embryogenesis and the signaling pathway becomes restricted within the neural and glial stem cell niches at the end of embryogenesis. Embryonically produced dentate granule neurons and dentate stem cells originate from the ventricular zone of the DG, whereas the adult dentate has hedgehog-responsive stem cells that reside in the dentate subgranular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altman and Bayer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Since Shh is not detected in the dorsal forebrain when the adult dentate stem cells appear before birth, we examined putative sources of Shh that might contribute to Shh delivery via the dentate vasculature. To gain insight into the anatomy of Shh signaling in the head, we examined <italic>Gli1-GFP</italic> transgenic mice expressing GFP in hedgehog-responding cells. The GFP + hedgehog-responding cells of a <italic>Gli1-GFP</italic> GENSAT transgenic mouse line were obvious in the forming HFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, arrow heads) of the dermis at E15.5 when the dermal mesenchymal cells condense before the appearance of calvarial bones, which showed GFP expression at later ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red arrows). From E17.5 onward, the DG showed GFP + dentate progenitors and their descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, yellow arrows). Despite the expansion of dentate <italic>Gli1-GFP +</italic> cells, the expression of Shh, however, was not detected in the dorsal cortex. Perinatally, Shh expression was rather restricted in the ventral forebrain such as around the third ventricle and in the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Interestingly, the HFs, expanding dramatically after E17.5, were the geographically closest Shh-expressing cells to the DG when examined using the perinatal mouse head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07834.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hedgehog signaling is restricted in the dermal mesenchyme and dentate stem cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of <italic>Gli1-GFP</italic> shows the hedgehog-responding cells in the dermal mesenchyme (red arrows), and hair follicles (HFs) (arrow heads) and the dentate (yellow arrows) at the late embryogenesis.

The vascular plexus and close location of HFs to the dermal and calvarial HSC niche led us to hypothesize that the follicular Shh could affect forebrain development and be a source of Shh ligand to the brain. To examine this possibility, we used <italic>Krt14-Cre</italic>, a dermis-specific Cre line, to conditionally inhibit the expression of Shh from the HF. The <italic>Krt14-</italic>Cre;<italic>Shh</italic><sup>flx<italic>/flx</italic></sup> mutants showed loss of Ptch1, a downstream target gene of hedgehog signaling, and Shh expression in the skin; however, Shh expression in the ventral forebrain was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We stained the DG with Ki67 (a marker of dividing dentate progenitors), Pdgfrα (a meningeal [white dashed lines], and oligodendrocyte precursor marker—in the dentate, a few oligogenic progenitors exist at E17.5 and more at P1 in the DG) and Reelin (a Cajal-Retzius cell marker) from E17.5 to P1, when the mutant died, and observed significant decreases of Ki67 + dentate progenitors in the <italic>Krt14-Cre;Shh</italic><sup><italic>flx/flx</italic></sup> mutant compared to the heterozygous <italic>Krt14-Cre;Shh</italic><sup><italic>flx/+</italic></sup> or control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,B′,B″</xref>).

Dermal mesenchymal cells expand rapidly perinatally and the mesenchymal cell numbers were reduced after loss of hair follicular Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A and 3D</xref>).

It is known that the BBB forms as early as E15.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>) and is reinforced later by astrocytes. We wondered whether the dentate BBB matures according to the same time frame as the rest of the cortex or whether the dentate BBB might still be leaky at perinatal stages when dentate stem cells populate the dentate. We examined the integrity of the perinatal dentate BBB first using 70 KDa biotin-conjugated dextran dyes perfused into E17.5 embryos and P1 pups followed by staining with streptavidin to visualize the integrity of the dentate blood vessels. At E17.5 and P1, the dentate blood vessels were leaky, with 70 KDa dye shedding into the adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

These results imply that at these perinatal stages, the glia-like dentate stem cells are involved in the organization of the dentate BBB and that these stem cells could be exposed to blood-born factors. Perfusion of 70 KDa dyes into P5 pups also showed weak integrity of dentate blood vessels compared to blood vessels in CA1 pyramidal zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,D′</xref>).

To examine whether the platelets contain Shh, fifty μl of embryonic blood was streaked on glass slides to stain platelets with Shh antibodies. Platelets from E15.5 did not show Shh expression, but platelets from E17.5 embryonic blood showed strong Shh expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,C′</xref>).

The microvesicles from the conditioned media contained unprocessed Shh proteins as compared from the Shh produced in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>) and this result implies that hair follicular Shh can be released as unprocessed form in microvesicles to be taken up by carrier cells such as platelets. It needs to be further studied how proteins from other sources are packaged into embryonic platelets at specific ages; however, these results support that platelets could carry Shh from the dermis to the DG.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07834.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Platelets and their neighboring cells respond to hedgehog signaling in the dermal and the dentate blood circulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pregnant <italic>Gli1-Cre</italic><sup><italic>ERt2</italic></sup><italic>;Rosa-Yfp</italic> mice were injected with TM at E15.5 and embryos were collected at E17.5 to co-stain hedgehog-responding cells and a platelet marker, Cd42d.

Lastly, we provide entirely unexpected evidence that platelets in the developing embryo affected the Shh-responding population in the perinatal dentate.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sources of Shh during dentate development</title><p>Early ventral patterning is governed by Shh secreted from the ventral neurons and floor plate cells, and development of the dorsal neural tube requires the absence of Shh signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Echelard et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ruiz i Altaba et al., 1995</xref>). However, after neural tube closure, the zona limitans intrathalamica cells, cerebellar Purkinje neurons, and the tectal plate start to express Shh and regulate expansion of the dorsal brain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ruiz i Altaba et al., 2002</xref>). From E14.5 to E17.5, weak expression of Shh was detected in the layer V cortical projection neurons away from the <italic>Gli</italic> gene expression domains, which are exclusively detected in the germinal area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dahmane et al., 2001</xref>). During late stage of dorsal brain development, Shh is known to function as a mitogen for Shh-responsive precursors in the cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dahmane, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999</xref>).

In the ventral forebrain, cells in the striatum and the amygdala strongly express Shh and contribute to the generation of dorsal neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Machold et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>).

A prominent source of Shh in the adult forebrain is restricted expression in the layer 5 cortical projection neurons, and the neuronal Shh primarily regulates neuronal microcircuit formation and the development of astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Harwell et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Development of the DG begins about E13 and extends for two weeks, continuing after birth. The loss of Tbr2, a nuclear regulator of intermediate neuronal progenitors, fails to generate postnatal DG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hodge et al., 2012</xref>) and Tbr2 mutants have postnatal abnormalities of the DG similar to the DG of <italic>Smo</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Machold et al., 2003</xref>). This result implies that Shh signaling might be involved in neurogenesis through production of intermediate neuronal progenitors. One of the Shh effects could be transforming embryonic dentate stem cells to an intermediate neuronal progenitor-generating derivative of dentate stem cells. This idea somewhat explains the perinatal appearance of Shh-responsive dentate stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahn and Joyner, 2005</xref>), the proliferative effect of Shh to the late-born dentate stem cells, and the expansion of Shh-responsive radial glial stem cells during the early postnatal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lai et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choe and Pleasure, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The neuroepithelial cells are located near the ventricle, a rich source of trophic factors, but Shh-responding perinatal dentate stem cells need transient cell–cell interactions to maintain their stemness while producing dentate cells and migrating to the SGZ. To produce a large volume of dentate granule neurons and finally form a ‘V’ shaped SGZ to generate the dentate blades with new granule neurons, migrating dentate stem cells should be continuously exposed to mitogenic factors. The migrating dentate stem cells could take advantage of other sources of stem cell factors like the meninges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choe et al., 2013</xref>) but stem cells ultimately travel far from the meninges but still need access to mitogens.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Platelets as a source of developmentally important signaling molecules</title><p>It is well known that platelets are thrombotic anuclear cell fragments that regulate hemostasis, wound healing, and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gawaz and Vogel, 2013</xref>). After vascular damage, activated platelets plug the wound and maintain hemostasis. Growth factors from platelets have been known to promote growth of fibroblasts, hepatocytes, glial cells, hippocampal neurons, and endothelial cells, and platelets are the best source of purifying growth factors such as PDGF, HGF, VEGF, PAF, TGFβ1, and BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kohler and Lipton, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Westermark and Wasteson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakamura et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyazono et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clark et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mohle et al., 1997</xref>). Although embryonic platelets appear before forebrain neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tober et al., 2007</xref>), the embryonic role for these cells has not been fully studied. Platelets are a source of various cytokines and growth factors and it is not surprising that platelets functions not only in the pathological conditions like thrombosis and neuronal degenerative diseases but also in physiological situations like embryonic development. Nonhemostatic and developmental functions of platelets are best understood for their roles in embryonic vascular patterning. <italic>Meis1</italic> mutant embryos lack platelets and show defective separation of blood and lymphatic vessels, while CLEC-2 receptors on platelets regulate lymphatic endothelial SLP-76 signaling and specify the lymphatic vessels from the blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bertozzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carramolino et al., 2010</xref>). In a pathological condition like stroke, platelet lysates injected into the ventricle showed a neuroprotective effect with increases in neurogenesis and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hayon et al., 2013</xref>). These results show that a plethora of biologically active contents in platelets can play a modulatory role under various physiological and pathological conditions and therapeutic benefits of platelets are broadly possible from this feature of platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stellos and Gawaz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mazzucco et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Developmental and pathophysiologic implications of platelets as carriers of signals</title><p>Proliferation of adult dentate stem cells proceeds in perivascular microenvironements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Palmer et al., 2000</xref>) and the platelets' contents including Shh, Vegf, Tgfβ could control stem cell behavior depending on the vascular condition. In a pathological condition like vascular dementia, the wound in the blood vessels could open up the hole for platelets to release contents to the endothelial cells and the dentate cells. Since Shh could affect differentiated dentate granule neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petralia et al., 2013</xref>), the shedding of platelets through the wounded blood vessels could not be beneficial to the adult dentate system like perinatal DG. Duration of Shh exposure time contributes to the proliferative capacity of progenitor cells and the specification of differentiated neurons such as dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hayes et al., 2013</xref>) and olfactory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ihrie et al., 2011</xref>).

This also helps to explain the expansion of migrating dorsal dentate stem cells from the ventral DG in the absence of definitive Shh-expressing cells just after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that Shh from platelets could affect not only the DG but also other regions like the cortex but the effect of Shh could be masked by other contents of platelets. Elucidation of the interplay among platelets' contents during formation of the dentate neural stem cell niche will bring new aspects of communication between HSCs and neural stem cells and it will shed light on the therapeutic use of platelets for neurodegenerative vascular diseases<bold>.</bold></p><p>Recent studies showing that youthful systemic circulation rejuvenates aged stem cells in heterochronic-aged parabionts provides a fascinating additional implication of our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conboy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Villeda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conboy and Rando, 2012</xref>).

Your submission has been evaluated by Sean Morrison (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript explores the perinatal source of Hh ligand, focusing on the first postnatal week of murine life prior to Hh secretion by dentate hilar cells. The authors demonstrate that Hh ligand is secreted by hair follicle cells of the scalp and transported to the hippocampus via platelets and through a focally leaky BBB. Without this extra-axial source of Hh ligand, the hippocampal stem cell population is diminished and dentate gyrus neurogenesis is impaired into later postnatal life.</p><p>The work utilizes elegant mouse modeling to demonstrate a previously unrecognized mechanism of Hh ligand delivery to the hippocampal stem cell population and elucidates a fascinating extension of the hippocampal “stem cell niche” outside of the brain. It is an important set of findings that furthers our understanding of Hh-mediated stem cell maintenance and highlights platelets as an under recognized source of growth factor transport to the brain.</p><p>However, two of the three referees raised some major concerns and point out that your conclusion is not yet convincing because you have not ruled out that some of the mouse lines are not inadvertently affecting Shh directly in the brain. Elucidating the mechanisms of SHH packaging into platelets goes beyond the scope of the paper, but providing data on the recombination patterns of the Cre alleles used would go a long way toward addressing the concerns of the reviewers. We would encourage you to undertake these major revisions and submit for further consideration.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) How well do the authors show that Shh is made in skin and conveyed to the hippocampus? The authors show that two Cre drivers, Keratin14 and <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic>, both decrease Shh expression in the skin that covers the brain and decrease dentate granule cell proliferation. The data presented regarding the specificity of the two promoters that were used is limited. For example, <italic>K14</italic> is also expressed in thymic tissues, raising the question of microglial changes in Shh expression in the mutant, and is also expressed in ovaries. Moreover, the <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> is usually used to tag cells derived from the AER. When crossed through females, it is expressed ubiquitously. Thus more data on the specificity would help. It would be important to show that neither of these Cres alter the expression of Shh mRNA in the periventricular area.</p><p>It would also be important to show that using these Cre's affects the level of Shh protein present in the Dentate granule zone, to confirm that the Shh present there is gone.</p><p>Please provide some additional data that there is loss of Shh signaling per se in the Dentate granule cells in these mutants (<italic>gli1</italic> expression perhaps?), in addition to the changes in proliferation shown for both, and changes in <italic>Ptc-LacZ</italic> shown for <italic>Msx2-cre</italic>.</p><p>2) The blot of E17.5 blood samples immunoprecipitated with CD41 are used to show that Shh is associated with platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>'). Our understanding of the model is that megakaryocytes and platelets do not synthesize Shh, but that it is associated with the platelets at a later time point. The size of the Shh band shown is the size of uncleaved, immature Shh, rather than the mature, N-terminal protein that is a ligand. This really brings into question the model that “shh could be packaged into platelets similar to other factors that are packaged into platelets without being expressed by megakaryocytes”.</p><p>3) Regarding the conclusion that Shh from HFs passes through the leaky BBB to dentate neural stem cells and platelets act as the Shh carrier: the <italic>Nfe2</italic> knockout experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> suggest that <italic>Nfe2</italic>-dependent platelets play an important role in expanding the <italic>Ptch1+</italic> DG stem/progenitor cells, but this might not be through their role as a Shh carrier. Rather, some other platelet-derived factors or indirect effects downstream of platelet differentiation might be responsible for this <italic>Nfe2</italic>-dependent effect.</p><p>Furthermore, how is follicular Shh incorporated into platelets? And how do platelets release Shh at the DG? Revealing these mechanisms and inhibiting them would address the above issue and greatly improve the study, but this may be too much to ask. The authors should revise the text instead in order to avoid overinterpretation.</p><p>4) The authors should be more careful about identification of the DG neural stem cells and use more markers to define them. Counting the numbers of Ki67+ cells and LEF1+ cells is not enough.</p><p>Suggestions for improvement:</p><p>The authors examine cell proliferation in the postnatal hippocampus and find it to be decreased when SHh ligand is conditionally ablated from hair follicle cells of the head, but postnatal neurogenesis is not examined in this model. Demonstrating postnatal decrease in Dcx+ cells of the dentate at P40 in the <italic>Msx2-cre</italic>; <italic>Shh</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> mouse would strengthen the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07834.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major revisions</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) How well do the authors show that Shh is made in skin and conveyed to the hippocampus?

It would be important to show that neither of these Cres alter the expression of Shh mRNA in the periventricular area</italic>.</p><p>The <italic>K14-Cre</italic> mice were selected according to the specific expression of <italic>K14-Cre</italic> in the skin. The <italic>K14-Cre</italic> line in the experiment was obtained from one of two lines originally generated from mice that expressed the highest levels of Cre RNA in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dassule et al., 2000</xref> Development 127:4775-4785). This line is different from the <italic>K14-Cre</italic> line reported by Hafner et al. which covered more areas such as ovary, tongue and thymic epithelium (Hafner et al., 2004, Genesis 38:176-181). As noted in the Methods section, we only derived Cre expression from the male side to avoid non-specific expression of Cre or germ-line expression of the Cre. <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> mice have been used for the expression of Cre in the AER and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choe et al., 2012</xref>) and the Cre expression of both <italic>K14-Cre</italic> and <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> at the age of the birth show strong expression mostly in the skin but nowhere in the brain (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). We do consider the possibility of transient expression of Cre in the other tissues which may compromise the restricted knockdown of Shh in the skin. Shh expression is highest in the lung, kidney as well as HF (<italic>Shh-Cre</italic> expression and Shh immunostaining; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>) at the age of birth but only HF overlapped with <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> and <italic>K14-cre</italic> expression so the chance of Shh inhibition in the other tissues of the Cre mice seems minimal. Considering that Cre may transiently inhibits Shh expression in the other regions of Shh expression, however, we do confirm that Cre expression from <italic>K14-Cre</italic> and <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> mice is highest in the skin at E15 and P1 but never detected in the area of the brain including the periventricular area.</p><p><italic>It would also be important to show that using these Cre's affects the level of Shh protein present in the Dentate granule zone, to confirm that the Shh present there is gone</italic>.</p><p>We show the expression of Shh in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>. From Western blot analysis, the expression was variable since collecting vascular tissues connected to the dentate gyrus couldn’t be controlled. As revealed by immunostaining the fresh frozen dentate tissues, the expression of Shh was abundant in the vascular tissues surrounding the dentate and also in the hilus at P3 pups. The staining showed drastic reduction of Shh expression in the mutant pups.</p><p><italic>Please provide some additional data that there is loss of Shh signaling per se in the Dentate granule cells in these mutants (</italic>gli1 <italic>expression perhaps?), in addition to the changes in proliferation shown for both, and changes in</italic> Ptc-LacZ <italic>shown for</italic> Msx2-cre<italic>.</italic></p><p>We also added another Shh reporter line i.e., <italic>Gli1-GFP</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>. Since breeding <italic>Gli1-GFP</italic> mice with the <italic>Msx2-Cre</italic> along with Shhflox allele took too long time we bred <italic>Nfe2</italic> mutant mice to the <italic>Gli1-GFP</italic> reporter line. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8–figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>Gli1-GFP</italic> expression was drastically reduced in <italic>Nfe2</italic> mutant mice supporting the idea that platelet mutants have reduced dentate cells produced from Shh activation.</p><p><italic>2) The blot of E17.5 blood samples immunoprecipitated with CD41 are used to show that Shh is associated with platelets (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7C</italic></xref>'<italic>). Our understanding of the model is that megakaryocytes and platelets do not synthesize Shh, but that it is associated with the platelets at a later time point. The size of the Shh band shown is the size of uncleaved, immature Shh, rather than the mature, N-terminal protein that is a ligand. This really brings into question the model that “shh could be packaged into platelets similar to other factors that are packaged into platelets without being expressed by megakaryocytes”</italic>.</p><p>We checked whether the lineage of megakaryocytes do express mRNA by using <italic>Shh-Cre</italic> with Ai14 reporter which has a strong red fluorescence in the Shh expressing cells. We did not see any platelets or MK cells are co-localized with Ai14 reporter which reconfirm that MK cell lineages do not express Shh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref>). The rationale for the containment of unprocessed Shh in the platelets rather than the active N-Shh may be a requirement for secondary Shh processing pathway can be involved after release of Shh from platelets to get activation of Shh in the recipient cells. We reasoned that unprocessed Shh in the microvesicles may be carried in the megakaryocytes or platelets and released as a form of microvesicles. To support the idea, we cultivated cells from the hair follicles from P1 pups. From in vitro cell culture, we got a preliminary result that the hair follicle cells secrete unprocessed Shh packaged in microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4</xref>). Cells from the hair follicle rich skin of P1 pups were cultivated in microvesicle depleted media (precleared by ultracentrifugation) and the conditioned media were precipitated at 120000 g for 90 min to collect microvesicles. Detection of Shh from the microvesicles by western blot showed unprocessed Shh. This implies that Shh in the vesicles could be carried to the circulating cells such as platelets or megakaryocytes as unprocessed, packaged particles. Super-resolution images of CD41 or CD42d+ platelets’ microvesicles containing Shh also support the idea unprocessed Shh may be packaged in the platelets as vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>). Further clarification of how Shh is loaded and released, gets activated in receiving cells will be an interesting next question.</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the conclusion that Shh from HFs passes through the leaky BBB to dentate neural stem cells and platelets act as the Shh carrier: the</italic> Nfe2 <italic>knockout experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref> <italic>suggest that</italic> Nfe2<italic>-dependent platelets play an important role in expanding the</italic> Ptch1+ <italic>DG stem/progenitor cells, but this might not be through their role as a Shh carrier. Rather, some other platelet-derived factors or indirect effects downstream of platelet differentiation might be responsible for this</italic> Nfe2<italic>-dependent effect</italic>.</p><p>It is totally possible that the other contents of platelets such as PdgfA and VEGF could be released to the DG stem cells. Other signaling pathways involved in the <italic>Nfe2</italic>-mediated platelet formation could also possibly affect the dentate at the age. We toned down our conclusion drawn from <italic>Nfe2</italic> mutants and focused on describing the result that <italic>Ptch1-LacZ</italic> positive dentate cells were also decreased in the <italic>Nfe2</italic> mutants and that the possible down-regulation of Shh responsiveness could be involved in the mutant.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, how is follicular Shh incorporated into platelets? And how do platelets release Shh at the DG? Revealing these mechanisms and inhibiting them would address the above issue and greatly improve the study, but this may be too much to ask. The authors should revise the text instead in order to avoid overinterpretation</italic>.</p><p>We totally agree with the reviewers point here and tried to get further supporting data about the same question. Unfortunately we can’t provide solid results except the preliminary results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7–figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7–figure supplement 4</xref>) at the moment. We also revised the text to avoid the over-interpretation as suggested.</p><p><italic>4) The authors should be more careful about identification of the DG neural stem cells and use more markers to define them. Counting the numbers of Ki67+ cells and LEF1+ cells is not enough</italic>.</p><p>We previously showed that Lef1 is a strong dentate stem cell marker and that at perinatal ages the stem cells are rapidly proliferating mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choe et al., 2013</xref>) so we relied on Lef1 staining rather than other less specific markers. Ki67 also marks proliferating cells in the dentate and most of proliferating cells in the perinatal DG are neurogenic, so counting Ki67 and Lef1 positive cells can be interpreted as the number of proliferating neurogenic cells in the dentate. We also added Sox2, another marker for dentate stem cells at P1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>) and DCX, a marker for newly born immature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>) to strengthen the result.</p></body></sub-article></article>
