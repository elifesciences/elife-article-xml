life. Animal studies have identified both neural and endocrine pathways, by which the central nervous system adjusts cardiac output and peripheral vascular resistance to changing physiological demands. The outflow of these pathways is coordinated by various central nervous regions based on afferent information from baroreceptors, chemoreceptors, nociceptors, and circulating hormones, and is modulated by physiologic and behavioural state. In humans, however, knowledge on central cardiovascular regulation below the cortical level is scarce. Here, we show using functional MRI (fMRI) that at least three hypothalamic subsystems are involved in cardiovascular regulation in humans. The rhythmic behaviour of these systems corresponds to high and low frequency oscillations typically seen in blood pressure and heart rate variability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stand up too fast and you know what happens next. You will feel faint as the blood rushes away from your head. Gravity pulls the blood into your legs, and your blood pressure drops. To correct this imbalance, the brain sends nerve impulses telling the heart to beat faster and the outer blood vessels to tighten. This is the autonomic nervous system at work. It is how the brain adjusts cardiac output, and quietly controls other internal organs in the body. It involves two key regions of the brain, the hypothalamus and the brainstem, and stimulates smooth muscles and glands around the body.</p><p>The cardiovascular system also responds to the demands of exercise, with the heart supplying fresh blood laden with oxygen and the blood clearing out waste materials as it flows around the body. Perhaps surprisingly, blood pressure and heart rate fluctuate even at rest. The heart beats faster when breathing in and slower when breathing out. People’s blood pressure, the force that keeps blood moving through arteries, also oscillates in so-called Mayer waves that last about 10 seconds.</p><p>Much of the current understanding of the inner workings of the cardiovascular system – and how it is regulated by the brain – stems from animal experiments. This is because few attempts have been made to simultaneously measure how a person’s brain and cardiovascular system work with enough detail to see how brain waves and cardiac oscillations might interact.</p><p>To achieve this, Manuel et al. have now measured the brain activity, pulse and blood pressure of twenty-two healthy people while they were lying down in an MRI machine. This revealed that three distinct parts of the hypothalamus regulate cardiovascular output in humans. These ‘subsystems’ communicate with each other and with the lower brainstem, which sits beneath the hypothalamus. Manuel et al. also observed that the rhythmic activity of these subsystems runs in sync with oscillations typically seen in heart rate and blood pressure.</p><p>With this work, Manuel et al. have shown that it is feasible to measure different systems of cardiovascular control in humans. In time, with further experiments using this new approach, the understanding of chronic high blood pressure and heart failure may improve.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>autonomic nervous system</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular regulation</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Horst Goertz Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beissner</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funding body had no role in study design, collection and analysis of data, and decision to publish</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>At least three hypothalamic subsystems are involved in cardiovascular regulation in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Given the importance of cardiovascular regulation for our daily survival, it is not surprising that the body has several redundant and mutually interacting systems for this task. Important representatives include the classical baroreceptor (arterial and cardiopulmonary) and chemoreceptor reflexes, neuroendocrine systems, like the vasopressin, sympatho-adrenal, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone, and the more recently discovered leptin-melanocortin system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sawchenko and Swanson, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dampney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilzendeger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Much of our present understanding of these systems stems from animals experiments, while mechanistic studies in humans remain scarce, mostly for lack of non-invasive methods to assess subcortical brain activity. Furthermore, most studies have evaluated only one system at a time. We must assume, however, that all neural and neuroendocrine cardiovascular control systems are carefully orchestrated by the central nervous system to achieve optimal regulation. The control centres responsible for such orchestration are presumed to be located in the brainstem and hypothalamus. They are well characterised for the ‘textbook’ baroreflex, but much less for the other systems.</p><p>To study cardiovascular regulation in human subjects, we devised an MR-compatible lower body negative pressure (LBNP) chamber that simulates orthostatic stress via footward blood volume displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goswami et al., 2008</xref>). The pressure of −30 mmHg used in our experiment has been shown to recruit both neural and endocrine mechanisms of cardiovascular regulation via activation of cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loewy, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mark and Mancia, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kimmerly et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salman, 2016</xref>). While assessment of endocrine pathways requires invasive methods, neural cardiovascular regulation by the autonomic nervous system can be measured non-invasively as it leads to characteristic rhythms of heart rate and blood pressure variability (HRV, BPV). To assess these rhythmic changes, we recorded blood pressure and heart rate traces during the LBNP-fMRI measurements and subjected them to spectral analysis isolating two frequency bands: low frequency blood pressure variability (LF<sub>BPV</sub>, ~0.1 Hz), reflecting the so-called Mayer waves of sympathetic origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Julien, 2006</xref>); and high frequency heart rate variability (HF<sub>HRV</sub>,~0.28 Hz) reflecting the primarily vagally mediated respiratory sinus arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Billman, 2013</xref>). Note that both the LF and HF bands lie at the top or above the canonical frequency range of the BOLD signal (&lt;0.1 Hz, Figure 1i); although several studies have recently provided evidence for BOLD oscillations beyond this frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Glover, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of cardiovascular centres in the human hypothalamus.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Whole-brain T<sub>1</sub>-weighted study template showing the anatomical localisation of the hypothalamus.

Since these areas are notoriously hard to investigate in humans due to their small size, depth within the skull, and physiological noise from surrounding vessels and cerebrospinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beissner, 2015</xref>), we devised a high-resolution functional MRI approach and preprocessing pipeline specifically optimised for subcortical imaging. In particular, we balanced spatial and temporal resolution (2×2×2 mm³, 1.23 s) to distinguish neighbouring nuclei, while critically sampling respiratory frequencies. Preprocessing involved maximising anatomical specificity by applying advanced distortion correction, symmetric diffeomorphic image registration to a study template, and omitting any spatial smoothing. In contrast to common practice, we did not regress physiological fluctuations from our data to avoid removing meaningful signal from the cardiovascular regions we were interested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iacovella and Hasson, 2011</xref>. Instead, we opted for a spatial noise correction approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beissner et al., 2014</xref>) as part of our group-level statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>LBNP led to a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (Rest: 132.6 ± 20.2 mmHg, LBNP: 113.4 ± 20.2 mmHg, t(17)=-11.3, p&lt;0.001, Cohen's d = −0.95) and a compensatory decrease of the interbeat interval (Rest: 0.95 ± 0.12 s, LBNP: 0.85 ± 0.11 s, t(20)=-4.9, p&lt;0.001, d = −0.96), while measures of respiration (respiratory interval, respiratory volume, and respiratory volume per time) showed no significant changes. Furthermore, head movement was not significantly different between LBNP and Rest periods. We also observed increased spectral power of LF<sub>BPV</sub> (Rest: 0.14 ± 0.03, LBNP: 0.17 ± 0.04, t(17)=2.9, p=0.011, d = 0.97) and reduced spectral power of HF<sub>HRV</sub> (Rest: 0.18 ± 0.08, LBNP: 0.14 ± 0.08, t(20)=-2.4, p=0.0267, d = −0.47) indicating sympathetic excitation and vagal inhibition in response to the cardiovascular challenge, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d,e</xref>).</p><p>To identify cardiovascular control centres within the hypothalamus, we followed a two-step process; namely segmentation using masked independent component analysis (mICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beissner et al., 2014</xref>) of the fMRI time series, followed by testing for cardiovascular involvement using two independent criteria. In the first step, the hypothalamus was segmented into 49 functionally distinct regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), followed by removal of six unspecific components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), leaving 43 components. The initial number 49 was derived by maximising mICA reproducibility, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>. This high-dimensional segmentation yielded the characteristic three medio-lateral zones and three rostro-caudal regions expected from post-mortem anatomical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dudás, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The lower-dimensional decompositions with 8 and 10 subregions showed only two medio-lateral zones, and were thus not analysed. They were, however, consulted later to elucidate averaged intra-hypothalamic functional connectivity (see below). In the second step, each of the 43 (49 - 6) hypothalamic regions was tested for two criteria, namely LBNP-related changes in functional connectivity (Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub>) with any region of the hypothalamus or lower brainstem, and changes in BOLD spectral power in one or both of the two cardiovascular frequency bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>).</p><p>Our analysis revealed five hypothalamic regions fulfilling both criteria for cardiovascular involvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary File 4</xref>): the right anterior, and bilateral tuberal LH/supraoptic nucleus (SON, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>), the right tuberal PVN/posterior hypothalamic area (PH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), and the arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

In contrast, Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub> of the tuberal LH/SON was restricted to the hypothalamus. Here, both sides showed positive within-nucleus Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub>, which can be interpreted as local activity changes, while only the left LH/SON showed additional negative Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub> with the arcuate nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Neural signature of cardiovascular control.</title><p>(<bold>a–e</bold>) Left: Individual hypothalamic centres derived from functional connectivity presented as mixture model thresholded probability maps.

This selection of nuclei agrees with previous results from studies using Fos-like protein expression in response to prolonged hypotension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Dampney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Based on functional connectivity changes between the original hypothalamic regions and the lower brainstem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we were able to distinguish three major hypothalamic cardiovascular control systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c–e</xref>). The first was characterised by positive Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub> of the PVN/PH with a region in the ipsilateral lateral medulla comprising the RVLM, inferior olivary (IO), parvicellular reticular nucleus (PCRt), Amb, and intermediate reticular (IRt) nuclei, as well as negative Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub> of the PVN/PH with itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). We suggest that this system represents the ‘textbook’ baroreflex arc with its sympathetic (RVLM) and vagal arms (Amb); both under hypothalamic control by the PVN. Since baroreflex regulation classically involves the NTS and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM), we conducted a supplementary mICA in the lower brainstem. This analysis yielded a functionally distinct region matching the above-mentioned RVLM cluster which was tested for Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub>. As expected, a single cluster in the ipsilateral caudal NTS showed positive Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>); however, we did not observe any functional connectivity changes with the CVLM. There is abundant evidence from animal experiments that the PVN projects heavily to the RVLM and Amb and to a lesser extent to Sp5 and reticular nuclei. These projections involve a wide variety of neurotransmitters including angiotensin-II, vasopressin, glutamate, and corticotropin-releasing hormone for RVLM, as well as oxytocin for the Amb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loewy, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coote, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geerling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sapru, 2013</xref>). Damage to the baroreflex arc elicits profound abnormalities in human blood pressure control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biaggioni et al., 1994</xref>). Therapeutically, electrical baroreceptor stimulation has been tested for treating arterial hypertension and heart failure, although patients showed disparate treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heusser et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, a deeper knowledge of central baroreflex control may help understand inter-individual differences and identify patients most likely to respond to such therapies.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Central cardiovascular network.</title><p>Summary of the network nodes and links in the hypothalamus (<bold>a</bold>) and lower medulla oblongata (up until the level of the vagal nerve root) (<bold>b</bold>) as defined by functional connectivity. The central cardiovascular network in humans comprises at least five hypothalamic and five medullary centres. Intra-hypothalamic connectivity emphasised the central role of the PVN/PH in cardiovascular regulation thus confirming results obtained in animals. Functional connectivity to the medulla oblongata was observed for three hypothalamic nuclei (<bold>c–e</bold>). Of these, the PVN/PH was connected to the ‘textbook’ baroreflex system (<bold>c</bold>) comprising the RVLM, Amb, and NTS (emphasised in red font). This system is known to be driven by baroreceptor input and regulate blood pressure by vascular and cardiac sympathetic, cardiovagal, and endocrine mechanisms (vasopressin and oxytocin release). In our experiment, it was strictly lateralised to the right medulla. (<bold>d</bold>) The second functional network connected the right anterior LH/SON with an ipsilateral medullary centre compatible with the NTS extending into DMN and PCRt. Projections of the LH to the NTS and DMN are well-established and mostly orexinergic, while likewise well-established projections from the NTS to the SON could trigger the release of vasoactive hormones from the pituitary gland. (<bold>e</bold>) The third and most widespread network emerged from the arcuate nucleus and comprised three distinct medullary regions: the left NTS and DMN, the midline ROb, and a large region in the right dorsal medulla comprising the NTS, DMN and several reticular nuclei. Although this system has received relatively little attention in comparison to the ‘textbook’ baroreflex system, there is clear evidence that the Arc plays an important role in integrating neural and hormonal signals from key cardiovascular organs and controlling sympathetic outflow.

These findings agree with animal experiments showing afferent connections of the LH/SON from the NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sawchenko and Swanson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Card et al., 2011</xref>) and efferent projections to the NTS and DMN, the latter of which have been shown to be orexinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Cechetto, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coote, 2004</xref>). Their exact role in cardiovascular regulation, however, is still unclear. Potentially, this system also represents direct projections from the NTS to the SON that trigger the release of vasoactive hormones from the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grindstaff and Cunningham, 2001</xref>). This pathway may complement neural cardiovascular regulation and serve as a backup for blood pressure maintenance in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jordan et al., 2000</xref>). Clinically, hypotension-induced vasopressin release is attenuated in patients with neurodegenerative diseases affecting cardiovascular centres in the brainstem and hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Puritz et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>The third hypothalamic system involved the arcuate nucleus (Arc) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e +4e</xref>), and showed positive Δfc<sub>LBNP</sub> with three different medullary regions. The first was located in the right dorsal medulla comprising NTS, DMN, PCRt, IRt and dorsal paragigantocellular nucleus (DPGi). The second included the right IRt, right medullary reticular nucleus (MdRt) and midline ROb. And finally, a third small region spanned the left NTS/DMN with its rostrocaudal position closely matching that of the contralateral NTS observed for the ‘textbook’ baroreflex control system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the role of the Arc in cardiovascular regulation has received relatively little attention despite several lines of evidence. The Arc has long been known to receive afferent fibres from the NTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ricardo and Koh, 1978</xref>). Changes in blood pressure and vascular resistance during electric stimulation, Fos-like protein expression in response to prolonged hypotension and afferent renal nerve stimulation, and retrograde tracing studies link it to key cardiovascular organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Dampney, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sapru, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rahmouni, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the Arc has been proposed as a potential region in which the leptin-melanocortin and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems interact to control sympathetic nerve activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilzendeger et al., 2012</xref>), relevant to obesity-associated arterial hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Greenfield et al., 2009</xref>). This issue is of utmost clinical relevance given the pandemic rise in the prevalence of obesity and associated cardiovascular disease.</p><p>This study combined functional connectivity and spectral analysis of fMRI signals to investigate hypothalamic regions involved during cardiovascular regulation. We found anatomically meaningful connectivity changes in five hypothalamic subregions during the cardiovascular challenge, all of which went along with spectral changes of the fMRI signal in the domains of low and high frequency cardiovascular regulation (LF,~0.1 Hz; HF,~0.28 Hz). In order to interpret these changes as BOLD signals, we need to assume that, at least for the HF domain, BOLD extends beyond the frequency range given by the canonical HRF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). Similar observations have recently been reported by several other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen and Glover, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gohel and Biswal, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 2016</xref>). However, caution is advisable, when interpreting results derived from BOLD signals. While the majority of our results were robust against the removal of physiological ‘noise’ signals, one should note that completely disentangling neuronal from non-neuronal BOLD signals is close to impossible for several reasons. Firstly, physiological noise is a mixture of several different noise sources, including those related to cardiac activity causing changes in arterial pulsatility, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and cerebrospinal fluid flow, and those related to respiration causing changes in the magnetic field and arterial carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2013</xref>). To complicate matters further, cardiac and respiratory activity are not independent but intricately linked through phenomena like the respiratory sinus arrhythmia. Secondly, several groups have recently shown that cerebral vascular regulation may be coordinated across long-distance brain regions, thus mimicking the structure of neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bright et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, every temporal regression of physiological ‘noise’ bears the risk of removing meaningful signal from the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iacovella and Hasson, 2011</xref>). Thus, the methodological approach used in this study cannot completely rule out the possibility that some of the connectivity we are seeing could be the result of highly structured physiological noise.</p><p>Nonetheless, we anticipate that the simultaneous in-vivo assessment of the different cardiovascular control systems in humans will deepen our understanding of these systems. Furthermore, access to individual neural signatures may facilitate development of novel pharmaceutical and electroceutical cardiovascular treatments, leading to an era of cardiovascular precision medicine.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study took place at Hannover Medical School.

We defined the hypothalamic mask for this analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) using the atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mai et al., 2016</xref>. The ICA dimensionality of 49 was derived by test-retest reproducibility analysis in the range between 1 and 100 dimensions using 30 random split-half samplings (mICA toolbox [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moher Alsady et al., 2016</xref>]). After matching the components of both half samples by Hungarian sorting of their cross-correlation matrix, mean reproducibility was calculated. After excluding all values with ICA non-convergence, a dimensionality of 49 was found to maximise mean reproducibility (r<sub>mean</sub> = 0.80 ± 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Independent components (ICs) were tested for specificity by running an unmasked dual regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckmann et al., 2009</xref>) to a cuboid volume containing the brainstem and hypothalamus. We calculated the weighted quotient of activation in grey and white matter versus cerebrospinal fluid (probabilistic masks obtained using FAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>]). Components were considered unspecific if this quotient was smaller than one standard deviation from the mean. Using this measure, 6 components were excluded from further analysis. Assigning each voxel the component number with the highest z-value at that point yielded a segmentation of the hypothalamus into 43 functional centres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>).</p><p>To discern which of the remaining 43 ICs were involved in cardiovascular regulation, we carried out two separate analyses: a spectral and a functional connectivity analysis. For the spectral analysis we defined two frequency bands, low frequency LF (0.1±0.03 Hz) and high frequency HF (0.28 ± 0.06 Hz) by looking at the spectral peaks of the autonomic recordings. The LF band was defined by the position of the Mayer peak in our subjects’ blood pressure variability, whereas the HF band corresponds to the respiration frequency (mean ± standard deviation). We extracted the time series of every IC in every run and calculated their power spectral density for each frequency band normalised to the total power (similar to an fALFF analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zou et al., 2008</xref>] at higher frequencies). Finally, we computed a non-parametric paired t-test to quantify spectral differences in the BOLD signal between LBNP and rest. In the functional connectivity analysis, we performed a dual regression to both, hypothalamus and lower brainstem. Ultimately, we calculated a non-parametric paired t-test thresholded at p&lt;0.05 using family-wise error (FWE) correction with threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) to identify functional connectivity changes between LBNP and rest. Components showing significant changes in both metrics, that is spectral and functional connectivity, were assumed to be involved in cardiovascular regulation. We overlaid the atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mai et al., 2016</xref>, which is in MNI standard space, to our components and their connectivity changes in order to identify the involved nuclei. To avoid identifying only familiar nuclei, we report every major nucleus from the atlas overlapping with any voxel of a functional connectivity cluster.</p><p>Furthermore, to ascertain that our results were not driven by physiological noise, we conducted two supplementary analyses. Firstly, we repeated our initial analysis adding an additional physiological noise correction. Specifically, we applied slice-wise regression of cardiac and respiratory influences (first order, one interaction term) using FSL PNM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brooks et al., 2008</xref>) before carrying out the masked ICA. We then matched the independent components to the ones of the original analysis by Hungarian sorting of the spatial cross-correlation matrix, and calculated their functional connectivity changes during LBNP. Since physiological noise regression influences frequency content in a non-linear manner, we did not test for spectral changes in this supplementary analysis.</p><p>Secondly, using dual regression and a non-parametric one sample t-test thresholded at p&lt;0.05 (FWE corrected), we calculated functional connectivity of the identified hypothalamic regions with the whole brain (smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 5 mm full width at half maximum). This was done to make sure that their functional connectivity was mainly in the grey matter and not in the ventricles or other regions, whose signals are driven by physiological noise.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Horst Görtz Foundation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Marc Tittgemeyer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ivan De Araujo (Reviewer #2); Olivia K Faull (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers agree that the paper describes a very interesting study to explore brain centers of cardiovascular regulation in humans.</p><p>The regulatory pathways underlying neural responses to bodily signals are currently intensively researched particularly regarding the capacity of the organism to shape its ongoing activity. Relating to interoception (sensing of internal bodily states) brain-heart interaction came recently into focus to better understand the influence of internal sensory information on perception, memory, cognition, and gating of our fear responses. To that end, the topic of the paper is very timely, and the study may offer important insights into human neural pathways within cardiovascular control that may also lead to potentially beneficial clinical applications.</p><p>To carry out their study the authors have undertaken a clever experimental paradigm that makes use of functional MRI to characterize human subcortical brain regions involved in cardiovascular tone. The authors stimulated orthostatic stress via footward blood volume displacement (-30 mmHg), which induced sympathetic excitation and vagal inhibition in response to the challenge. The authors describe three hypothalamo-medullary subsystems potentially involved in cardiovascular control, preserving some parallel to activation patterns observed in animal studies.</p><p>A further interesting aspect of the paper is an elaborate processing pipeline for the notoriously difficult task to analyze brainstem and hypothalamus fMRI data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the study may thus advance our knowledge and all reviewers are in general enthusiastic about this work, some concerns must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) Relating to confounds associated with the involvement of control systems that only indirectly link to cardiovascular regulation per se: Specifically, the cardiovascular challenge employed induces responses in motor systems associated with respiration such as the craniofacial and thoracic motor systems. Several of those nuclei (parvocellular, intermediate, and medullary reticular nuclei, PCRt, IRt, MdRt) are known to be primarily involved in motor control of head and upper body muscles. It is unclear how exactly the authors did dissociate cardiovascular from other motor control systems in their analyses.</p><p>2) Various pathways implicate in the central regulation of cardiocvascular reactivity. The output of these pathways is coordinated by a number of central nervous system regions based on afferent information, but the central nervous system does not only involve the brain but also e.g. spinal cord. The authors mention for instance the melanocortine system which is not only involved in vagus nerve signaling but likely also regulated by somatosensory afferent from the spine via PBN. That said, it is sensible for the authors to emphasise primary regulators, such as hypothalamic regions and the lower brain stem. However, to then interpret the results as direct connections between hypothalamus and brainstem is a simplification, especially also as their connectivity measure is a very indirect one. This aspect needs to be discussed.</p><p>3) The authors argue that the &quot;canonical&quot; frequency of the BOLD signal lies outside the frequency bands of blood pressure and heart rate and that analysis is not affected by this. This argument needs more evidence.</p><p>4) Some consideration regarding susceptibility to noise in the image analyses is warranted. It is noticeable that many activated areas overlap with neighbouring ventricles, and in fact, some images suggest the peak activation voxel is centered at the ventricular area proper (e.g. Figures 2E, Figure 2—figure supplement 5D, E). Further assurance that no artefacts (e.g. movement given no spatial filtering etc.) influenced the determination of the areas described.</p><p>5) Furthermore, the use/non-use of physiological noise correction in this analysis needs more elaboration. While removing all signal associated with physiological recordings may drastically reduce the power to detect neural changes associated with the changes in physiology that are of interest, simply ignoring this step may dramatically influence the results. There would be two possible approaches that could ameliorate concerns that the results are driven by physiological artefacts (preferably both):</p><p>– A wider/whole-brain unmasked GLM analysis of the time-course associated with the 5 “cardiovascular” regions identified within the current analysis. The brain areas that correspond to these signals within a wider field of view would allow us to more accurately identify whether this signal is significantly associated with common physiological artefacts, as outlined here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.10.019</p><p>– A supplementary repeat of the analysis with the inclusion of physiological noise regressors, to understand which of the results can be robustly identified independently of the physiological artefacts.</p><p>6) The current method employed of only including ICA components that sit primarily within the grey matter does not fully prevent the influence of physiological artefacts, in particular second-order effects such as changes in relatively global signal primarily associated with cerebral vasculature, resulting from fluctuations in ventilation and/or metabolism (the former of which would occur with LBNP). The Discussion could also benefit from a short discussion of the limitations of disentangling physiological artefacts from neural underpinnings for the readers who are less familiar with the difficulties of this topic. This issue is particularly important if the authors are going to claim that their frequency analyses challenge the notion of the canonical HRF, as this claim can only be true if what they are reporting is in fact of neural origin, and not simply a non-neuronal artefact. Furthermore, the induction of LBNP is also regularly associated with a hyperventilatory response, and the high-frequency band sits right within the respiratory range and thus it is not surprising this sees differences with LBNP. Lastly, the HRF in the brainstem and hypothalamus are not clearly mapped nor understood, and as the vasculature in these smaller brain areas is vastly different from the original cortical locations where the HRF was identified, it might be advisable to proceed with caution when using strong statements in this regard.</p><p>7) The continuous blood pressure measurement seems to reside on peripheral arterial pressure pulse. Given that these are healthy participants, is there written consent and permission from the ERB explicitly to acquire arterial blood pressure, given that this is of course super invasive?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55316.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the study may thus advance our knowledge and all reviewers are in general enthusiastic about this work, some concerns must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p><p>1) Relating to confounds associated with the involvement of control systems that only indirectly link to cardiovascular regulation per se: Specifically, the cardiovascular challenge employed induces responses in motor systems associated with respiration such as the craniofacial and thoracic motor systems.

Further analyses of our physiological data have now revealed that neither respiratory interval, nor respiratory volume or respiratory volume per time were significantly affected by LBNP. On the other hand, we saw large (Cohen’s d≈1) and highly significant changes of cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure, BPV, heart rate, and HRV). Taken together, this indicates that LBNP’s effect on respiration were negligible in comparison to its cardiovascular effects. (In our experience, higher negative pressures are needed to induce respiratory changes like the ones described by the reviewers). Therefore, we believe that it is safe to assume that most of the connectivity we are seeing indeed reflects cardiovascular processes and not other motor functions, such as respiration. We have now added information on the absence of respiratory changes to the manuscript.</p><p>Of course, our findings do not completely rule out the possibility that respiratory or other motor nuclei were activated by LBNP. Indeed, the analysis of reflex processes always includes the possibility of stimulating further afferences or provoking further efferent activity in addition to those examined. This situation is very similar to co-activating autonomic areas in the cortex when using any form of stimulus (see Beissner et al., 2014). Although we are aware that some parts of the activations reflect autonomic reactions to the stimulus instead of higher cognitive functions, we usually cannot control for it.</p><p>Regarding our report of reticular nuclei, we would like to emphasize that we report every major nucleus from the atlas that overlaps with any voxel of a connectivity cluster. This is because we want to avoid making the mistake of only identifying familiar nuclei. Therefore, we have grouped the nuclei that belonged to the same cluster together in Figure 4. Our resolution clearly does not allow us to identify these individual nuclei in the first place. We have now added a clarifying sentence concerning this point to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Various pathways implicate in the central regulation of cardiocvascular reactivity. The output of these pathways is coordinated by a number of central nervous system regions based on afferent information, but the central nervous system does not only involve the brain but also e.g. spinal cord. The authors mention for instance the melanocortine system which is not only involved in vagus nerve signaling but likely also regulated by somatosensory afferent from the spine via PBN. That said, it is sensible for the authors to emphasise primary regulators, such as hypothalamic regions and the lower brain stem. However, to then interpret the results as direct connections between hypothalamus and brainstem is a simplification, especially also as their connectivity measure is a very indirect one. This aspect needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this constructive criticism. We did not mean to imply that the connectivity was direct, although, as we discuss, there is ample evidence from animal studies for this assumption. We see, however, that the term “hypothalamo-medullary (sub-)system” may suggest a direct connection. To avoid confusion, we have now removed this term from the manuscript and exchanged it with “hypothalamic (sub-)system”. Furthermore, we made sure to only speak of functional connectivity throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors argue that the &quot;canonical&quot; frequency of the BOLD signal lies outside the frequency bands of blood pressure and heart rate and that analysis is not affected by this. This argument needs more evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the point tried to make here by the reviewers is not entirely clear to us. First of all, we do not speak of a frequency of the BOLD signal, but of a frequency range. This range is defined by the Fourier transform of the canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) as shown in Figure 1i. Furthermore, we do not speak of the frequencies of heart rate and blood pressure (both around 1 Hz), but of heart rate variability (HF range, around 0.28 Hz) and blood pressure variability (LF range, around 0.1 Hz). However, we assume that these were just typos in the question.</p><p>Secondly, we do not say that frequency bands of HRV/BPV are generally outside frequency bands of the BOLD signal. This is only true for HF<sub>HRV</sub> as shown in Figure 1i. For LF<sub>BPV</sub>, the same figure clearly shows overlap between the spectra (the light grey “LF” box overlaps with the non-zero part of the BOLD frequency response, while that of HF<sub>HRV</sub> is considerably higher). See also: “Note that both the LF and HF bands lie at the top or above the canonical frequency range of the BOLD signal […]”.</p><p>Thirdly, in the sentence “that analysis is not affected by this” it is unclear, what the reviewers mean by “this”. We will try to give answers to both potential meanings. Should we have missed the main point, we ask the reviewers to clarify the critical points in a future re-review.</p><p>1) We do not claim that our analysis is not affected by cardiovascular (i.e. physiological) noise. We correct for this spatially by our masked ICA approach. However, since this was explicitly requested, we have now repeated our analysis using the more widely used temporal noise regression (see our reply to question # 5 below).</p><p>2) We do not claim that our analysis is not affected by BPV/HRV. On the contrary, what we are saying is that we find anatomically meaningful changes in functional connectivity of our hypothalamic subregions and these go along with spectral changes of the fMRI signal falling exactly into the BPV/HRV spectral region. In order to interpret these changes as BOLD signals, however, we need to assume that BOLD extends beyond the frequency range given by the canonical HRF. This assumption is not new, as the following papers show. They all find BOLD signals in higher frequencies than those defined by the canonical HRF. (Niazy et al., 2011; Chen and Glover, 2015; Gohel and Biswal, 2015; Lewis et al., 2016; Trapp, Vakamudi and Posse, 2018).</p><p>We have now added a detailed explanation about why we believe that what we are seeing are BOLD signals beyond the canonical frequency range to the beginning of our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some consideration regarding susceptibility to noise in the image analyses is warranted. It is noticeable that many activated areas overlap with neighbouring ventricles, and in fact, some images suggest the peak activation voxel is centered at the ventricular area proper (e.g. Figures 2E, Figure 2—figure supplement 5D, E). Further assurance that no artefacts (e.g. movement given no spatial filtering etc) influenced the determination of the areas described.</p><p>5) Furthermore, the use/non-use of physiological noise correction in this analysis needs more elaboration. While removing all signal associated with physiological recordings may drastically reduce the power to detect neural changes associated with the changes in physiology that are of interest, simply ignoring this step may dramatically influence the results. There would be two possible approaches that could ameliorate concerns that the results are driven by physiological artefacts (preferably both):</p><p>– A wider/whole-brain unmasked GLM analysis of the time-course associated with the 5 “cardiovascular” regions identified within the current analysis. The brain areas that correspond to these signals within a wider field of view would allow us to more accurately identify whether this signal is significantly associated with common physiological artefacts, as outlined here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2016.10.019</p><p>– A supplementary repeat of the analysis with the inclusion of physiological noise regressors, to understand which of the results can be robustly identified independently of the physiological artefacts.</p></disp-quote><p>Since points (4) and (5) are closely related, we will answer them together. We very well understand the reservations the reviewers might have against our minimal preprocessing approach (i.e. standard realignment, no noise regression, no temporal low-pass filtering, no smoothing), when a large part of the field uses ever more aggressive methods of noise correction and data scrubbing.</p><p>Regarding the effect of motion, our original analysis only used fMRI data from the steady-state periods after the target LBNP pressure had been reached. This was done to avoid any contamination by movement artefacts during the pressure changes. To further rule out the possibility that head motion was driving our results, we have now quantified movement by calculating mean relative displacement for LBNP and Rest in all subjects. A paired t-test showed no significant differences (t = 0.05, p = 0.96). This result has now been added to the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding our decision to omit spatial smoothing, it is important to note that according to filter theory the smoothness of the image should match the smallest structure one aims to resolve. In our case, we are at the absolute resolution limit of our fMRI sequence, which is why spatial smoothing with any kernel would reduce our chances of identifying the nuclei of interest. Instead, we upsampled the data to twice the original resolution, which effectively increases smoothness without applying a smoothing kernel. Furthermore, we have previously shown that smoothing fMRI data in subcortical regions can impair data quality, since signals with high noise content (e.g., in the ventricles) are mixed with low-noise signals of adjacent regions of interest (Beissner et al., 2014). Finally, the non-parametric statistics we use do not rely on the central limit theorem and hence, do not need a certain smoothness of the data.</p><p>Regarding the use of physiological noise regression, we have previously shown that the results of masked ICA of noisy areas, like the brainstem, are not significantly altered by physiological noise regression (Beissner et al., 2014).</p><p>Nevertheless, we understand the need for more evidence that our results are not driven by noise. Therefore, we have now added results of two supplementary analyses as proposed by the reviewers.</p><p>Firstly, we repeated our initial analysis adding physiological noise correction. Specifically, we applied slice-wise regression of cardiac and respiratory influences using FSL PNM before carrying out the masked ICA. We then matched the independent components to the ones of the original analysis by Hungarian sorting of the spatial cross-correlation matrix and calculated their functional connectivity changes during LBNP.</p><p>As the analysis showed, physiological noise regression had little effect on the masked ICA results as evidenced by the functional segmentation still showing the same known anatomical subdivisions of the hypothalamus (new Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, the ICs matching our five hypothalamic regions from the original analysis showed similar, yet smaller functional connectivity changes in response to cardiovascular challenge (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3).</p><p>Secondly, we calculated functional connectivity of the identified hypothalamic regions with the whole brain over all runs. This analysis revealed that four of the five hypothalamic regions from the original analysis showed significant functional connectivity with cerebral regions that was clearly dominated by grey matter (new Figure 2—figure supplement 4 ). In contrast, noise components would be expected to mainly show white matter or ventricular connectivity. The one remaining region was the PVN/PH, which showed very little cerebral connectivity at all (neither to grey matter nor to white matter or CSF).</p><p>We have now added the results of these additional analyses to the manuscript and are confident that our results mainly represent neuronal activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The current method employed of only including ICA components that sit primarily within the grey matter does not fully prevent the influence of physiological artefacts, in particular second-order effects such as changes in relatively global signal primarily associated with cerebral vasculature, resulting from fluctuations in ventilation and/or metabolism (the former of which would occur with LBNP). The Discussion could also benefit from a short discussion of the limitations of disentangling physiological artefacts from neural underpinnings for the readers who are less familiar with the difficulties of this topic. This issue is particularly important if the authors are going to claim that their frequency analyses challenge the notion of the canonical HRF, as this claim can only be true if what they are reporting is in fact of neural origin, and not simply a non-neuronal artefact. Furthermore, the induction of LBNP is also regularly associated with a hyperventilatory response, and the high-frequency band sits right within the respiratory range and thus it is not surprising this sees differences with LBNP. Lastly, the HRF in the brainstem and hypothalamus are not clearly mapped nor understood, and as the vasculature in these smaller brain areas is vastly different from the original cortical locations where the HRF was identified, it might be advisable to proceed with caution when using strong statements in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our approach does not completely rule out the possibility that some of the connectivity we are seeing could be the result of highly structured physiological noise. However, in this, our study is not different from any other fMRI study. The past few years have shown that we have to completely rethink the BOLD signal and its relationship with physiological “noise” as well as its exact role in functional connectivity. Nevertheless, we have now removed our statement about non-canonical BOLD signals from the Abstract and also toned down the statement in the caption of Figure 1. As requested, we have further added a short discussion of the limitations of disentangling physiological artefacts from neural underpinnings to the Discussion section.</p><p>Regarding a potential hyperventilatory response to LBNP, we have no evidence for a significant effect of 30 mmHg LBNP on respiratory interval, respiratory volume, and respiratory volume per time (see our response to point 1 above). This has been added to the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the HRF in non-cortical regions, we agree that it is not well understood. However, we do not consider this a specific problem for non-cortical regions, as Rangaprakash et al., 2017, have shown that HRF variability can lead to strong pseudo-connectivity in cortical RSNs. Furthermore, Chen and Glover, 2015 have shown that the need for a narrower HRF with a higher frequency cut-off is evident in cortical fMRI when investigating the neuronal underpinnings of functional connectivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The continuous blood pressure measurement seems to reside on peripheral arterial pressure pulse. Given that these are healthy participants, is there written consent and permission from the ERB explicitly to acquire arterial blood pressure, given that this is of course super invasive?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a misunderstanding and we apologize for not being clear about this. Of course, the blood pressure measurement was carried out non-invasively by using an inflatable cuff on the thumb. We have now made it clear in the Materials and methods section, that our measurement was non-invasive.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>Niazy RK, Xie J, Miller K, Beckmann CF, Smith SM.
