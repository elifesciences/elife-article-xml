endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) responsible for most insertional mutations in the mouse. Full-length IAPs harbour genes flanked by long terminal repeats (LTRs). Here, we identify a solo LTR IAP variant (<italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic>) recently formed in the inbred C57BL/6J mouse strain. In contrast to the C57BL/6J full-length IAP at this locus (<italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic>), <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> lacks DNA methylation and H3K9 trimethylation. The distinct DNA methylation levels between the two alleles are established during preimplantation development, likely due to loss of KRAB zinc finger protein binding at the <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> variant. <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> methylation increases and becomes more variable in a hybrid genetic background yet is unresponsive to maternal dietary methyl supplementation. Differential epigenetic modification of the two variants is associated with metabolic differences and tissue-specific changes in adjacent gene expression. Our characterisation of <italic>Iap5-1</italic> as a genetically induced epiallele with functional consequences establishes a new model to study transposable element repression and host-element co-evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our genome provides a complete set of genetic instructions for life. It begins by directing the growth and development of the embryo, and subsequently supports all the cells of the adult body in their daily routines. Yet approximately 10% of the DNA in mammalian genomes is made up of sequences originating from past retroviral infections, leaving a calling card in our genetic code.</p><p>While these segments of retroviral DNA can no longer produce new infectious viruses, some of them retain the ability to copy themselves and jump into new parts of the genome. This can be problematic if they jump into and disrupt an important piece of genetic code. To protect against this, our bodies have evolved the ability to chemically strap down retroviral sequences by adding methyl groups to them and by modifying the proteins they are wrapped around. However, some of these endogenous retroviruses can dodge such so-called epigenetic modifications and disrupt genome function as a result.</p><p>Studying a population of widely used inbred laboratory mice, Bertozzi et al. have identified a retroviral element that evades these epigenetic restraints. They discovered that some mice carry a full-length retroviral sequence while others have a shortened version of the same element. The shorter sequence lacked the repressive epigenetic marks found on the longer version, and this affected the expression of nearby genes. Moreover, the repressive marks could be partially restored by breeding the short-version mice with a distantly related mouse strain.</p><p>Bertozzi et al. highlight an important issue for research using mouse models. Inbred laboratory mouse strains are assumed to have a fixed genetic code which allows scientists to conclude that any observed differences in their experiments are not a product of background genetic variation. However, this study emphasizes that this assumption is not guaranteed, and that hidden genetic diversity may be present in ostensibly genetically identical mice, with important implications for experimental outcomes.</p><p>In addition, Bertozzi et al. provide a new mouse model for researchers to study the evolution and regulation of retroviral sequences and the impact of these processes on cell function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endogenous retrovirus</kwd><kwd>transposable element</kwd><kwd>IAP</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epiallele</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210757/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson-Smith</surname><given-names>Anne C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R009791/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson-Smith</surname><given-names>Anne C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/R009996/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferguson-Smith</surname><given-names>Anne C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cambridge Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertozzi</surname><given-names>Tessa M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A retrotransposon-derived recombination event in inbred mice gives rise to an epiallele and tissue-specific phenotypes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>More than 10% of the mouse genome is made up of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smit et al., 2015</xref>). ERVs are transposable elements (TEs) containing retrotransposition-enabling genes flanked by non-coding identical 5′ and 3′ long terminal repeats (LTRs). Although most ERVs have lost their mobilisation potential due to mutational decay, they retain the ability to modulate host genome function through the use of transcriptional regulation motifs contained in their sequences. These include transcription factor binding sites, polyadenylation signals, and splice acceptor sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maksakova et al., 2006</xref>). For instance, solo LTRs produced via inter-LTR homologous recombination make up a large fraction of mammalian ERV sequences and can influence host gene expression through their promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nellåker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ruda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Mammals have evolved a range of mechanisms to mitigate the deleterious effects of ERV retrotransposition and transcriptional disruption. The vast majority of mouse ERVs exhibit high levels of DNA methylation, and loss of DNA methyltransferase activity causes an increase in ERV transcription in embryos and in the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barau et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourc'his and Bestor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Walsh et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, the deposition of histone H3 lysine nine trimethylation (H3K9me3) by the methyltransferase SETDB1 (or ESET) in early development is crucial for ERV repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsui et al., 2010</xref>). SETDB1 is recruited to ERVs following the binding of KAP1 (or TRIM28) to KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) that recognise specific sequence motifs within ERV elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ecco et al., 2017</xref>). RNA-mediated mechanisms such as the piRNA pathway also play key roles in silencing mammalian ERVs, especially in the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carmell et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) are murine-specific ERVs. They are young and highly active elements, exhibiting extensive insertional polymorphism across inbred mouse strains and accounting for more than 10,000 ERVs in the C57BL/6J (B6) inbred strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nellåker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smit et al., 2015</xref>). IAP insertions are responsible for the majority of documented insertional mutations in the mouse, most of which disrupt host gene function by generating aberrant or fusion gene transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gagnier et al., 2019</xref>). In some cases, the phenotypic severity of the mutation is associated with the methylation status of the IAP. For example, the IAP LTR promoter at the <italic>Agouti viable yellow</italic> (<italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic>) allele drives ectopic expression of the downstream coat colour gene <italic>Agouti</italic> when unmethylated. By mechanisms not yet fully understood, the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> IAP exhibits variable DNA methylation levels across genetically identical individuals, which results in inbred mice displaying a range of coat colours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duhl et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morgan et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We previously carried out a genome-wide screen to probe the generalisability of inter-individual methylation variability at IAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>). We identified dozens of novel variably methylated IAPs (VM-IAPs) in the B6 genome and showed that their characteristic methylation variability is recapitulated from generation to generation irrespective of parental methylation level. Our screen for VM-IAPs identified the IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic> element, named after its closest annotated coding gene <italic>Phosphoglucomutase-2</italic> (<italic>Pgm2</italic>). It is a fully structured 7.5 kb IAP located on Chromosome 5 containing identical 5′ and 3′ LTRs of the IAPLTR2_Mm subclass (mm10 coordinates: chr5:64,030,834–64,038,297; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic>, in sharp contrast to VM-IAPs, exhibits two distinct DNA methylation states which are stably inherited from parent to offspring within the B6 strain. Sequencing of the locus reveals that the epiallele is genetically conferred, where the methylated variant of IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic> is a full-length IAP matching the B6 reference genome (renamed <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic>) and the unmethylated variant is a solo LTR produced from an inter-LTR recombination event (renamed <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic>). The absence of DNA methylation at <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> is accompanied by a loss of H3K9me3 marks. We find that differential modification of the two variants is established during early preimplantation development and identify candidate KZFPs responsible for the acquisition of contrasting epigenetic states. We report that <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> is unresponsive to dietary methyl supplementation but highly susceptible to genetic background, becoming a bona fide VM-IAP in an F1 hybrid context. In addition, we demonstrate that formation of the <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> allele is associated with tissue-specific changes in neighbouring gene expression and a decrease in fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations. Our study establishes the <italic>Iap5-1</italic> locus as a naturally occurring and biologically relevant model in the widely studied reference mouse strain to investigate the mechanisms underlying TE repression, inter-individual methylation variability, and TE-induced disruptions to host genome function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic> methylation is tri-modally distributed in inbred B6 mice</title><p>Following our genome-wide screen for VM-IAPs in the B6 genome, DNA methylation at the distal CpGs of the 5′ LTR of each candidate was validated using genomic DNA (gDNA) extracted from adult inbred B6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elmer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kazachenka et al., 2018</xref>).

To test whether this phenomenon occurs at IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic>, specific parental combinations were set up for breeding and IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic> 5′ LTR methylation levels were quantified in the offspring. In stark contrast to VM-IAPs, IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic> exhibited stable inheritance of methylation levels. Offspring born to highly methylated parents were all highly methylated and offspring born to lowly methylated parents were all lowly methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When one parent was highly methylated and the other lowly methylated, all offspring were intermediately methylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This indicates that high and low methylation states are allelic variants of IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic> (designated IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic><sup>HH</sup> and IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic><sup>LL</sup>), with intermediate methylation representing co-dominant epigenetic heterozygosity (IAP-<italic>Pgm2</italic><sup>HL</sup>).

It is possible that this incomplete methylation is symptomatic of lower methylation levels in the developing trophectoderm which counteract the higher methylation levels in the inner cell mass (ICM). In support of this, DNA methylation levels in embryonic stem (ES) cell lines derived from the ICM of <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> and <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> blastocysts closely matched those observed in adult somatic tissues, with ES cells derived from <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> blastocysts nearing 100% methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We observed KAP1 occupancy at the Gm14419 binding site, rendering Gm14419 a particularly promising candidate for future mechanistic research (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The Gm14419 peak overlaps with the primer binding site (PBS) just downstream of the 5′ LTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a retroviral sequence often bound by KZFPs to effectuate repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wolf and Goff, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, it is likely that additional as yet unidentified KZFP(s) bind to <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic>, as evidenced by a second KAP1 peak in the <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> internal region which does not overlap with the binding site of any of the KZFPs identified in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

These findings suggest that the emergence of a derepressed solo LTR near a gene involved in glucose metabolism has phenotypic implications, providing a basis for further functional characterisation of this model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Historically, inter-LTR recombination events have been identified due to phenotypic reversions of ERV-induced mutations, whereby the phenotypic effect of the insertion is reversed following proviral excision and solo LTR formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bultman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Seperack et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stoye et al., 1988</xref>). In this study, we identified one such chromosomal event based on its epigenetic rather than phenotypic outcome, revealing <italic>Iap5-1</italic> as a genetically induced epiallele in the ostensibly isogenic B6 mouse strain. We demonstrated that the <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> and <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> variants display distinct DNA and H3K9 methylation profiles which are associated with differential adjacent gene expression and altered metabolism, establishing the <italic>Iap5-1</italic> locus as a valuable endogenous system to study the mechanisms, evolution, and functional implications of TE repression in both the germline and soma.</p><p>The unmethylated status of <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> sets it apart from other solo LTRs in the B6 genome, the vast majority of which (&gt;93%) are highly methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shimosuga et al., 2017</xref>). Shimosuga and colleagues quantified DNA methylation at more than 8000 B6 IAP LTRs and only 14 exhibited less than 20% methylation in tail samples. Ten of these were solo LTRs, mostly of the same subtype as the <italic>Iap5-1</italic> LTR (IAPLTR2_mm). While the authors classified the <italic>Iap5-1</italic> LTR as a hypomethylated 3′ LTR of a full-length IAP, in all likelihood they unknowingly detected the hypomethylated <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> allele in their particular samples. It is conceivable that some of the other documented hypomethylated LTRs of full-length IAPs are in fact solo LTRs formed from recent recombination events. In comparing tail and sperm DNA methylation, the same study showed that individual hypomethylated IAPs in either tail or sperm were non-overlapping. This is consistent with the hypermethylation of <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> that we observed in sperm and highlights the divergence of TE silencing mechanisms between the soma and the germline.</p><p>Ancestral variants of spontaneous mutations in inbred mouse strains are easily lost from the population. The fortuitous timing of our discovery and the resultant availability of both <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> and <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> mice allowed us to quantitatively explore the functional repercussions of a derepressed solo LTR. We showed that the <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> variant is associated with increased expression of adjacent genes in thymic and placental tissue. This may reflect the use of newly accessible regulatory sequences in the solo LTR or, alternatively, a secondary effect stemming from heterochromatin loss at a neighbouring region. The transcriptional consequences were tissue-specific: <italic>Rell1</italic> expression was lower in <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> livers, and no gene expression differences were observed in cortex samples. The lncRNA <italic>5830416l19Rik</italic>, identified from the sequencing of adult male thymus and aorta cDNA libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kawai et al., 2001</xref>), was only expressed in thymus samples collected from <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> individuals; it was nearly undetectable in <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> thymic samples and not expressed at all in any of the other tested tissues. We speculate that the formation of <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> gave rise to <italic>5830416l19Rik</italic> as a novel tissue-specific (perhaps immune-specific) lncRNA. Indeed, IAP transcripts are rarely detected in somatic tissues outside of tumours and early embryogenesis, but thymic and activated splenic cells are notable exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kuff and Lueders, 1988</xref>). In addition, young ERVs have recently been implicated in shaping the evolution of transcriptional networks underlying innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ye et al., 2020</xref>), and our group recently identified individual IAP elements that exhibit inter-individual methylation variability exclusively in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elmer et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Along with the transcriptional differences observed at the metabolic gene <italic>Pgm2</italic>, we found that <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> individuals exhibit lower plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations compared to <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> individuals. While the effect sizes were small, we note that these measurements were taken in an unaltered environment. Administration of a long-term metabolic challenge such as a high-fat diet and subsequent metabolic phenotyping will aid in further elucidating the biological significance of these results. Nevertheless, our work adds to the body of work suggesting that TE insertions and their epigenetic modification can have quantifiable consequences on host metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuehnen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Scherneck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yen et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> is susceptible to genetic background effects, whereby passage through a CAST egg promotes methylation of the B6-derived solo LTR. In a recent study we reported the same effect at a number of VM-IAPs and showed that KZFP diversification is associated with strain-specific IAP methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertozzi et al., 2020</xref>). This combined with the identification of candidate KZFPs capable of binding the <italic>Iap5-1</italic> variants suggests that the differential recruitment of heterochromatin factors by KZFPs is involved in both driving the epigenetic differences between <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> and <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic>, and for the strain-specific methylation of <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic>. In fact, by definition, the wide range of methylation levels observed at the <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> allele across genetically identical CB individuals renders this locus a bona fide VM-IAP (or <italic>metastable epiallele</italic>) in this hybrid context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertozzi and Ferguson-Smith, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rakyan et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, we expect the new <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> variant to be a useful tool for the study of epigenetic stochasticity in the absence of genetic variation, a phenomenon for which the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.</p><p>The identification of <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> demonstrates that cryptic genetic diversity in an inbred mouse population can have functional repercussions with important implications for experimental outcomes. It serves as a cautionary tale for researchers working with inbred mouse colonies, particularly in the field of epigenetics where ruling out genetic effects is often paramount. We are reminded that the current mouse reference genome harbours large gaps and inaccuracies, largely due to mapping difficulties associated with the repeat genome. Inter-LTR recombination events are surely an underappreciated source of genetic variation considering that a lack of uniquely mapped reads in internal portions of TEs is more likely to be attributed to technical rather than biological limitations. A recent study in humans developed a computational pipeline to capture dimorphic human ERVs (HERVs) resulting from inter-LTR recombination events and detected dozens of previously unidentified candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). The advent of such analytical tools as well as routine long-read sequencing of whole genomes will be highly beneficial in addressing these issues.</p><p>In summary, we have identified and characterised a recent spontaneous inter-LTR recombination event at the <italic>Iap5-1</italic> locus, introducing a genetic variant in the commonly investigated and supposedly inbred B6 mouse strain. The ancestral variant, <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic>, is a full-length IAP repressed by DNA methylation and H3K9 trimethylation, as is typical for this class of evolutionary young ERV. The recently formed solo LTR variant, <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic>, lacks these silencing marks and is associated with metabolic changes and differential neighbouring gene expression. Our study lays the foundation for further comparative studies between the <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> and <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> variants aimed at better understanding the epigenetic and functional consequences of TE structural variation and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory via <break/>Charles River</td><td valign="top">000664 (JAX) <break/>632 (Charles River)</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CAST/EiJ</td><td valign="top">MRC Harwell Institute</td><td valign="top">FESA:773</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C57BL6/J ES cell lines</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">See Materials and methods, Generation of ESC lines.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K9me3</td><td valign="top">Active Motif</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2532132">AB_2532132</ext-link></td><td valign="top">ChIP (2.5 µl/30 mg liver tissue)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Mouse work was carried out in accordance with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 Amendment Regulations 2012 following ethical review by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body (Home Office project license # PC213320E).

PyroMark Assay Design SW 2.0 software (QIAGEN) was used to design the pyrosequencing assays (primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Target regions were PCR-amplified in technical triplicates from bilsulphite-converted DNA using a biotinylated forward or reverse primer and HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN). PCR conditions were as follows: (1) 95°C for 3 min; (2) 94°C for 30 s, optimised T°C for 30 s, 72°C for 55 s, 40 cycles; (3) 72°C for 5 min. For low-input pyrosequencing of oocyte and blastocyst DNA, two rounds of PCRs were performed: the first PCR used non-biotinylated primers and 20 amplification cycles (other conditions remained the same); the second PCR used 1 µl of the product from the first PCR as template as well as a biotinylated forward or reverse primer. Following PCR, Streptavidin Sepharose High Performance beads (GE healthcare) were bound to the product in binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 2 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20) at 1400 rpm for 5 min. The bead-bound biotinylated strands were washed consecutively in 70% ethanol, denaturation solution (0.2 M NaOH), and wash buffer (10 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.6) using the PyroMark Q96 Vacuum Workstation (QIAGEN). Purified DNA resuspended in annealing buffer (20 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.6, 2 mM magnesium acetate) was incubated with the sequencing primer at 85°C for 4 min. Pyrosequencing was performed on the PyroMark Q96 MD pyrosequencer (QIAGEN) with PyroMark Gold Q96 Reagents and HS Capillary Tips (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Per cent CpG methylation was calculated by Pyro Q-CpG 1.0.9 software (Biotage) using the ratio of C-to-T at each site. Technical triplicates were averaged, and samples were kept for subsequent analysis if the standard deviation of technical triplicates did not exceed 5%. Where indicated, methylation levels were averaged across CpGs for each individual at each locus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Clonal bisulphite sequencing</title><p>Bisulphite-converted liver DNA was amplified by PCR using the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and HotStarTaq DNA Polymerase (QIAGEN).

Here the authors identified an IAP retrotransposon copy that exists in two genetic and epigenetic flavors among subpopulations of the mouse C57Bl6/J reference genome. Having one or the other version of this genetically-induced IAP epiallele matters for nearby gene regulation in some tissues and for metabolic features. This study is impactful for the fields of epigenetics, genomics and mobile DNA.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The authors found that this recent genetic variant occurred by recombination of the two LTRs of an original full length copy, forming a solo LTR version that is unmethylated in somatic tissues, in contrast to other solo LTR elements of the genome. They defined the developmental window when these two IAP alleles diverge in terms of DNA methylation, and involved differential recruitment of sequence-specific KRAB-ZFP as responsible for the different epigenetic states. Although this is a one-case study, this work unambiguously shows that genetic changes in IAP copies influence their own epigenetic states, in an autonomous manner (independently of the genomic environment). Finally, this work represents an important piece of warning of the unsuspected genetic/epigenetic diversity of a very well-characterized, inbred mouse strain, the reference C57Bl6/J genome, and may provide explanations for discrepant results and/or phenotypes obtained among different C57Bl6/J mouse cohorts.</p><p>The reviewers unanimously recognized the originally of the findings, the quality of the experimental approaches (with notably strong mouse genetics with reciprocal crosses and backcrosses between mouse strains) and the accurate interpretation of the data.</p><p>A limited points for improvements were suggested.</p><p>1. The current bisulfite sequencing approach analyses the first/most 5' four CpGs found in the 5' LTR of C57iap1<sup>solo</sup> and C57iap1<sup>full</sup>. In Figure 1A, the authors nicely check that the four last/most 3' CpGs in the 3' LTR are similarly methylated to the first 4 CpGs of the 5' LTR of the C57iap1<sup>full</sup>. However, it is unclear whether the methylation status of these 4 CpGs is reflective of the methylation across the LTRs. Moreover, it is unknown as to whether the 5' end of the C57iap1<sup>solo</sup> originates from the 5' LTR or the 3'LTR. If the latter, C57iap1<sup>solo</sup> could appear less methylated than C57iap1<sup>full</sup> because the approach is measuring different CpGs. The 5' end of the C57iap1<sup>solo</sup> should then be compared with the 5'end of the 3'LTR of the C57iap1<sup>full</sup>. Do the authors have data to exclude this possibility? Bisulfite pyrosequencing does not allow analyzing large amplicons. But bisulfite cloning sequencing could be attempted (on one somatic tissue) to investigate larger parts of the 5'LTR and the 3'LTR of the C57iap1<sup>full</sup> and larger part of the LTR of the C57iap1<sup>solo</sup>.</p><p>2. The reviewers suggest mining into public data, and more particularly long-read sequencing data, to try to identify other cases of conversion of full length IAPs in the reference C57Bl6/J genome into solo LTRs in sub-C57BL6/J populations.

The authors were careful stating that the C57iap1 polymorphism is &quot;associated&quot; with transcription of nearby genes, as they did not investigate as to how the C57iap1<sup>solo</sup> regulates these nearby genes, acting as an alternative promoter or an enhancer. Abundant transcriptomic data exist and may resolve this easily, provided that some of them emanate from the C57bl6/J subpopulation with the C57iap1<sup>solo</sup> polymorphism. If not, RT-PCR approaches may be attempted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65233.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>The authors found that this recent genetic variant occurred by recombination of the two LTRs of an original full length copy, forming a solo LTR version that is unmethylated in somatic tissues, in contrast to other solo LTR elements of the genome.

These data confirm that DNA methylation of the most distal CpGs quantified throughout the manuscript using bisulphite pyrosequencing are indeed reflective of DNA methylation across the entire LTRs. They also exclude the possibility that the difference in DNA methylation between <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> and <italic>Iap5-1<sup>solo</sup></italic> are due to the quantification of different CpGs. In addition, we were able to measure the methylation state of a few CpGs located inside the internal region proximal to the 5' LTR of <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic>, suggesting that the entire <italic>Iap5-1<sup>full</sup></italic> provirus is heavily methylated. These results have been included in the updated manuscript in Figure 2—supplement figure 2 and are discussed in the text (lines 186-189).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, in addition to building a robust computation pipeline to identify new solo LTRs (as well as other transposable element-derived polymorphisms), we are aiming to validate the findings experimentally on various C56BL/6J sub-populations and conduct secondary analyses on the genomic distribution, epigenetic state, and functional consequences of the identified polymorphisms. This interesting future direction is therefore outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
