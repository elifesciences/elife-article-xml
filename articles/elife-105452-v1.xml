During learning, multimodal information converges onto the hippocampus, activating sparse neuronal assemblies which are thought to form a memory representation through concerted activity and synaptic interconnectivity. In this work, we use a novel tool for fast fluorescent labeling of engram neurons (FLEN). FLEN is based on c-Fos activity-dependent transient expression of a destabilized fluorescent marker ZsGreen1 rapidly after one-trial learning. With FLEN, we explore the electrophysiological properties of c-Fos activated CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) a few hours following one-trial learning of an episodic-like memory. In parallel, we employ the Robust Activity Marker (RAM) system, which provides activity-dependent labeling 24 hr following a novel experience. Comparing FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons allows us to characterize how the properties of neuronal assemblies evolve during an initial phase of consolidation. Whereas no difference was observed in the excitability of FLEN+ vs. FLEN− neurons, RAM+ neurons were more excitable than RAM− neurons. This suggests that CA3 PNs recruited in an engram progressively acquire increased excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs. Overall, with the FLEN strategy, we can show that both the intrinsic excitability and the synaptic properties of CA3 PNs undergo progressive plastic changes over the first day following a one-trial memory task.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>engram</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>intrinsic properties</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00rbzpz17</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hippencode 14-CE13-0015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulle</surname><given-names>Christophe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/019w4f821</institution-id><institution>European Union MSCA ITN SYDAD</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>676144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cupolillo</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04w6kn183</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDT201904007898</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cupolillo</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel viral tool (FLEN) is designed, and used to monitor changes in the intrinsic and synaptic properties of engram cells quickly (3–6 hours) following encoding of a memory.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animal survival depends on the ability to rapidly form new and durable episodic memories of one-time meaningful events which, when recalled, allow to adapt behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tulving, 2002</xref>). Contextual memories of ongoing experiences are continuously and rapidly generated in the hippocampus and subsequently stored in an extended cortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eichenbaum, 2000</xref>). Computational models of memory point to a crucial role of the hippocampal CA3 region in episodic memory encoding and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kesner and Rolls, 2015</xref>). Based on its distinctive extensive recurrent architecture (CA3–CA3), CA3 may act as an auto-associative or attractor network, enabling pattern completion during recollection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kesner and Rolls, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McNaughton and Morris, 1987</xref>). Indeed, mice with CA3-specific synaptic plasticity impairment (CA3 NR1-KO mice) are unable to encode the novel location of a hidden platform in a delayed matching-to-place version of the Morris water maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>) and to retrieve the learned position of a submerged platform when partial cues are presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakazawa et al., 2002</xref>). In addition to recurrent connections, the main excitatory synaptic drivers of CA3 pyramidal neurons (PNs) are inputs from medial and lateral entorhinal cortex via the perforant pathway, and indirectly from mossy fibers (Mfs) through the dentate gyrus (DG). Mf inputs display ‘conditional detonator’ properties, enabling individual Mf synapses to trigger postsynaptic firing in response to repetitive firing of presynaptic DG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Henze et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marneffe et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rebola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sachidhanandam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vandael and Jonas, 2024</xref>).</p><p>During encoding of novel information, the orchestrated activity patterns of selected neuronal groups distributed throughout the brain, called engrams, represent the initial memory trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>). Engrams undergo long-lasting synaptic modifications during consolidation and are selectively re-engaged when the memory is retrieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bessières et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Josselyn and Tonegawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tomé et al., 2024</xref>). Experimental manipulation of neuronal engrams in the hippocampus allows selective memory erasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Han et al., 2009</xref>), artificial memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), and creation of a synthetic memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vetere et al., 2019</xref>), highlighting both their necessity and sufficiency for memory functions.</p><p>The investigation of the properties of engram neurons has taken advantage of immediate early genes (IEGs) such as c-Fos, Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein), or <italic>Npas4</italic> (neuronal PAS domain protein 4) to visualize and label neurons active during a memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kawashima et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sørensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Generally, IEGs are rapidly and transiently expressed; however, different IEGs are triggered by different sets of extracellular events and possess specific expression kinetics. Temporal control of IEG-based systems is crucial to accurately link engram labeling to specific events that occur in a specific time.</p><p>The activity of engram neurons can be tracked in vivo during their maturation from the process of encoding throughout consolidation in behaving mice, by means of functional indicators like GCaMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milczarek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mocle et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tomé et al., 2024</xref>). However, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging does not allow addressing the synaptic and intrinsic properties of engram neurons. Labeling of engram neurons in order to characterize these properties ex vivo over time after an experience has occurred often relies on labeling techniques using inducible transgenic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>). In several studies using transgenic mouse lines, engram labeling requires 48 hr of doxycycline (Dox) deprivation before a novel experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ryan et al., 2015</xref>), or the use of tamoxifen injection to open a 12-hr time window for engram labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, these systems only offer temporal control over extended time windows, thus increasing the probability of compromising the experience specificity of labeled engram cells. In addition, most of these approaches drive a relatively late labeling, enabling investigation of learning-induced modifications more than 24 hr after a novel experience (e.g. Robust Activity Marker [RAM] system) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) or shortly after recall for neurons which have been labeled several days before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>), when consolidation processes have already been engaged.</p><p>Little has been learned about how neuronal engrams in the hippocampus rapidly (in the time range of hours) adapt their synaptic and physiological properties following encoding of a memory event, and how these properties evolve over time. In this sense, it is unknown whether initial memory storage is enabled by engram cell modifications of intrinsic properties, synaptic plasticity, or a combination of them. Here, we tackle these questions using a combination of viral strategies that allow us to identify engram neurons and compare ex vivo their properties shortly after learning (3–4 hr), and 24 hr after the experience has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cupolillo, 2021</xref>). To track early engrams, we developed a virally delivered c-Fos-based genetic construct that provides physiological-like rapid expression and fast decay of the bright fluorescent cytosolic marker ZsGreen1. This novel viral strategy for fast and efficient labeling of engram neurons (FLEN) allows identifying and characterizing engram neurons within 3–4 hr following a novel experience, in reference to non-activated neurons. Then, to understand how initial engram cell properties evolve within a 24-hr time scale, we employ the more durable c-Fos-based artificial RAM system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sørensen et al., 2016</xref>) to label neurons and characterize their properties 24 hr after the exposure to a one-trial memory task.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Development of a novel viral tool to study early changes in the properties of CA3 engram cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme representing the maturation of engram neurons during memory formation.

This construct includes the full-length, activity-dependent c-Fos promoter which controls the expression of a destabilized variant of the green fluorescent protein ZsGreen1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The complete sequence of the c-Fos promoter ensures a physiological-like gene expression of ZsGreen1, which follows c-Fos expression. ZsGreen1 provides a bright whole-cell somatic and dendritic labeling of activated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To restrict the labeling time window and minimize labeling unrelated to the designed experience, ZsGreen1 was fused with a destabilizing domain (DR); when fused to EGFP, DR decreases the fluorescence half-time to 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>To determine the expression kinetics of FLEN in response to neuronal activity, P0 mouse cortical neurons were cultured (cellular density 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) and then co-infected at DIV3 with AAV9-c-Fos/ZsGreen1-DR (FLEN) and a secondary AAV9-CB7/mCherry, which constitutively expresses mCherry in infected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Neurons were cultured until DIV11 in regular neurobasal medium, before switching to an activating medium containing 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 100 µM) and bicuculline (Bic, 10 µM) for 30 min. The drugs were then washed out, and tetrodotoxin (TTX, 0.5 µM) was added to block further neuronal activity until cells were fixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The percentage of activated neurons (ZsGreen+, further named FLEN+ neurons) over the total number of transduced neurons (mCherry+ neurons) was calculated at different time points within a 6-hr period after pharmacological stimulation. Only a limited number of FLEN+ neurons could be found in unstimulated conditions (5.4 ± 0.5 FLEN+/FLEN−, <italic>n</italic> = 3 plates) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The activating medium triggered ZsGreen1 expression in neurons as early as 2 hr, reaching a threefold peak within 3 hr (1 hr: 6.7 ± 1.0, <italic>n</italic> = 3; 2 hr: 13.2 ± 5.0, <italic>n</italic> = 3; 3 hr: 15.7 ± 2.2, <italic>n</italic> = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). The number of FLEN+ neurons decreased after the peak, decaying to pre-stimulation-like levels within 6 hr (4.5 hr: 12.0 ± 3.9, <italic>n</italic> = 4; 6 hr: 5.0 ± 1.1, <italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>). Thus, FLEN showed a rapid induction (2–3 hr) and a fast decay (within 6 hr) of ZsGreen1-DR fluorescence (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.04). To test specificity, we assessed co-expression with endogenous c-Fos in hippocampal cultures 3 hr following the same pharmacological stimulation. Among infected neurons (mCherry+), we found that 77.1 ± 6.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) of FLEN+ neurons were positive for c-Fos. We also found that 60.8 ± 5.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 4) of the c-Fos−+ neurons were also positive for FLEN. Thus, although FLEN does not capture the entire c-Fos+ population, FLEN+ neurons are likely true engram (c-Fos+) cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FLEN captures early neuronal activity following contextual fear conditioning</title><p>We next investigated the time course of FLEN expression in vivo in wild-type mice in response to exposure to a salient novel experience.

We thus calculated the proportion of miniature excitatory events with an amplitude greater than 40 pA. During spontaneous activity recording, we found no difference in the fraction of putative Mf-driven inputs between FLEN+ and FLEN− PNs (FLEN+: 0.09 ± 0.03%, <italic>n</italic> = 9; FLEN−: 0.06 ± 0.02%, <italic>n</italic> = 14; Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p = 0.33) and between RAM+ and RAM− PNs 24 hr after learning (RAM+: 0.25 ± 0.08%, <italic>n</italic> = 14; RAM−: 0.18 ± 0.07%, <italic>n</italic> = 13; Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, p = 0.42) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, inset).

Because of the rapid time course with which structural plasticity occurs at Mf-CA3 synapses following one-trial memory task, we took advantage of FLEN to explore a functional counterpart to structural plasticity, and to address whether the change in feedforward inhibition was differentially affected in FLEN+ vs. FLEN− CA3 PNs. We recorded excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents in CA3 PNs while stimulating Mfs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

The primary goal of our work was to test the hypothesis that the functional properties of hippocampal cells activated during a one-trial contextual memory task were distinct from surrounding ones shortly (3–6 hr) after encoding and were subject to progressive plastic changes which could be linked to a first phase of memory consolidation.</p><p>Most techniques currently employed to study the properties of engram cells ex vivo combine promoter expression based on IEGs, intersectional transgenic strategies, optogenetics, and pharmacogenetics with behavioral paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Denny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tonegawa et al., 2015</xref>). A major caveat for using activity-dependent promoter/enhancers is the background basal expression which can result in the labeling of neurons unrelated to the triggering behavioral event. To limit this, fluorescent marker and/or actuator expression can be temporally controlled by directly coupling IEG promoters, such as c-Fos or synthetic promoters (RAM), to inducible systems such as the doxycycline (Dox) or the tamoxifen (TAM) systems. With these approaches, the physiological properties of engram vs. non-engram cells have been examined by ex vivo patch-clamp recordings 24 hr to several days after the initial contextual memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sørensen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yap et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We thus developed a viral strategy for transient neuronal expression of a fluorescent protein (FLEN) following the exposure of mice to a novel context making use of the full-length c-Fos promoter and of the brightly fluorescent ZsGreen1 protein (8.6 times brighter than EGPF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bell et al., 2007</xref>), engineered to be quickly destabilized. The time course of expression of ZsGreen1 in FLEN-labeled neurons peaked at 3 hr both after pharmacological activation in cultured neurons and in vivo after a 5-min exposure to a novel context. Neuron labeling persisted for a few hours, enabling ex vivo electrophysiological characterization of neurons thought to be involved in the initial encoding of contextual memory. As with all techniques based on IEG promoters, a small percentage of AAV-transduced neurons showed ZsGreen1 fluorescence under control conditions (HC or no activation of cultured neurons). However, following CFC, the number of FLEN-labeled neurons increased by a factor of 3.12. The bright fluorescence of ZsGreen1 enabled the electrophysiological characterization of FLEN+ neurons, the majority of which (&gt;60%) were activated in relation to the CFC memory task. Therefore, the key features of the FLEN strategy as compared to other tools used to label engrams are that: (1) it uses an AAV-based viral tool, (2) a c-fos promoter drives the expression of a brightly fluorescent protein allowing for their identification ex vivo for functional analysis, and (3) the fluorescent protein is rapidly destabilized, providing the possibility to label neurons only a few hours after their activation by a behavioral task.</p><p>We have used FLEN to label neurons in CA3, which is involved in the rapid encoding of new spatial and contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kesner and Rolls, 2015</xref>). One of the key features of CA3 is the presence of recurrent excitatory connections which are subject to NMDA-dependent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rebola et al., 2017</xref>), and this appears essential for memory of a one-trial experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakazawa et al., 2003</xref>). It has been proposed that the excitability state of neurons may contribute to memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Linden, 2003</xref>). We first examined whether FLEN+ neurons showed distinctive intrinsic excitability properties. We observed no difference in the membrane potential, input resistance, threshold, or bursting activity between FLEN+ and FLEN− neurons in slices prepared 3 hr following CFC. This suggests that the subpopulation of CA3 PNs engaged in a one-trial learning task is not initially more excitable than the general population of neurons, hence is not predetermined by their excitability state. Alternatively, engram neurons may be transiently more excitable, at the time of encoding, and lose this property within a few hours. In apparent contrast with our finding that FLEN+ CA3 PNs did not show increased excitability, a simple associative memory task, trace eye-blink conditioning, appears to increase the excitability of a large fraction (more than half) of CA3 neurons starting at 1 hr and decreasing after several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>). Beyond the difference in the task and in the species, these contrasting results may be explained by an overall increased neuronal activity related to the learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thompson et al., 1996</xref>), however not specific to engram neurons. This does not preclude, however, the possibility that relative neuronal excitability immediately before training could contribute to the selection of neurons to an engram as proposed in the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yiu et al., 2014</xref>) and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mocle et al., 2024</xref>). However, in our hands, a one-trial memory task does not per se trigger a selective increase in the excitability of engram neurons 3 hr after CFC as compared to the general population of CA3 neurons. In the DG, recall of a previously stored contextual memory (48 hr before), hence reactivation of engram neurons, rapidly increased the excitability of these engram neurons (within 1 hr) with respect to engram neurons which were not subject to reactivation in a separate group of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>). A learning-related task may, however, induce plasticity of intrinsic excitability of engram neurons on a longer time scale. We thus compared the intrinsic excitability of FLEN+ neurons to those labeled more than 24 hr after CFC by using the previously described RAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sørensen et al., 2016</xref>). We found that RAM+ neurons showed prolonged spike firing in response to a depolarizing pulse of current, hence decreased accommodation in comparison with non-labeled neurons. Considering that the set of neurons labeled by these two strategies may be of the same set, based on the expression of a fluorescent marker under the control of the c-Fos promoter, our data strongly suggest that engram neurons in CA3 progressively increase excitability as compared to neurons which were not activated by the one-trial contextual memory task. As a limitation point, it should however be considered that both strategies may label distinct populations of neurons, due to the use of different promoters to drive the expression of the fluorescent marker. However, both strategies accurately label neurons that are, in large part, c-Fos positive and are involved in processing specific context information (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sørensen et al., 2016</xref>). The acquisition of increased excitability 24 hr after one-trial memory encoding suggests that intrinsic excitability is a key feature of an early consolidation of memory, which may even be strengthened upon reactivation of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pignatelli et al., 2019</xref>). It would be interesting to assess whether increased intrinsic excitability persists throughout further consolidation of memory.</p><p>Increased neuronal activity in engram neurons at the time of encoding may result from more efficient or more synchronous excitatory synaptic inputs to these neurons. Here we observed that FLEN+ neurons (hence characterized &gt;3 hr after initial encoding) showed an increased excitatory drive, which may be explained by a higher number of synaptic contacts, although an increase in release probability cannot be excluded. We cannot discriminate whether the increased number of synaptic inputs preexists to the formation of the engram, or whether it is a plastic mechanism taking place shortly following the contextual memory. The time course of appearance of additional synapses, by unmuting of silent synapses following contextual memory acquisition, is compatible with experimentally induced functional and structural synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Holtmaat and Caroni, 2016</xref>). On the other hand, if FLEN+ neurons showed higher synaptic inputs at the time of memory encoding, this would increase the chance that these neurons show increased excitation (c-Fos activation) and hence participate in the engram. The amplitude of mEPSCs in FLEN+ neurons does not appear to increase on average in comparison with FLEN− CA3 PNs. This finding may not favor the possibility that LTP-like synaptic plasticity occurs early during the process of memory formation. In this event, NMDA-dependent forms of synaptic plasticity are more likely to occur later on during the early phase of consolidation of the memory trace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Humeau and Choquet, 2019</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a comparable increase in the frequency of sEPSCs and mEPSCs in RAM+ CA3 neurons 24 hr after CFC, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weng et al., 2018</xref>), without any change in the amplitude. Using a pharmacological agent which selectively inhibits Mf-CA3 transmission, it was hypothesized that the increased mEPSC frequency is mainly due to more active Mf-CA3 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weng et al., 2018</xref>). However, if this was the case, we would also expect an increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs as well as an increase in the fraction of mEPSCs larger than 45 pA. In addition, we did not find evidence for an increase in Mf-CA3-evoked EPSCs (see below). Overall, our data indicate that CA3 engram neurons characterized a few hours after the one-trial memory task show a higher level of excitatory synaptic inputs, and this feature seems to extend to 24 hr. We found no evidence for increased amplitude of EPSCs in FLEN+ or RAM+ CA3 PNs which could have been indicative of postsynaptic plasticity through an increased number of synaptic AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Humeau and Choquet, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>). One reason may be that synaptic plasticity only occurs in a subset of synaptic contacts, and the recording of mEPSCs is not sensitive enough to capture these modifications.</p><p>Local inhibition controls the spiking of CA3 PNs, hence their capacity to be engaged in an active ensemble of neurons at the time of contextual memory encoding. In CA1, there is a fine control of inhibition upon novel environment exploration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yap et al., 2021</xref>) or fear learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lovett-Barron et al., 2014</xref>). We found an increase in the frequency of mIPSCs after CFC in engram CA3 neurons, both after 3 hr and after 24 hr. This suggests that the elevation of mEPSCs in the engram neurons is counterbalanced by increased inhibition, although this would need to be generally tested in conditions of hippocampal circuit activity in vivo. We have also provided information on the process of Mf-driven feedforward inhibition in CA3 following one-trial memory encoding. Mf-CA3 synapses have been proposed to play a major role in assisting CA3 in the encoding of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kesner and Rolls, 2015</xref>). For these reasons, it is important to directly characterize the properties of Mf-CA3 synapses impinging on CA3 engram neurons. We observed no difference in the amplitude and short-term plasticity of Mf-CA3 EPSCs evoked in FLEN+ CA3 neurons vs. FLEN- neurons. It has been proposed that 24 hr after CFC, the increased amplitude of mEPSCs in RAM+ neurons can be attributed to modifications of Mf-CA3 synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weng et al., 2018</xref>), which may suggest progressive plasticity of these inputs. There is abundant evidence that the structural properties of Mf-CA3 synapses are modified by experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Galimberti et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maruo et al., 2016</xref>). Feedforward inhibition combines with short-term plasticity of Mf-CA3 synapses to define the physiological conditions for efficient spike transfer between the DG and CA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Marneffe et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vandael and Jonas, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zucca et al., 2017</xref>). CFC induces a robust and global increase in the number of filopodia emanating from the giant Mf terminals, which peaks between 1 and 5 hr after the one-trial memory task and is related to the precision of memory and the size of engrams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>). Because filopodia contact GABAergic interneurons, this structural plasticity has been proposed to increase feedforward inhibition, albeit this has not yet been demonstrated. Here we compared the excitation/inhibition ratio of Mf-evoked synaptic responses between FLEN+ and FLEN− neurons. We did not observe a significant increase of feedforward inhibition onto CA3 engrams, as may be expected from an increased number of filopodia, but we rather observed a tendency toward less feedforward inhibition. This leads us to speculate that shortly following contextual memory formation, Mf-driven feedforward inhibition is increased in the general population of neurons but not in Mf inputs onto engram neurons, thus allowing for a comparatively stronger input from the DG to the engram neurons. It will be interesting to test whether this increased signal to noise ratio is maintained 24 hr after contextual memory encoding, given that the number of filopodia per Mf bouton has returned to basal level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we used a viral tool allowing for the identification of neurons involved in a behavioral task within 3 hr, as a complement to the transgenic mouse strategies and viral vectors which have been used to assess changes in engram neuron properties in the time range of days. Although it is not possible to fully assess the electrophysiological properties of engram neurons at the time of the encoding, this work shows that the engram neurons are not different in their intrinsic membrane properties shortly after encoding. This set of properties may, however, follow delayed (progressive) plastic changes which are evident 24 hr after initial encoding. Overall, we propose that engram neurons do not show higher excitability preexisting to the selection of neurons to the engram during the memory encoding task. Hence, the increased activation state of the FLEN+ neurons at the time of encoding may rather relate to a higher number of active synaptic inputs providing more efficient excitation. Interestingly, although more work is needed to confirm this tendency, increased excitation may also be linked to decreased Mf-driven feedforward inhibition, thus favoring spike transfer from the DG to CA3 at the time or shortly after memory encoding. The FLEN viral tool will be useful to assess how the properties of neurons in brain regions are involved in the contextual memory encoding process, including the entorhinal cortex and the DG.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL/6J female mice were obtained from Janvier and cared for according to the regulations of the University of Bordeaux/CNRS Animal Care and Use Committee (agreement number, APAFIS#8444-2016051911442448).

Permeabilization was performed with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min under shaking (1 ml/well), followed by three PBS washes (5 min each). Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 60 min under shaking (1 ml/well). Primary antibody incubation was performed at RT for 60 min under shaking using rat anti-c-Fos (Synaptic Systems, ref 226 017) diluted 1:1000 in 2% BSA (160 µl/coverslip). Coverslips were washed three times with 2% BSA in PBS (5 min each) and incubated again in 2% BSA for 60 min under shaking (1 ml/well). Secondary antibody (goat anti-rat Alexa Fluor 647, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ref A21247) was applied at 1:500 dilution (160 µl/coverslip) for 60 min at RT under shaking and protected from light. Coverslips were washed three times in PBS (5 min each) and mounted using Fluoromount-G with DAPI (Southern Biotech).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell counting</title><p>Culture and ex vivo slice images were processed using custom code. Each fluorescence channel (mCherry, ZsGreen, c-Fos, and DAPI) was normalized, Gaussian-filtered, and manually thresholded. Binary masks were generated and cleaned by removing small objects and segmented using watershed. Masks were further filtered by area and shape (circularity, axis ratio, eccentricity, and solidity). From these counts, labeling ratios (between ZsGreen, mCherry, c-Fos, and DAPI) were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Stereotaxic injection</title><p>Two-month-old C57BL6J mice were bilaterally injected with either AAV9-c-Fos-ZsGreen1-DR or the AAV9-RAM virus mixed with the infection control virus AAV9-CB7-mCherry into dorsal hippocampus. Mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus, where they were kept under 1.5–2% isoflurane anesthesia (0.8–1 l/min), and injected with buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) and carprofen (5 mg/kg) to prevent post-surgery pain. The injection volume and flow rate (300 nl at 60 nl/min) were controlled with an injection micro-pump (World Precision Instruments). Injection coordinates, using bregma as a reference point, were as follows: AP –1.78, ML ±2.40, DV –2.35. This site targets dorsal CA3b, but virus spreading resulted in the infection of CA3a, CA3b, CA3c, CA2, and in some cases, few granule neurons and hilar cells of the DG. Mice were carefully monitored for 4 days following surgery, and behavioral manipulation started after a recovery period of approximately 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral tests</title><p>Once recovered, mice were single-housed to reduce uncontrolled experiences that could contaminate the ensemble of CFC-related labeled engram cells. Then, mice were handled to habituate to the experimenter for at least 3 consecutive days prior to CFC. Mice injected with the RAM virus were deprived of doxycycline, switching to a regular diet, 48 hr before CFC training. On the one-trial learning day, mice were transported in the experimental room and immediately placed in a novel conditioning chamber enclosed in a sound-attenuating cabinet (Ugo Basile), enriched with visual cues, and allowed to explore it for a total duration of 300 s. After an initial exploration period, three mild foot-shocks (2 s, 0.7 mA) were delivered at 150, 210, and 270 s, leaving 30 s for additional context sampling at the end. Mice were recorded and freezing behavior was scored using ANY-Maze 6 software (Stoelting Europe). Freezing was detected as the absence of movement apart from respiration, and freezing events were scored when immobility lasted more than a threshold of 300 ms. Mice were then returned to their home cage. For context-only (CO) exploration, mice were placed in a 50 cm × 50 cm custom-built open field, where some objects were distributed. Mice were allowed to explore for 5 min before returning to their home cage. The immediate shock test was carried out in the fear conditioning system. Mice explored the conditioning chamber for only 2 s before receiving a 6-s-long foot-shock and then returned to their home cage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with intraperitoneal administration of a ketamine/xylazine mix (100/10 mg/kg) at different time intervals following CFC (1.5, 3, 4.5, 6, and 12 hr for c-Fos-ZsGreen1-DR, 24 hr for RAM). Mice were then intracardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl solution followed by 4% PFA in 0.1 mM PBS. Brains were removed and postfixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Brains were transferred to sucrose 30% in 0.1 mM PBS at 4°C until they sank. Brains were cut on a cryostat into 25-µm-thick coronal sections and collected in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100. Slices were immediately mounted on glass slides and covered in DAPI-based mounting medium. The number of fluorescent neurons was assessed directly without amplification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Confocal microscope</title><p>Confocal acquisitions were performed using a Leica SP8 White Light Laser 2 on an inverted stand (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) and with a x20 (NA 0.75) immersion objective. Images were analyzed using ImageJ. At least 5 slices per animal were acquired. Imaging of neuronal cultures was carried out as well using confocal Leica SP8 White Light Laser 2 (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany) and with a x20 (NA 0.75) immersion objective. In all experiments, the settings (laser power, gain, offset) were fixed between groups as well as the pixel size (120 nm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Ex vivo slice preparation</title><p>Slices were prepared 3 or 24 hr following CFC for c-Fos-ZsGreen1-DR-injected mice and RAM-injected mice, respectively. To attempt to reduce stress-related unspecific c-Fos activation, mice were anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mix (100/10 mg/kg; i.p.) and intracardially perfused with an ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) cutting solution containing (in mM): 87 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 75 sucrose, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 7.4, 315 mOsm/kg. Brains were quickly dissected out and parasagittal slices from both hemispheres (300 µm thick) were cut on a vibratome (Leica VT1200S, Germany) in the same oxygenated ice-cold cutting solution. Slices were then incubated at 34°C in a resting chamber containing the same cutting solution for 20–30 min for recovery. Slices were then transferred in a resting chamber filled with an oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) containing (mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 glucose, pH 7.4, 300 mOsm/kg at room temperature for the rest of the day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>When transferred to a recording chamber, slices were continuously superfused with aCSF. CA3 pyramidal cells were identified with an infrared differential interference contrast microscope with a water immersion 63X objective (N.A. 0.8). Neurons were then classified as engram neurons (simultaneous expression of ZsGreen1-DR/mCherry or EGFP/mCherry when RAM was used) or non-engram neuron (mCherry expression only) with a 2p microscope. Whole-cell recordings were made at room temperature using borosilicate glass capillaries with resistances between 4 and 6 MΩ. For current clamp recordings, the intracellular solution contained (in mM): 135 K-gluconate, 5 KCl, 2 NaCl, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 0.1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Mg-ATP, 0.4 Na-GTP, pH 7.2 adjusted with KOH, 280–290 mOsm/kg. For voltage clamp mode, the patch pipettes were filled with a solution containing (mM): 140 Cs-methanesulfonate, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 NaCl, 5 Na-phosphocreatine, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 3 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.3 GTP, pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH, 280–290 mOsm/kg. To record inhibitory currents, a high-chloride intracellular solution was used, containing (mM): 103 CsCl, 12 CsCH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>S, 5 TEA-Cl, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, 0.5 Na-GTP, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH, 280–290 mOsm/kg. No liquid-junction correction was used. Neurons were held at –70 mV. Leak current and series resistance were monitored throughout each experiment; neurons with a leak current &gt;200 pA and a series resistance &gt;25 MΩ or if these parameters changed more than 20% were excluded from analysis. All recordings were performed 5–10 min after opening the membrane. Input resistance was quantified by linearly fitting the voltage change against injected current. Steps of hyper- and depolarizing current steps were injected to determine AP threshold and rheobase. AP firing pattern was determined by injecting 200 pA steps of current. sEPSCs were isolated by bath application of bicuculline (10 µM), while mEPSCs were recorded in the presence of bicuculline (10 µM) and TTX (0.5 µM). Spontaneous IPSCs were recorded in the presence of D-AP5 (50 µM) and NBQX (20 µM), while mIPSCs were isolated in the presence of D-AP5 (50 µM), NBQX (20 µM), and TTX (0.5 µM). Spontaneous and miniature synaptic events were detected using a deconvolution-based approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pernía-Andrade et al., 2012</xref>). To record evoked EPSCs, stimulating glass pipettes (World Precision Instruments) were filled with aCSF and placed in the hilus, close to the granule cell layer to stimulate initial portion of Mf axons. Voltage pulses (200 µs) were delivered through a stimulus isolator (Digitimer, UK). Stimulation intensity was adjusted to obtain minimal Mf stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marchal and Mulle, 2004</xref>). Basal synaptic transmission was recorded while holding CA3 neurons at –70 mV with pulses delivered at a low frequency of 0.1 Hz. Frequency was then increased to 1 Hz to induce frequency facilitation. After 2–3 min, when facilitation was extinguished, the voltage was switched to +5 mV (reversal potential for cations) to record di-synaptic eIPSC. All recordings were obtained with a HEKA EPC10 amplifier, filtered at 3.3 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz via PatchMaster software (Lambrecht, Germany). Data was analyzed offline using custom-made Python scripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis, statistics, and graphical representation were performed with custom-written Python codes using standard libraries (e.g. Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Matplotlib). All experiments consist of biological replicates, with <italic>N</italic> values reported throughout the manuscript. Data is shown as box plots and scatter plots. Scatter plots indicate individual samples per group. Boxplots indicate median, first and third quartiles with whiskers representing the rest of the distribution. Bold horizontal and vertical lines on scattered data points represent mean and SEM, respectively. All values were first tested for normality (D’Agostino and Pearson omnibus test or Shapiro–Wilk test). Normally distributed data were compared using a <italic>t</italic>-test (two-sided) while Mann–Whitney rank test (two-sided) was used for non-normal dataset. Multiple group comparison was carried out using one-way ANOVA when data were normally distributed or Kruskal–Wallis when normality did not apply. Tukey’s post hoc comparison analysis or Dunn post hoc comparison analysis was applied. Cumulative frequency distributions and normalized distributions were tested using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Statistical differences were considered as significant at p &lt; 0.05.

Several such systems already exist but this study adds additional capability by leveraging an activity marker that is destabilized (and thus temporally active) as well as being driven by the full-length promoter of cFos. The authors demonstrate the activity dependent induction and timecourse of expression, first in cultured neurons and then in vivo in hippocampal CA3 neurons after one trial contextual fear conditioning. In a series of ex vivo experiments the authors perform patch clamp analysis of labeled neurons to determine if these putative engram neurons differ from non-labelled neurons using both the FLEN system as well as the previously characterized RAM system. Interestingly the early labelled neurons at 3 h post CFC (FLEN+) demonstrated no differences in excitability whereas the RAM labeled neurons at 24h after CFC had increased excitability. Examination of synaptic properties demonstrated an increase in sEPCS and mEPSC frequencies as well as those for sIPSCs and mIPSCs which was not due to a change in the mossy fiber input to these neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall the data is of high quality and the study introduces a new tool while also reassessing some principles of circuit plasticity in the CA3 that have been the focus of prior studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No major weaknesses were noted</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105452.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Cupollilo et al. investigate the properties of hippocampal CA3 neurons that express the immediate early gene cFos in response to a single foot shock. They compare ex-vivo the electrophysiological properties of these &quot;engram neurons&quot; labeled with two different cFos promoter-driven green markers: Their new virally delivered tool FLEN labels neurons 2-6 h after activity, while RAM contains additional enhancers and peaks considerably later (&gt;24 h). Since the fraction of labeled CA3 cells is comparable with both constructs, it is assumed (but not tested) that they label the same population of activated neurons at different time points. Both FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons in CA3 receive more synaptic inputs compared to non-expressing control neurons, which could be a causal factor for cFos activation, or a very early consequence thereof. Frequency facilitation and E/I ratio of mossy fiber inputs were also tested, but are not different in both cFos+ groups of neurons.

Several such systems already exist but this study adds additional capability by leveraging an activity marker that is destabilized (and thus temporally active) as well as being driven by the full-length promoter of cFos. The authors demonstrate the activity-dependent induction and time course of expression, first in cultured neurons and then in vivo in hippocampal CA3 neurons after one trial of contextual fear conditioning. In a series of ex vivo experiments, the authors perform patch clamp analysis of labeled neurons to determine if these putative engram neurons differ from non-labelled neurons using both the FLEN system as well as the previously characterized RAM system. Interestingly the early labelled neurons at 3 h post CFC (FLEN+) demonstrated no differences in excitability whereas the RAMlabelled neurons at 24h after CFC had increased excitability. Examination of synaptic properties demonstrated an increase in sEPCS and mEPSC frequencies as well as those for sIPSCs and mIPSCs which was not due to a change in the mossy fiber input to these neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall the data is of high quality and the study introduces a new tool while also reassessing some principles of circuit plasticity in the CA3 that have been the focus of prior studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No major weaknesses were noted.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cupollilo et al. investigate the properties of hippocampal CA3 neurons that express the immediate early gene cFos in response to a single foot shock. They compare ex-vivo the electrophysiological properties of these &quot;engram neurons&quot; labeled with two different cFos promoter-driven green markers: Their new tool FLEN labels neurons 2-6 h after activity, while RAM contains additional enhancers and peaks considerably later (&gt;24 h). Since the fraction of labeled CA3 cells is comparable with both constructs, it is assumed (but not tested) that they label the same population of activated neurons at different time points. Both FLEN+ and RAM+ neurons in CA3 receive more synaptic inputs compared to non-expressing control neurons, which could be a causal factor for cFos activation, or a very early consequence thereof. Frequency facilitation and E/I ratio of mossy fiber inputs were also tested, but are not different in both cFos+ groups of neurons. One day after foot shock, RAM+ neurons are more excitable than RAM- neurons, suggesting a slow increase in excitability as a major consequence of cFos activation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is conducted to high standards and contributes significantly to our understanding of memory formation and consolidation in the hippocampus. Modifications of intrinsic neuronal properties seem to be more salient than overall changes in the total number of (excitatory and inhibitory) inputs, although a switch in the source of the synaptic inputs would not have been detected by the methods employed in this study</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>With regard to the new viral tool, a direct comparison between the new tool FLEN and existing cFos reporters is missing.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I have only minor suggestions for the authors to consider.</p><p>(1) In the in vitro characterization, the percentage of labelled neurons seems very low after a powerful and prolonged activation. It was somewhat surprising and raised the question of how accurately the FLEN construct reflects endogenous cFOS activity. Could the authors speak to this?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the level of FLEN positive neurons, as compared to mCherry positive neurons, is low as compared to studies using viral infection with RAM vectors in neuronal cultures (Sorensen et al, 2016, Sun et al, 2020), which is around 70-80% following chemical stimulation. The authors do not provide evidence however for a comparison with endogenous c-Fos activity in cell cultures. The reason for a discrepancy in the effect of chemical stimulation of cultured neurons is not clear, but may depend on culture conditions which may vary between labs.</p><p>FLEN was constructed using a mouse c-Fos promoter (-355 to +109) (Cen et al, 2003). To answer the reviewer’s question we performed an additional experiment in cultured neurons in which we found that 77.1 % of FLEN positive neurons were also c-fos positive neurons (using immunocytochemistry).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors compare the two labelling strategies and interpret their data with the presumption that both label a similar set of active neurons. This is particularly relevant when they suggest there might be a progressive increase in the excitability of active neurons with time. This is certainly a possibility, but the authors should also consider other possibilities that the two markers might label different populations of neurons. For example, if they require different thresholds for activation, it is possible that one is more sensitive to activity than the other. As these are unknown variables the authors should temper the interpretation accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the reviewer is correct that this limitation should be discussed. We have added this as a point of discussion in the text (line 355-358). In the article describing the RAM strategy (Sorensen et al, 2016) the authors use RAM to label DG neurons activated during an experience in a context A (Figure 4). Exploiting the fact that engram cells are re-activated when the animal is re-exposed to the same environment of training (memory recall), they performed c-Fos staining 90 minutes following either context A or context B re-exposure. The RAM-c-Fos overlap percentage was higher in A-A rather than A-B (A-A was a bit more than 20%). This means that RAM has captured a group of cells during training that, at least in part, were re-activated during recall. This could in part support the assumption that RAM and c-Fos share a certain overlap. Of course, this was done in DG, while we worked in CA3. In addition, both strategies label in their great majority c-Fos+ neurons (see above answer to point #1). This can not completely rule out the possibility that FLEN and RAM label partly distinct population of activated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) An increase in the frequency of synaptic events is observed in neurons labelled with both markers. The authors propose that this may be due to an increase in synaptic contacts based on prior studies. However, as this is the first functional assessment why not consider changes in release probability as a mechanism for this finding?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this as a possibility in the text (line 362-363).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would be useful to include plots of the average frequency of m/sEPSCs and m/sIPSCs in Figures 4 and 5. These figures could also be combined into a single figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that figure 4 and 5 could be merged into a single figure. In the revised version, figure 5A becomes panel C in figure 4. Text and figure descriptions were adjusted accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Abstract, line 24: &quot;In contrast, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs.&quot; RAM+ neurons also show an increased number of excitatory inputs, so this is not &quot;in contrast&quot;. Also, not just excitatory, but also inhibitory synaptic inputs are more numerous in cFos+ neurons. Please improve the summary of your findings.</p></disp-quote><p>“In contrast” referred to the fact that FLEN+ neurons do not show differences in excitability as compared to FLEN- neurons, as mentioned in the previous sentence. We now provide a more explicit sentence to explain this point: “On the other hand, like RAM+ neurons, FLEN+ CA3 neurons show an increased number of excitatory inputs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Novel tool: Destabilized cFos reporters were introduced 23 years ago and are also part of the TetTag mouse. I am not sure that changing the green fluorescent protein to a different version merits a new acronym (FLEN). To convince the readers that this is more than a branding exercise, the authors should compare the properties (brightness, folding time, stability) of FLEN to e.g. the d2EGFP reporter introduced by Bi et al. 2002 (J Biotechnol. 93(3):231) and show significant improvements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment which compelled us to evaluate the features of other tools used to label neurons activated following contextual fear conditioing. The key properties of FLEN as compared to other tools used to label engrams is that: (i) it is a viral tool, as opposed to transgenic mice, (ii) a c-fos promoter drives the expression of a brightly fluorescent protein allowing their identification ex vivo for functional analysis, (iii) the fluorescent protein is rapidly destabilized, providing the possibility to label neurons only a few hours after their activation by a behavioural task.</p><p>We did not find any viral tools providing the possibility to label c-fos activated neurons for functional assesment. We have not been able to find references for the use of the d2EGFP reporter introduced by Bi et al. 2002 in a behavioural context. One of the major difference and improvement is certainly the brightness of ZsGreen. In cell cultures, ZsGreen1 showed a 8.6-fold increase in fluorescence intensity as compared with EGFP (Bell et al, 2007).</p><p>Amongst tools with comparable properties, eSARE was developed based on a synthetic Arc promoter driving the expression of a destabilized GFP (dEGFP) (Kawashima et al 2013). We initially used ESARE–dGFP but unfortunately, in our experimental conditions we found that the signal to noise ratio was not satisfactory (number of cells label in the home cage vs. following contextual fear conditining).</p><p>We developed a viral tool to avoid the use of transgenic reporter lines which require laborious breeding and is experimentally less flexible. Nevertheless, many transgenic mice based on the expression of fluorescent proteins under the control of IEG promoters have been developed and used. Some of these mice show a time course of expression of the transgene which is comparable to FLEN. For instance, in organotypic slices from Tet-Tag mice, the time course of expression of EGFP slices follows with a small delay endogenous cFOS expression, and starts decaying after 4 hours (Lamothe-Molina et al, 2022). However, the fluorescence was too weak to visualize neurons in the slice (Christine Gee, personal communication), and imaging is perfomed after immunocytochemistry against GFP.</p><p>Therefore, we feel that the name given to the FLEN strategy is legitimate. The features of the FLEN strategy were summarized in the discussion (Lines 318-322).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 214: &quot;...FLEN+ CA3 PNs do not show differences in [...] patterns of bursting activity as compared to control neurons.&quot; It looks quite different to me (Figure 3E). Just because low n precludes meaningful statistical analysis, I would not conclude there is no difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the data in Figure 3E are not conclusive due to small sample size, which limits the reliability of statistical comparison. Additionally, the classification of bursting neurons is highly dependent on the specific criteria used, which vary considerably across the literature. To avoid overinterpretation or misleading conclusions, we decided to remove the panel E of Figure 3 showing the fraction of bursting neurons. Nevertheless, we draw the attention to the more robust and interpretable results: RAM⁺ neurons exhibit an increase in firing frequency and a distinct action potential discharge pattern, data which we believe are informative of altered excitability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 304: Remove the time stamp.</p></disp-quote><p>This was done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Line 334: &quot;...results may be explained by an overall increased activity of CA1 neurons...&quot; I don't understand - isn't CA1 downstream of CA3?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the sentence was misleading. We removed the reference to CA1, as it was more of a general principle about neuronal activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Line 381: &quot;resolutive&quot;, better use &quot;sensitive&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This was changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure S3: Fear-conditioned animals were 3 days off Dox, controls only 2 days. As RAM expression accumulates over time off Dox, this is not a fair comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the incorrect reporting of the experimental design in Figure S3 panel A (bottom), which could lead to misinterpretation of results. In fact, the two groups of mice (CFC vs. HC) underwent all experimental steps in parallel. Specifically, both groups were maintained on and off Doxycycline for the same duration and received viral injection on the same day. 48 hours after Dox withdrawal, the CFC group was trained for contextual conditioning, while the HC group remained in the home cage in the holding room. All animals were thus sacrificed 72 hours after Dox removal. We have corrected the figure to accurately reflect this timeline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Please provide sequence information for c-cFos-ZsGreen1-DR. Which regulatory elements of the cFos promoter are included, is the 5' NTR included? This information is very important.</p></disp-quote><p>The information is now provided in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Please provide the temperature during pharmacological treatments (TTX etc.) before fixation.</p></disp-quote><p>The pharmacological treatment was performed in the incubator at 37°C, this is now indicated in the methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
