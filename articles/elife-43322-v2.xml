reproducibility, and transparent reporting of research. We report here the generation of a novel resource in the form of a library of recombinant R-mAbs validated for neuroscience research. We cloned immunoglobulin G (IgG) variable domains from cryopreserved hybridoma cells and input them into an integrated pipeline for expression and validation of functional R-mAbs. To improve efficiency over standard protocols, we eliminated aberrant Sp2/0-Ag14 hybridoma-derived variable light transcripts using restriction enzyme treatment. Further, we engineered a plasmid backbone that allows for switching of the IgG subclasses without altering target binding specificity to generate R-mAbs useful in simultaneous multiplex labeling experiments not previously possible. The method was also employed to rescue IgG variable sequences and generate functional R-mAbs from a non-viable cryopreserved hybridoma. All R-mAb sequences and plasmids will be archived and disseminated from open source suppliers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43322.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system fights off disease-causing microbes using antibodies: Y-shaped proteins that each bind to a specific foreign molecule. Indeed, these proteins bind so tightly and so specifically that they can pick out a single target in a complex mixture of different molecules. This property also makes them useful in research. For example, neurobiologists can use antibodies to mark target proteins in thin sections of brain tissue. This reveals their position inside brain cells, helping to link the structure of the brain to the roles the different parts of this structure perform.</p><p>To use antibodies in this way, scientists need to be able to produce them in large quantities without losing their target specificity. The most common way to do this is with cells called hybridomas. A hybridoma is a hybrid of an antibody-producing immune cell and a cancer cell, and it has properties of both. From the immune cell, it inherits the genes to make a specific type of antibody. From the cancer cell, it inherits the ability to go on dividing forever. In theory, hybridomas should be immortal antibody factories, but they have some limitations. They are expensive to keep alive, hard to transport between labs, and their genes can be unstable. Problems can creep into their genetic code, halting their growth or changing the targets their antibodies recognize. When this happens, scientists can lose vital research tools.</p><p>Instead of keeping the immune cells alive, an alternative approach is to make recombinant antibodies. Rather than store the whole cell, this approach just stores the parts of the genes that encode antibody target-specificity. Andrews et al. set out to convert a valuable toolbox of neuroscience antibodies into recombinant form. This involved copying the antibody genes from a large library of preserved hybridoma cells. However, many hybridomas also carry genes that produce non-functional antibodies. A step in the process removed these DNA sequences, ensuring that only working antibodies made it into the final library. Using frozen cells made it possible to recover antibody genes from hybridoma cells that could no longer grow.</p><p>The recombinant DNA sequences provide a permanent record of useful antibodies. Not only does this prevent the loss of research tools, it is also much more shareable than living cells. Modifications to the DNA sequences in the library allow for the use of many antibodies at once. This could help when studying the interactions between different molecules in the brain. Toolkits like these could also make it easier to collaborate, and to reproduce data gathered by different researchers around the world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antibodies</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24 NS050606</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24 NS092991</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24 NS109113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimmer</surname><given-names>James S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>This paper describes an effective pipeline for conversion of conventional monoclonal antibodies into recombinant form that results in an IgG subclass switch that greatly expands their utility for multiplex labeling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibodies (Abs) are the workhorses of biomedical research. Enhancing the research community’s access to extensively validated Abs remains an important goal of antibody developers in both academia and industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taussig et al., 2018</xref>). This has been the topic of a number of recent conferences and commentaries, led to changes in journal practices as related to transparent reporting of antibody-based research including the use of Research Resource Identifiers or RRIDs, and resulted in large-scale NIH and EU Ab development initiatives (<italic>e.g.</italic>, the NIH Common Fund Protein Capture Reagent Program, the EU Affinomics Program). It is widely recognized that production of Abs in a renewable form, such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), represents a substantial advance over polyclonal Abs from antisera that are available in finite quantity, and that comprise a heterogeneous and less definable population of Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harlow and Lane, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Greenfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Busby et al., 2016</xref>). Having mAbs available in recombinant form as recombinant mAbs (R-mAbs) offers numerous additional advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015</xref>). Recombinant expression systems allow for the reliable production of an R-mAb not prone to loss by genetic instability of tetra- or hexa-ploid hybridoma cells or other factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreeff et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, unlike hybridoma cell lines that can express multiple functional heavy and light immunoglobulin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zack et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blatt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradbury et al., 2018</xref>), recombinant expression ensures production of a single, molecularly defined R-mAb. Recombinant expression can also yield production levels hundreds or even thousands of times higher than is possible with endogenous expressions of mAbs from hybridoma cells (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Backliwal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kunert and Reinhart, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the cloning of R-mAbs provides for permanent, dependable and inexpensive archiving of the R-mAb as plasmid DNA and nucleic acid sequences versus an archiving system relying on expensive cryopreservation of hybridoma cell lines in liquid nitrogen, and their subsequent recovery as viable cell cultures. The conversion of existing mAbs to R-mAbs also allows for more effective dissemination of R-mAbs as plasmids, bacterial stocks or as DNA sequences. However, in spite of these advantages, it remains that many mAbs used for research are produced by hybridomas in culture.</p><p>Modern techniques employing Abs as immunolabels [<italic>e.g.</italic>, immunoblotting (IB), immunocytochemistry (ICC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC)] utilize multiplexing of numerous Abs to simultaneously detect multiple targets within a single cell or tissue sample. This allows for direct comparison of the relative amounts and respective characteristics of multiple target molecules within the same sample, while reducing the number of samples needed to accomplish a comprehensive analysis. Typically, the individual primary Abs bound to the sample are detected with secondary antibodies conjugated to distinct reporters, most commonly organic fluorescent dyes, although enzymes, gold particles, etc. are also routinely employed as detection modalities. Multiplex labeling is often accomplished using Abs raised in distinct species, with their subsequent individual detection accomplished using species-specific secondary antibodies. However, mouse mAbs offer an important advantage for multiplex labeling procedures. Each mouse mAb is a single immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype, generally of the IgG class and if so specifically of a single IgG subclass, most commonly IgG1, IgG2a or IgG2b. Mouse mAbs of distinct IgG subclasses can be robustly, reliably and specifically detected with commercial subclass-specific secondary antibodies, and, as such, can be multiplexed in a manner analogous to Abs from different species (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekele-Arcuri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rhodes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rasband et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2012</xref>). One limitation to greater adoption of this approach is that mouse mAb collections generally have an extremely high representation (≈70%) of IgG1 mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2012</xref>), which limits the flexibility of multiplex labeling. The conversion of mAbs into R-mAbs allows for their subsequent engineering into forms with properties distinct from their parent mAb, as is routinely done to impact diverse aspects, including target binding affinity, of therapeutic R-mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kennedy et al., 2018</xref>). Such engineering could also include switching the heavy chain constant region to impact subclass-specific secondary Ab binding specificity, an approach similar to that used to successfully modify subclass-specific in vivo effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>There are numerous routes to obtaining validated R-mAbs, including their de novo generation from high complexity immune repertoire libraries produced from naïve or immunized animals, combined with selection of target-specific R-mAbs by in vitro display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradbury et al., 2011</xref>). Alternatively, R-mAbs can be generated from existing hybridoma cell lines, which express well-characterized mAbs (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2010</xref>). Here we undertook conversion of a widely used collection of hybridoma-generated mAbs extensively validated for neuroscience research applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekele-Arcuri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rhodes and Trimmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2016</xref>) into recombinant form. We developed a coherent pipeline of protocols for effective cloning of intact R-mAbs from cryopreserved hybridoma cells and their subsequent validation compared to their parent mAbs. Further, we developed a process to engineer these R-mAbs to IgG subclass-switched forms that provide additional utility for multiplex labeling employing mouse IgG subclass-specific secondary Abs. This approach is feasible and relatively inexpensive for any laboratory that uses standard molecular biology and mammalian cell culture techniques. This approach also represents a reliable method to convert valuable cryopreserved hybridoma collections to the immortalized form of a DNA sequence archive, including hybridomas that are no longer viable in cell culture.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effective cloning of immunoglobulin V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> regions from cryopreserved hybridomas and generation of R-mAbs</title><p>We previously generated a large library of mouse mAbs that have been extensively validated for efficacy and specificity for immunolabeling endogenous target proteins in mammalian brain samples in immunoblotting (IB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekele-Arcuri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rhodes and Trimmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we undertook the systematic conversion of a sizable subset of this existing mAb collection to R-mAbs. We developed an innovative pipeline for R-mAb cloning, expression and validation. For the cloning steps, we built upon a previously described method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Müller-Sienerth et al., 2014</xref>) to clone IgG V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> region sequences, but with the modification that we cloned directly from cryopreserved hybridomas, without the need for their labor-intensive recovery into cell culture. Our overall cloning strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) employs PCR-mediated amplification to generate IgG V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> region sequences from hybridoma-derived cDNA, followed by PCR-based fusion of these V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> regions with a joining fragment that contains a subset of the elements needed for high level expression of R-mAbs from transfected mammalian cell lines. The product of this fusion PCR reaction is then inserted into a plasmid containing the remainder of the elements for propagation in bacteria and expression of intact heavy and light chains in, and secretion of R-mAbs from transfected mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43322.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the R-mAb pipeline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of cloning, expression and validation pipeline.

PCR-mediated fusion of these three elements is followed by their insertion into the p1316 plasmid that contains an upstream CMV promoter for light chain expression, and an ER signal/leader sequence (<bold>L</bold>) for translocation of the light chain across the ER membrane.

Following NotI/AscI restriction digestion to verify the correct insert size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), these plasmid clones were subjected to further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), including expression in mammalian cells, and R-mAb validation and sequencing as detailed in the subsequent sections.</p><p>While a number of <italic>bona fide</italic> R-mAbs were isolated using this approach, we found a high degree of variability in the number of colony PCR- and restriction enzyme digest- verified positive plasmids that yielded functional expression. A major obstacle in cloning functionally rearranged IgG sequences from many mouse hybridomas is the presence of an aberrant kappa IgG light chain transcript expressed by the Sp2/0-Ag14 (Sp2/0) hybridoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll et al., 1988</xref>) that frequently serves as a ‘myeloma’ partner for fusion with mouse splenocytes to generate mAb-producing hybridomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shulman et al., 1978</xref>), and that was used as the fusion partner in all of our mAb generation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekele-Arcuri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2016</xref>). The source of this non-productive IgG light chain is the MOPC-21 myeloma cell line used to generate the Sp2/0 hybridoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shulman et al., 1978</xref>). As we experienced, and as previously reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carroll et al., 1988</xref>), aberrant chain mRNA expression varies greatly among distinct hybridoma cell lines but in certain cases can exceed the levels of functional light chain transcripts. For certain of our projects, this resulted in &gt;90% of the colony PCR positive clones failing to produce detectable levels of functional R-mAbs, thus necessitating a high volume of screening.</p><p>As such, we sought to eliminate this aberrant light chain during the cloning process. We treated the V<sub>L</sub> PCR products with the restriction enzyme BciVI. The restriction site for this enzyme is present in the V<sub>L</sub> region of the aberrant Sp2/0-derived transcript, but is predicted to occur at a low frequency in functional mouse V<sub>L</sub> kappa sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Juste et al., 2006</xref>). We used V<sub>L</sub> PCR products derived from the Sp2/0 cell line and from pooled BALB/c mouse splenocytes as positive and negative controls, respectively, for sensitivity to BciVI digestion. Due to the exclusive presence of aberrant light chain in Sp2/0 cells, V<sub>L</sub> PCR products from these cells were completely digested, as shown by the decreased size of the V<sub>L</sub> PCR products from ≈360 bp typical of V<sub>L</sub> PCR products (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for examples) to the ≈180 bp fragment that results from BciVI digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the sample prepared from the pooled mouse splenocytes was not detectably affected by BciVI digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Treatment of V<sub>L</sub> PCR products from various Sp2/0-derived hybridomas with BciVI resulted in varying degrees of digestion, yielding different proportions of the bands representing the intact V<sub>L</sub> PCR product of ≈360 bp and the cleaved aberrant SP2/0-derived V<sub>L</sub> fragment of ≈180 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). After BciVI digestion was incorporated into the protocol, DNA sequencing of 149 colony PCR-positive clones from 26 different hybridomas revealed that only 12 (8%) still contained the aberrant V<sub>k</sub> light chain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In certain cases, digestion of hybridoma V<sub>L</sub> PCR products resulted in fragments of unexpected sizes (see the K58/35 lane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating, as predicted by an earlier bioinformatics analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Juste et al., 2006</xref>), that in rare cases (in our hands, 3/248 clones pursued to this step) the BciVI restriction site was also present in these functionally rearranged splenocyte-derived V<sub>L</sub> genes. As such, we attempted to clone these V<sub>L</sub> PCR products without BciVI treatment. As one example, the splenocyte-derived V<sub>k</sub> light chain PCR products from the K58/35 hybridoma were sensitive to BciVI digestion, which necessitated their cloning in the absence of the BciVI digestion step. This project yielded somewhat lower frequency of clones that produced functional R-mAbs able to detect target antigen (≈37%) than, on average, those containing splenocyte-derived V<sub>L</sub> PCR products refractory to BciVI digestion (≈48%; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For the bulk of mAbs encoded by splenocyte-derived V<sub>L</sub> PCR products resistant to BciVI digestion, ligations were performed following BciVI digestion, and 10–14 candidate clones that were colony PCR-positive were selected. Plasmid DNA was digested with AscI/NotI restriction enzymes to confirm the correct insert (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). On average, ≈93% of all clones subjected to restriction analysis passed this screening step.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43322.005</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Aberrant V<sub>L</sub> sequences remaining after BciVI digestion.</title><p>Table delineates for specific mAb cloning projects the total number of clones sequenced, and the number of sequenced clones with V<sub>L</sub> chains corresponding to the Sp2/0-Ag14 hybridoma-derived aberrant V<sub>L</sub> transcript.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>mAb</th><th>Number of clones sequenced</th><th>Number of clones with aberrant chain</th><th>% with aberrant chain</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>K7/45</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>K9/40</td><td>7</td><td>2</td><td>28.6</td></tr><tr><td>K13/31</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>K14/16.2</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>K14/16.2.1</td><td>9</td><td>2</td><td>22.2</td></tr><tr><td>K17/70</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>16.7</td></tr><tr><td>K28/86</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>K36/15</td><td>6</td><td>1</td><td>16.7</td></tr><tr><td>K74/71</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>K75/41</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>K87A/10</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>L6/60</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>L21/32</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>L23/27</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>L61/14</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>14.3</td></tr><tr><td>N59/20</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>N70/28</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>N86/8</td><td>8</td><td>2</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>N86/38</td><td>22</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>N100/13</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>N103/31</td><td>4</td><td>1</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>N103/39</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>N105/13</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>N106/36</td><td>6</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>N116/14</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>N297/59</td><td>7</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td><bold>Total</bold></td><td>149</td><td>12</td><td>8.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>We next transfected the colony PCR and restriction digest-validated plasmids into COS-1 cells and after a 3 to 6 day incubation, tested the conditioned culture media for production of target-specific R-mAbs. While the parent mAbs had previously been validated for efficacy and specificity in a variety of applications (IF-ICC, IB and IHC on brain samples), we selected the IF-ICC assay in transiently transfected heterologous cells for R-mAb validation. This method was chosen because it is high-throughput, employing 96 well microtiter plates, it requires only a small amount of R-mAb sample, and the robust difference between target-expressing and non-expressing cells in the same sample allows for sensitivity and clarity of results. Importantly, each of the parent mAbs had been previously validated in this procedure. We took advantage of the fact that in most cases we switched the IgG subclass during conversion of the hybridoma-derived mAb into the corresponding R-mAb, allowing for their separate detection by subclass-specific secondary Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2012</xref>). This assay involved expressing the full-length target protein in transiently transfected COS-1 cells cultured in individual wells of a black polystyrene 96 well clear bottom plate that allows for microscopic visual analysis and imaging using indirect immunofluorescence. For each of 1 to 15 R-mAb candidate clones to be assayed from a given project, a set of replicate wells were prepared expressing the given target protein. After fixation and permeabilization, the individual wells were then immunolabeled with either the hybridoma-generated mAb alone, the R-mAb alone, or the mAb and R-mAb together. Each well was subsequently incubated with a cocktail of the two distinct subclass-specific secondary Abs, one specific for the respective mAb and one specific for the subclass-switched R-mAb mouse IgG subclasses, and both conjugated to spectrally distinct Alexa Fluors. The ‘mAb only’ well was used to demonstrate that the target protein was expressed in a subset of the transiently transfected cells, and that the only detectable secondary Ab labeling was for the IgG subclass of the parent hybridoma-generated mAb. Similarly, the 'R-mAb only' wells were used to show that the R-mAb labeled a comparable number of cells, and that the only detectable secondary Ab labeling was for the IgG subclass of the subclass-switched R-mAb. The wells containing both the parent mAb and candidate R-mAb were used to show that the mAb and R-mAb gave indistinguishable labeling patterns at both the cellular and subcellular level and could be detected separately using subclass-specific secondary Abs. Numerous examples of this assay are shown in the following sections focusing on specific R-mAb projects. We note that only in rare cases was the labeling for one or both secondaries noticeably depressed in the well containing both mAb and R-mAb relative to the wells with these primary antibodies alone, as would occur due to competitive binding to the same epitope. However, this was generally not apparent, suggesting that in this assay system, in which the target protein was overexpressed, we were typically operating under conditions of antigen excess.</p><p>In comparing the overall results from 180 recent projects that had BciVI-resistant splenocyte-derived V<sub>L</sub> PCR products, and that were taken through this entire pipeline one time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), we found that a range of 1–15 colony PCR- and restriction digest-positive candidate R-mAbs per project were evaluated in the COS-ICC assay (919 total, mean/project = 5.11 ± 0.23 S.E.M.). For these 180 projects, cloning was performed after BciVI digestion, and all restriction digest-validated candidates were tested for functional mAb production. Of these 180 projects, 72% (129 projects) yielded at least one positive R-mAb on their first pass through the pipeline. A retrospective analysis of these 129 successful projects revealed a range of 1 to 13 restriction digest-validated candidates were evaluated (mean/project = 5.74 ± 0.26 S.E.M.), with an overall success rate of 48.4% for all 741 restriction digest-validated candidate R-mAbs tested. A parallel analysis of the 51 projects that did not yield a positive R-mAb on their first pass through the pipeline revealed a similar range of 1 to 15 restriction digest-validated candidates per project evaluated. However, an overall lower number of colony PCR- and restriction digest-positive candidates were evaluated in the COS-ICC assay (178 total, mean/project = 3.5 ± 0.37 S.E.M.) in these projects than for the successful projects. A statistically significant difference (two-tailed P value = 2.48×10<sup>−6</sup>) existed between the number of candidates evaluated in successful versus unsuccessful projects. The per-project COS-ICC rate success was impacted by number of clones tested. For 1–3 clones tested (66 projects), the project success rate was 50%, for 4–6 (62 projects) it was ≈ 77%, and for ≥7 (52 projects) it was ≈92%. However, the per clone success rate was similar between the three bins (≈ 45% vs. ≈39% vs. ≈ 45%).</p><p>Following validation in the COS-ICC assay, a subset of positive clones for each project was subjected to DNA sequencing. We employed a set of sequencing primers that allowed for determination of sense and antisense strands of the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domain-encoding cDNA inserts that were unique to each R-mAb. The sequences were searched against the NCBI database, and against a custom database that contained the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domain sequences of the parent P1316 plasmid, the V<sub>L</sub> domain of the aberrant Sp2/0 cell line, and the V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domain sequences of all of the R-mAbs we had cloned to date. The set of COS-ICC validated R-mAb plasmids derived from a single hybridoma that had matching sequences unique from any sequences in the custom database were subsequently archived as frozen plasmid DNA and bacterial glycerol stocks, and their sequence used as the archival sequence of that particular R-mAb.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Effective cloning and IgG subclass switching of a widely used monoclonal antibody</title><p>We initiated our R-mAb cloning efforts with the K28/43 mAb, a mouse mAb specific for the neural scaffolding protein PSD-95. This mAb is widely used as a marker of excitatory synapses (<italic>e.g.</italic>, as of 1/1/19 ≈520 publications have cited the use of the K28/43 mAb as obtained from the UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility alone). While the K28/43 mAb is already of a less common IgG subclass (IgG2a), generating a subclass switched version with an alternate IgG subclass would provide greater flexibility in its use in multiplex labeling experiments, and also provide proof of concept that we could use our process to effectively generate subclass switched R-mAbs with efficacy and specificity comparable to the parent mAb. We generated V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub> domain cDNA fragments from the cryopreserved K28/43 hybridoma and cloned them into the original P1316 plasmid that contains a mouse IgG1 C<sub>H</sub> domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2010</xref>). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the resultant plasmids. We evaluated the conditioned medium from the transfected cells for the presence of the subclass-switched K28/43R IgG1 R-mAb by ICC against fixed and permeabilized transiently transfected COS-1 cells expressing full-length PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We note that we have designated the recombinant R-mAb versions of each of our mAbs by a capital ‘R’ after the clone designation, in this case the R-mAb cloned from the K28/43 hybridoma is designated K28/43R. We screened the COS-1 cell-generated R-mAbs for functional R-mAb immunoreactivity in the 96-well IF-ICC assay detailed in the previous section. After primary antibody labeling, all wells received both IgG1- and IgG2a-subclass-specific, fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, as expected, the sample receiving only the native K28/43 hybridoma-generated mAb exhibited a signal corresponding to the IgG2a subclass-specific secondary Ab (red) with no detectable signal for the IgG1 subclass-specific secondary Ab (green). Conversely, labeling with the K28/43R R-mAb alone produced only an IgG1 subclass-specific green signal demonstrating a successful IgG subclass switch for the R-mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Simultaneous multiplex labeling with the hybridoma-generated mAb and a positive R-mAb resulted in an identical pattern of immunolabeling at the cellular level in the specific cells recognized, and at the subcellular level as to the pattern of immunolabeling within the labeled cells, as shown by the uniform hue of the signal in the merged panel, indicating that both the mAb and R-mAb were recognizing the same target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We next performed multiplex immunofluorescent IHC on adult mouse brain sections with the K28/43 mAb and the K28/43R R-mAb. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, as detected with secondary Abs specific for their respective mouse IgG subclasses, the signal from these two primary antibodies was indistinguishable in its laminar and subcellular pattern in cerebellar cortex, consistent with previous studies of PSD-95 (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kistner et al., 1993</xref>). Both signals were especially intense in the terminal pinceau of basket cells located adjacent to the Purkinje cell layer, and both signals were also present in the molecular layer, and for the most part lacking in the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This demonstrates that consistent with the validation in heterologous COS-1 cells expressing exogenous PSD-95, the K28/43 R-mAb can be used reliably for multiplex immunolabeling of endogenous PSD-95 in brain sections.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43322.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Validation of subclass-switched anti-PSD-95 K28/43R R-mAb.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Validation of the K28/43R R-mAb in heterologous cells.

Both the IgG1 and IgG2a subclass isoforms of the K28/43R R-mAb gave identical immunolabeling patterns against samples from rat brain and COS-1 cells overexpressing PSD-95.

Generating R-mAbs employing the efficient V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> cloning approach developed by Gavin Wright and colleagues includes their subsequent insertion into an expression plasmid that yields R-mAbs of the mouse IgG1 subclass due to the presence of the mouse γ1 C<sub>H</sub> domain in the plasmid backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2010</xref>). To generate R-mAbs of less common mouse IgG subclasses, we modified this plasmid by replacing the γ1 C<sub>H</sub> domain with a mouse γ2a C<sub>H</sub> domain. We amplified the γ2a C<sub>H</sub> domain sequence from cDNA generated from the hybridomas producing the K28/43 IgG2a mAb and then replaced the γ1 C<sub>H</sub> domain present in the K28/43R plasmid with this γ2a C<sub>H</sub> domain using standard cloning. This plasmid was sequenced verified and validated for expression of a K28/43R R-mAb of the IgG2a subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>We subsequently used this plasmid as the target cloning vector for generation and expression of numerous R-mAb plasmids encoding functional IgG2a R-mAbs.

Toward this end, we have successfully cloned and validated as functional R-mAbs a total of 178 mAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This includes 148 mAbs of distinct subclasses converted to IgG2a R-mAbs (125 IgG1, 21 IgG2b, and 3 IgG3), and 29 IgG2a mAbs that were retained in their native IgG subclass (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Like the corresponding mAb, K58/35 R-mAb gives robust labeling of Nav channels concentrated on the axon initial segment (AIS, arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> main panel), and at nodes of Ranvier (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> insets). Importantly, subclass switching allowed Nav channel labeling at nodes to be verified by co-labeling with K65/35 an IgG1 subclass antibody directed against CASPR, a protein concentrated at paranodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Menegoz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peles et al., 1997</xref>). Similarly, simultaneous labeling for the highly-related GABA-A receptor β1 and β3 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 1991</xref>) with their widely used respective mAbs N96/55 and N87/25 could not be performed as both are IgG1 subclass. Switching the N96/55 mAb to the IgG2a N96/55R R-mAb allowed simultaneous detection of these two highly-related but distinct GABA-A receptor subunits. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> localization of GABA-A receptor β1 and β3 subunits appeared completely non-overlapping in separate layers of cerebellum. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> illustrates localization of protein Kv2.1 and AnkyrinG in separate subcellular neuronal compartments. Labeling for the K89/34R R-mAb (IgG2a, red), specific for the Kv2.1 channel, highly expressed in the plasma membrane of the cell body and proximal dendrites (arrows in panel C1) is shown together with labeling for N106/65 (green), an IgG1 mAb specific for AnkyrinG, a scaffolding protein highly expressed in the AIS (arrows in panel C2) and at nodes of Ranvier. Subclass switching N229A/32 (IgG1, GABA-AR α6) to IgG2a, allows comparison with Kv4.2 potassium channel (K57/1, IgG1) in the cerebellum where both are highly expressed in the granule cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). While both are prominently found in the glomerular synapses present on the dendrites of these cells, simultaneous labeling reveals that some cells express both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, magenta) while others appear to predominantly express Kv4.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, blue). Labeling for both proteins is in contrast to that for mAb N147/6 (IgG2b) which recognizes all isoforms of the QKI transcription factor and labels oligodendrocytes within the granule cell layer and throughout the Purkinje cell layer (PCL, green). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, localization of pan-QKI (N147/6, IgG2b, blue) is compared with GFAP (N206A/8, IgG1, green) predominantly thought to be in astrocytes. Surprisingly many (but not all) cells co-label both proteins. We also labeled cortical neurons with these two mAbs (pan-QKI in blue, GFAP in green). Multiplex labeling for the neuron-specific Kv2.1 channel, using subclass-switched K89/34R (IgG2a, red) confirms non-neuronal localization of both proteins. Lastly, we labeled for the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-93 using R-mAb N18/30R (IgG2a, red), which in the cerebellum is prominently localized to Purkinje cell somata and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenman et al., 1998</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, the R-mAb labeling is consistent with the established localization of PSD-93. Because of subclass switching the N18/30R R-mAb, this labeling can now be contrasted with labeling for the excitatory presynaptic terminal marker VGluT1, labeled with mAb N28/9 (IgG1, blue), which exhibits robust labeling of parallel fiber synapses in the molecular layer, and glomerular synapses in the granule cell layer.

As the method described here for cloning of V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domain sequences from cryopreserved hybridomas does not require expansion of cells in culture prior to RNA extraction, we speculated that it may be possible to use this approach to generate functional R-mAbs from even those hybridoma cell lines that are no longer viable in cell culture.</p><p>We had in our cryopreserved hybridoma archive a hybridoma cell line that produced the D3/71 mAb.

The D3/71 mAb has particular value in binding at a site distinct from other anti-Kv2.1 mAbs, which unlike most other available anti-Kv2.1 mAbs (and pAbs), remains intact in truncated isoforms of Kv2.1 found in patients with severe neurodevelopmental disorders linked to de novo frameshift or nonsense mutations in the KCNB1 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Kovel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marini et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike our experience with other cryopreserved hybridomas in our collection, when we attempted to resuscitate this cryopreserved hybridoma cell line over 20 years after it was cryopreserved, the D3/71 hybridoma cells were no longer viable. We extracted RNA from a cryopreserved vial of D3/71 hybridoma cells in an attempt to generate a functional D3/71R R-mAb. Cloning was performed as described above including amplification of D3/71 V<sub>H</sub> and V<sub>L</sub> domain cDNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>) and their insertion into the mouse IgG2a expression plasmid. Most of the bacterial colonies tested (20/24) were positive for the insert by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and subsequent restriction analysis of 12 of these positive clones confirmed that they each contained the full-length V<sub>L</sub>-joining fragment-V<sub>H</sub> cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We next tested whether these plasmids encoded functional D3/71R R-mAb in the COS-1-ICC assay, using a distinct native anti-Kv2.1 IgG1 mAb K89/34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Misonou et al., 2004</xref>) and the subclass-switched K89/34R R-mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) as controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mandikian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>). A subset of the recovered and subclass-switched D3/71R R-mAbs were positive in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, the D3/71R R-mAb exhibits immunolabeling of endogenous Kv2.1 in neurons in mouse neocortex that recapitulates the previously established pattern of Kv2.1 immunolabeling in these neurons (<italic>e.g.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Trimmer, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rhodes et al., 1995</xref>) and that overlaps precisely with simultaneous immunolabeling obtained with the native K89/34 mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The D3/71R R-mAb also yields an immunoreactive band on immunoblots similar to that obtained with K89/34 and K89/34R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Our approach was adapted from that of Gavin Wright and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2010</xref>) with modifications to facilitate higher throughput cloning and validation steps. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by restriction digest of V<sub>L</sub> PCR products to eliminate the MOPC-21 derived aberrant light chain. R-mAbs were produced in the culture medium from transiently transfected cells under standard mammalian cell culture conditions in sufficient quantities that they did not require purification for effective use in IB, ICC, and IHC assays. We were also able to recover functional R-mAbs from a cryopreserved hybridoma cell line that was no longer viable in cell culture <italic>via</italic> RNA extraction, cloning and expression. Moreover, in the process we generated subclass-switched R-mAbs that are more amenable to multiplex labeling in IB, ICC, and IHC applications. We then employed these mAbs in multiplex IHC experiments in combinations that were not possible prior to their cloning and expression as subclass-switched R-mAbs. Using the method described here, most researchers with standard molecular biology expertise can generate functional R-mAb expression plasmids with the advantages associated with recombinant reagents from their own cryopreserved hybridomas, whether viable or non-viable. Moreover, producing R-mAbs from cells transfected with any of the large collection of expression plasmids whose generation is described here is within the reach of anyone with standard mammalian cell culture capabilities.</p><p>We previously undertook a systematic analysis of anti-mouse IgG subclass-specific secondary antibodies and demonstrated that the use of mouse mAbs of different IgG subclasses in combination with anti-mouse IgG subclass-specific secondary antibodies for simultaneous multiplex immunolabeling allows for robust and specific labeling in several immunolabeling applications, and also provides enhanced signal-to-noise (background) in immunolabeling of brain samples when compared to generic anti-mouse IgG (H + L) secondary Abs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekele-Arcuri et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rhodes et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lim et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rasband et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2012</xref>). Simultaneous multiplex labeling of multiple targets within a single sample allows for better comparison of their relative levels, co-localization, and overall tissue architecture. Multiplex labeling also conserves valuable samples, as multiple targets can be interrogated in the same sample instead of across multiple samples, which can be a particular concern in studies using human tissue samples that may be available in limited quantity. However, multiplex labeling using the classical approach of employing primary Abs raised in different species and their subsequent detection with species-specific secondary Abs is highly limited by the lack of available Abs from numerous species. As one example, interrogating the Abs registered with the Antibody Registry (2,381,068 as of 9/9/18) shows a preponderance (84% in total) of Abs raised in only three species: rabbits (44.6%), mice (31.2%) and goats (8.2%), with all other species together accounting for the remaining 16%. Among the predominant species, goat Abs are exclusively polyclonal and as such cannot be used with one another in simultaneous multiplex labeling. Moreover, the bulk of secondary Abs are raised in goats, constraining facile detection of primary Abs in multiplex labeling experiments employing goat primary Abs. Rabbit Abs (whether poly- or mono-clonal) have limited utility for multiplex labeling, as unlike most other mammals, rabbits do not make IgGs of distinct subclasses but only a single generic IgG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knight et al., 1985</xref>). As such employing multiple goat or rabbit primary Abs for multiplex immunolabeling involves costly and time-consuming procedures such as direct labeling with different fluorophores or sequential multiplexing technologies such as Opal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stack et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the utility of mouse mAbs (and less common rat mAbs) for simultaneous multiple immunolabeling is enhanced by the availability of subclass-specific secondary antibodies, it remains that mouse mAbs against any given target may be available in only a single IgG subclass. In general, mouse mAb collections reflect the representation of these subclasses in the circulating serum IgGs in immunized BALB/c mice, which is ≈70% IgG1, ≈20% IgG2a and ≈10% IgG2b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Natsuume-Sakai et al., 1977</xref>). As a prominent example, the large mouse mAb catalog of ThermoFisher Scientific (10,992 independent IgG mouse mAbs as of 6/28/18) follows this remarkably closely, comprising 69% IgG1, 18% IgG2a and 12% IgG2b (Matt Baker, ThermoFisher Scientific, personal communication). As such, the flexibility of using mouse mAbs in multiplex labeling is restricted by the prevalence of those of the IgG1 subclass. It is possible to selectively screen for mAbs of the rarer IgG2a and IgG2b subclasses of mouse IgGs in the process of their development and screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). It is also possible, although labor-intensive, to manipulate hybridomas in culture and select and/or screen for subclass switched hybridoma-generated mAbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Faguet and Agee, 1993</xref>). However, it remains that the optimal utility of mouse mAbs in research and diagnostics is limited by the preponderance of IgG1 mAbs. Here, we have enhanced the flexibility of a substantial fraction of an existing library of widely used mouse mAbs by converting them to subclass-switched R-mAbs without altering target binding specificity. We show using mixtures of mAbs and R-mAb that we can obtain effective simultaneous multiplex labeling for combinations that were previously unattainable due to conflicting IgG subclass.</p><p>Antibody reformatting in our system is easily accomplished by the choice of plasmid backbone used for the original cloning, or by subcloning the V<sub>L</sub>-joining fragment-V<sub>H</sub> cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) between plasmids with distinct C<sub>H</sub> domains. Ultimately, one can envision using this approach to convert any mouse mAb into the corresponding set of mouse IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b subclass R-mAb expression plasmids. Multiplex labeling could be further expanded by constructing IgG expression vectors containing C<sub>H</sub> regions of other species that have IgG subclasses such as rat and human (but not rabbit, in which all IgG Abs are of a generic IgG class), for which subclass-specific secondary antibodies are also widely available. For example, we interrogated the ThermoFisher secondary Ab catalog, which contains 52 different IgG subclass-specific secondary antibodies for mouse IgG subclasses, 47 for rat IgG subclasses, and 43 for human IgG subclasses. Together, the wide availability of such a broad range of reliable secondary antibodies with distinct conjugates provides ample flexibility for specific detection of multiple R-mAbs with distinct C<sub>H</sub> regions engineered for separate detection in multiplex labeling experiments.</p><p>Previous attempts by others to generate R-mAbs have been complicated by the MOPC-21 derived aberrant kappa light chain that is present in many widely used myeloma fusion partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cochet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan and Pomerantz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2004</xref>). For example, Crosnier et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crosnier et al., 2010</xref>) showed that depending on the hybridoma, 26% to 70% of R-mAb plasmids they generated contained this aberrant sequence. We have incorporated a simple restriction enzyme digest into our process to eliminate the aberrant kappa light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Juste et al., 2006</xref>). For most of our hybridomas, the majority of the V<sub>L</sub> PCR product was cleaved by BciVI, indicating that the MOPC-21 aberrant light chain comprised the greatest fraction of total light chain amplicons. By eliminating this transcript, the overall screening and cloning burden for each mAb was reduced substantially. However, depending on the particular hybridoma, the efficiency of generating clones that produced functional R-mAbs even after BciVI digestion of the V<sub>L</sub> domain PCR products was still highly variable. This was evidenced by the overall efficiency of slightly below 50% for the successful projects tabulated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, and also by the projects that were unsuccessful on the first pass in which clones passed the colony PCR and restriction digest screening steps but failed in the COS-ICC screening assay for functional R-mAbs. Moreover, a lack of allelic exclusion at heavy and light chain IgG loci has been documented in hybridomas, resulting in expression of multiple IgG heavy and/or light chains at the mRNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zack et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blatt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bradbury et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruberti et al., 1994</xref>). In these previous studies, while multiple combinations of heavy and light IgG chains were produced by monoclonal hybridoma cells, only one combination of heavy and light IgG chains present in the hybridoma produced an R-mAb capable of recognizing the target antigen. Varying degrees of allelic exclusion in the hybridomas that served as the source of our R-mAbs could also contribute to the variable efficiency of whether colony PCR and restriction enzyme assay-positive clones would produce an R-mAb that recapitulated immunolabeling obtained with the native mAb. Technical issues, such as PCR-induced mutations may have also contributed to the generation of R-mAb clones that failed in the COS-IF-ICC assay. We did not systematically analyze these negative clones, so we do not know whether these plasmids contain residual aberrant light chains from the BciVI digestion step, plasmids containing other heavy and/or light chains, or mutated forms of <italic>bona fide</italic> R-mAb chains with impaired/lost functionality. That the vast majority (84%) of the 114 projects for which ≥ 4 clones were evaluated yielded at least one positive R-mAb suggests that the presence of a small and variable number of negative clones does not impact the overall success of the approach described here, given the simple but effective nature of microplate screening assays, such as the ICC assay employed here, to rapidly and easily screen candidate R-mAbs.</p><p>There is a growing impetus to enhance research reproducibility by both improving the quality of Abs used in basic research and in diagnostics, and the transparency of their reporting as related to the exact molecularly-defined Ab that was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Taussig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uhlen et al., 2016</xref>). Using mAbs in their recombinant form and defining them unambiguously at the molecular level by publishing their V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub> domain sequences is a step towards achieving this goal and elevate reproducibility world-wide. Among the different forms of research and diagnostic Abs, polyclonal Ab preparations have unique benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ascoli and Aggeler, 2018</xref>), due to the presence of Abs recognizing distinct epitopes on the target protein. However, in any of the diverse forms in which they are available (antiserum, IgG fractions, affinity-purified) polyclonal Abs are inherently limited by their intrinsic lack of precise molecular definition. The inability to rigorously define the clonal composition of specific preparations can contribute to batch-to-batch variation in the efficacy and specificity of the polyclonal collection for any specific application, negatively impacting the reproducibility of research performed with such Abs. Moreover, unlike mAbs, polyclonal Abs are a finite resource whose depletion can lead to batch-to-batch variability or complete lack of availability, stymieing independent reproduction of research using the same reagent. Conventional mAbs are advantageous in lacking the molecular complexity of polyclonal preparations, and in being renewable reagents. However, the conversion of conventional hybridoma-generated mAbs into R-mAbs offers numerous additional advantages. This includes ensuring their broad availability by generating a publicly accessible DNA sequence archive that can be used to synthesize the functional V<sub>L</sub> and V<sub>H</sub> domain sequences. R-mAbs are also more easily distributed as plasmids or DNA sequence, a feature that should enhance dissemination of this resource, relative to the more labile cryopreserved and/or living hybridomas that are less amenable to long-distance transport. Cloning also enhances research reproducibility by the unambiguous definition of mAbs at the level of their cDNA sequence, as well as the enhanced control of molecular composition afforded by expressing a single light and heavy chain combination from transfected cells and their high-level animal-free production in cell culture. Cloning of mAbs also allows for increased utility as offered by their subsequent engineering into alternate forms, such as the subclass-switched R-mAbs generated here. The method described here represents a straightforward approach to producing functional R-mAbs from existing murine hybridomas that could be applied to other valuable mAb collections to ensure their permanent archiving, which cannot be assured when they exist solely in the form of hybridomas cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. In particular, there are many cases of important hybridomas, including entire collections, that have been discarded upon the closure of the laboratory that formerly housed and financially supported the maintenance of the cryopreserved collection. The enhanced utility, permanence, and cost-effectiveness of R-mAbs as generated by the approach described here is one route to circumvent the negative impact to research effectiveness and reproducibility that such losses represent. Simple conversion of mAbs to R-mAbs, as described here, also paves the way for higher throughput approaches, for example those employing high throughput ‘next generation’ sequencing to simultaneously obtain light and heavy chain sequences from large pools of hybridomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). In theory this should allow for larger scale ‘<italic>en masse</italic>’ (as opposed to the mAb-by-mAb approach used here) conversion efforts more suitable to large hybridoma collections.

Primary antibodies were mAb TC supes diluted 1:10, non-diluted R-mAb TC supes, and an in-house anti-PSD-95 rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a GST fusion protein, GSTKAP1.13, containing amino acids 77–299 of human PSD-95 [clone 2, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 1995</xref>)] and that crossreacts with SAP97 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for details of non-R-mAb Abs used in this study). After three washes with Blotto, the membranes were incubated with the appropriate subclass-specific Alexa Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2012</xref>) for 1 hr. After three washes with TBS containing 0.1% v/v Tween-20, the immunoblots were visualized directly on a FluorChem Q imager (Cell Biosciences Cat# DE500-FCQ). Alternatively, crude rat brain membranes (RBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 1994</xref>) were subjected to immunoblotting as described above except that a single RBM sample (3 mg protein) were size fractionated on a curtain gel, and after transfer to nitrocellulose the membrane was cut into 30 strips, each containing 100 μg of RBM protein. Immunolabeling was detected on autoradiography film after treatment of strip immunoblots with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG-specific secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Multiplex immunofluorescence labeling of brain sections</title><p>Multiplex immunofluorescence labeling of rat brain sections was performed essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2015</xref>). All experimental procedures were approved by the UC Davis Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and conform to guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (Fatal-Plus solution, 100 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital) and perfused transcardially with 100 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS), containing 10 units/mL heparin, pH 7.4, followed by 400 mL of 4% formaldehyde (prepared fresh from paraformaldehyde) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer or PB (pH 7.4). The brains were removed, cryoprotected for 48 hr in 30% sucrose, frozen in a bed of pulverized dry ice, and then cut into 30 μm sections on a freezing-stage sliding microtome. Sections were collected in 0.1 M PB and processed immediately for immunohistochemistry. Free-floating brain sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in 0.1 M PB containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (vehicle) for 1 hr at RT and then incubated overnight at 4°C in vehicle containing different combinations of primary antibodies (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> for details of non-R-mAb Abs used in this study). The following day sections were washed 4 × 5 min each with vehicle, and then incubated for 1 hr at RT in mouse IgG subclass-specific or anti-rabbit Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manning et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strassle et al., 2005</xref>). Sections were then washed 2 × 5 min each with 0.1 M PB, 2 × 5 min each with 0.05 M PB and mounted on gelatin-coated microscope slides and air dried. Sections were cover slipped after adding ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific catalog # P36930). Images were obtained on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope with Apotome. Imaging and post-imaging processing was performed in Zeiss Axiovision and Adobe Photoshop software, taking care to maintain any linear differences in signal intensities present in the original samples.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was funded by NIH research grants U24 NS050606, R24 NS092991 and U24 NS109113 to JS Trimmer.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew N Rasband (Reviewer #1); Zoltan Nusser (Reviewer #2); Andrew Chalmers (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. The requested revisions are detailed in the individual reviews and should be straightforward to address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>Much of the biomedical research community depends on the use of antibodies. The quality of the research they produce depends on the quality of the antibodies used. Over the last 25 years the Trimmer lab has been at the forefront of developing high quality and validated monoclonal antibodies for use in neuroscience research. For more than a decade this has been carried out at the NIH-funded neuromab monoclonal antibody resource at UC Davis. This resource has provided high quality, validated antibodies to thousands of scientists in the neuroscience community. This paper represents a remarkable additional step forward; not because of any conceptual advance, but because of a convergence of new technologies that the Trimmer lab has brought to bear on their extensive monoclonal antibody library. This technical advance makes it possible for the rapid and simple dissemination of high quality antibodies – of a variety of subclasses – to any laboratory. This makes it possible for any laboratory to simply acquire the plasmid for their antibody of interest from Addgene, then express the antibody in culture in their own lab. This paper also serves as a paradigm for how a lab can do this on their own, and how to apply the subclass switched R-mAbs. Broader acceptance and application of this strategy of making R-mAbs has the potential to dramatically improve the rigor and reproducibility, as well as reduce the overall costs associated with using antibodies in research.</p><p>I found the manuscript to be very straightforward, with enough detail for others to follow the overall strategy – as would be expected from a tools and resources paper. All experiments are very high quality. The examples of applications of the R-mAbs are also of very high quality. It still surprises me the number of scientists that do not understand how to multiplex experiments using different antibody subclasses. This paper emphasizes how the use of R-mAbs can dramatically and easily expand the repertoire of subclasses, effectively increasing the number of tools available to the investigator.</p><p>I think this paper is very appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as a 'tools and resources' paper. I have no major suggestions – only one minor suggestion for improved presentation. The blue channels are very difficult to seeing Figures 3A, 3C, and 6A and 6B. Perhaps the authors could think about using gray scale for the blue channels?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript describes a workflow of how to transfer monoclonal Abs (mAbs) to recombinant Abs (R-mAbs). In the past decades, the authors developed a large number of mAbs against various proteins expressed in the CNS, which became widely used tools in neuroscience. Most of their mAbs are extensively characterized in WB, ICC and IHC experiments. The authors provide a clear and convincing argument of why it is beneficial for the community to create R-mAbs from their mAbs. In the Results section, the authors describe many technical details regarding their cloning strategy and verifications. These are clearly essential, but the description in the results makes hard to read the manuscript. The reviewer suggests to remove some technical parts from the Results and put a reference to the Materials and methods. The part describing the generation of R-mAb from non-viable hybridoma is also too long and technical.

These methods were used to convert a widely used collection of hybridomas, the converted recombinant antibodies will be made available to the research community and the methods described could be carried out by most labs. This combination of new antibodies and new method has the potential to significantly promote the adoption of recombinant monoclonals which would help the research community due to their advantages, including greater transparency from the availability of the unambiguous sequence, easier archiving and sharing of reagents and improved reproducibility as they represent a molecularly defined reagent that should not be prone to genomic instability induced changes.</p><p>In addition recombinant monoclonals allow for conversion of the clones to new antibodies with distinct properties. This is nicely illustrated in this study as the methods developed allow for switching of the mouse IgG subclass, this makes multi-labelling experiments using subclass specific secondary antibodies possible that were not before, due to limitations in the availability of antibodies of different IgG subclasses. This if very nicely illustrated with a range of multi-labelling experiments.</p><p>Overall, I feel this work has the potential to support a wide range of research fields and warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) I think the panel labelling of Figure 3 might need correcting.

Perhaps the authors could think about using gray scale for the blue channels?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the pure blue in these panels is difficult to see. We have revised the immunocytochemistry panels of these figures (3A, 6A, 6B) to make the tint of the blue much brighter by mixing equal parts blue and white. In our opinion this makes the details of the Hoechst labeling much easier to see without conflict with the red and green antibody labeling, but also retains the blue of the Hoechst dye itself. We changed the single-color blue panels on the immunoblots in panel 3C to pure greyscale, as retaining the blue was not as relevant here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes a workflow of how to transfer monoclonal Abs (mAbs) to recombinant Abs (R-mAbs). In the past decades, the authors developed a large number of mAbs against various proteins expressed in the CNS, which became widely used tools in neuroscience. Most of their mAbs are extensively characterized in WB, ICC and IHC experiments. The authors provide a clear and convincing argument of why it is beneficial for the community to create R-mAbs from their mAbs. In the Results section, the authors describe many technical details regarding their cloning strategy and verifications. These are clearly essential, but the description in the results makes hard to read the manuscript. The reviewer suggests to remove some technical parts from the Results and put a reference to the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that while this is a toolbox article, some of the information in the Results section was redundant with and/or more appropriately presented in the Materials and methods section. As such we have removed/moved material from the Results section that we felt was in this category, such that the revised manuscript has a shorter Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The part describing the generation of R-mAb from non-viable hybridoma is also too long and technical.

In practice, this is more difficult to do accurately as in converting the native mAbs into R-mAbs, we also switched the IgG subclass. This results in a detection bias when probing these antibodies with the same generic secondary that sees all mouse subclasses, and even interferes with precisely determining antibody concentrations in conditioned media/tissue culture supernatants, and we do not yet have pure preps of the R-mAbs. As such while this goal seems easy to achieve in theory, it is more difficult to do well in practice. We are working towards reliable systems for being able to do this routinely, but it will be some time before we have this in place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors describe (subsection “Effective Cloning and IgG Subclass Switching of a Widely Used Monoclonal Antibody”, last paragraph) data shown in Figure 3D and E.

However, the QA, production and QC process at Addgene is quite involved such that to date only 32 of the 92 we submitted have to date been made available. Included in the revised manuscript is a link (https://www.addgene.org/James_Trimmer/) to the section of the Addgene website that will catalog these, which includes the 32 that are currently listed and the others that will appear once they complete this process.

However, many are still native from hybridomas (for example, all of these from DSHB). We have revised the Introduction from “most” to “many” to make this point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
