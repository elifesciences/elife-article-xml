It remains largely unexplored how environmental cues bring about epigenetic fluctuations and affect heterochromatin stability. In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, heterochromatic silencing is quite stable at pericentromeres but unstable at the mating-type (<italic>mat</italic>) locus under chronic heat stress, although both loci are within the major constitutive heterochromatin regions. Here, we found that the compromised gene silencing at the <italic>mat</italic> locus at elevated temperature is linked to the phosphorylation status of Atf1, a member of the ATF/CREB superfamily. Constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling disrupts epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin at the <italic>mat</italic> locus even under normal temperature. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of Atf1 impairs its interaction with heterochromatin protein Swi6<sup>HP1</sup>, resulting in lower site-specific Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> enrichment. Expression of non-phosphorylatable Atf1, tethering Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> to the <italic>mat3M</italic>-flanking site or absence of the anti-silencing factor Epe1 can largely or partially rescue heat stress-induced defective heterochromatic maintenance at the <italic>mat</italic> locus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fission yeast</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin protein Swi6<sup>HP1</sup></kwd><kwd>epigenetic maintenance</kwd><kwd>Atf1</kwd><kwd>MAPK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Quan-wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30871376</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Quan-wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fission yeast loses its heterochromatin stability at mating-type locus under high temperature due to compromised binding between heterochromatin protein Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> and Atf1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes contain two types of chromatin, namely euchromatin and heterochromatin, which are characterized according to their structure and compaction state, and the latter is crucial for regulating the gene expression pattern, cell differentiation, and maintaining genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allshire and Madhani, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloom, 2014</xref>). In the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, RNAi machinery contributes to the establishment of major constitutive heterochromatin at pericentromeres, telomeres, and the silent mating-type region (<italic>mat</italic> locus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martienssen and Moazed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Volpe et al., 2002</xref>). In general, transcripts from heterochromatic regions, such as pericentromeric repeats, were processed into double strand small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by RNase Dicer (Dcr1 in fission yeast) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colmenares et al., 2007</xref>), then siRNAs were loaded to Argonaute (Ago1) to finally form functional RNAi-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex, only containing single-stranded siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Verdel et al., 2004</xref>). The RITS complex can target nascent noncoding RNAs from heterochromatic regions through the single-stranded guide siRNAs and subsequently recruit the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 to establish H3K9me2/3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hong et al., 2005</xref>), which can be bound by heterochromatin protein Swi6 and Chp2 through the conserved N-terminal chromo-domain (CD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jacobs and Khorasanizadeh, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobs et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maison and Almouzni, 2004</xref>). Heterochromatin proteins act as a platform to recruit downstream heterochromatin factors, such as the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Clr3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Motamedi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sugiyama et al., 2007</xref>), to initiate heterochromatin assembly. Once established, H3K9me2/3 can be firmly inherited independent of the mechanisms of heterochromatin establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allshire and Madhani, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Heterochromatin plays an essential role in epigenetic gene silencing in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Epigenetic states of heterochromatin can be stably inherited, but they are also reversible, which is true for not only facultative but also constitutive heterochromatin, and it can be influenced by environmental cues and thus evokes phenotypic variations. Eukaryotic cells are constantly exposed to various environmental stimuli, such as changes in osmotic pressure, oxygen, and temperature. Although the possible impact of the environment on epigenetic regulation has attracted considerable interest, it remains largely unknown how environmental cues bring about epigenetic fluctuations. So far, sporadic studies have demonstrated that heat stress is one of the most prevalent environmental stresses that trigger epigenetic alterations, which may negatively affect early embryonic development in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2023</xref>) and eye color-controlling gene inactivation during early larval development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seong et al., 2011</xref>), or serve as thermosensory input to positively control the rate of vernalization of the flowering plants after winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antoniou-Kourounioti et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feil and Fraga, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Song et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In fission yeast, two redundant pathways contribute to establishment and maintenance of heterochromatin at the endogenous silent mating-type region. These two mechanisms rely on two major <italic>cis</italic> elements <italic>cenH</italic> and <italic>REIII</italic> acting as nucleation centers to recruit the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 via the RNAi machinery and the RNAi-independent ATF/CREB family proteins Atf1/Pcr1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>). The initial nucleation and subsequent spreading of heterochromatin are further facilitated by Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> and HDACs (including Clr3 and Clr6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>). As two major stress-responsive transcription factors, it has been shown that Atf1 and Pcr1 are activated and regulated by Sty1, one of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), in response to high temperature, osmotic, oxidative, and a number of other environmental stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eshaghi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lawrence et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reiter et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it is plausible to assume that Atf1 and Pcr1 have the potential to render the heterochromatin stability at the silent mating-type region to be more resistant to ambient perturbations. However, contrary to this pre-assumption, recent studies demonstrated that the constitutive heterochromatin at centromeres is propagated stably whereas the epigenetic stability at the <italic>mat</italic> locus in vegetatively growing cells is sensitive to being continuously cultured at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickels et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oberti et al., 2015</xref>). It has been established that the protein disaggregase Hsp104 is involved in buffering environmentally induced epigenetic variation at centromeres by dissolving cytoplasmic Dcr1 aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oberti et al., 2015</xref>). However, the reason for the absence of the buffering effect on heterochromatin at mating-type region under similar environmental stress remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, to explore the possible mechanism underlying the lack of epigenetic stability at the mating-type region in fission yeast under high temperature, we systematically performed genetic analyses combined with biochemical characterization. We found that heat stress-induced phosphorylation of Atf1 negatively influences its recruiting capability toward heterochromatin protein Swi6<sup>HP1</sup>, and thus it results in defective Atf1-dependent epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin at the <italic>mat</italic> locus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gene silencing within constitutive heterochromatin at the <italic>mat</italic> locus is unstable under heat stress</title><p>To examine the stability of heterochromatin under environmental stresses, we first tested the robustness of heterochromatic silencing when cells were grown at 37°C, which is above the permissive temperature for <italic>S. pombe</italic> and causes acute temperature stress. We employed <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains with an <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter gene placed within two major constitutive heterochromatic regions, represented by pericentromere of chromosome I (<italic>otr1R::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic>) and the mating-type region of chromosome II (<italic>mat3M::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells with repressed <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> within heterochromatic region gave rise to red colonies under limiting adenine conditions and failed to grow on medium without adenine, whereas de-repressed <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> allowed cells to form white colonies or vigorous growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Consistent with previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oberti et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>otr1R::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> cells formed almost fully red colonies at all tested temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In contrast, <italic>mat3M::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> cells gave rise to variegated colonies or white colonies with low degrees of redness, or even were able to grow on medium without adenine at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

These results are consistent with recent reports that heterochromatin at pericentromere is largely maintained and that at the <italic>mat</italic> locus seems to be unstable under heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greenstein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickels et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oberti et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Heat stress leads to gene silencing defects at the mating-type region.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of an <italic>ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter gene inserted into mating-type region and pericentromeric region.

We provided a few lines of evidence to support the idea that phosphorylation of Atf1 by MAPK in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is directly responsible for defective heterochromatin assembly at the <italic>mat</italic> locus under heat stress. First, non-phosphorylatable Atf1 (i.e. Atf1(10A/I)) is indeed more abundantly loaded at both the mating-type region and other Atf1 targets at euchromatic loci than wild type Atf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), which efficiently maintains the enrichment of H3K9me3 and Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> and its binding affinity with Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Second, much reduced binding between phosphomimetic Atf1 (i.e. Atf1(10D/E)) and Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> can be similarly detected between wild type Atf1 and Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> when MAPK is constitutively activated (i.e. in <italic>wis1-DD</italic> mutants) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). It still remains mysterious how MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Atf1 loses its affinity toward Swi6<sup>HP1</sup>, which requires more detailed study in the future.</p><p>It is noteworthy that our mass spectrometry analyses on Atf1 purified from wild type and <italic>sty1Δ</italic> cells grown at 37°C pinpointed at least six residues of Atf1 as heat-induced and Sty1-dependent phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, these sites largely fall in the middle region of Atf1, this is similar to those 11 putative MAPK phosphorylation sites which were originally identified purely based on their fit with ST/P motif. This is also consistent with previous observation that the central domain of Atf1 harboring six Ser/Thr sites affects heterochromatin assembly capacity of Atf1 at the <italic>mat</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fraile et al., 2022</xref>), reinforcing the idea that phosphorylation of multiple sites is required for negative regulatory effect of Atf1 on heterochromatin maintenance at <italic>mat</italic> locus upon heat stress. We also noticed that a few among those 11 putative MAPK phosphorylation sites (such as Ser2, Ser4, and Ser438) which fit with ST/P motif in Atf1 did not show up in our mass spectrometric identifications, most likely due to technical limitations of spectrometry analyses. At least our genetic analyses on Ser438 mutants excluded its involvement in influencing gene silencing at the <italic>mat</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, we also identified three residues Ser140, Ser152, and Ser226 as heat-induced but Sty1-independent phosphorylation sites, indicating that other kinase(s) may also collaborate with MAPK to affect heterochromatin maintenance at <italic>mat</italic> locus upon heat stress.</p><p>In previous studies performed in higher eukaryotes, heterochromatin stability has been mostly characterized based on the enrichment of ATF/CREB family protein itself, heterochromatin protein HP1 and H3K9me within examined heterochromatin sites/regions under heat stress. In our current study, in addition to altered binding between Atf1 and Swi6<sup>HP1</sup> under heat stress, we also found that Clr3, one of the histone modifying enzymes, fails to be efficiently recruited to the <italic>cenH</italic>-flanking sites within the fission yeast <italic>mat</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and <italic>epe1Δ</italic> is able to alleviate silencing defects at this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Although we did not observe the weakened binding between Atf1 and Clr3 by in vitro pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>), or enhanced binding of Epe1 at <italic>cenH</italic>-flanking sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), it does not exclude the possibility that Clr3-recruiting activity of Atf1 is only compromised or Epe1 is more retained respectively in a sub-population of heterochromatic nucleosomes, which cannot be detected by our current methods. Alternatively, heat stress-induced decreased recruitment of Clr3 at <italic>mat</italic> locus could be attributed to compromised binding between Swi6 and Atf1, because Clr3 interacts with Swi6 and Swi6 is involved in Clr3 spreading throughout the 20 kb heterochromatic <italic>cenH</italic>-flanking domain as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, our observation that H3K9me3 enrichment is reduced within <italic>cenH</italic> element-surrounding regions but not at <italic>cenH</italic> site itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) can also be explained by the fact that Clr3 contributes to heterochromatin spreading and maintenance at those regions by stabilizing H3K9 trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>), but heterochromatin nucleation at <italic>cenH</italic> site mainly requires RNAi-directed mechanism. Thus, it is fairly possible that loss of heterochromatin stability at high temperature may also involve histone-modifying enzymes to curb heterochromatin formation in higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physiological relevance of the loss of heterochromatin stability at <italic>mat</italic> locus in fission yeast</title><p>In mammals, the loss of the ATF/CREB family protein-dependent heterochromatin maintenance may cause detrimental consequences. It has been shown that p38-dependent phosphorylation of ATF7 in mice causes its release from the promoters of genes encoding either TERRA (telomere repeat containing RNA) in the sub-telomeric region or Cdk inhibitor p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>, which disrupts heterochromatin and induces TERRA or cellular senescence and a shorter lifespan, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maekawa et al., 2019</xref>). TERRA can be transgenerationally transmitted to zygotes via sperm and causes telomere shortening in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). During early porcine embryonic development, high temperatures also trigger the increased expression level of p38, which leads to ATF7 phosphorylation, heterochromatin disruption, and eventually the failure of blastocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In fission yeast, the tightly silent mating-type region contributes to the mating-type switching to ensure the presence of almost equal number of cells with opposite mating types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klar, 2007</xref>).

Indeed, fission yeast cells spend much effort to establish and maintain stable heterochromatin at the <italic>mat</italic> locus by employing multiple mechanisms and factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jia et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jia et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>). One very recent study has proposed that the transcription factor Atf1 not only involves in heterochromatin maintenance at the <italic>mat</italic> locus, but also acts in parallel with RNAi machinery and multiple histone-modifying enzymes during heterochromatin establishment steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickels et al., 2022</xref>). Even so, fission yeast still suffers the stress-induced defective heterochromatic maintenance at this important locus in its genome. The presence of Atf1 is unable to efficiently fend off phenotypic variation, while its functional disruption can cause even much severe silencing defects at 37°C, as demonstrated by cells with <italic>s1</italic> and <italic>REIII</italic> elements (i.e. the major Atf1 binding sites) deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nickels et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>It is generally believed that yeast spores have higher stress tolerance than vegetative cells, which should be helpful for them to survive the unfavorable environment before they meet more friendly conditions. However, it is quite anti-intuitional that fission yeast cells do not mate and therefore fail to undergo meiosis and sporulation at temperatures above 33°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2020</xref>). The heat stress-induced heterochromatic disruption might interfere with the mating-type switching and reduce mating efficiency, but it seems to be innocuous to vegetatively growing cells. For fission yeast, this feature may be regarded as an ‘intrinsic flaw’ which prevents its use of a better strategy to ‘escape’ from stress and has not been fixed during its evolution. How much heterochromatic maintenance defects at the <italic>mat</italic> locus induced by heat stress is contributing to this feature will be an interesting question for future studies to solve.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast methods</title><p><italic>S. pombe</italic> strains and DNA oligos used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseenKevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers, Senior and Reviewing Editors have discussed your manuscript and concluded that additional controls and experiments are necessary to solidify the advances in your manuscript over previously published work. In particular it was determined that analysis of individual phosphorylation site mutations under expression of the endogenous promoter is required to advance the work and confirm the role of MAPKs. This and other requested experiments are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Some main conclusions are based upon experiments in which Atf1 and Atf1 mutants are expressed constitutively under the control of the Psty1 promoter.</p><p>Atf1 levels in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells depend on Sty1 activity in two ways. Firstly, an increased Sty1 dependent transcription and secondly increased stability via Sty1 dependent phosphorylation of the Atf1 protein. Both the transcriptional induction as well as phosphorylation of Atf1 during stress response is known to have a temporal pattern. So, the endogeneous levels of a phosphorylation defective mutant of Atf1 expressed from its native promoter are expected to be very different from that expressed constitutively in the experimental model that the authors have chosen. Specifically, the levels of Atf1 are expected to be much higher in the conditions chosen by the author and not representative of the levels that would be there in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells during heat stress. This difference would have a significant effect on the interactions of Atf1 with the other factors. A higher Atf1 level would also exaggerate the influence of Sty1 dependent phosphorylation on the mechanism described. Hence it’s not very clear, to what extent the mechanisms described in this manuscript would be operational in <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells during heat stress. Appropriate experiments using phosphorylation mutants under the control of the endogeneous Atf1 promoter are therefore essential to validate the conclusions made by the authors.</p><p>2. Under normal temperature conditions, earlier studies have implicated that phosphorylation of Atf1 by Sty1 is important for heterochromatin initiation. At the same time a constitutively expressed Atf1.10M mutant (under the Psty1 promoter) has been shown to be able to establish silencing at the mat locus while an Atf1.10D mutant failed to do so (Fraile et al., iScience. 2022 Aug 19; 25(8): 104820). Reports also exist which indicate that kinase activity of Sty1 is important for heterochromatin formation at the mat locus. (Kim et al., J Biol Chem,2004 Oct 8;279(41):42850-9) The authors need to discuss the contrasting implications of the existing reports and how these results co-relate with their own conclusions.</p><p>3. Atf1 functions are known to be influenced strongly by Pcr1 both during stress responses and heterochromatin formation. In fact, Pcr1 is also known to interact with Swi6 (Kim et al., J Biol Chem,2004 Oct 8;279(41):42850-9). During Heat stress the transcriptional induction of pcr1+ is much more than that of Atf1<sup>+</sup>. Atf1 and Pcr1 are also known to influence each other's expression levels. The mechanistic details presented in this study therefore remain largely incomplete in the absence of an assessment of whether and how Pcr1 levels are affected in a cell expressing Atf1 mutants constitutively. The mechanistic details remain elusive in the absence of that.</p><p>4. Since phosphorylation of Atf1 is presented as the basis of the alteration in heterochromatin state at the mat locus, this study would have benefitted immensely by the further investigation of which one (or more) of the 10 indicated phosphorylatable sites plays the major role in the suggested mechanism. This could have been easily done via genetic approaches similar to using the Atf1.10A/I mutant or via biochemical approaches that exactly identify which residues in Atf1 remain phosphorylated under these conditions.</p><p>5. Studies with analog sensitive mutants of Sty1 would have been necessary to conclusively prove that it is the kinase activity of Sty1 which is responsible for the observed effects. While experiments with wis1-DD mutants do provide and indication, the observation needed further validation.</p><p>6. The only well characterized observations in the manuscript therefore are the ones that show the changes in recruitment of Swi6 and the clr proteins, which is important but in the absence of a conclusive mechanism that leads to these changes, the result remains incomplete.</p><p>7. Figure S2B: Why the ratio of GFP/Cdc2 and the mRNA level of gfp/act1 are inconsistent, especially for imr1R::GFP strain.</p><p>8. Figure 2C-D: What would happen to the expression of ade6, cenH and dg when cells were treated at 37°C?</p><p>9. Figure 3B: In addition to the 10 phosphorylation sites on the left end of Atf1, there is also a S348, why this site was not studied? Mutation of Atf1 (10A/I) at 37℃ did not reduce the expression of ade6 to wild-type level, which could be due to Atf1-S348 is still active. Or does it indicate that there are other pathways regulating gene silencing under heat stress?</p><p>10. Figure 3C: From the western blots, we can tell that the level of Atf1 (10A/I) was decreased and the Atf1 (10D/E) protein was recovered. Does phosphorylation of Atf1 affect Atf1 protein level?</p><p>11. It may be favorable to present the ade6 reporter data in Figure 1 first and follow it with discussion of the confirming ura4 data which is in supplemental data.</p><p>12. Further discussion is required to explain why upon heat stress K9me2 is down at all heterochromatic regions while H3K9me3 is only down at mat. Something is also happening at other heterochromatic sites. Is it similar but insufficient to relieve silencing at those loci or some different phenomenon.</p><p>13. Figure 4 presents compelling data that bacterially expressed Swi6 loses its binding to ATF in extracts made from heat-treated cells. Of course, the gold standard of such experiments is reciprocal IPs with endogenous proteins. The authors should perform such experiments or provide a compelling technical description of why it is not feasible in this case.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90525.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Since phosphorylation of Atf1 is presented as the basis of the alteration in heterochromatin state at the mat locus, this study would have benefitted immensely by the further investigation of which one ( or more) of the 10 indicated phosphorylatable sites plays the major role in the suggested mechanism. This could have been easily done via genetic approaches similar to using the Atf1.10A/I mutant or via biochemical approaches that exactly identify which residues in Atf1 remain phosphorylated under these conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with you that it is possible that only one or a few among 10 phosphorylatable sites within the N-terminal half of Atf1 plays the major role in regulating epigenetic maintenance of heterochromatin at the mating-type region.

Figure 3B: In addition to the 10 phosphorylation sites on the left end of Atf1, there is also a S348, why this site was not studied?

Or does it indicate that there are other pathways regulating gene silencing under heat stress?</p></disp-quote><p>One very recent study has shown that the constitutively expressed Atf1(10A/I) mutant (under the <italic>sty1<sup>+</sup></italic> promoter, <italic>P<sub>sty1</sub></italic>) is able to promote heterochromatin establishment and maintenance at the <italic>mat</italic> locus under normal temperature conditions (Fraile <italic>et al.</italic>, iScience. 2022, PMID: 35992058; DOI: 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104820). Consistently, our data showed that expression of <italic>P<sub>sty1</sub></italic>-<italic>atf1(10A/I)</italic> also rescues the heat stress-induced defective heterochromatic maintenance at the <italic>mat</italic> locus (see our data shown in Figure 3D, E and G). These findings raised the possibility that removal of phosphorylation of 10 out of the 11 serine or threonine on the left end of Atf1 is sufficient for heterochromatin establishment and maintenance at the mating-type region.</p><p>Nevertheless, to satisfy your curiosity, we constructed yeast strains expressing Atf1-S348A, Atf1-S348D, Atf1(11A/I) (i.e. 10A/I plus S348A) or Atf1(11D/E) (i.e. 10D/E plus S348D) mutants and examined their effect on expression of the <italic>mat3M::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> reporter. We found that Atf1-S348A alone could not rescue heat stress-induced defective reporter silencing at the mating-type region, and when it was combined with Atf1(10A/I), it did not enhance the rescuing effect on heat stress-induced defective reporter silencing. These results indicated that phosphorylation of S348 site is not essential for heterochromatin establishment and maintenance at the mating-type region. We have added these new data in Figure 6—figure supplement 3.</p><p>We have also tried to narrow down the Sty1-dependent phosphorylation sites in Atf1 at high temperature by Mass spectrometry mapping and analyzed silencing of <italic>mat3M::ade6<sup>+</sup></italic> in individual phosphorylation site mutants.

First, although replacing Ser or Thr by Ala, Val or Ile is a very commonly used strategy to create the non-phosphorylatable mutation, it is actually quite “artificial” and is not necessarily always equivalent to nonphosphorylated state of those residues in some cases. Many examples of failed nonphosphorylation-mimicking strategy can be found throughout published literatures, one example has been reported in Koyano et al., Genes to Cells (2015) (PMID: 26525038; DOI: 10.1111/gtc.12309). The same issue also applies for phosphomimetic mutations by Glu or Asp, which do not necessarily result in expected phosphomimetic phenotypes. One of such examples was reported by Ruggiero et al., Current Biology (2020) (PMID: 31928870, DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2019.11.054) in which the <italic>mad3-S268E</italic> mutant does not behave as phosphomimetic and does not delay mitotic slippage. For Atf1, perhaps a dynamic equilibrium and balance between phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Atf1 is critical for fine-tuning Atf1 function in gene silencing maintenance at the mating-type region, and Atf1(10A/I) mutation could block its dynamic balance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 3C: From the western blots, we can tell that the level of Atf1 (10A/I) was decreased and the Atf1 (10D/E) protein was recovered. Does phosphorylation of Atf1 affect Atf1 protein level?</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, whether phosphorylation of Atf1 affects its protein level is still an unresolved issue.</p><p>Two earlier studies showed that a mutant version of Atf1, lacking all eleven putative mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) sites (i.e. Atf1-11A/I), is less stable than its wild-type counterpart and accumulates to a lesser extent upon stress (Please see Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic> 2007, PMID: 17182615/DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M608526200; and Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic> 2009, PMID: 19836238/DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2009.09.044). The instability of Atf1(11A/I) can be rescued by the absence of F-box protein Fbh1 or disruption of Atf1 interaction with Fbh1 (Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic> 2009, PMID: 19836238/DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2009.09.044). In these studies, anti-Atf1 antibodies were used to detect wild type and phosphorylation mutants of Atf1. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of Atf1 by Sty1 inhibits its ubiquitinylation-dependent degradation, and thus promotes its stabilization and accumulation, especially under stress.</p><p>However, one recent study challenged the above notion. Salat-Canela <italic>et al.</italic> noticed that protein level of HA-Atf1(10D/E) is significantly enhanced and that of HA-Atf1(10A/I) is decreased under stress when they used anti-Atf1 antibodies in Western blotting (Salat-Canela <italic>et al.</italic> 2017, PMID: 28652406; DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M117.794339), which is consistent with previous studies (Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic> 2007; Lawrence <italic>et al.</italic> 2009). Astonishingly, when they used anti-HA antibodies to detect HA-Atf1, HA-Atf1(10A/I) and HA-Atf1(10D/E) before and after H2O2 treatment, they found that the protein levels of wild type and phosphorylation mutants of Atf1 are comparable, demonstrating that the levels of HA-Atf1 are not enhanced upon stress (Salat-Canela <italic>et al.</italic> 2017, PMID: 28652406; DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M117.794339).</p><p>Because we used anti-Atf1 antibodies in our Western blotting experiments, so it is not surprising to detect decreased level of Atf1(10A/I) and stabilized Atf1(10D/E) under heat stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

Further discussion is required to explain why upon heat stress K9me2 is down at all heterochromatic regions while H3K9me3 is only down at mat. Something is also happening at other heterochromatic sites. Is it similar but insufficient to relieve silencing at those loci or some different phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p>As we have discussed in our manuscript, H3K9me3, but not H3K9me2, is a more reliable hallmark for heterochromatin, which has been documented recently by several studies, such as Jih et al., 2017 (PMID: 28682306, DOI: 10.1038/nature23267) and Cutter DiPiazza et al., 2021 (PMID: 34035174, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2100699118). Thus, our observation that H3K9me3 enrichment is reduced within <italic>mat</italic> locus under heat stress is a good indication that heterochromatin maintenance is disrupted.</p><p>We agree that it indeed seems puzzling that H3K9me3 enrichment is reduced within <italic>cenH</italic> element-surrounding regions but not at <italic>cenH</italic> site itself (as we showed in our Figure 1E). We think this data can be explained by two facts about Clr3 function at <italic>mat</italic> locus revealed by one previous study (Yamada et al., 2005; PMID: 16246721, DOI: 10.1016/j.molcel.2005.10.002):</p><p>1) Clr3 interacts with Swi6 and Swi6 is involved in Clr3 spreading throughout the 20 kb heterochromatic <italic>mat</italic> locus;</p><p>2) Clr3 contributes to heterochromatin spreading and maintenance at <italic>mat</italic> locus by stabilizing H3K9 trimethylation (i.e. H3K9me3). The heterochromatin spreading and maintenance at <italic>mat</italic> locus is largely dependent on Clr3, but heterochromatin nucleation at <italic>cenH</italic> site mainly requires RNAi-directed mechanism.</p><p>Therefore, it is possible that heterochromatin spreading and maintenance at <italic>cenH</italic> element-surrounding regions are more sensitive to efficient Clr3 recruitment than the heterochromatin initiation at the <italic>cenH</italic> site.</p><p>We have added a brief relevant discussion in our revised manuscript (Please see page 20, line 549-558).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Figure 4 presents compelling data that bacterially expressed Swi6 loses its binding to ATF in extracts made from heat-treated cells.

We have tried co-IP experiments several times without success. The reason might be that only a small subpopulation of these proteins interact with each other in vivo and the amount of co-immunoprecipitated proteins is far below the detection limit by Western blotting, although Swi6, Atf1 and Pcr1 are among relatively abundant proteins in fission yeast.</p><p>Actually, although two previous studies successfully detected the interaction between Atf1 or Pcr1 and Swi6, neither of them employed co-IPs. Instead, one study used GST-pull down assay of overexpressed GST-Atf1 or overexpressed GST-Swi6 (Kim, H.S., et al., J Biol Chem. 2004, PMID: 15292231; DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M407259200), and the other study used in vitro translated and <sup>35</sup>S-labeled Atf1 and Pcr1 and bacterially expressed GST-Swi6 (Jia S., et al., Science, 2004, PMID: 15218150; DOI: 10.1126/science.1099035). Although neither of these papers mentioned why they chose these “non-gold standard” techniques to deal with the protein interaction detection, we believe these two studies probably also encountered the similar technical difficulty as us in detecting the interaction between Atf1 or Pcr1 and Swi6 directly through co-IP. So, in this aspect, it is very likely that we are not alone in choosing alternative approach to tackle this technical difficulty in this specific case.</p></body></sub-article></article>
