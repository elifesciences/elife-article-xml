Molecular machines spanning the cell envelope depend on spatial constraints and load-bearing forces across the cell envelope and surface. The mechanisms dictating spatial constraints across the cell envelope remain incompletely defined. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the coiled-coil lipoprotein Lpp contributes the only covalent linkage between the outer membrane and the underlying peptidoglycan layer. Using proteomics, molecular dynamics, and a synthetic lethal screen, we show that lengthening Lpp to the upper limit does not change the spatial constraint but is accommodated by other factors which thereby become essential for viability. Our findings demonstrate <italic>E. coli</italic> expressing elongated Lpp does not simply enlarge the periplasm in response, but the bacteria accommodate by a combination of tilting Lpp and reducing the amount of the covalent bridge. By genetic screening, we identified all of the genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> that become essential in order to enact this adaptation, and by quantitative proteomics discovered that very few proteins need to be up- or down-regulated in steady-state levels in order to accommodate the longer Lpp. We observed increased levels of factors determining cell stiffness, a decrease in membrane integrity, an increased membrane vesiculation and a dependance on otherwise non-essential tethers to maintain lipid transport and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Further this has implications for understanding how spatial constraint across the envelope controls processes such as flagellum-driven motility, cellular signaling, and protein translocation</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>periplasm</kwd><kwd>cell envelope</kwd><kwd>Lpp</kwd><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FL130100038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lithgow</surname><given-names>Trevor</given-names></name><name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>Iain D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM123169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumbart</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI052293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumbart</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gumbart</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009193</institution-id><institution>Marsden Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UOA1907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hay</surname><given-names>Iain D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bacterial periplasm must adapt to factors effecting the width of the cell envelope.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gram-negative bacteria have a cell envelope composed of two membranes sandwiching between them an aqueous space called the periplasm, in which an essential structural layer of peptidoglycan (PG) resides. The outer membrane is critical to cell growth and these bacteria face challenges to their cell biology in terms of membrane protein assembly and lipid-transport pathways that must traverse the distance from the inner membrane (IM) to the outer membrane (OM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Silhavy et al., 2010</xref>). Recent work investigating the spatial demands for assembly of proteins into the outer membrane has shown precincts of active protein integration into the membrane can deliver new material to the growing outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gunasinghe et al., 2018</xref>) and that random planar movement from these precincts drives the observed non-uniform distributions of the major proteins of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rassam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ursell et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast to these protein components that diffuse to the outer membrane, elements of the LPS-transport machinery (e.g. the Lpt complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freinkman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sperandeo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sperandeo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekiert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shrivastava and Chng, 2019</xref>) span the OM and IM in order to fulfil their function in delivering lipid components to the outer membrane.</p><p>The PG layer is a fundamental aspect of the cell envelope, and it must be dynamically remodeled to allow growth as well as the assembly and transit of trans-envelope structures. PG synthesis and remodeling is a complex process with high levels of redundancy at various steps, involving at least 50 enzymes in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pazos et al., 2017</xref>). The Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are the core components responsible for the periplasmic biosynthesis of peptidoglycan. There are multiple PBP complexes including the two core, semi-redundant PBP complexes PBP1a and PBP1b embedded in the IM which are activated by interactions with lipoproteins LpoA and LpoB embedded in the OM. Thus, the activation of PG synthesis by these enzymes is spatially regulated, serving as a self-limiting molecular ruler to modulate PG thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Typas et al., 2011</xref>). Cells must possess either a functional PBP1a or PBP1b system for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Typas et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Trans-envelope complexes such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) transit pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freinkman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sperandeo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sperandeo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ekiert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shrivastava and Chng, 2019</xref>) and the protein translocation and assembly module (the TAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Selkrig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Selkrig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) are also spatially constrained by the need to reach across from the IM to OM in order to function. The PG layer is covalently attached to the outer membrane by Braun’s lipoprotein (Lpp), with two recent papers addressing whether extending the length of Lpp would impact on (i) flagellar function given that the flagellum spans both membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>) and (ii) signal-transduction systems that span the OM to IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>). In both cases, extending the coiled-coil structure of Lpp by 21 residues (Lpp<sup>+21</sup>) was found to be the longest form that supported close to normal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>). Imaging of these Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strains in both studies showed that the total periplasmic width had been stretched ~3–4 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>). This being the case, the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> model would provide a powerful experimental system to study how processes like OM biogenesis and PG biosynthesis can be maintained under a spatial stress on the cell wall.</p><p>To understand how trans-envelope processes in <italic>E. coli</italic> adapt to the presence of an enlarged periplasm, a combination of phenotypic analysis, proteomics, molecular dynamics and a synthetic lethal screen was employed to identify and characterize factors needed to maintain viability in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>. The genetic screen demanded synthetic growth phenotypes from an array of mutants each lacking a gene that, while non-essential in wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baba et al., 2006</xref>), is essential in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain. These genes fall into three functional categories: PG biosynthesis and remodeling, LPS biosynthesis and PG-outer membrane linkage. We show that previously non-essential proteins involved in bridging the gap between the OM and PG become essential in the context of the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain background. These include previously known PG binding OM proteins (OmpA and Pal) as well as proteins previously not known to play an active role in linking the OM and PG (TolC and YiaD). We observed a thicker more diffuse or heterogeneous PG layer in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain and whole cell proteomics revealed that in response to an increased length of Lpp, <italic>E. coli</italic> increases the levels of a range of cell envelope proteins involved in PG turnover. We discuss the outcomes in terms of how the PG-outer membrane linkage functionalizes the periplasm, the evolutionary constrains in place to maintain this functionality, and the specific activity of Lpp in contributing to the load-bearing function of the OM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Resilience and growth of the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain</title><p>A phylogenetic assessment of Lpp lengths across diverse bacterial lineages showed a very narrow window of protein size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), with Lpp being 78 residues in most species of bacteria including <italic>E. coli</italic>. Lpp lengths of 99 residues or more are at the upper end of the natural range for this protein and, in nature, these longer Lpp proteins are found in the genus <italic>Geobacter</italic>. The previously described Lpp<sup>+21</sup> isoform expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> therefore sits near the upper physiological range observed among bacteria. We introduced a gene encoding the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> isoform into an <italic>E. coli</italic> background suitable for genetic screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and confirmed the size of the protein by SDS-PAGE of bacterial cell extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Enteric bacteria like <italic>E. coli</italic> can thrive in hyperosmotic environments compared to most laboratory growth media, such as the human gut by maintaining the periplasm and the cytoplasm in an iso-osmotic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ingraham and Marr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stock et al., 1977</xref>). This is achieved by adjusting the solute concentration in the cell compartments by influx or efflux of water. By doing so, osmolality contributes immensely to the architectural aspects of cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stock et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cayley et al., 2000</xref>). In this study sorbitol was used to mimic these physiological osmotic conditions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the periplasmic volume increased rapidly in response to increased osmolyte levels in the external medium. This phenomenon can reduce the cytoplasmic volume by about 30%, thereby constricting the IM inwards, and substantially increasing the periplasmic volume by around 300% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stock et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cayley et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pilizota and Shaevitz, 2013</xref>). The Lpp<sup>+21</sup> isoform had little impact on growth of <italic>E. coli</italic>. On minimal growth medium, growth rates of the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> were equivalent to the isogenic wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This was likewise true on growth media osmotically balanced with concentrations of sorbitol up to 1.0 M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and on rich (LB) medium with or without sorbitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phenotypes of <italic>E. coli</italic> cells encoding the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> isoform.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-redundant Lpp sequences were identified (Materials and methods) and the protein length charted on the x-axis.

As expected, the average distance from the middle of the IM density to the middle of the OM density was increased in both strains under hyperosmotic conditions when compared to previously reported data where cells were grown in standard laboratory media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, the averaged distance from the IM to the OM were somewhat greater in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain (32–36 nm) compared to the isogenic wild-type strain (30–32 nm) in line with previous Lpp<sup>+21</sup> periplasmic width measurements. Previous studies could not discern peptidoglycan; whereas here, we were able discern peptidoglycan in subtomogram averages. The distance to the center of the PG density from the OM was slightly increased in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), although by less than the anticipated ~3 nm. The PG morphology was also qualitatively different: in the wild-type strain a uniform dark PG layer could be observed in the images, whereas in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain a broader and more diffuse PG layer was evident, suggesting heterogeneity in both the density and thickness of the PG.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell envelope response to elongated Lpp</title><p>To determine the adaptive response to changing the distance constraint between OM and PG, quantitative whole cell proteomics was applied to evaluate the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain.

These MD simulations only represent a portion of the membrane, and as such we could not account for potential heterogeneity in the protein and LPS concentrations between a WT and Lpp<sup>+21</sup> cell. For three of the systems: Lpp only, Lpp with OmpA, and Lpp<sup>+21</sup> only, tilting was marginal, with tilt angles of 76.9 ± 4.7°, 75.5 ± 4.7°, and 82.8 ± 2.9°, respectively (all numbers from the last 100 ns of the 200-ns trajectory).

We observed a moderate increase to the OM-IM space similar to that previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathelié-Guinlet et al., 2020</xref>) and reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathelié-Guinlet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asmar and Collet, 2018</xref>). Three adaptive features were expressed as phenotypes in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain: (i) the steady-state level of the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> tether was reduced eightfold compared to the level of Lpp in the isogenic wild-type strain, and other tethers that enforce a wild-type distance: OmpA, Pal, YiaD, and TolC, became essential factors in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> condition, (ii) structures that depend on a wild-type OM-IM distance, such as the LPS transport system, continued to function but key components of the system became essential for cell viability, and (iii) the PG network took on characteristics of dysregulated synthesis and all components of an otherwise redundant PG biosynthesis pathway become essential to viability. In response to Lpp elongation, we demonstrated a reduction in Lpp levels, as shown by the quantitative proteomic presented here, and the apparent tilting of the elongated Lpp as suggested by our molecular dynamics simulations. The reduction in the copy number of the elongated Lpp isoform observed in the quantitative proteomics was not due to a transcriptional downregulation of the <italic>lpp<sup>+21</sup></italic> gene, as RNAseq data demonstrated a moderate increase in the level of <italic>lpp</italic><sup>+21</sup> transcripts in the mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Previous studies have not noted a marked reduction in Lpp<sup>+21</sup>, but these studies also did not directly measure the levels of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>). One interpretation of the reduction of the level of Lpp<sup>+21</sup> observed here is that the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> isoform has a higher turnover in the periplasm, either via an inherently lower stability or driven by a targeted degradation due to its influences on the cell envelope structure. Taken together, this suggests a reinterpretation of previous conclusions drawn from experiments with elongated Lpp isoforms that assumed that Lpp<sup>+21</sup> was present at the same amount as Lpp, and that Lpp<sup>+21</sup> sits perpendicular to the membranes such that the 21 extra amino acids always stretch the periplasmic width by a constant amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mathelié-Guinlet et al., 2020</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Tethers that enforce the distance constraint between the OM and PG layer became essential factors in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> condition</title><p>The lipoyl-N-terminus of Lpp is integrated into the OM, and the C-terminus of a protomer of the Lpp trimer is covalently linked to the PG layer. Stereochemically, only one unit of a Lpp trimer can be covalently attached to the PG layer, and this stoichiometry has been observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boags et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inouye et al., 1972</xref>). This makes each Lpp trimer an important bridge between the OM and PG layers of the cell wall, but it has not been clear whether the core role of Lpp is acting in compression or tension. In other words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller and Salama, 2018</xref>), is the role of Lpp to be a supportive brace to keep the OM away from the PG, or a binding anchor to bring the OM as closely as possible to the PG? In a wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> scenario, molecular dynamics simulations show that the flexible linkers in PG-binding proteins like OmpA allow for adjustments in positioning the PG relative to the OM. In the presence of Lpp, the flexible linker of the PG binding domain of OmpA needs to extend further from the OM, as the distance between the OM and PG increases when Lpp sits perpendicular to the OM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boags et al., 2019</xref>). In the absence of Lpp, OmpA determines the distance between the OM and PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boags et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Samsudin et al., 2017</xref>) but is not essential for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babu et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together with the data presented here from characterization of the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> phenotypes, we suggest that Lpp functions as a brace to keep the OM away from the PG layer.</p><p>The genetic screen showed that each one of the OM-located PG-binding factors Pal, YiaD, and OmpA are essential (as is TolC) for viability of the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>, while previous high-throughput synthetic genetic screens demonstrate none of Pal, YiaD, OmpA nor TolC are essential or negatively affect the growth in an Lpp null background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babu et al., 2011</xref>). The overlap in the distance constraints measured for cells expressing Lpp and Lpp<sup>+21</sup> suggests that much of the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> is in the highly tilted (49.4 ± 2.3°) form observed in the MD simulations. The enforced tilt and reduction in steady state levels of Lpp<sup>+21</sup> would severely impact its bracing force, with the measurable consequence that membrane integrity (SDS resistance) is diminished, OmpA and other tethers become essential to viability, and the OM is highly permissive to OMV formation. Furthermore, the discovery of YiaD in the genetic screen for essential factors is significant. Our proteomic assessment and previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2014</xref>) demonstrated that the copy number of YiaD is much lower than that of either Pal or OmpA, making it not immediately clear how a minor component of the membrane could be exerting such an essential role. Previously, YiaD was suggested to be a factor regulating OMP biosynthesis by the BAM complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tachikawa and Kato, 2011</xref>). Structural analysis shows YiaD to be highly similar to the PG-binding domains of Pal and OmpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishida et al., 2014</xref>). We suggest that the primary function of YiaD is to mediate OM-PG linkage, and that this indirectly impacts OMP biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Continued function of LPS transport in localized regions of the periplasm</title><p>The bridges needed to mediate LPS transport appear to be susceptible to disruption caused by Lpp<sup>+21</sup> in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

These findings are consistent with observations through electron microscopy that regions of the periplasm in Lpp<sup>+21</sup> cells are maintained with OM-PG distances reflective of the wild-type condition, which would permit LPS transport to the OM.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Components of the PG biosynthesis pathways become essential to cell viability</title><p>In <italic>E. coli</italic>, the weave of the PG-layer is maintained in a uniform, open state through quality control mechanisms that depend on the regulators in the OM (LpoA and LpoB) being able to permeate it to contact the synthetases (PBP1a and PBP1b) in the IM. It has been hypothesized in this way that the OM lipoproteins may serve as a molecular ruler to modulate PG thickness, maintaining a single layer of PG equidistant from the OM layer under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Typas et al., 2011</xref>).

However, in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain both <italic>mrcA</italic> and <italic>mrcB</italic> (as well as their OM lipoprotein partners) are essential for viability, indicative of a compromised capability to build the PG-layer. Mutations designed to impact on these interactions lead to transient deposition of ‘high-density PG’ and ‘multi-layered PG’ through dysregulation of the synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Typas et al., 2011</xref>). The broader and more diffuse morphology of the PG-layer observed by electron microscopy in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain could suggest a similar phenotype associated with transient or local impacts on the OM-PG distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Typas et al., 2011</xref>).

Taken together with the increase in oligopeptide transporter subunits (OppB, OppC, OppD, and OppF) in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain to recycle PG precursors across the IM, our results suggest a clearance of the malformed PG caused by dysregulation of the PG synthases is a crucial adaptation in the Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Stiffness and connection of OM-PG</title><p>The concept of bacterial cell stiffness has emerged as a means to understand the physical parameters that define how readily bacteria can respond to major environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rojas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rojas and Huang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>).

Cells were collected by spinning at 6000xg for 5 min and resuspended to an OD<sub>600</sub> of ≈ 12. Cryo-EM, data collection, and analysis were performed similarly to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asmar et al., 2017</xref>), except using 3-D subtomogram averages derived from whole-cell cryotomograms instead of projection images so as to discern peptidoglycan. Tilt series of WT and Lpp<sup>+21</sup> strains was acquired on an FEI Krios operating at 300 keV with a Gatan K2 direct detector and energy filter with a 20 eV slit with a tilt range of±60° using 3° increments and reconstructed using IMOD. Subtomograms were picked manually using 3DMOD along the length of all non-polar periplasm and averaged using PEET.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Generation of simulation systems</title><p>Initially, two systems were generated: the OM and PG, as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>), with two copies of wild-type Lpp and with two copies of Lpp<sup>+21</sup>. For wild-type Lpp, we used the homo trimer from PDB 1EQ7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shu et al., 2000</xref>). For Lpp<sup>+21</sup>, a monomer was first built using I-TASSER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang and Zhang, 2015</xref>). Next, the trimer of Lpp<sup>+21</sup> was built using the wild-type Lpp trimer as a template, further optimized using Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD) for one ns. For both Lpp and Lpp<sup>+21</sup>, the proteins were anchored in the OM via N-terminal acylation while the C-terminus of one copy from each trimer was covalently linked to the PG. The systems generated were prepared for equilibration using the following steps for one ns each: (1) minimization for 10,000 steps, (2) melting of lipid tails, (3) restraining only the PG and the protein, and (4) restraining the PG and the protein backbone. Both systems were equilibrated for 200 ns.</p><p>For each of the two systems (Lpp and Lpp<sup>+21</sup>), a new system was constructed with one Lpp trimer removed and OmpA inserted into the OM. The full-length OmpA structure was taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz-Suarez et al., 2016</xref>. The periplasmic domain region of the OmpA (clamp, hereafter) was lowered to the PG by shortening the distance between the PG and the clamp for 20 ns. After the clamp was lowered, it was clenched to the nearest DAP residue by using two different distance collective variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiorin et al., 2013</xref>) between the centre of mass of residue 242 or 256 from OmpA and that of a nearby PG DAP residue to maintain the connection for 110 ns. In the case of Lpp<sup>+21</sup>, PG was first pulled toward the OM to match the distance between them in wild-type Lpp, after which the clamp of OmpA was lowered and clenched for 110 ns. The wild-type Lpp/OmpA system was equilibrated for 200 ns; OmpA stayed bound to the PG without colvars. The Lpp<sup>+21</sup>/OmpA system was also equilibrated for 200 ns, but colvars were needed to maintain the OmpA-PG interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Molecular dynamics (MD)</title><p>All-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed using NAMD 2.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phillips et al., 2005</xref>) and the CHARMM36m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2017</xref>) and CHARMM36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klauda et al., 2010</xref>) force-field parameters for proteins and lipids, respectively, with the TIP3P-CHARMM water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>). Unless otherwise stated, all MD simulations were performed under a periodic boundary condition with a cut-off at 12 Å for short-range electrostatic and Lennard-Jones interactions with a force-based switching function starting at 10 Å. For long-range electrostatic calculations, the particle-mesh Ewald method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darden et al., 1993</xref>) with a grid spacing of at most 1 Å was used for long-range electrostatic calculations. Bonds between a heavy atom and a hydrogen atom were maintained to be rigid, while all other bonds remain flexible. Unless otherwise stated, each system was equilibrated under an isothermal-isobaric ensemble (NPT) at 310 K and 1 bar, with a timestep of 4 fs after hydrogen mass repartitioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balusek et al., 2019</xref>). A Langevin thermostat with a damping coefficient of 1 ps<sup>–1</sup> was used for temperature control and a Langevin piston was used for pressure control. VMD was used for all visualization and analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Humphrey et al., 1996</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Visualization, Writing -

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Periplasm homeostatic regulation maintains spatial constraints essential for cell envelope processes and cell viability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers appreciated the genetic approach to understand how changes in the extended Lpp+21 variant modulates periplasmic space. At the same time, however, there was consensus that many of the results were preliminary and mechanistic insight was generally missing. We hope you will find the detailed comments provided by all three reviewers helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The outer-membrane anchored lipoprotein Lpp is the most abundant protein in <italic>E. coli</italic> and about one third of the Lpp molecules are covalently attached to peptidoglycan, which is important to maintain the outer membrane impermeable to SDS (anionic detergent). Lpp forms a homotrimer made of α-helical monomers, hence, the abundant connections between the peptidoglycan and the outer membrane via Lpp are thought to maintain a constant distance between both envelope layers, which is likely important for trans-envelope processes. In two previous papers, an extended version of Lpp, Lpp+21, was used to study flagellar assembly and signal transduction through an artificially widened periplasm but it remained unclear what other processes are impaired in the Lpp+21 expressing cells. Mandela and co-workers provide now a comprehensive characterization of the strain. Different from previous papers, they conclude that lengthening of Lpp only slightly affects the widths of the periplasm under hyperosmotic condition, but there is a more pronounced effect on the mechanical properties of the outer membrane. The expression of Lpp+21 induces several stress responses and renders specific components of the peptidoglycan remodelling pathway essential.</p><p>I find this an interesting and important study and would like to make the following specific comments:</p><p>Main points:</p><p>1. I am concerned that some of the phenotypes of the Lpp+21 expressing strain are caused by the ~8-fold reduced copy number, compared to the copy number of native Lpp in wild-type cells. With 8-fold reduced amount of Lpp, other outer membrane-peptidoglycan connecting proteins are likely more abundant than Lpp+21 and capable of maintaining a normal distance between both layers, explaining why the authors did not observe a more increased width in the Lpp+21 strain. It would be helpful to try to compare strains with similar amounts of Lpp+21 or Lpp and find out which phenotypes, proteome changes and changes in essentiality of genes are caused by the reduced amount of Lpp+21, and which are caused by the extension of the protein.</p><p>2. Line 113 and Figure 1F, numbers of periplasmic widths. The numbers measured by the authors are not numbers of periplasmic widths, as they include also half of the cytoplasmic membrane and half of the outer membrane (measurements were take from the middle of each membranes). Hence, these numbers are different to published data of periplasmic widths (for example, from the Beveridge lab), which could confuse the readers. Hence, I suggest to explain the difference to published numbers in the text and refrain from using the term 'periplasmic widths' for their measurements.</p><p>3. Line 115, PG morphology. It is hard to see whether the PG morphology is changed (Figure 1F) because the images of the wt are generally darker than those of the mutant. Can the authors apply some sort of image analysis to support their claims that there is a difference? However, it is also not clear what insights about the PG layer one can possibly obtain from transmission EM images and the discussion about possible effects is very speculative (lines 300-302).</p><p>4. Figure 1F. It might be interesting to compare the Lpp+21 strain to a mutant lacking Lpp?</p><p>5. Figure 4C/D, model. Are they sure that the attachment of Lpp+21 to peptidoglycan is as efficient as the attachment of wt Lpp? If many Lpp+21 trimers were not attached to peptidoglycan, this would explain the almost normal distance between outer membrane and peptidoglycan, the strong vesicle production (Figure 2C) and the higher SDS sensitivity (Figure 2D). Have the authors considered simulations with Lpp+21 that is not attached to peptidoglycan, would it penetrate the layer?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The outer membrane lipoprotein Lpp provides the only covalent link known to exist between the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan cell wall in <italic>E. coli</italic>. It has been previously shown that elongating the coiled-coil structure of Lpp increases the distance between the outer membrane and the cell wall, increasing the overall width of the periplasm. Mandela et al. investigate the effects of increasing the length of Lpp by 21 (Lpp+21) residues using proteomics, a genetic screen for factors that become essential when Lpp is elongated, and molecular dynamics. Based on their results, the authors propose that factors that maintain the distance constraint between the outer membrane and the cell wall become essential. However, they do not provide clear insight into why other factors were identified in their experiments.</p><p>The authors set out to investigate an interesting question and present a significant amount of data. However, there are important concerns about the study.</p><p>1) Important phenotypes reported in the study are significantly different from data previously reported by others. Although the authors acknowledge some (not all) of the discrepancies in the Discussion, they do not address the differences. These differences relate to the distribution, uniformity, and overall values of the distance between the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer, the impact that adding 21 residues to Lpp has on Lpp protein levels, and the reported synthetic lethality with mrcB. It would be necessary to address why these differences exist to validate this study.</p><p>2) The authors provide a list of genes and proteins from the experiments that they conducted using proteomics and genetics. However, they do not further explore the relationship or mechanism linking those factors to Lpp+21. As a result, the work is limited to reporting correlations and speculative links between factors and lengthening Lpp. None of the proposed connections between Lpp+21 and the identified factors are investigated. As a result, it is unclear whether the effect results from a direct or indirect link to the presence of Lpp+21, or even whether they are the result of increasing the distance from the OM to the cell wall, or simply because the levels of Lpp+21 are significantly decreased in comparison to those of wild-type Lpp in the parent strain.</p><p>3) The authors conducted a synthetic lethal screen with non-essential genes and lpp+21. The screen relied on conjugation to construct double mutants. However, the authors have not demonstrated that the recipient single mutant strains are not defective in conjugation, which would lead to the wrong conclusion.</p><p>4) The conclusions that OmpA becomes essential in the presence of lpp+21 because it anchors the outer membrane to the cell wall is plausible, but requires further testing, since that is not the only role that OmpA plays.</p><p>5) The authors incorrectly conclude that &quot;the&quot; (i.e. &quot;all&quot;) non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis become essential in the lpp+21 strain in the Results and Discussion sections. There are several non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis that were not identified in this work. Moreover, the authors do not explain why changing LPS structure lead to synthetic lethality. It is also unclear why galU, which is required for making the outer core, would be essential but genes encoding for enzymes required for the synthesis of the middle core are not when they function upstream in the LPS biosynthesis pathway.</p><p>6) The authors propose that the deletion of some factors leads to synthetic lethality because they are involved in making complexes that link the inner and outer membranes. The authors suggest that the reason why pumps were identified is because they form a complex linking these membranes. However, AcrA forms a pump with AcrB and TolC but acrB was not identified in the screen. It would be good to know what is the evidence that MdtK, MdtL and YdHI form pumps that connect the two membranes.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1) Some of the crucial data presented here are different from data previously reported by others. The authors acknowledge this in the Discussion but provide no explanation, which is very problematic. The most salient differences relate to the phenotypes caused by the presence of the lpp+21 allele. The distribution of the width of the periplasm in both the wild-type and the lpp+21 strains is larger than previously reported (e. g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29257832/. ). In addition, Asmar et al. (PMID: 29257832) reported that levels of the Lpp+21 protein are similar to those of wild-type Lpp. Here, the authors report that they are significantly lower. Given that when lpp is deleted, blebs are formed and there is less uniformity, it is possible that some (if not most) of the phenotypes presented here are the result of cells having less Lpp than wild type cell, not a longer Lpp protein. An additional discrepancy is that Asmar et al. PMID: 29257832 reported that an lpp+21 mrcB strain grows normally, while here the authors report they are synthetic lethal. It is necessary to address why these differences exist to validate this study.</p><p>2) The authors report synthetic lethality between a set of alleles and lpp+21. The screen relied on conjugation to make double mutants. It is unclear whether any of these interactions are specific to lpp+21 or not. Are they also observed with δ-lpp? More importantly, the authors should perform a parallel screen in which the Hfr donor carries a wild-type lpp allele linked to the chloramphenicol-resistance marker to ensure that the recipients are not defective in conjugation or resolving the merodiploid state, as suggested for the yraN mutant. This is especially relevant for mutants altering LPS synthesis since alterations to LPS structure can affect conjugation (and transduction).</p><p>3) The authors incorrectly state that the non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis become essential in the lpp+21 strain in the Results and Discussion sections. There are several genes encoding enzymes for the synthesis of LPS core and two acyltranferases that synthesize lipid A that are not essential in wild type that are not in the list of synthetic lethal genes with lpp+21. Moreover, why would changing LPS structure lead to this synthetic lethality? Furthermore, it is peculiar that galU, which is required for making the outer core of LPS, would be essential but genes encoding for enzymes required for the synthesis of the middle core are not (they would also lack the outer core).</p><p>4) The authors propose that the deletion of some factors leads to synthetic lethality because they are involved in making complexes that link the IM and OM. The authors suggest that the reason why pumps were identified is because they form a complex linking the IM and OM. That is true for TolC-dependent pumps. AcrA forms a pump with AcrB and TolC, so why was acrB not identified in the screen? Or tested separately to check their claim? The authors should test the δ-acrB allele to test their model. In addition, what is the evidence that MdtK, MdtL and YdHI form pumps that connect the IM and OM? References should be provided.</p><p>5) The authors suggest that the synthetic lethality observed with ompA results from the loss of an OM factor that interacts with the cell wall. This is a reasonable proposal, but OmpA is also the most abundant OM β-barrel protein. To test if, as suggested by the authors, the lethality caused by the ompA null results from the loss of an OM-PG connection, the authors should test an allele of ompA that still produces the OM β-barrel domain but lacks the C-terminal domain that contains the PG-binding domain. Related to this, both Pal and OmpA are very abundant proteins at the OM that interact with the PG layer. Is YiaD also very abundant? The prediction is that it would be for its loss to lead to synthetic lethality when both Pal and OmpA are present. I think the authors might be able to provide information on YiaD's abundance from their proteomics analysis.</p><p>6) Figure 3A shows that ycaL does not grow in the wild-type background either, so it should be removed from Table 1 and text.</p><p>7) The Discussion is highly speculative, and the arguments are not well formulated to strongly support conclusions. Here are some examples:</p><p>– Lines 265-266: I do not understand the argument supporting the authors' suggestion that &quot;Lpp functions as a brace to keep the OM away from the PG layer&quot; as opposed to functioning to ensure that the OM is not too far from the PG. The loss of Lpp leads to formation of OM blebs and wide distribution of cell width. This is problematic to cells. more than increasing width according to previously published studies.</p><p>– Lines 282-283: &quot;The bridges needed to mediate LPS transport appear to be susceptible to disruption caused by Lpp+21 in <italic>E. coli</italic>.&quot; What is the evidence for this? To my knowledge, there is no evidence supporting this statement shown in this manuscript or elsewhere.</p><p>– Line 307: What is the evidence for &quot;malformed PG&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Mandela et al. deals with the size of the periplasmic space using an Lpp mutant that has been extended by 21 amino acids. The manuscript mainly focuses on the results of a screen in which they introduce the Lpp+21 protein into the Keio collection to determine viability. There are some interesting findings, including the importance of cell-wall synthesis enzymes and of LPS synthesis and OMV production, but these findings are not followed up on to glean some insight into the processes of cell envelope construction. Moreover, some of the messages in the manuscript are not sufficiently supported (such as &quot;homeostatic regulation&quot; in the title, which I do not think the authors have shown ).</p><p>– Line 73: the wording had been stretched from ~9.5 nm to ~11.5 nm, and it is very confusing. In Asmar et al., the periplasmic width in Lpp+21 increases from ~24-25 nm to ~28 nm, which is neither in the range quoted above, nor is the difference.</p><p>– The first main result seems to be that Lpp+21 does not change the width of the periplasm, at least by as much as was reported in Asmar et al. I have several serious concerns about this section:</p><p>– (1) on line 112-113, the statement &quot;periplasmic width were only slightly greater&quot; is a misstatement of the data; the distributions shown in the figure are almost surely statistically different. Also, a shift of 2-4 nm can be incredibly biologically important, so saying &quot;only slightly greater&quot; is misleading. To make any quantitative statement, the authors would need to perform independent biological replicates of this cryoEM experiment, and then ask whether there is a consistent shift between WT and Lpp+21 as there is obviously a lot of cell-to-cell variation.</p><p>– (2) The authors do not provide any explanation for the quantitative difference with the Asmar paper, even though the same EM group (Beeby) was doing the measurements in each case.</p><p>– Line 114-115: There is a large amount of variation in the periplasmic thickness across cells, so one cannot draw any conclusions from the isolated images in Figure 1F. If the authors want to make any statements about the distance from PG to the OM, they need to quantify this. The same holds true for statements about PG morphology in the following lines – as it stands these statements seemed cherry-picked. The conclusion on line 316 about how the cell is softer despite having a thicker, non-homogeneous PG is not justified in the paper.</p><p>– The abstract states that &quot;the periplasm cannot be widened by engineering approaches.&quot; Putting aside the points above about the Lpp+21 construct, this statement is not justified – the authors have only tried one way to change periplasmic width, and there are several groups that have shown that periplasmic size can be altered (see e.g. work from Matthias Heinemann's lab).</p><p>– The authors have a whole section called &quot;homeostasis in the periplasm&quot;, but it’s difficult to understand what homeostatic process they have uncovered. To do so would involve perturbing some quantity and then seeing the process by which it recovers. I think the closest the paper comes is in lines 307-308, but these are just hypotheses.</p><p>Several findings seem too preliminary without follow-up experiments:</p><p>– (1) It is interesting that their genetic screen indicates a compromised ability to build the PG, but this conclusion would be greatly bolstered by follow-up experiments such as single-cell growth during CRISPRi depletion and/or HPLC measurements of cell-wall composition. This last point on line 248 about PG synthesis is confusing – why would LpoA/B become individually essential? Without follow-up studies, e.g. using CRISPRi to deplete proteins and studying the phenotypes during depletion, the screen seems preliminary.</p><p>– (2) It is interesting that LPS synthesis becomes more essential, but this finding does not appear to be further studied. It is unclear whether LPS levels decreased in the Lpp+21 strain.</p><p>– (3) The data suggests that the phenotypes of AcrAB/TolC are due to reduced PG binding, but it is not proven that this is the case.</p><p>– The molecular dynamics simulations are also intriguing, but do not provide strong evidence to back up their claims. (1) Were the simulations taking into account differences in protein and LPS concentration in the outer membrane? At the very least, these points should be mentioned as potentially important factors. (2) Evidence needs to be presented that any of these parameters on line 217-219 have stabilized. (3) Moreover, steered molecular dynamics simulations need to be carried to ensure that the system is not stuck in a local minimum based on the initial conditions. (4) It is unclear from the writing what the authors are trying to accomplish with the MD simulations. In large part, this is because the authors have not made clear what their model is for the detrimental effects of Lpp+21.</p><p>– The initial motivation regarding the conservation of Lpp length seems insufficient – first, there is no reason to believe that different bacterial species would have periplasms of the same size. Second, for the outlier (a Geobacter species), the authors do not show any evidence that this outlier does have a periplasm of a different size. Therefore, this entire motivation appears to distract from the other data in the paper.</p><p>Additional major concerns:</p><p>– Line 265: if Lpp acts as a brace, what happens in a ∆lpp strain to OM/PG distances?</p><p>– Line 270: I don't see how this is consistent, since there is no hypothesis for what the consequence would be for bracing vs. bridging.</p><p>– Line 273: This point about the tilting of Lpp seems to be a simple steric argument, that does not require MD? Or am I missing something? Also, this is an overinterpretation of their data – they have not linked the tilt at all to membrane integrity. This could easily be due to the difference in Lpp levels.</p><p>– In fact, they should measure the LPS levels in Lpp+21 cells, which would likely be a very important determinant of permeability and stiffness.</p><p>– Line 292: This statement about the PG being uniform has not been shown, and is unnecessary for this paper in any case.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Periplasm homeostatic regulation maintains spatial constraints essential for cell envelope processes and cell viability&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Additionally, the reviewers were not convinced that the results provide strong evidence for a dedicated homeostatic regulatory mechanism governing periplasmic dimensions, and requested that this point be significantly toned down in the revised manuscript.

They do this by studying the adaptive response of cells when a lengthened version of the Lpp protein (Lpp21+) is used to tether the outer membrane with the peptidoglycan layer. Lpp21+ has been used previously as a model system, and in these studies, it was largely assumed to increase the distance between the outer membrane and peptidoglycan. In the presented study, the authors use proteomics, a synthetic lethal screen, and molecular dynamic simulations to probe the adaptive response. They note that lengthening Lpp does not change the spatial constrain in the periplasm, but that a number of adaptive responses can be observed, which help to understand how periplasmic homeostasis is maintained.</p><p>On the whole, the authors have addressed the vast majority of comments and concerns raised by the 3 referees in the first round of review. This has improved the manuscript. However, two points remain unresolved, which the editor needs to consider.</p><p>1. The initial review noted that the study &quot;is limited to reporting correlative associations with the observed phenotypes, and definitive mechanistic evidence would be needed to support the conclusions.&quot; This point was strongly refuted by the authors in the revision.</p><p>On this point I agree with the initial review. The study has used omics approaches and MD simulations to probe the adaptive response of the cells to the presence of Lpp21+. As such, the conclusions are largely correlative and definitive mechanistic evidence is not provided. However, I do not see this as a 'deal-breaker' for publication. Rather I feel that the study provides plausible explanations and hypotheses as to how <italic>E. coli</italic> maintains periplasmic homeostasis, which is valuable information for the community.</p><p>2. The initial review raised concern that some of the phenotypes of the Lpp21+ expressing strain are caused by the ~8-fold reduced copy number, rather than the extension in protein linker length. On this point I agree with the initial review. Since both occur, the authors need to be more conservative in their conclusions. Or they need to experimentally tease apart the two possibilities. This has not been sufficiently dealt with in the revision.</p><p>Related to the point above, the initial review also noted that discrepancies with previous studies had not been resolved in the revised text. For example, the fact that Asmar et al. (PMID: 29257832) reported that levels of the Lpp+21 protein are similar to those of wild-type Lpp. This has not been sufficiently dealt with in the revision.</p><p>Finally, a concern that I had, related to the point above is that the study assumes that the 8-fold reduction in levels of Lpp21+ are an adaptive response that helps maintain periplasmic homeostasis (see abstract). They do not exclude the possibility that the engineered protein is subject to proteolysis because it is not native.</p><p>To summarise, I think that the study is an interesting and important contribution to the field, but that the authors need to be more conservative in the conclusions that they draw. For example, they need to provide some discussion as to the limitations of their study, and the differences with other published work (point 2).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors addressed my concerns about the initial manuscript and submitted a substantially improved revised version. In particular, they now clarify that the 8-fold reduced cell copy number of Lpp+21 could be responsible of some of the phenotypes observed. My remaining doubt is that the observed changes in cell envelope properties (softer outer membrane, increased blebbing) and the altered essentiality of genes could be similar in cells that lack Lpp or that have 8-fold less wild-type Lpp. Overall, I am now more positive about the revised manuscript as it clarifies the question about the periplasmic widths of cells with an elongated Lpp, which has not been fully addressed in previous papers. The work by Mandela et al. provides an interesting and important analysis of how a Gram-negative bacterium maintains a largely functional cell envelope (biogenesis) upon severe disturbance in the linkage between the two key components, the peptidoglycan layer and outer membrane.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The revision by Mandela et al. addresses some but not all of the comments and suggestions that I and the other reviewers introduced in the our initial review. In particular, they have clarified the differences (or lack thereof) with Asmar et al. in terms of the periplasmic width changes due to Lpp+21. Moreover, they have helped to clarify some of the differences between their experiments and others such as the growth defect in ∆mrcB with lpp mutants, though I was surprised that they did not simply do the experiment to test whether their explanation (difference in growth media) was the case.</p><p>One of my major criticisms in the initial review persists – that there are interesting conclusions that emerge from the screen of the Keio collection, but none of these results are followed up on, and hence I am left with the question of to what extent any of these phenotypes are direct. I had suggested investigating one in detail using e.g. CRISPRi knockdown in order to examine single-cell phenotypes during depletion of a now-essential protein in the lpp+21 background, but this was not done. Thus, while I find the topic of their paper generally interesting and well motivated, I am left unsatisfied with some of the major conclusions of their paper.</p><p>Moreover, many of the conclusions of their paper remain to be fully justified. For instance: in their abstract:</p><p>&quot;…impacts the load-bearing capacity of the outer membrane&quot;: this is not something that they show to be true in their paper, it is an inference from another paper, and there is nothing in this work that directly addresses load bearing.

Lpp forms a homotrimer made of α-helical monomers, hence, the abundant connections between the peptidoglycan and the outer membrane via Lpp are thought to maintain a constant distance between both envelope layers, which is likely important for trans-envelope processes. In two previous papers, an extended version of Lpp, Lpp+21, was used to study flagellar assembly and signal transduction through an artificially widened periplasm but it remained unclear what other processes are impaired in the Lpp+21 expressing cells. Mandela and co-workers provide now a comprehensive characterization of the strain. Different from previous papers, they conclude that lengthening of Lpp only slightly affects the widths of the periplasm under hyperosmotic condition, but there is a more pronounced effect on the mechanical properties of the outer membrane. The expression of Lpp+21 induces several stress responses and renders specific components of the peptidoglycan remodelling pathway essential.</p><p>I find this an interesting and important study and would like to make the following specific comments:</p><p>Main points:</p><p>1. I am concerned that some of the phenotypes of the Lpp+21 expressing strain are caused by the ~8-fold reduced copy number, compared to the copy number of native Lpp in wild-type cells. With 8-fold reduced amount of Lpp, other outer membrane-peptidoglycan connecting proteins are likely more abundant than Lpp+21 and capable of maintaining a normal distance between both layers, explaining why the authors did not observe a more increased width in the Lpp+21 strain. It would be helpful to try to compare strains with similar amounts of Lpp+21 or Lpp and find out which phenotypes, proteome changes and changes in essentiality of genes are caused by the reduced amount of Lpp+21, and which are caused by the extension of the protein.</p></disp-quote><p>We also conclude that the phenotypes of the Lpp+21 expressing strain are caused by the ~8-fold reduced copy number and the ability to tilt Lpp+21 to minimize its “stretch” on the OM-PG distance.</p><p>To clarify, we now state explicitly in the Abstract and Introduction, that we perturbed (enlarged) the main bridge between the OM and PG and show by electron microscopy that <italic>E. coli</italic> does NOT simply enlarge the periplasm in response, but maintains homeostasis by a combination of (a) tilting the (Lpp) bridge to an angle, and (b) reducing the amount of the (Lpp) bridge, keeps the periplasm from expanding.

Line 113 and Figure 1F, numbers of periplasmic widths. The numbers measured by the authors are not numbers of periplasmic widths, as they include also half of the cytoplasmic membrane and half of the outer membrane (measurements were taken from the middle of each membranes). Hence, these numbers are different to published data of periplasmic widths (for example, from the Beveridge lab), which could confuse the readers. Hence, I suggest to explain the difference to published numbers in the text and refrain from using the term 'periplasmic widths' for their measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point, though our measurements are methodologically consistent with those used in the two key papers – Cohen et al.

It has been previously shown that elongating the coiled-coil structure of Lpp increases the distance between the outer membrane and the cell wall, increasing the overall width of the periplasm. Mandela et al. investigate the effects of increasing the length of Lpp by 21 (Lpp+21) residues using proteomics, a genetic screen for factors that become essential when Lpp is elongated, and molecular dynamics. Based on their results, the authors propose that factors that maintain the distance constraint between the outer membrane and the cell wall become essential. However, they do not provide clear insight into why other factors were identified in their experiments.</p><p>The authors set out to investigate an interesting question and present a significant amount of data. However, there are important concerns about the study.</p><p>1) Important phenotypes reported in the study are significantly different from data previously reported by others. Although the authors acknowledge some (not all) of the discrepancies in the Discussion, they do not address the differences. These differences relate to the distribution, uniformity, and overall values of the distance between the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan layer, the impact that adding 21 residues to Lpp has on Lpp protein levels, and the reported synthetic lethality with mrcB. It would be necessary to address why these differences exist to validate this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the criticism and can make a more direct and clear comparison in rewriting the text: no previous study has evaluated the reduced level of Lpp+21 protein by any line of investigation, nor has any previous study taken into account whether the Lpp+21 protein might be tilted in the periplasm. We have now revised the text in the Results section around Figure 1 more direct language to explain why we needed to evaluate these features. We also are more explicit in the text concerning the need to re-examine by EM enough sections to be representative of the whole cell scenario for periplasmic width. We have done all of the appropriate controls, using immunoblotting and quantitative proteomics and structural biology to accurately represent the experimental model. We now explicitly state that this is the first time that such controls have been done, and make clear that we anticipate our explanations will change the conclusions of five previous papers that assumed that Lpp+21 was present at the same amount as Lpp, and that Lpp+21 always sits perpendicular to the membranes and thereby the 21 extra amino acids always stretch the periplasmic width by a constant amount. This assumption is incorrect, as we evidence here for the first time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors provide a list of genes and proteins from the experiments that they conducted using proteomics and genetics. However, they do not further explore the relationship or mechanism linking those factors to Lpp+21. As a result, the work is limited to reporting correlations and speculative links between factors and lengthening Lpp. None of the proposed connections between Lpp+21 and the identified factors are investigated. As a result, it is unclear whether the effect results from a direct or indirect link to the presence of Lpp+21, or even whether they are the result of increasing the distance from the OM to the cell wall, or simply because the levels of Lpp+21 are significantly decreased in comparison to those of wild-type Lpp in the parent strain.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree that our study is limited to reporting correlations and speculative links between factors and Lpp+21.

To test the hypothesis that a collection of genes of known function would become essential in order to enact this homeostasis, we established a genetic screen and identified a set of genes defining five known functional categories all relevant to periplasmic width. By applying quantitative proteomics we discovered that very few proteins need to be up- or down-regulated in steady-state levels in order to enact this homeostasis. No correlations are measured or drawn in the paper.</p><p>As to the last point, the three options mentioned are the same thing: the presence of Lpp+21 was previously assumed to increase the distance from the OM to the cell wall, and we show that the levels of Lpp+21 are significantly decreased in comparison to those of wild-type Lpp in the parent strain. We document, quantitatively, what happens in this situation, correcting the record.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors conducted a synthetic lethal screen with non-essential genes and lpp+21. The screen relied on conjugation to construct double mutants. However, the authors have not demonstrated that the recipient single mutant strains are not defective in conjugation, which would lead to the wrong conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have clarified the sentence in the Methods and in the Results that deals with this issue. The donor lpp+21 single mutant is clearly not defective in conjugation as multiple mutants of this strain could be generated and confirmed (if the parent was defective in conjugation we would expect no antibiotic resistant colonies to be generated). It is unreasonable to suggest we individually assess every single mutant in the Keio collection (~4000 strains) for conjugation defects (this has never been required of any of the multiple widely cited published eSGA screens, all using this established method relying on conjugation for gene knock out – e.g. PMID: 18677321; 24586182; 22125496). Furthermore – If any of the single mutants were defective in conjugation they would appear as “false positives” in the synthetic screen (i.e they would not grow on the second antibiotic). Once we had identified synthetic phenotypes in the primary conjugation-based screen, we then made “clean” mutants that did not rely on conjugation (ie via the λ red method which utilises transformation) to be certain of the outcomes documented here. We thank the reviewer for seeking clarity on this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The conclusions that OmpA becomes essential in the presence of lpp+21 because it anchors the outer membrane to the cell wall is plausible, but requires further testing, since that is not the only role that OmpA plays.</p></disp-quote><p>We must respectfully disagree. While <italic>ompA</italic> deletion mutants have been implicated genetically in various screens, the only biochemically valid function for OmpA is anchoring the outer membrane to the cell wall. Even if OmpA were to play other roles, the OM-PG anchor role and any other OmpA roles are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>The important point in this paper is that OmpA is not essential for viability in an Lpp strain, but becomes essential in the Lpp21 background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors incorrectly conclude that &quot;the&quot; (i.e. &quot;all&quot;) non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis become essential in the lpp+21 strain in the Results and Discussion sections. There are several non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis that were not identified in this work. Moreover, the authors do not explain why changing LPS structure lead to synthetic lethality. It is also unclear why galU, which is required for making the outer core, would be essential but genes encoding for enzymes required for the synthesis of the middle core are not when they function upstream in the LPS biosynthesis pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have clarified the sentence in the Results and Discussion sections dealing with the LPS biosynthesis pathway, to remove this ambiguity. While there are non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis become essential in the lpp+21 strain, we did not intend to imply that all non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis must become essential in the lpp+21 strain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors propose that the deletion of some factors leads to synthetic lethality because they are involved in making complexes that link the inner and outer membranes. The authors suggest that the reason why pumps were identified is because they form a complex linking these membranes. However, AcrA forms a pump with AcrB and TolC but acrB was not identified in the screen. It would be good to know what is the evidence that MdtK, MdtL and YdHI form pumps that connect the two membranes.</p></disp-quote><p>We now note that <italic>acrB</italic> was not identified in this screen, and cite the papers that implicate MdtK, MdtL and YdHI with pumps that connect the two membranes. YdhI – while it is unknown function it is in the same operon as tripartite pump components YdhJK, and has homology to AaeX [also in same operon as tripartite pump component AaeAB] and homology to YtcA [which is also in same operon as tripartite pump components MdtNO, possibly MdtNOP]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1) Some of the crucial data presented here are different from data previously reported by others. The authors acknowledge this in the Discussion but provide no explanation, which is very problematic. The most salient differences relate to the phenotypes caused by the presence of the lpp+21 allele. The distribution of the width of the periplasm in both the wild-type and the lpp+21 strains is larger than previously reported (e. g. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29257832/. ). In addition, Asmar et al. (PMID: 29257832) reported that levels of the Lpp+21 protein are similar to those of wild-type Lpp. Here, the authors report that they are significantly lower. Given that when lpp is deleted, blebs are formed and there is less uniformity, it is possible that some (if not most) of the phenotypes presented here are the result of cells having less Lpp than wild type cell, not a longer Lpp protein. An additional discrepancy is that Asmar et al. PMID: 29257832 reported that an lpp+21 mrcB strain grows normally, while here the authors report they are synthetic lethal. It is necessary to address why these differences exist to validate this study.</p></disp-quote><p>In their paper, Asmar et al. (PMID: 29257832, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29257832/) show a width distribution (Figure 2B) that is similar to ours with most widths of the Lpp+21 cells overlap with the wild-type cells in both papers, but have selected the microraphs (Figure 2A) only for the increased width distributions. These select micrographs are the basis on which their conclusions are drawn: this is appropriate for their conclusion of “<italic>Can Lpp+21 exert an effect on periplasmic width</italic>”, but would not be appropriate for our study which asks “<italic>Is the effect of Lpp+21 uniform across the bacterial cell, or is it buffered by homeostasis</italic>”. There is a moderate increase in in the distribution of widths among both the WT and lpp+21 strain compared to the Asmar paper (~18-35 vs 20-46 and 2139 vs 24-50) but given the differences in data collections methodology (we use whole-cell cryotomograms instead of projection images) and the osmotic conditions of the growth media this is not unexpected or concerning. The trend in both studies is similar with our data showing a longer distribution on the upper end.</p><p>In their paper, Asmar et al. (PMID: 29257832, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29257832/) conduct the viability experiments (i.e. address the phenotype of a mrcB strain of <italic>E. coli</italic>) in rich LB medium. The synthetic lethal screen in our work is conducted on minimal medium. Furthermore, there are differences in the strain backgrounds used. We have made this point more clear in the text of the revised paper.</p><p>In their paper, Asmar et al. (PMID: 29257832) do not show data on the levels of the Lpp+21 protein, and do not measure this relative to the wild-type Lpp. The only data dealing with this point is presented as Figure S5 which does demonstrate that all of the Lpp isoforms have similar PG connectivity, but does not address the steady-state level of Lpp versus Lpp+21. The loading of the gel have been made to set the same level of Lpp protein isoform in each lane, with no controls used to interpret the relative levels of Lpp and Lpp+21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors report synthetic lethality between a set of alleles and lpp+21. The screen relied on conjugation to make double mutants. It is unclear whether any of these interactions are specific to lpp+21 or not. Are they also observed with δ-lpp? More importantly, the authors should perform a parallel screen in which the Hfr donor carries a wild-type lpp allele linked to the chloramphenicol-resistance marker to ensure that the recipients are not defective in conjugation or resolving the merodiploid state, as suggested for the yraN mutant. This is especially relevant for mutants altering LPS synthesis since alterations to LPS structure can affect conjugation (and transduction).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have clarified the sentence in the Methods and in the Results that deals with this issue. The eSGA library creation and screening methods used here are established techniques (e.g. PMID: 18677321; 24586182; 22125496). If any of the single mutants were defective in conjugation they would appear as “false positives” in the synthetic screen. That is why, once we had identified synthetic phenotypes in the primary conjugation-based screen, we then made “clean” mutants that did not rely on conjugation (ie by transformation) to be certain of the outcomes documented here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors incorrectly state that the non-essential genes involved in LPS synthesis become essential in the lpp+21 strain in the Results and Discussion sections. There are several genes encoding enzymes for the synthesis of LPS core and two acyltranferases that synthesize lipid A that are not essential in wild type that are not in the list of synthetic lethal genes with lpp+21. Moreover, why would changing LPS structure lead to this synthetic lethality? Furthermore, it is peculiar that galU, which is required for making the outer core of LPS, would be essential but genes encoding for enzymes required for the synthesis of the middle core are not (they would also lack the outer core).</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the sentence in the Results and Discussion sections dealing with the LPS biosynthesis pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors propose that the deletion of some factors leads to synthetic lethality because they are involved in making complexes that link the IM and OM. The authors suggest that the reason why pumps were identified is because they form a complex linking the IM and OM. That is true for TolC-dependent pumps. AcrA forms a pump with AcrB and TolC, so why was acrB not identified in the screen? Or tested separately to check their claim? The authors should test the δ-acrB allele to test their model. In addition, what is the evidence that MdtK, MdtL and YdHI form pumps that connect the IM and OM? References should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We now note that <italic>acrB</italic> was not identified in this screen, and cite the papers that implicate MdtK, MdtL and YdHI with pumps that connect the two membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors suggest that the synthetic lethality observed with ompA results from the loss of an OM factor that interacts with the cell wall. This is a reasonable proposal, but OmpA is also the most abundant OM β-barrel protein. To test if, as suggested by the authors, the lethality caused by the ompA null results from the loss of an OM-PG connection, the authors should test an allele of ompA that still produces the OM β-barrel domain but lacks the C-terminal domain that contains the PG-binding domain. Related to this, both Pal and OmpA are very abundant proteins at the OM that interact with the PG layer. Is YiaD also very abundant? The prediction is that it would be for its loss to lead to synthetic lethality when both Pal and OmpA are present. I think the authors might be able to provide information on YiaD's abundance from their proteomics analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>On the point of OmpA function, we must respectfully disagree. While <italic>ompA</italic> deletion mutants have been implicated genetically in various screens, the only biochemically valid function for OmpA is anchoring the outer membrane to the cell wall.</p><p>On the point of YiaD we agree and have modified the sentence. The quantitative proteomics suggests that YiaD is present at 5% the level of Pal, similar to the 7% amounts found by Li et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.033).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3A shows that ycaL does not grow in the wild-type background either, so it should be removed from Table 1 and text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this correction and thank the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The Discussion is highly speculative, and the arguments are not well formulated to strongly support conclusions. Here are some examples:</p><p>– Lines 265-266: I do not understand the argument supporting the authors' suggestion that &quot;Lpp functions as a brace to keep the OM away from the PG layer&quot; as opposed to functioning to ensure that the OM is not too far from the PG. The loss of Lpp leads to formation of OM blebs and wide distribution of cell width. This is problematic to cells. more than increasing width according to previously published studies.</p><p>– Lines 282-283: &quot;The bridges needed to mediate LPS transport appear to be susceptible to disruption caused by Lpp+21 in E. coli.&quot; What is the evidence for this? To my knowledge, there is no evidence supporting this statement shown in this manuscript or elsewhere.</p><p>– Line 307: What is the evidence for &quot;malformed PG&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text in the Discussion as suggested, and to address (and clarify) the points of speculation. We appreciate the feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Mandela et al. deals with the size of the periplasmic space using an Lpp mutant that has been extended by 21 amino acids. The manuscript mainly focuses on the results of a screen in which they introduce the Lpp+21 protein into the Keio collection to determine viability. There are some interesting findings, including the importance of cell-wall synthesis enzymes and of LPS synthesis and OMV production, but these findings are not followed up on to glean some insight into the processes of cell envelope construction. Moreover, some of the messages in the manuscript are not sufficiently supported (such as &quot;homeostatic regulation&quot; in the title, which I do not think the authors have shown ).</p></disp-quote><p>We note that the manuscript is not aimed at the processes of cell envelope construction, which are already understood in great detail.

I have several serious concerns about this section: (1) on line 112-113, the statement &quot;periplasmic width were only slightly greater&quot; is a misstatement of the data; the distributions shown in the figure are almost surely statistically different. Also, a shift of 2-4 nm can be incredibly biologically important, so saying &quot;only slightly greater&quot; is misleading. To make any quantitative statement, the authors would need to perform independent biological replicates of this cryoEM experiment, and then ask whether there is a consistent shift between WT and Lpp+21 as there is obviously a lot of cell-to-cell variation.</p><p>– (2) The authors do not provide any explanation for the quantitative difference with the Asmar paper, even though the same EM group (Beeby) was doing the measurements in each case.</p></disp-quote><p>1.

We note in discussing the genetic screen that it identified all of the genes in <italic>E. coli</italic> that become essential in order to enact this homeostasis, and state that by quantitative proteomics very few proteins need to be up- or downregulated in steady-state levels in order to enact this homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several findings seem too preliminary without follow-up experiments:</p><p>– (1) It is interesting that their genetic screen indicates a compromised ability to build the PG, but this conclusion would be greatly bolstered by followup experiments such as single-cell growth during CRISPRi depletion and/or HPLC measurements of cell-wall composition.

(3) Moreover, steered molecular dynamics simulations need to be carried to ensure that the system is not stuck in a local minimum based on the initial conditions. (4) It is unclear from the writing what the authors are trying to accomplish with the MD simulations. In large part, this is because the authors have not made clear what their model is for the detrimental effects of Lpp+21.</p></disp-quote><p>We address these points by number.</p><p>1) Because we are simulating only a very tiny portion of the membrane, we did not account for heterogeneity in the protein and LPS concentrations. This is now noted in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) Plots of the angles over time, from which the averages and standard deviations were derived, are now included as a supplemental figure. We also modified how we measured the angle to correct for an error due to wrapped coordinates; we note this primarily affected the Lpp+21 w/OmpA simulation.

Specifically, we determined the free energy as a function of the distance between the cell wall and outer membrane with two Lpp trimers bridging them. As can be seen in Gumbart et al.,. Lpp positions peptidoglycan at the AcrA-TolC interface in the AcrAB-TolC multidrug efflux pump. Biophys. J. In press., the free energy minimum agrees with the position from our equilibrium simulations. We also note that there are no barriers nor other features in the PMF that would indicate it is trapped in a local minimum in our equilibrium simulations.

Thus, in the revised Results text we make clear that we did not assume that different bacterial species would have periplasms of the same size, but started with the question: Over what size range does Lpp range across species?

They do this by studying the adaptive response of cells when a lengthened version of the Lpp protein (Lpp21+) is used to tether the outer membrane with the peptidoglycan layer. Lpp21+ has been used previously as a model system, and in these studies, it was largely assumed to increase the distance between the outer membrane and peptidoglycan. In the presented study, the authors use proteomics, a synthetic lethal screen, and molecular dynamic simulations to probe the adaptive response. They note that lengthening Lpp does not change the spatial constrain in the periplasm, but that a number of adaptive responses can be observed, which help to understand how periplasmic homeostasis is maintained.</p><p>On the whole, the authors have addressed the vast majority of comments and concerns raised by the 3 referees in the first round of review. This has improved the manuscript. However, two points remain unresolved, which the editor needs to consider.</p><p>1. The initial review noted that the study &quot;is limited to reporting correlative associations with the observed phenotypes, and definitive mechanistic evidence would be needed to support the conclusions.&quot; This point was strongly refuted by the authors in the revision.</p><p>On this point I agree with the initial review. The study has used omics approaches and MD simulations to probe the adaptive response of the cells to the presence of Lpp21+.

Rather I feel that the study provides plausible explanations and hypotheses as to how E. coli maintains periplasmic homeostasis, which is valuable information for the community.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful assessment of our revised manuscript.

The initial review raised concern that some of the phenotypes of the Lpp21+ expressing strain are caused by the ~8-fold reduced copy number, rather than the extension in protein linker length.

(PMID: 29257832) do not directly quantitate data on the levels of the Lpp+21 protein and do not measure this relative to the wild-type Lpp. The only data dealing with this point is presented as Figure S5B, which does demonstrate that all of the Lpp isoforms have similar PG connectivity but does not address the steady-state levels of Lpp versus Lpp+21. The method of loading of the gel is unclear, with no loading controls used to interpret the relative levels of Lpp and Lpp+21 – no quantification of the levels of Lpp isoforms was presented. Furthermore, in the figure there is arguably a minor reduction in the levels of the two longer versions.</p><p>Due to this apparent discrepancy, we ensured that we used appropriate loading controls in our gels and WBs (Figure 1B), and furthermore, we confirmed our observed reduction with proteomics.</p><p>While, we cannot rule out that minor differences in methodology used in the construction of the lpp+21 &quot;knock-in&quot; mutant strains in our study and the Asmar study may result in expression differences or transcript stability, our transcriptomics data do not support this. The transcriptomics shown in table S6 do not show a reduction in lpp transcripts compared to WT. The resulting sequence and structure of the Lpp+21 protein expressed from the modified genes should be identical in both studies.</p><p>We have better clarified the differences in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, a concern that I had, related to the point above is that the study assumes that the 8-fold reduction in levels of Lpp21+ are an adaptive response that helps maintain periplasmic homeostasis (see abstract). They do not exclude the possibility that the engineered protein is subject to proteolysis because it is not native.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point – there is a possibility that the longer &quot;synthetic&quot; version of Lpp is more unstable and/or degraded more readily. It’s worth noting that the transcription level of lpp was not reduced (table S6), suggesting that either: (i) the protein is less &quot;stable&quot; or; (ii) the protein is &quot;targeted&quot; for degradation in response to the stretching or; (iii) that the modified transcript is translated less efficiently.</p><p>We have clarified this in the discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To summarise, I think that the study is an interesting and important contribution to the field, but that the authors need to be more conservative in the conclusions that they draw. For example, they need to provide some discussion as to the limitations of their study, and the differences with other published work (point 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified and amended the discussions to better describe the limitation of the present study and attempt to outline the key differences with previous studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors addressed my concerns about the initial manuscript and submitted a substantially improved revised version. In particular, they now clarify that the 8-fold reduced cell copy number of Lpp+21 could be responsible of some of the phenotypes observed. My remaining doubt is that the observed changes in cell envelope properties (softer outer membrane, increased blebbing) and the altered essentiality of genes could be similar in cells that lack Lpp or that have 8-fold less wild-type Lpp. Overall, I am now more positive about the revised manuscript as it clarifies the question about the periplasmic widths of cells with an elongated Lpp, which has not been fully addressed in previous papers. The work by Mandela et al. provides an interesting and important analysis of how a Gram-negative bacterium maintains a largely functional cell envelope (biogenesis) upon severe disturbance in the linkage between the two key components, the peptidoglycan layer and outer membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful assessment of our revised manuscript. We agree that we can not rule out the effect that reduction in Lpp copy number may have on the cells. In revision, we have clarified that this is a limitation of the data, but it is an important finding due to the potential implication on previous studies using the Lpp+21 isoform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The revision by Mandela et al. addresses some but not all of the comments and suggestions that I and the other reviewers introduced in the our initial review. In particular, they have clarified the differences (or lack thereof) with Asmar et al. in terms of the periplasmic width changes due to Lpp+21. Moreover, they have helped to clarify some of the differences between their experiments and others such as the growth defect in ∆mrcB with lpp mutants, though I was surprised that they did not simply do the experiment to test whether their explanation (difference in growth media) was the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now conducted this experiment and included it in as a supplemental figure. In our synthetic screen the initial selections were done on LB media with antibiotics before testing in minimal media. Both the ΔmrcB lpp<sup>+21</sup> and ΔmrcA lpp<sup>+21</sup> were able to be recovered from the initial double antibiotic selection on LB and could grow on LB agar plates, albeit with an apparent minor growth defect (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of my major criticisms in the initial review persists – that there are interesting conclusions that emerge from the screen of the Keio collection, but none of these results are followed up on, and hence I am left with the question of to what extent any of these phenotypes are direct. I had suggested investigating one in detail using e.g. CRISPRi knockdown in order to examine single-cell phenotypes during depletion of a now-essential protein in the lpp+21 background, but this was not done. Thus, while I find the topic of their paper generally interesting and well motivated, I am left unsatisfied with some of the major conclusions of their paper.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that it would be interesting, the proposed experiment is beyond the scope of the present study. However, it could form the basis of a subsequent manuscript. Many studies using the KEIO mutant library do not (and realistically could not) follow up on all &quot;hits&quot; with a conditional single cell knockdown experiments. This represents a significant amount of work, and we cannot recall any study where synthetic lethal screens were routinely investigated via such silencing methods.</p><p>We confirmed all “hits” by generating independent mutants of all relevant double knockouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, many of the conclusions of their paper remain to be fully justified. For instance: in their abstract:</p><p>&quot;…impacts the load-bearing capacity of the outer membrane&quot;: this is not something that they show to be true in their paper, it is an inference from another paper, and there is nothing in this work that directly addresses load bearing. I don't think they have shown adequately that the combination of tilting and reduced Lpp abundance is the cause of reduced load bearing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the relevant text to avoid making this claim throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;E. coli homeostatically counteracts periplasmic enlargement by tilting Lpp and reducing Lpp abundance&quot;: I still don't see how there is any homeostasis here, since they are now emphasizing that Lpp+21 does in fact change periplasmic width.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the title, abstract and discussions to removed and/or toned down any reference to a &quot;homeostatic&quot; regulatory mechanism throughout the manuscript and have sought to place more emphasis on the cellular &quot;adaptation&quot; or &quot;response&quot; to the Lpp+21 protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, they have not shown that the reduced Lpp abundance is a cause – what happens if you increase Lpp+21 abundance via inducible expression.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study there was a reduction in the steady state protein level of Lpp+21 compared to Lpp. We have also demonstrated that this was not due to reduced transcription of lpp+21, indeed transcriptomic data (table S6) showed an increased level of lpp+21 transcripts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 158: note that I do not believe it has been established that stiffness of E. coli is always associated with OMV production – I would not make claims based on this hypothesized connection.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not suggesting that all things that effect cell stiffness affect OMV production, just that there is a documented correlation between reduced cell stiffness and OMV production. Thus we sought to investigate OMV production in our lpp mutant strain. We have clarified the relevant sentence to better represent our intent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 2 title: there is no data here that shows that Lpp+21 cells have a softened OM.</p></disp-quote><p>The title to better represent the data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
