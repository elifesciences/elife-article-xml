For perfect images, light needs to be able to pass through the sample, the material (or “mounting medium”) that holds the sample in place, and finally the image-detecting equipment in a straight line. However, in practice, light rays often deviate away from this line because they move at different speeds in different materials; how much the speed of light changes is related to a property called the refractive index of the material. This is exactly the effect that causes a stick stuck into water to look bent at the water’s surface. In light microscopy, mismatches in refractive index significantly reduce quality of the images that can be obtained.</p><p>Live specimens are particularly challenging to image because different specimens have very different refractive indices compared to the mounting medium, which holds specimens in place but must also keep them alive. Although the addition of chemical compounds can theoretically match the refractive index of the mounting medium to that of the specimen, this approach has so far not been practical because such manipulations tend to kill the specimen. An important challenge has therefore been to identify a compound that can adjust, or “tune”, the refractive index of mounting media over a wide range, yet without harming the specimens.</p><p>Now, Boothe et al. have identified a chemical called Iodixanol as an ideal and easy to use supplement for tuning the refractive index of water-based live imaging media. Adding Iodixanol to the mounting media did not appear to have any toxic effects on cell cultures, developing zebrafish embryos or regenerating planarian flatworms. Importantly, Boothe et al. found that Iodixanol significantly improved the quality of the images collected from all of these different specimens.</p><p>It is important to stress that Iodixanol does not change the refractive index of the sample or cancel out refractive index differences within the sample – so it cannot render opaque specimens transparent. Nevertheless, Iodixanol supplementation is a simple and affordable technique to improve image quality in any live imaging application without having to resort to more expensive and highly specialized microscopes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27240.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27240.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Planaria</kwd><kwd>confocal microscopy</kwd><kwd>refractive index matching</kwd><kwd>live-imaging</kwd><kwd>organoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Individual research support programs</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boothe</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name><name><surname>Hilbert</surname><given-names>Lennart</given-names></name><name><surname>Heide</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name><name><surname>Berninger</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name><name><surname>Huttner</surname><given-names>Wieland B</given-names></name><name><surname>Zaburdaev</surname><given-names>Vasily</given-names></name><name><surname>Vastenhouw</surname><given-names>Nadine L</given-names></name><name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>Eugene W</given-names></name><name><surname>Drechsel</surname><given-names>David N</given-names></name><name><surname>Rink</surname><given-names>Jochen C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Systems Biology, Dresden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ELBE Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boothe</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name><name><surname>Hilbert</surname><given-names>Lennart</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008662</institution-id><institution>Joachim Herz Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Add-on Fellowship in Systems Biology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boothe</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Iodixanol supplementation provides a simple method for tuning the refractive index of live imaging media, which can greatly improve resolution and penetration depth in live imaging experiments.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Live imaging is a key tool in understanding the organization and function of cells, tissues and organisms, since it allows the visualization of dynamic processes within their native environment. However, in practice, the live-imaging of multi-layered tissues with different cell types often poses major challenges. Refractive index mismatches between tissue and surrounding medium result in spherical aberrations that misalign the optical paths and ultimately distort and attenuate the microscopic image. This effect increases with complexity and thickness of the specimen, making imaging in deep tissue layers difficult and technically demanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Microscope optimization constitutes a first approach to optimize deep imaging. 2-photon microscopy greatly improves depth penetration by excitation with low scattering, near-infrared wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>). However, 2-photon microscopy cannot alleviate spherical aberration effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>). These can be partially compensated by the recent introduction of adaptive optics microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Booth, 2014</xref>), yet at the cost of reduced image acquisition rates and the need for intense excitation light. A second approach to improving depth penetration is the direct adjustment of the refractive indexes (RI) of sample and environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>). Indeed, recently developed optical clearing techniques can render tissues effectively transparent by equilibrating refractive index heterogeneity within biological samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hama et al., 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, these protocols remain limited to fixed specimens due to their reliance on harsh mounting conditions and/or toxic chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Towards the goal of developing an RI matching medium for live-imaging, we searched for compounds that combine high water solubility as prerequisite for dilution into regular culture media, dilution-dependent RI tuning for effectiveness with a wide range of specimens and finally low toxicity as crucial requirement for live-imaging compatibility. The compound Iodixanol, which was originally developed as an intravenous X-ray contrast agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrechtsson et al., 1992</xref>) and widely used in density gradient applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bettinger et al., 2002</xref>), appeared to have many of the desired properties. Commercially available under the brand name OptiPrep<sup>(TM)</sup>, Iodixanol is optically clear and displays a high refractive index of 1.429 as a 60% stock solution, likely at least in parts due to its high density. This value is close to the refractive index of popular fixed tissue clearing solutions such as FocusClear (RI 1.47) or CLARITY (RI 1.45) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>), and Iodixanol has in fact been used in such protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ku et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>As first test of its principal suitability, we evaluated the physicochemical properties of Iodixanol solutions. As Iodixanol is highly water-soluble, simple dilution into aqueous solutions can be used to linearly tune the refractive index of the solutions between RI 1.333 – RI 1.429 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For water, PBS and culture media of aquatic model organisms, the medium only minimally affected the refractive index at a given Iodixanol concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Further, we found the temperature dependent change in refractive index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beysens and Calmettes, 1977</xref>) of Iodixanol solutions to be minimal within physiologically relevant temperature ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), allowing the use of the same medium at multiple temperatures. Organisms are often immobilized in agarose for live imaging. Agarose polymerization was not prevented at any Iodixanol concentration and agarose concentrations in ranges used for specimen immobilization did not significantly affect the refractive index of Iodixanol solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), thus making Iodixanol compatible with agarose embedding protocols. A further important requirement especially for fluorescence-based live imaging applications is low autofluorescence. A spectral emission scan of Iodixanol solutions at the commonly used excitation wavelengths of 405, 488, 560 and 640 nm failed to reveal significant autoflorescence in comparison with PBS or highly diluted fluorescent beads as negative or positive controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). pH buffering capacity is a further important consideration for potential media supplements. pH titration curves demonstrate that Iodixanol solutions have no significant pH buffering capabilities within the physiological relevant pH range of pH 4 – pH 9, especially in comparison with PBS as classical physiological buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). In fact, Iodixanol is only a slightly stronger acid than water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Finally, many optical clearing agents, such as Sca<italic>l</italic>eA2, have a high intrinsic osmolality that makes the reagent intrinsically live specimen incompatible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ke et al., 2013</xref>). 60% OptiPrep stock solution displays an osmolality of 212 ± 2 mmol/kg, which is below the typical 290–300 mmol/kg of vertebrate cell culture media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). Further, we measured a linear increase of media osmolality across a dilution series with increasing Iodixanol concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). This means that the contribution of Iodixanol to overall media osmolality can be offset by a corresponding decrease in media salt concentration (e.g., NaCl).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27240.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Physicochemical properties of the refractive index matching agent Iodixanol.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>).

As expected, tuning of the refractive index of the bead solution to that of the used silicon immersion oil (RI = 1.40), greatly improved both the lateral and axial image resolution compared to controls mounted in conventional aqueous media (RI = 1.33; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g,h</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Overall, the physicochemical properties of Iodixanol are therefore ideally suitable for refractive index tuning of live imaging media.</p><p>However, toxicity is a further crucial concern in live imaging applications. We therefore quantitatively assessed the health of a range of typical specimens under extended Iodixanol exposure. We first measured the growth rates of human HeLa cell cultures exposed to various concentrations of Iodixanol 24 hr after seeding. Our quantitative measurements failed to detect any Iodixanol concentration dependent effects on HeLa cell proliferation or cell death up to three days after plating, even at the highest tested concentration of 30% Iodixanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, a concentration of 30% Iodixanol (RI = 1.380) is higher than the optimal Iodixanol concentration required for HeLa cells. In absence of any toxicity indications, we carried out all subsequent toxicity assessments at the optimal Iodixanol concentration for the respective specimens (please see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for a guide on how to determine a specimen’s optimal Iodixanol concentration).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27240.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Iodixanol is live specimen compatible.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Iodixanol does not affect growth and cell death levels in cultured HeLa cells.

At 72 hr post fertilization, all embryos developing in Iodixanol displayed normal motility, muscle contractions and body pigmentation. Further, we found survival rates and the head to tail length as measure of developmental growth to be indistinguishable from controls, indicating that Iodixanol exposure over three days of development neither overtly affected development nor survival of zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><p>To assess potential long-term effects of Iodixanol exposure on dynamic tissue-level processes, we mounted regeneration-competent tissue fragments of planarian flatworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rink, 2013</xref>) in 50 % w/v Iodixanol. Remarkably, even after 3 weeks of continuous exposure to a high concentration of Iodixanol, the specimens were healthy, had regenerated morphologically normal heads and succeeded in restoring normal body plan proportions as quantified by length to width ratio and projected area in a manner indistinguishable from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

As reference point we used a current state of the art spinning disc confocal microscope with silicone immersion oil objectives. The refractive index of silicone oil, RI = 1.406 closely matches typical live specimens and its introduction has afforded a substantial improvement in live imaging quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">York et al., 2012</xref>). We started our investigations at the smallest functional scale by imaging clusters of cultured primary zebrafish cells. In unsupplemented mounting media, the structure of nuclear chromatin was indiscernible in cells located ‘behind’ the first layer along the z-axis. Tuning the mounting media RI to 1.362 reduced the degradation of image resolution for such cells, demonstrating improvements in high resolution imaging of multi-layered cell culture applications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Organoids, which are currently emerging as an important ex vivo model of organ development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Simian and Bissell, 2017</xref>), represent an imaging challenge at a larger functional scale. Human cerebral organoids appear opaque due to the optical density of neuronal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref>). Consequently, conventional single photon microscopy cannot penetrate significantly beyond 20 µm depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). By mounting organoids (67 days aged) in Iodixanol supplemented culture media (RI = 1.363), we doubled the penetration depth to ~40 µm as a consequence of improved signal to noise ratios at depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Iodixanol supplementation thus improves depth penetration in organoid imaging.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27240.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Refractive index tuning with Iodixanol improves live-imaging of tissue culture systems.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>).

Although these animals are widely studied as models of whole body regeneration, live imaging of planarian regeneration has so far not been possible. Even unpigmented species like <italic>Dendrocoelum lacteum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) are optically highly opaque, such that live imaging is largely restricted to the outermost cell layer (the epithelium; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). By tuning the refractive index of the embedding medium to RI 1.412, we could partially compensate the opaque appearance of the specimen and significantly improve both signal detection and the overall signal to noise ratio in deeper cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

We show that the reduction of spherical aberrations between sample and mounting media by refractive index tuning provides substantial improvements in achievable imaging depth in planaria, zebrafish and human organoids, as well as improved spatial resolution in cell culture applications. Refractive index tuning with Iodixanol therefore enables alignment of an important aspect of the optical axis in live specimens that could so far only be compensated in fixed specimens. What Iodixanol supplementation cannot correct for are refractive index differences within the specimen, such as between neighboring cells or between organelles and surrounding cytoplasm. Such effects are likely responsible for the fact that planarians and organoids appear optically opaque despite lacking pigmentation. Even though Iodixanol can therefore not achieve the <italic>in-toto</italic> RI matching of fixed tissue protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Richardson and Lichtman, 2015</xref>), our results nevertheless demonstrate substantial imaging improvements even in the case of opaque specimens.

Embryos were mounted in hanging drops of liquid mounting medium in ibidi glass bottom dishes (35 mm diameter, 0.17 mm coverslip), and inverted and submerged in liquid medium for imaging.</p><p>For zebrafish cell culture, embryos were dissociated into individual cells in 55 mM NaCl, 1.75 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10% glycerol solution by vortexing in low retention micro-centrifuge tubes. The cell suspension was centrifuged (400 g, 1 min), supernatant aspirated and replaced with 110 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 2.7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM Tris/Cl (pH 8.5), 10% glycerol solution. After further centrifugation (400 g, 1 min), supernatant replaced with DPBS with 0.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> added. This suspension was centrifuged (400 g, 1 min), the supernatant replaced with ~20 µl liquified agarose-based cell culture medium (liquified at 70°C and held at 38°C) and the cell pellet mechanically resuspended with a plastic micropipette tip. Liquid culture medium with suspended cells was transferred with the same micropipette tip onto the coverslip of an ibidi glass bottom dish. The still liquid mounting medium droplet was sandwiched with an additional 18 mm diameter round coverslip. After about 3 min the added coverslip was mechanically held down while applying 1 ml additional mounting medium. The imaging dish was then capped and sealed airtight with parafilm to prevent evaporation. Dissociation, mounting and imaging were carried out at room temperature without cooling or heating.</p><p>Control zebrafish cell culture medium was DPBS with 0.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. RI-matched medium was prepared in several steps, starting with 0.7X Dulbecco-PBS, 20% Iodixanol, 0.8 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Osmolality was then lowered to 5 mOsm/kg of control medium as a reference by addition of distilled water and repeated osmolality measurement. The RI was then lowered to within 0.003 of the cytoplasmic RI (1.3615, determined by phase contrast microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Oster, 1956</xref>]) by addition of control medium and repeated RI measurement (refractometer, 25°C). Control and RI-matched media were divided into 2 ml aliquots in microcentrifuge tubes, supplemented with 0.7% UltraPure (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat No.: 16520050) low melting point agarose. Tubes were closed airtight and heated to 70°C for at least 1 hr, and could then be stored at 4°C for a month at minimum. For DNA staining, Hoechst 33342 stock (5 mg/ml) was spiked into mounting medium aliquots at 1:2000 (v/v) ratio before mounting.</p><p>Human cerebral organoids were generated from human iPSC line SC102A-1 (System Biosciences) and cultured according to previously published protocols with minor modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lancaster and Knoblich, 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camp et al., 2015</xref>). The culture media was replaced with an 18% Iodixanol/media v/v solution 24 hr prior imaging to match the refractive index of the tissue. 2 hr prior imaging this solution was supplemented with 5 µg/ml Hoechst 34580 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat No. H21486) to stain nuclei. Organoids were mounted in 1% SeaPlaque agarose for imaging.</p><p>The experiments performed with live samples did not require ethical approval according to German law.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Imaging</title><p>Autofluorescence of Iodixanol and control solutions was measured on a Tecan Spark 20M plate reader. Fluorescence was measured at 405, 488, 560 and 640 nm excitation. The emission signals were detected by emission spectra scans starting at 440, 520, 592 and 670 nm respectively. Scans were performed in 2 nm intervals.</p><p>HeLa cell proliferation and death was monitored using a Cell Voyager 7000 spinning disc high throughput confocal system (Yokogawa Electric Cooperation). H2B-mCherry was excited with a 561 nm solid state laser and the emission signal was detected with a 600/37 nm bandpass filter. DRAQ7 was illuminated with a 640 nm solid state laser and emission was detected with a 676/29 nm bandpass filter. Imaging was performed with a 10x UPlSApo NA 0.4 air objective.</p><p>Fluorescent images of all other experiments were acquired on an Andor Revolution WD Borealis confocal spinning disc system. The Olympus IX83 stand was equipped with an Andor iXon Ultra 888 EMCCD for image acquisition. In vitro point spread functions were determined with an Olympus 100x NA 1.35 Sil UPlanSApo objective. For planarian, zebrafish embryo and organoid imaging an Olympus 30x UPlan SApo NA 1.05 Sil objective was used. Imaging of cultured zebrafish cells was performed with an Olympus 60x UPlan SApo NA 1.30 Sil objective. For Hoechst imaging a 405 nm laser diode was used in combination with 452/45 bandpass filter to detect the emission light. Green fluorescence of TetraSpeck beads was excited with a 488 nm laser diode and emission was collected with a 525/50 bandpass filter. RFP was illuminated with a 561 nm laser diode and the emission was detected with a 607/36 bandpass filter. RedDot1 was excited with a 640 nm laser diode and the emission was detected with a 685/40 bandpass filter. All filters were produced by Semrock.</p><p>In all comparisons between refractive index matched media to control conditions identical illumination (laser power) and detection parameters (exposure time) were used on identical hardware setups (objective, immersion silicone oil, filters, camera).</p><p>Regenerating <italic>Dendrocoelum lacteum</italic> were imaged on a Nikon AZ 100M widefield microscope stand equipped with dark field illumination and a Nikon AZ Plan Fluor 2x NA 0.2 lens mounted.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.

This requires determination of the effects of iodixanol concentration on resolution as a function of depth for media and water. In addition, quantifying the effects of various iodixanol concentrations as a function of time of exposure (both time and light exposure) on cell division and death rates, as well as embryo growth and normal development is absolutely critical for validation of the method. Proper statistical analysis of these results will be of utmost importance.</p><p>The reviewers have excellent suggestions on how to carry these suggestions out, as well as several comments on other more minor issues that will benefit the strength of the conclusions (see below).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Rink and colleagues describe a simple method for minimizing spherical aberration that results due to refractive index mismatch at a boundary between the imaging media and live samples. The method uses a commercially available reagent, iodixanol, to index-match the media to the sample, thereby improving signal, resolution, and depth penetration in zebrafish cell culture, embryos, and planaria. Although the improvement is not dramatic, I still feel it is significant and, given the wide applicability of the method, the work seems appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I have several concerns that need to be addressed before I can recommend publication.</p><p>First, it is unclear in general to me how the matching was determined. e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, how was the concentration of iodixanol determined? The authors are vague on this point, in general: 'In this and all subsequent applications, Iodixanol concentrations were carefully titrated until optimal imaging results were achieved and thus the media's refractive index was best matched to the refractive index of the specimen.' What criteria for 'optimal imaging' was used? The methods section fails to discuss this adequately, instead referring to [biophysical methods book reference]. I'm assuming the authors meant to cite a paper here – but even better would be careful, step-by-step directions as to how to determine the optimal RI so that others can replicate the work. I suspect such a protocol would go a long way to disseminating the method.</p><p>Second, the manuscript in general suffers from a lack of quantitative detail, instead qualitatively assuring us that samples were morphologically identical, divided at the same rate, etc as controls. Please provide quantitative evidence for these claims so that we can better assess them! <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows pictures, but to my eye the planaria grown in iodixanol seem obviously smaller than the controls. We are told that the zebrafish embryos developed 'normally', but how – precisely – was 'normal' determined? The lack of quantitative detail extends to the description of the imaging improvement: 'largely abolished the degradation of image resolution for such cells'. More precision in claims like this would be helpful.</p><p>Another example – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> attempts to conclude that cultured cells are unaffected by 20% iodixanol. This conclusion is based on a visual inspection of cluster morphology under transmitted light. This is a wholly inadequate assessment of culture health. Indeed, throughout the first half of the manuscript, the authors could have and should have measured cell health using e.g. cell division rates, cell viability/vitality dyes, the levels of stress related proteins, etc. Establishing a non-cytotoxic but optically effective concentration of iodixanol (or at least an algorithm by which one can be found) is central to this work.</p><p>Furthermore all the viability work has been done on non-mammalian systems, while some of the imaging was done on human organoids. A viability study on mammalian cells would thus seem helpful.</p><p>Third, most of the imaging and biological viability work was done using 20% Iodixanol to generate a modest increase in refractive index (n=1.36). Presumably this is because the authors were trying to match the refractive index of bulk phase cytoplasm (n=1.3615, subsection “Live sample preparation”). However the refractive index of most tissues is considerably higher than that of pure cytoplasm – being influenced by, for example, the lipid and water fraction of the tissue.</p><p>This again raises the question of whether higher concentrations of iodixanol would further improve image quality and what concentrations can be tolerated by cells? What would greatly improve the quality of this manuscript is a titration of iodixanol concentration against optical aberration and biological stress/viability. Finding an optimal concentration that balances these two competing effects, or even just demonstrating an algorithm by which an optimal concentration can be found for a given biological system, would add tremendously to this work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Review of &quot;A tunable refractive index matching medium for live imaging cells, tissues and model organisms&quot; by Boothe et al.,.</p><p>This article presents a novel method for improving the resolution and useful penetration depth of fluorescence microscopy of live organisms. The authors define the rationale of the method as a well-known problem in the field of microscopy; namely, the mismatches of refractive indices (RIs) between the optical media through which the emitted fluorescence travels (cytosol, aqueous mounting media, glass coverslips, and objective immersion media) cause spherical aberration in the native images formed. This increased spherical aberration causes decreases in resolution, especially at depths far from the coverslip surface. The method presented in this paper serves as a solution to lower the effective spherical aberration of silicone oil immersion objectives by changing the RI of the media in which the live sample is mounted in order to better match the RI of the objective immersion medium. The authors demonstrate the usability of this RI-matching compound, Iodixanol, with a variety of live model organisms. The authors also demonstrate the increase in fluorescence intensity from live fluorescent organisms that are mounted in a RI-matched media, as compared with the normal aqueous media.</p><p>This article proposes a fantastic method for increasing the quality of fluorescent images of live organisms. Microscopists have been able to match RIs of fixed samples for years to increase image quality, but this is the first method detailing the possibility of RI matching in live samples with no observable effects on sample vitality. The authors comprehensively demonstrate the non-toxicity of Iodixanol on three common model organisms with varying degrees of complexity. The authors also effectively show that dilution of Iodixanol into traditional mounting media can easily tune the RI of the solution in a linear fashion, which will be useful to microscopists to easily implement with their own samples. The authors are very quantitative in their analysis of the increase in fluorescence intensity in a biological sample as a result of their RI matching method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).</p><p>However, the authors fail to quantitatively support their assertion that their RI-matching method increases the practically achievable spatial resolution (in x/y or in z) of the system. There is no measurement or mention of the point-spread function of the objective, which is the true physical definition of the resolution of a microscope. Despite quantitatively showing that the intensity of fluorescence is higher at greater depths, the authors have not shown that the full-width at half maximum intensity (FWHM) of the objective's PSF remains more consistent with their RI-matching method than with traditional mounting methods. Without these data, the claims of providing &quot;substantial improvements in achievable imaging depth&quot; are not yet validated, since a deep image with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but low spatial resolution only ameliorates one of the two main issues that results from RI-mismatched spherical aberration. The data presented are encouraging and exciting as a live-cell microscopist, but ultimately incomplete at this point with respect to the conclusions.</p><p>Before recommending this paper for publication, I would make the following suggestions for experiments:</p><p>1) A quantitative comparison of spatial resolution in three dimensions between traditional media and Iodixanol-supplemented media, using an accepted resolution standard. I would suggest sub-diffraction limit multicolor fluorescent beads (100 nm diameter for high NA) embedded in 1-2% agarose. Fluorescent images of the beads should be acquired as three-dimensional stacks (similar parameters to the images presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in order to quantify the effect that the Iodixanol has on the lateral (x/y) and axial (z) resolution of the objective. Since the beads will be below the diffraction limit, a three-dimensional gaussian intensity profile (PSF) can be fit to beads that are suspended at various depths away from the coverslip. In order to maximize the relevance of this quantification to most live-cell microscopists, I would recommend quantifying the PSFs using green (~500 nm) and red (~600 nm) fluorescence emission, as these wavelengths correspond to the two most common classes of biological fluorophores used in live-cell fluorescence microscopy (GFP and RFP). Additionally, I would recommend varying the concentration of Iodixanol in these experiments, as the refractive index matching will most likely correct for spherical aberrations at a subset of focal depths, rather than at every depth from the surface of the coverslip to the maximum working distance of the objective. I would recommend reporting the depth of the focal plane about which the spatial resolution is best for several useful concentrations of Iodixanol.</p><p>2) Perform a test of common drug solubility/activity in Iodixanol. While I am convinced of the non-toxicity of Iodixanol on vitality and growth of living organisms, many microscopists introduce inhibitory drugs into the mounting media to observe the effects that the drugs have on the organism at a sub-cellular level. Many of these microscopists would most likely not use Iodixanol in mounting media if Iodixanol inhibited the solubility or activity of their experimental drugs. I would suggest a commonly used DMSO-soluble drug, such as nocodazole, which has well-characterized organismal and sub-cellular phenotypes in many model organisms, and observe the differences (if any) of the drug's effect on the organisms' phenotype compared to traditional mounting media supplemented with the drug.</p><p>3) Measure and report the following physical parameters of Iodixanol at various concentrations: viscosity, autofluorescence, dispersive properties, the pH buffering capacity, and the refractive index at various wavelengths.</p><p>4) Use a higher-resolution, oil-immersion lens (numerical aperture {greater than or equal to} 1.4) with high refractive index immersion oil (n ~= 1.5). The authors mainly focus on silicone-immersion objectives, which offer greater working distance but lower native resolution and brightness than high-NA objectives. Microscopists that use these objectives also experience spherical aberration; in fact, the spherical aberration more sharply affects the resolution as a function of depth. I am interested to know if this RI-matching method improves the resolution and brightness of images using high-NA objectives at depths under 10μm from the coverslip.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27240.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>There is a shared sentiment that the work is clever and the advance in terms of improving live 3D imaging is potentially very important, but the results are quite preliminary in terms of thorough quantitative validation, and thus it will require quite a bit of work to bring it up to the level of eLife.</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewers and the editorial team for a constructive and competent <italic>eLife</italic> review round.

Specifically, we i) quantified growth dynamics and cell death in mammalian cell culture; ii) quantified head-tail length in developing zebrafish embryos as integrative measure of growth and development; iii) quantified body plan proportions and plan area as integrative measure of flatworm regeneration efficiency. None of these assays revealed significant discrepancies between controls and Iodixanol-treated specimens, which is why we can confidently state that Iodixanol supplementation has no overt toxicity in a wide range of model systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>3) Quantitative demonstration of resolution improvements: We have added substantial new data, specifically in vitro and in vivo-determined point spread functions. The new data quantitatively demonstrates the improvement of image resolution by Iodixanol supplementation both in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p><italic>The reviewers have excellent suggestions on how to carry these suggestions out, as well as several comments on other more minor issues that will benefit the strength of the conclusions (see below).</italic> </p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>In this manuscript, Rink and colleagues describe a simple method for minimizing spherical aberration that results due to refractive index mismatch at a boundary between the imaging media and live samples.

We now provide a formula which describes the desired concentration of Iodixanol when the RI of the specimen is known. For samples with unknown RI we describe a method for RI determination initially described by Oster et al., (Physical techniques in biological research: Cells and Tissues. Volume 3, 1956) which is based on phase contrast imaging. We generated a methodological scheme for these procedures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and described it in detail in the methods section and in the figure legend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>Second, the manuscript in general suffers from a lack of quantitative detail, instead qualitatively assuring us that samples were morphologically identical, divided at the same rate, etc as controls.

For planaria, we now quantified both the length to width ratio as well as the area of regenerating posterior body pieces in Iodixanol and control conditions. As now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, there is no significant difference in the reestablishment of body plan proportions during regeneration in Iodixanol compared to control fragments.

As now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, we could not observe any concentration dependent effects of Iodixanol on cell proliferation or cell death, which now quantitatively demonstrates a lack of adverse effects on cell growth.</p><p> <italic>Third, most of the imaging and biological viability work was done using 20% Iodixanol to generate a modest increase in refractive index (n=1.36). Presumably this is because the authors were trying to match the refractive index of bulk phase cytoplasm (n=1.3615, subsection “Live sample preparation”). However the refractive index of most tissues is considerably higher than that of pure cytoplasm – being influenced by, for example, the lipid and water fraction of the tissue.</italic> </p><p> <italic>This again raises the question of whether higher concentrations of iodixanol would further improve image quality and what concentrations can be tolerated by cells? What would greatly improve the quality of this manuscript is a titration of iodixanol concentration against optical aberration and biological stress/viability. Finding an optimal concentration that balances these two competing effects, or even just demonstrating an algorithm by which an optimal concentration can be found for a given biological system, would add tremendously to this work.</italic> </p><p>First, this point was the second reason for measuring the growth of HeLa cells under a range of Iodixanol concentrations. As we could not detect any concentration dependent effect of Iodixanol on cell proliferation and death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), these data indicate that there are no strong penalties associated with increasing Iodixanol concentrations, which is not so surprising given that this compound has been used for vital imaging of the human brain. Importantly, we used Iodixanol concentrations of up to 30%, which is above the optimal HeLa target concentration of ≈ 20% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, we now also provide a scheme which describes a method inspired by Oster et al., in which phase contrast imaging can be used to determine the Iodixanol concentration required to image the sample at RI-matched conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these two additions to the manuscript now accomplish the requested user guide for determining the optimal concentration of Iodixanol.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Review of &quot;A tunable refractive index matching medium for live imaging cells, tissues and model organisms&quot; by Boothe et al.,.</italic> </p><p> <italic>This article presents a novel method for improving the resolution and useful penetration depth of fluorescence microscopy of live organisms. The authors define the rationale of the method as a well-known problem in the field of microscopy; namely, the mismatches of refractive indices (RIs) between the optical media through which the emitted fluorescence travels (cytosol, aqueous mounting media, glass coverslips, and objective immersion media) cause spherical aberration in the native images formed. This increased spherical aberration causes decreases in resolution, especially at depths far from the coverslip surface. The method presented in this paper serves as a solution to lower the effective spherical aberration of silicone oil immersion objectives by changing the RI of the media in which the live sample is mounted in order to better match the RI of the objective immersion medium. The authors demonstrate the usability of this RI-matching compound, Iodixanol, with a variety of live model organisms. The authors also demonstrate the increase in fluorescence intensity from live fluorescent organisms that are mounted in a RI-matched media, as compared with the normal aqueous media.</italic> </p><p> <italic>This article proposes a fantastic method for increasing the quality of fluorescent images of live organisms. Microscopists have been able to match RIs of fixed samples for years to increase image quality, but this is the first method detailing the possibility of RI matching in live samples with no observable effects on sample vitality. The authors comprehensively demonstrate the non-toxicity of Iodixanol on three common model organisms with varying degrees of complexity. The authors also effectively show that dilution of Iodixanol into traditional mounting media can easily tune the RI of the solution in a linear fashion, which will be useful to microscopists to easily implement with their own samples. The authors are very quantitative in their analysis of the increase in fluorescence intensity in a biological sample as a result of their RI matching method (Figure C,D).</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the positive assessment of our work.</p><p> <italic>However, the authors fail to quantitatively support their assertion that their RI-matching method increases the practically achievable spatial resolution (in x/y or in z) of the system. There is no measurement or mention of the point-spread function of the objective, which is the true physical definition of the resolution of a microscope. Despite quantitatively showing that the intensity of fluorescence is higher at greater depths, the authors have not shown that the full-width at half maximum intensity (FWHM) of the objective's PSF remains more consistent with their RI-matching method than with traditional mounting methods. Without these data, the claims of providing &quot;substantial improvements in achievable imaging depth&quot; are not yet validated, since a deep image with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but low spatial resolution only ameliorates one of the two main issues that results from RI-mismatched spherical aberration. The data presented are encouraging and exciting as a live-cell microscopist, but ultimately incomplete at this point with respect to the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>Absolutely, we fully agree and have added extensive quantitative data on the resolution effects of Iodixanol supplementation (see below).</p><p> <italic>Before recommending this paper for publication, I would make the following suggestions for experiments:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) A quantitative comparison of spatial resolution in three dimensions between traditional media and Iodixanol-supplemented media, using an accepted resolution standard. I would suggest sub-diffraction limit multicolor fluorescent beads (100 nm diameter for high NA) embedded in 1-2% agarose. Fluorescent images of the beads should be acquired as three-dimensional stacks (similar parameters to the images presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in order to quantify the effect that the Iodixanol has on the lateral (x/y) and axial (z) resolution of the objective. Since the beads will be below the diffraction limit, a three-dimensional gaussian intensity profile (PSF) can be fit to beads that are suspended at various depths away from the coverslip. In order to maximize the relevance of this quantification to most live-cell microscopists, I would recommend quantifying the PSFs using green (~500 nm) and red (~600 nm) fluorescence emission, as these wavelengths correspond to the two most common classes of biological fluorophores used in live-cell fluorescence microscopy (GFP and RFP). Additionally, I would recommend varying the concentration of Iodixanol in these experiments, as the refractive index matching will most likely correct for spherical aberrations at a subset of focal depths, rather than at every depth from the surface of the coverslip to the maximum working distance of the objective. I would recommend reporting the depth of the focal plane about which the spatial resolution is best for several useful concentrations of Iodixanol.</italic> </p><p>Done and thanks for these insightful suggestions. We have now quantified resolution in vitro and in vivo and the added data demonstrate quantitatively that RI tuning indeed enhances the spatial resolution.</p><p>Firstly, as suggested by the reviewer we now compare in our in vitro experiments sub diffraction sized beads mounted in aqueous agarose (RI = 1.333) with beads mounted in RI-matched agarose tuned to the specific RI of the silicon immersion oil used for imaging (RI = 1.401). RI matching leads to a narrower PSF with a significantly higher intensity and an improved resolution in both lateral (328 ± 15 vs 254 ± 5 nm) and axial (886 ± 26 vs 576 ± 10 nm) directions at 488nm excitation. These data are now displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> along with results of improved PSFs by Iodixanol supplementation at 638 nm.</p><p>Secondly, we injected sub diffraction sized beads into live zebrafish embryos and demonstrate in vivo that lateral resolution can be significantly improved by Iodixanol supplementation especially at larger distances from the coverslip (918 ± 50 vs 792 ± 28 nm at 150µm depth, 638nm excitation). These data are now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Unfortunately, due to the fast dithering of the small beads in live samples it was impossible to record a proper PSF in axial direction. But as our in vitro data suggests, with improvement of lateral resolution an improvement of axial resolution can also be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and is qualitatively demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3 —figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p> <italic>2) Perform a test of common drug solubility/activity in Iodixanol. While I am convinced of the non-toxicity of Iodixanol on vitality and growth of living organisms, many microscopists introduce inhibitory drugs into the mounting media to observe the effects that the drugs have on the organism at a sub-cellular level. Many of these microscopists would most likely not use Iodixanol in mounting media if Iodixanol inhibited the solubility or activity of their experimental drugs. I would suggest a commonly used DMSO-soluble drug, such as nocodazole, which has well-characterized organismal and sub-cellular phenotypes in many model organisms, and observe the differences (if any) of the drug's effect on the organisms' phenotype compared to traditional mounting media supplemented with the drug.</italic> </p><p>We treated HeLa cells with Nocadozole with and without Iodixanol and conclude that microtubules depolymerize even in presence of 30% Iodixanol. We did not include these data in the manuscript, as we do not want to generally rule out effects on drug efficacies on basis of n =1 and the compound screen that would be required to support this statement is clearly beyond the scope of this manuscript. On the other hand, we believe that the mention of normal agarose polymerization, growth, embryonic development and regeneration all indicate that Iodixanol does not greatly change molecular interactions.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27240.017</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>HeLa cells stably expressing H2B-mCherry were exposed to 300 nM Nocodazole for 2.5 hrs.</title><p>Nocodazole treatment leads to depolimerization of microtubules stained with 0.2 nM SiR-Tubilin in both complete media and media supplemented with 30% Iodixanol.

As a negative control we used PBS and as a positive control fluorescent bead suspensions. These data are now displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>3) The dispersive properties out of which the surface tension is for biological applications the most relevant parameter has been reported for Iodixanol (89.6 mN/m; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://goo.gl/VsCxbJ">https://goo.gl/VsCxbJ</ext-link>) and is similar to that of water (72.0 mN/m). One should consider that the surface tension of Iodixanol is concentration dependent as previously reported (DOI: 10.1183/09031936.02.00257902). We do not have the laboratory equipment to measure surface tension at various Iodixanol concentrations in biological media and refer to the mentioned sources for further details. Collectively, we did not find the dispersive properties of Iodixanol to be disadvantageous in our experiments.</p><p>4) We performed a pH-titration of Iodixanol and compared its pH buffering capacities to water and PBS. We conclude from these experiments that Iodixanol has no strong pH buffering capacity within physiological relevant pH ranges and behaves similar to the pH buffering capacity of water. These data are now displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p><p>5) Unfortunately, we do not have the technical equipment to measure the RI in dependence of the excitation wavelength. The equipment used for RI measurements measured the RI at a wavelength of 589.3 nm. We now added this important parameter to the methods section (subsection “Determination of Iodixanol’s physical prop”).</p><p> <italic>4) Use a higher-resolution, oil-immersion lens (numerical aperture {greater than or equal to} 1.4) with high refractive index immersion oil (n ~= 1.5). The authors mainly focus on silicone-immersion objectives, which offer greater working distance but lower native resolution and brightness than high-NA objectives. Microscopists that use these objectives also experience spherical aberration; in fact, the spherical aberration more sharply affects the resolution as a function of depth. I am interested to know if this RI-matching method improves the resolution and brightness of images using high-NA objectives at depths under 10μm from the coverslip.</italic></p><p>Done and this is a valid point. However, we want to highlight that the highest possible RI Iodixanol can compensate for is RI 1.43. As correctly stated by the reviewer, common oil immersion media display an RI &gt; 1.5. Iodixanol can therefore not fully compensate for spherical aberrations caused by RI mismatches between immersion oil and culture media. We performed the requested experiment at the highest Iodixanol concentration regardless using a 100x NA 1.40 objective with oil immersion (RI = 1.518). As expected the lateral resolution does only slightly improve (294 ± 10 nm vs 258 ± 7 nm) whereas no significant changes were detected in the axial resolution (696 ± 25 vs 694 ± 17 nm) at 488nm excitation. Since this is obviously a result of an insufficient RI match, we did not include the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 2</xref> in the manuscript.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27240.018</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27240.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27240.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27240-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>We conclude from these data that Iodixanol is indeed capable of improving lateral resolution at high NA Oil immersion objectives.</p><p>Finally, we also want to highlight that these data do not exclude that Iodixanol can provide a significant improvement with high NA lenses independent of the used immersion media. When additional spherical aberrations are introduced by the sample itself due to RI mismatches between sample and media we expect Iodixanol to have a major improvement on image resolution (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, we see Iodixanol in the first place as an RI matching agent to overcome RI mismatches between culture media and sample and not between culture media and objective immersion liquid, which we believe is clearly stated in the text.</p><p>Overall, we again thank our reviewers for their insightful and constructive comments. We believe that we have addressed them all, resulting in a manuscript that, in our opinion, now provides a useful resource for the life imaging research community.</p></body></sub-article></article>
