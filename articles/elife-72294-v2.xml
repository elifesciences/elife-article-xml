The App used a previously derived and internally validated model consisting of patient-specific (‘present patient’) clinical variables (age, blood in stool, vomiting, breastfeeding status, and mid-upper arm circumference) as well as location-specific viral diarrhea seasonality curves. The performance of additional models using the ‘present patient’ data combined with other external data sources including location-specific climate, data, recent patient data, and historical population-based prevalence were also evaluated in secondary analysis.

Viral-only pathogens were detected in 22% of patients in Mali and 63% in Bangladesh. Rotavirus was the most common pathogen detected (16% Mali; 60% Bangladesh). The present patient+ viral seasonality model had an AUC of 0.754 (0.665–0.843) for the sites combined, with calibration-in-the-large <italic>α</italic> = −0.393 (−0.455––0.331) and calibration slope <italic>β</italic> = 1.287 (1.207–1.367).

In low- and middle-income countries with limited health care resources, it can be deadly. Diarrhea can be caused by infections with viruses or bacteria. Antibiotics can treat bacterial infections, but they are not effective against viral infections.</p><p>It can often be difficult to determine the cause of diarrhea. As a result, many clinicians just prescribe antibiotics. However, since diarrhea in young children is often due to viral infections, prescribing unnecessary antibiotics can cause children to have side effects without any benefit. Excessive use of antibiotics also contributes to the development of bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, making infections harder to treat.</p><p>Scientists are working to develop mobile health tools or ‘apps’ that may help clinicians identify the cause of diarrhea. Using computer algorithms to analyze information about the patient and seasonal infection patterns, the apps predict whether a bacterial or viral infection is the likely culprit. These tools may be particularly useful in low- or middle-income country settings, where clinicians have limited access to testing for bacteria or viruses.</p><p>Garbern, Nelson et al. previously built an app to help distinguish cases of viral diarrhea in children in Mali and Bangladesh. Now, the researchers have put their app to the test in the real-world in a new group of patients to verify it works. In the experiments, nurses in Mali and Bangladesh used the app to predict whether a child with diarrhea had a viral or non-viral infection. The children’s stool was then tested for viral or bacterial DNA to confirm whether the prediction was correct. The experiments showed the app accurately identified viral cases of diarrhea.</p><p>The experiments also showed that customizing the app to local conditions may further improve its accuracy. For example, a version of the app that factored in seasonal virus transmission performed the best in Bangladesh, while a version that factored in data from recent patients in the past few weeks performed the best in Mali. Garbern and Nelson et al. are now testing whether their app could help reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics in children with diarrhea. If it does, it may help minimize antibiotic resistance and ensure more children get appropriate diarrhea care.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diarrhea</kwd><kwd>global health</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>enteropathogens</kwd><kwd>mobile health</kwd><kwd>clinical decision support</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1198876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI135114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK116163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name><name><surname>Gainey</surname><given-names>Monique</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1TR002538</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brintz</surname><given-names>Ben J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21TW010182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Eric J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A smartphone app incorporating clinical prediction models using patient-specific and location-specific data sources in a modular approach could predict viral-only etiology of diarrhea in children under five in Bangladesh and Mali.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diarrheal diseases remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children younger than five years worldwide, with approximately one billion episodes and 500,000 deaths annually. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">James et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Troeger et al., 2018</xref>. While a significant problem in all countries, the greatest burden of pediatric diarrhea exists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), primarily in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Troeger et al., 2018</xref>. Although the majority of diarrhea episodes are self-limiting and the mainstay of diarrhea treatment is rehydration, clinicians must also make decisions regarding appropriate use of diagnostics and for antibiotic prescribing. Guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) recommend against antibiotic use for the treatment of pediatric diarrhea, except for specific presentations of diarrhea such as suspicion of <italic>Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae</italic>) with severe dehydration, blood in stool, or concurrent illness such as severe malnutrition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">World Health Organization, 2005a</xref>. For the majority of diarrhea etiologies, antibiotics are not recommended, particularly for viral causes of diarrhea in which antibiotics have no benefit. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bruzzese et al., 2018</xref>. Viral pathogens such as rotavirus, sapovirus, and adenovirus, are among the top causes of diarrhea in young children in LMICs, as shown in two large multi-center studies from LMICs, the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) and the Malnutrition and Enteric Disease (MAL-ED) study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kotloff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Platts-Mills et al., 2018</xref>.</p><p>Laboratory testing by culture or molecular assays are often impractical when treating children with diarrhea in the majority of LMIC clinical settings due to time and resource constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bebell and Muiru, 2014</xref>. As a result, clinicians often make decisions regarding antibiotic use based on non-evidence-based assumptions or broad syndromic guidelines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kotloff, 2017</xref>. Unfortunately, physician judgment has been shown to poorly predict etiology and need for antibiotics in diarrheal infections. For example, patients presenting to Kenyan hospitals with diarrhea showed that syndrome-based guidelines for <italic>Shigella</italic> infection led to the failure to diagnose shigellosis in nearly 90% of cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pavlinac et al., 2016</xref>. Accurate and cost-effective tools to better determine diarrhea etiology at the point-of-care without relying on laboratory tests are greatly needed to reduce antibiotic overuse while conserving scarce healthcare resources.</p><p>Electronic clinical decision support systems (CDSS) incorporating prediction models may offer a solution to the challenges of determining diarrhea etiology in low-resource settings. CDSSs have been used in high-income country (HIC) settings to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and reduce costs by avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests at the point-of-care <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bright et al., 2012</xref>. CDSSs, especially as mHealth applications on smartphone mobile devices, hold great potential for implementing sophisticated clinical prediction models that would otherwise be impossible for providers to calculate manually. These tools can also enable flexibility by clinician choice or automation to optimize the clinical algorithm based on epidemiologic and clinical factors dominant in a given location. Despite opportunities to improve clinical care in a cost-aware mindset, there remains a paucity of data on the use of CDSS for infectious disease etiology determination and to support appropriate antibiotic use in LMICs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tuon et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>Our team previously derived and internally validated a series of clinical prediction models using data from GEMS, integrating characteristics of the present patient’s diarrhea episode (patient-specific factors including age, blood in stool, vomiting, breastfeeding status, and mid-upper arm circumference) with external data sources (such as characteristics of recent patients, historical prevalence, climate, and seasonal patterns of viral diarrhea ‘viral seasonality’) in a modular approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brintz et al., 2021</xref>. The best-performing model, which used ‘present patient’+ location-specific viral seasonality data, had an internally validated area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.83 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brintz et al., 2021</xref>. The objective of this study was to prospectively externally validate the models for the prediction of viral-only etiology of diarrhea in children aged 0–59 months in Bangladesh and Mali and demonstrate a proof-of concept for the incorporation of the primary model (‘present patient’+ location-specific viral seasonality) into a mobile CDSS software application (‘App’) for use in LMIC settings with high diarrheal disease burden.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>A prospective, observational cohort study was conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh and Bamako, Mali.

Briefly, a series of five models predicting viral etiology were independently developed based on the hypothesis that including location-specific ‘external’ data sources (i.e. characteristics such as recent patients or climate data in addition to the present patient’s characteristics), may improve predictive performance. This study team’s prior work described the development of these predictive models that integrates multiple sources of data in a principled statistical framework using a ‘post-test odds formulation’. This method incorporates observed prior knowledge of a prediction, typically using prior known location-specific prevalence (e.g. historical prevalence of viral diarrhea in Mali), as pre-test odds and then updates the pre-test odds using a single model or series of models based on current data. It also enables electronic real-time updating and flexibility in a ‘modular’ fashion, such that the component models can be flexibly included or excluded according to data availability, an important consideration for LMIC settings in which prior epidemiologic data may be unavailable. The post-test odds formulation combines the likelihood ratios derived from these independent models along with pre-test odds into a single prediction. In order to externally validate the predictions from the post-test odds, we processed the data from this study to match the variables used in previously trained models as closely as possible. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows the terminology used to refer to each model and the features included in each model.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Model terminology definitions and descriptions.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Model name</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Description and features included</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Present patient</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Random forest variable importance screening was used to screen variables for fitting a logistic regression model from the GEMS data including only five clinical variables (selected from candidate variables which would be accessible to clinicians at the point-of-care) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brintz et al., 2021</xref>.

The design herein was intended to demonstrate a ‘live’ proof-of-concept that the models could be successfully configured as a CDSS on a mobile device for high-volume clinical settings in an LMIC. The App was configured in English (Bangladesh) and French (Mali). On the input page, clinical variables were restricted to those required for the App (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Text was favored over symbology to increase clarity based on prior experience. Computations were initiated locally on the device after pressing ‘calculate’. On the output page, the patient code and randomized calculation code were used to enable joining the digital record to the paper case report form. The design objective was to identify weaknesses in the UI for data entry using paper data entry as the reference standard, and address weaknesses after the study. The code-base was allowed to be iterated once at the transition between the Bangladesh and Mali phases of the study to address engineering challenges exposed during ‘live’ deployment. The probability of a viral-alone etiology was provided, and the probabilities by model type were accessible via a drop-down menu. Data were encrypted for security on the device and upon transfer to a HIPAA compliant server. The code bases consisted of Python (server), Java (web portal interface), Android operating system, and TensorFlor Lite (TFLite) on the Android device. TFLite is an open-source cross-platform deep-learning framework. TFLite converts pre-trained models from Python in TensorFlow to a format that is optimized for speed to run models and store data on mobile devices. Therefore, all calculations were performed on-device (locally on the smartphone) and allowed App use irrespective of internet connectivity. Calculated probabilities were displayed near instantaneously (within 1 s). The App deployed a single primary model (present patient+ viral seasonality as described above) which used data collected at the point-of-care and input by the clinician user, and viral seasonality curves; climate and recent patient data sources were not included because they did not add to the AUC at the GEMS study sites. The models were not re-trained on the server after deployment for this validation study in order to align with standards of clinical practice for AI-enabled clinical decision support currently being set by Boards of Medical Informatics; according to these standards, validated models derived using machine learning should not be subsequently iterated without validation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AMIA, 2021</xref> For future iterations of the software that use models that require near real-time data input (e.g. climate data, recent patient data), the local database on the device was programmed to automatically fetch climate data and recent patient data (no PHI) from the server if the server was available. The device would also check the server for updated data on a scheduled basis (hourly) and if needed, manually fetch data when desired by the user.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>App user interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Input page after application launch.(<bold> B</bold>) Output page with an example showing calculated probability of viral-only diarrhea.

Random selection was accomplished using a black pouch filled with white and blue marbles in a preset ratio. Study nurses drew a marble each time a patient presented to the rehydration unit. If a blue marble was pulled, the patient was screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria as described above. After each marble was pulled, it was returned to the bag and shaken. An average of approximately eight patients were enrolled per working day which allowed for high-quality data collection and integrity of all study protocols to be maintained. In Mali, a consecutive sample of patients presenting with acute diarrhea were enrolled. After initial assessment by the facility doctor, children with acute diarrhea were referred to the study team for screening. Study staff were located in the intake area and potential participants’ information was recorded in a screening log. All patients presenting with diarrhea were assessed for eligibility. After screening, research staff provided the parent or guardian with information about the purpose of the study, risks and benefits in Bangla (Bangladesh) and Bambara (Mali) language. Research staff then obtained written consent if the parent or guardian agreed to participate on behalf of the child. In cases where the parent or guardian was illiterate, the consent form was marked with a thumbprint for signature, based on standards for informed consent at icddr,b and CVD-Mali. In these cases, a witness (other than study staff) also signed the consent form. If a child arrived without a parent or guardian in attendance, they were not considered for enrollment in the study.</p><p>After enrollment, study staff collected demographic, historical and clinical information from the parent or guardian. All information was collected on a paper case report form (CRF). The ‘present patient’ clinical variables were entered into the App on a mobile device (Bangladesh: Samsung Galaxy A51; Mali: Samsung Galaxy Note 10) by two different study nurses independently to ensure reliability; variables were age in months for 0–23 months and in years for 2–4 years, blood in stool since illness began, history of vomiting (three or more times a day since illness started), breastfeeding status (‘currently’), and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). During data collection, study investigators noted that nearly all participants in Bangladesh had reported ‘yes’ to the question regarding history of vomiting. Given vomiting was not expected in all patients especially those with non-viral diarrhea etiology, it was determined after speaking with the study nurses that the phrasing of the question sometimes led patients to respond ‘yes’ if there had been regurgitation with feeding or ORS administration, rather than actual vomiting. The question format was then revised for the remainder of the study enrollment in Bangladesh, and prior to any patient enrollment in Mali, to clarify the definition of vomiting. The App calculated the probabilities specific to each data source (present patient, recent patient, historical patient, climate, and viral seasonality). The model deployed on the App used the present patient and location-specific viral seasonality components along with the location-specific viral diarrhea alone prevalence from GEMS as pre-test odds.</p><p>The App results were not used for clinical decision-making to allow first for the external validation and second to iterate the software in response to engineering challenges exposed from ‘live deployment’. All patients were treated according to standard local clinical protocols, and the clinicians caring for patients were blinded to any study data collected in order to prevent any undue influence in clinical care. Study procedures were not allowed to delay any immediately necessary patient care, such as the placement of an intravenous line or delivery of intravenous fluid to the patient. As the primary outcome was determined only after all clinical enrollment and procedures concluded and laboratory analysis was not linked to predictors, all assessments of predictors and the outcome were blinded.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sample collection and laboratory procedures</title><p>The first available stool specimen after enrollment of the participant was collected. Study participation concluded after a stool sample was obtained. Nurses were unaware of the etiology of diarrhea at the time of clinical assessment as microbiological testing was conducted only after the study period concluded. Stool samples were collected in a sterile plastic container and then transferred to two separated 2 mL cryovials – one vial with 1 mL stool only and one vial for storage in 70% ethanol (Bangladesh) or 95% ethanol (Mali). Samples were stored at –20°C or –80°C freezer for processing. At the conclusion of the study, samples were thawed, underwent bead beating and nucleic acid extraction using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. Total Nucleic acid was mixed with PCR buffer and enzyme and loaded onto custom multiplex TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) containing compartmentalized probe-based quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays for 32 pathogens at the icddr,b or CVD-Mali laboratories (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> for full list of pathogen targets).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Assignment of diarrhea etiology</title><p>The outcome (dependent) variable was defined as the presence or absence of viral-only etiology. Diarrheal etiology was determined for each patient using qPCR attribution models developed previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2016</xref> Viral-only diarrhea was defined as a diarrhea episode with at least one viral pathogen with an episode-specific attributable fraction (AFe) threshold of ≥0.5 and no bacterial or parasitic pathogens with an AFe ≥0.5. This clinically relevant outcome measure was selected because patients with viral-only diarrhea should not receive antibiotics. Other etiologies were defined as having a majority attribution of diarrhea episode by at least one other non-viral pathogen. Patients without an attributable pathogen (unknown final etiology for diarrheal episode) were excluded from this analysis since the cause of the diarrheal episode could not be definitively determined. However, prior studies by this research team have shown that these cases have a similar distribution of viral predictions using a model with presenting patient information as those cases with known etiologies and this study had similar results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brintz et al., 2020</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For the primary analysis, MUAC measurements collected by the two study nurses were averaged. Patients were considered to have ‘bloody stool’ only if report from both nurses agreed on bloody stool. For children older than 2 years, age in months was rounded down to the nearest year in months (i.e. 42 months was rounded to 36 months) to match the user interface on the software. Using clinical information gathered from the data sources (present patient, recent patient, historical patient, climate, viral seasonality), predictions using post-test odds formulation with the developed models were made. The primary model deployed in the App, selected based on the best-performing model from the derivation and internal validation, used the present patient data and viral seasonality components.</p><p>Model performance for the prediction of viral-only diarrhea was calculated using AUC for each model to evaluate discrimination; calibration was assessed using calibration-in-the-large and calibration slope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Steyerberg and Vergouwe, 2014</xref>. The target for calibration slope is 1, where &lt; 1 suggests predictions are too extreme and &gt;1 suggests predictions are too moderate. The target for calibration intercept is 0, where negative values suggest overestimation and positive values suggest underestimation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Van Calster et al., 2019</xref>. We estimated the calibration coefficients by regressing predicted values versus the observed proportion of viral cases, calculated using the observed proportion of viral cases within 0.05 plus or minus the predicted probability. For the primary analysis, data from the time period using the original vomiting question in Bangladesh was excluded; however, site specific results incorporate all Bangladesh data for the purpose of highlighting the potential impact of misunderstanding of the required App input questions in real-world scenarios. The reliability of the predictor data entered independently by the two study nurses was assessed using Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ) which is a calculation of inter-observer agreement for categorical data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Secondary analysis</title><p>The performance of additional models integrating other available components was assessed in post-hoc secondary analysis for comparison.

While antibiotic use is widespread in HICs and LMICs, antibiotic overuse is particularly challenging in LMICs for a multitude of reasons including: widespread availability and unregulated sale of antibiotics, long-standing patient expectations for antibiotics, low public health knowledge of AMR, and limited diagnostic testing capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bebell and Muiru, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vila and Pal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Okeke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">World Health Organization, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein et al., 2018</xref>.

While a lack of research persists regarding CDSSs in LMICs, their use has risen recently due to the increasingly ubiquitous use of smartphones globally.

In Bangladesh, electronic CDSSs have also been shown to improve WHO diarrhea guideline adherence including reducing non-indicated antibiotic use by 28.5% in children under five <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Khan et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>While prior studies of CDSS targeting antibiotic use have focused on improving adherence to guidelines, our prediction tool provides the clinician with an estimation of viral diarrhea etiology. Such information recognizes the expertise of the end-user and augments the available information that is used in the decision-making process for antibiotic use, potentially improving trust in the tool. In addition, entry of a select few clinical variables that can be easily collected at the point-of-care into the prediction tool may enhance clinician awareness of the relevance of such factors and further increase confidence in the use of the tool. A 2021 pre-implementation workshop among health professionals in Burkina Faso aimed at developing a CDSS for appropriate antimicrobial use in West Africa found that although the tool was expected to reduce antibiotic use, the lack of epidemiologic and microbiological data and limited availability of diagnostic tests were cited as anticipated barriers to use <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Peiffer-Smadja et al., 2020</xref>. Our App provides this additional information taking local epidemiologic data into account which may increase provider buy-in toward antibiotic stewardship efforts. Our study also provides an approach by which similar models could be developed for other infectious syndromes such as respiratory and febrile illness.</p><p>A unique aspect of this study was the use of a modular approach to clinical prediction models. In this validation study, the App deployed a primary model of present patient+ viral seasonality data based on the best performing model in internal validation studies. However, the great strength of the modular approach is that it allows for customization according to data availability and local diarrhea epidemiology. In this validation study, we found that the model performance varied depending on the study site. To that end, when possible, a trial period would be prudent prior to implementation of the App to determine which model has the best performance for the selected site. In the present study, we found that the best performing models at each site had a discriminatory performance, as assessed by AUC, of 0.783 (0.705–0.86) in Mali and 0.710 (0.595–0.825) in Bangladesh. These levels of performance are comparable to that achieved in external validation of one of the most commonly-used prediction models for etiology of infection, the Centor score for streptococcal pharyngitis, which achieved an AUC of 0.72 in two separate external validation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wigton et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fine et al., 2012</xref>. Current WHO IMCI guidelines recommend use of antibiotics only for cases with bloody diarrhea or suspicion for cholera with severe dehydration, which account for less than 10% of children with diarrhea worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">World Health Organization, 2005b</xref>. In the majority of cases where antibiotics are not indicated, even a prediction rule with moderate performance would help to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use. While setting a high viral probability threshold would ensure that non-viral cases are not missed, such a threshold may not be as important if the implementation of this prediction rule is limited to children who do not qualify for antibiotics based on WHO recommendations.</p><p>Importantly, all data collection for the App was conducted by nurses, the majority of whom had never used a mobile CDSS for clinical use previously. Nurses were able to confidently use the smartphone after a relatively brief training period and enter all necessary data into the tool without difficulty in high-volume clinical settings. While the ease of use or exact time required to enter data into the App was not formally assessed in this validation study, from direct observation nurses were able to enter all required data and obtained calculated outputs within several minutes per patient. Given this time required is similar to that spent with patients during routine clinical care, we believe the App would have high clinical utility in the busy clinical settings for which it was designed. Although the calculations for the primary model deployed on the app were performed on-device, data was transmitted successfully from the App to the Cloud server, from an engineering standpoint this indicates that using real-time data sources is feasible. Additionally, the excellent reliability and agreement between nurses as well as between the App and the paper CRF reference demonstrate that accurate data collection is highly feasible in these clinical settings. Formal evaluation of the usability of the App including an assessment of user experience and metrics such as time required for data entry and for display of calculated outputs using real-time data sources are also needed.</p><p>Lastly, given the substantial drop in AUC when the vomiting question was asked incorrectly, a trial period to ensure precise understanding of the App’s questions among the target population is recommended. These findings underscore the challenges of implementing mHealth tools in diverse contexts, and the importance of ensuring cross-cultural understanding of questions by clinician and patient end-users in real-world scenarios.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our findings have several limitations. The study was conducted at study sites located in close proximity to sites from which the prediction model data were trained on. The prediction models may not therefore be generalizable to other locations, sites that have poor epidemiologic data on diarrhea etiologies, or locations that have initiated new vaccination campaigns (e.g. rotavirus). Rotavirus vaccination has not yet been introduced in Bangladesh, although a cluster randomized trial was conducted in rural Matlab in 2008–2011, and rotavirus vaccine introduction into the routine immunization program has been planned; thus, we do not expect any effect of the vaccine on the present study results for the Bangladesh study site. However, in Mali, rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the routine immunization program in 2014, as of 2019 official coverage rate was 63% in infants 12–23 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zaman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rota Council, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mali, 2019</xref>. We recognize that the App may not perform as well in places where the rotavirus vaccine has been introduced given the change in viral diarrhea epidemiology in the years since the data were collected from which the models were trained. However, there remain many countries without access to the rotavirus vaccine, notably in Asia where only a few countries have introduced the vaccine nationally or sub-nationally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rota Council, 2021</xref>. For this reason, the App may be most useful in these settings. Interestingly, the models performed better at the Mali study site compared to Bangladesh despite fairly high coverage rates of rotavirus vaccine with subsequently much lower rates of rotavirus detected on TAC PCR. These findings may indicate that the clinical features associated with viral diarrhea may be pathogen-independent, and that seasonal variations in viral diarrhea may still be relevant even when overall rates of rotavirus are substantially lower than in prior time periods. Lastly, as the rotavirus vaccine is planned to be introduced in an increasing number of countries globally, we also recognize that the model may need to be updated to account for changes in epidemiology as rotavirus vaccine is increasingly introduced and rotavirus becomes a less prominent cause of viral diarrhea.</p><p>Another limitation is that approximately one-third of patients enrolled in this study did not have diarrhea etiology assigned using the predefined threshold AFe &gt;0.5 from the TAC testing data. The much higher rate of diarrhea etiology assignment in Bangladesh compared to Mali may be partially attributable to the study being conducted during the annual rotavirus season in Bangladesh (typically November to February each year) with rotavirus strongly associated with diarrhea and therefore easier to attribute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dey et al., 2020</xref>. However, the predominance of rotavirus may limit the generalizability of this study’s findings. Additionally, given the known seasonal cycles of viral diarrhea infections, ideally, at least one full annual cycle of data would have been collected at each study site to account for seasonal variations in diarrhea epidemiology. However, funding and resource limitations, and the prioritization of including two diverse study sites precluded a longer duration of study enrollment. Notably, the occurrence of a large seasonal rotavirus peak during the data collection period in Bangladesh may be a reason why the models performed sub-optimally at this site in comparison to Mali. We believe that, had resources been available for a longer duration of study enrollment that accounted for greater seasonal variability, our models would have shown better performance characteristics than in the present analysis. Studies to further validate these models using additional study sites with different seasonal cycles of viral diarrhea over at minimum one full annual cycle are recommended. Changes over time in the epidemiology of diarrhea at the study sites as well as the internal validation being conducted in a very large dataset ( &gt; 20,000 patients) from the GEMS study compared to this study with 300 patients over a short period during a surge of rotavirus likely also contributed to the drop in AUC between the internal validation and external validation.</p><p>Lastly, there is currently no existing gold standard for threshold of AFe that should be used to assign etiology and the threshold of 0.5 was set a priori based on expert consultation; however, the effect of using this cut-off has not yet been explored. A lower AFe threshold may still indicate likely etiology of diarrhea. Notably, there were no norovirus infections detected using these pre-determined thresholds. This may have been due to the particularly high prevalence of other pathogens especially rotavirus in Bangladesh during this time period, the previously documented lower prevalence of norovirus in Bangladesh in November-January compared to other months, as well as the relatively short period of participant enrollment, although using a different AFe cutoff may have detected possible cases of norovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Satter et al., 2021</xref> .</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite these limitations, we have externally validated, in a prospective multicenter study, a smartphone-based clinical decision-support system that dynamically implements clinical prediction models based on real-time data streams.

The original GEMS samples were re-analyzed by a different group of investigators using a multiplex gastroenteritis syndromic panel to establish the 'ground truth' data upon which a random forest model was trained (Liu, Lancet, 2016). A simpler 5 feature logistic regression model was chosen using the variable weights assigned by the random forest and included only factors that would be obtainable by practitioners in real time. The final model utilized patient-intrinsic features as well as a viral seasonality model that they combined into a single prediction using a pre-determined cutoff (attributable fraction &gt; 0.5) validated in previous work and by expert opinion. The study had a 'lead in' period where adjustments were made to the CDSS to adjust for real-world deployment and then they collected data from 2 referral centers, the first in Dhaka, Bangladesh and the second in Bamako, Mali.</p><p>The results of this external validation study show that model performance dropped relative to the internal validation (AUC 0.83) at both sites and were just at the arbitrary AUC cutoff of 0.75 for acceptable model accuracy, though with suboptimal calibration.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>Most antibiotic use in the setting of pediatric gastroenteritis is unnecessary. The impact of the CDSS for management of pediatric diarrhea in the literature appears mixed, with some studies showing increased antibiotic use and others showing decreased. This highlights the critical need for a rigorous prospective multicenter RCT to evaluate the utility of a point of care CDSS for optimal decision making around pediatric gastroenteritis. The results of the current study are an important stepping stone to that objective. The establishment of ground truth using a multiplex PCR assay provides for a more sensitive and (possibly) more specific reference by which to compare model outputs relative to traditional culture, EIA and uniplex PCR methods used in GEMS. Additionally, the use of a mobile app with a simple UI maximizes the number of staff members that will be able to utilize the CDSS. Finally, the use of an interpretable model that incorporates local data is an excellent design choice for improving trust and uptake.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>It is not entirely clear that the data support the claim that the model passed external validation. While the point estimate for the overall model was just above the AUC cutoff of 0.75, the 95% CIs were (0.67 – 0.84). Furthermore, most of the site specific models has an AUC estimate below 0.75 and this was consistent across various model sets. It is important to note that being below an arbitrary AUC cutoff of 0.75 does not necessarily indicate the model will not perform well in practice.</p><p>The operational component is important when interpreting results of CDSS validation studies. In this study the key personnel were general practice nurses / study nurses who enrolled no more than 8 children per day and had no other responsibilities. In actual deployment, one could imagine staff members would likely have other duties in addition to managing kids presenting with acute diarrhea and would need to triage more than 8 per day, depending on the season. This may lead to over-estimation of the CDSS's utility in higher volume / higher acuity settings, perhaps due to entry error or time constraints. The results of the ongoing RCT evaluating this platform will be critical for assessing real-world utility.</p><p>From what I could tell, models features are parameterized on a cloud based server and variable weights are then downloaded on to the mobile phone app. I understand the CDSS recommendations were not reported to treating clinicians but were they generated in real time (ie as soon as the staff entered the data)?. How long did it take for results to appear? Would consider describing this a little more clearly. I'm also curious to know how often the model was re-trained on the server (if at all)? Not critical to overall hypothesis but important to think about when trying to develop the infrastructure to deploy this approach in other settings.</p><p>Were the study nurses who entered data into the app the same ones who entered the data into the CRF? If so, may be hard to differentiate the App's ease of use and accuracy since there will be correlation in symptom documentation.</p><p>The change in the design of the application halfway through the first phase in Bangladesh means that data accrued prior to the change are not relevant to the evaluation of the CDSS' external validity or generalizability. I would consider dropping the '(no date restriction)' analyses from the results.</p><p>Unclear what is being referred to with regards to &quot;these independent models&quot; (line 337 – 338). Also, from what I could tell, the prediction model combines 3 separate prediction models in a Bayesian analysis. Why could all features not be included in a single Bayesian model? This is not my area of expertise, but I did not understand the rationale here.</p><p>There was significant heterogeneity between the sites in terms of the percentage without a viral etiology and the distribution of organisms. As noted in the limitations section, this may be partially explained by differences in rotavirus seasonality. However, model accuracy seemed paradoxically better in Mali where almost 50% of children did not have an etiology determined. Is this presumably due to better discrimination in cases where bacterial infection is more likely? On a more general note, a deeper (or more explicit) discussion of the factors that could explain the drop in AUC between the internal and external validation studies would be helpful.</p><p>Different model sets performed best at the different sites. Might this suggest utility in incorporating a trial period to establish which model has the best performance for a given locale?

As the reviewers point out, given the known seasonal cycles of viral diarrhea infections, ideally, at least one full annual cycle of data would have been collected at each study site to account for seasonal variations in diarrhea epidemiology. However, funding and resource limitations, and the prioritization of including two diverse study sites precluded a longer duration of study enrollment. To discuss these considerations and the potential impact on our findings, we have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>“Additionally, given the known seasonal cycles of viral diarrhea infections, ideally, at least one full annual cycle of data would have been collected at each study site to account for seasonal variations in diarrhea epidemiology. However, funding and resource limitations, and the prioritization of including two diverse study sites precluded a longer duration of study enrollment. Notably, the occurrence of a large seasonal rotavirus peak during the data collection period in Bangladesh may be a reason why the models performed sub-optimally at this site in comparison to Mali. We believe that, had resources been available for a longer duration of study enrollment that accounted for greater seasonal variability, our models would have shown better performance characteristics than in the present analysis. Studies to further validate these models using additional study sites with different seasonal cycles of viral diarrhea over at minimum one full annual cycle are recommended.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Please discuss how operational components may impact the performance characteristics of the decision making tools.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these important suggestions, further details describing how operational components may have impacted the performance of the tool have been added to the following sections.</p><p>In Methods, we have clarified that for the purpose of this study all calculations for the primary model deployed on the App were performed on-device (i.e., not on the Cloud server) and models were not re-trained. However, future iterations of the App would be able to use near real-time data input depending on data availability and internet connectivity. We have added:</p><p>&quot;All calculations were performed on-device (locally on the smartphone) and allowed App use irrespective of internet connectivity. Calculated probabilities were displayed near instantaneously (within 1 second). The App deployed a single primary model (present patient + viral seasonality as described above) which used data collected at the point-of-care and input by the clinician user, and viral seasonality curves; climate and recent patient data sources were not used in this study because they did not add to the AUC at the GEMS study sites. The models were not re-trained on the server after deployment for this validation study in order to align with standards of clinical practice for AI-enabled clinical decision support currently being set by Boards of Medical Informatics; according to these standards, validated models derived using machine learning should not be subsequently iterated without validation. However, for future iterations of the software that use models requiring near real-time data input (e.g., climate data, recent patient data), the mobile device could access the server if internet connectivity and the necessary data sources were available, and if not available, use data stored locally on the device that is obtained from scheduled backend downloads with the server using the most recent data available.”</p><p>As mentioned by Reviewer 1 (“Weaknesses”) an important consideration for the future utility and uptake of this App is the time required to effectively use the app in real-world clinical scenarios. We have added discussion regarding several important operational considerations and recommendations for formal evaluations of usability in future research. We have added to the Discussion:</p><p>“Importantly, all data collection for the App was conducted by nurses, the majority of whom had never used a mobile CDSS for clinical use previously. Nurses were able to confidently use the smartphone after a relatively brief training period and enter all necessary data into the tool without difficulty in high-volume clinical settings. While the ease of use or exact time required to enter data into the App was not formally assessed in this validation study, from direct observation nurses were able to enter all required data and obtained calculated outputs within several minutes per patient. Given this time required is similar to that spent with patients during routine clinical care, we believe the App would have high clinical utility in the busy clinical settings for which it was designed. Although the calculations for the primary model deployed on the app were performed on-device, data was transmitted successfully from the App to the Cloud server, from an engineering standpoint this indicates that using real-time data sources is feasible. Additionally, the excellent reliability and agreement between nurses as well as between the App and the paper CRF reference demonstrate that accurate data collection is highly feasible in these clinical settings. Formal evaluation of the usability of the App including an assessment of user experience and metrics such as time required for data entry and for display of calculated outputs using real-time data sources are also needed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please discuss how frequently which the mode missed bacterial or protozoal infections.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have clarified that the aim of the study was not to provide a binary classification decision but rather a continuous predicted risk of viral etiology. However, to illustrate the frequency of misidentified bacterial/protozoal infections, a new figure (Figure 3) has been created showing the number of missed bacterial / protozoal infections using different viral probability cutoffs as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>In Results, we have added:</p><p>“While the aim of the study was not to provide a binary classification decision but rather a continuous predicted risk of viral etiology, the numbers of false positives and false negatives at various probability thresholds are shown in Figure 3. Notably, viral seasonality tends to have fewer false negatives while the present patient only model tends to have fewer false positives at various thresholds. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of the “present patient” and “present patient” + viral seasonality models were similar (Figure 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please limit jargon and provide definitions for all terms listed by Reviewer 2. The mechanistic and statistical explanations for α and β in the methods are also insufficient to interpret the results, particularly for the generalist reader. Please provide a lengthier and clearer explanation of the calibration procedure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for making these important points, to better clarify terminology and methods, major revisions have been made to the Methods section as below.</p><p>The definitions for the terminology used to describe the various models have been clarified and clearly delineated in a new Table 1 entitled, “Model Terminology Definitions and Description”.</p><p>We have also greatly expanded our descriptions of model development and the “modular” approach from our prior work published by Brintz et al., (2021) in <italic>eLife</italic>, to orient unfamiliar readers to the background model development needed to contextualize the present study. This section has been significantly revised.</p><p>More detailed explanations of the terms “pre-test odds” and “post-test odds” have been added:</p><p>“This study team’s prior work described the development of these predictive models that integrates multiple sources of data in a principled statistical framework using a ‘post-test odds formulation.’ This method incorporates observed prior knowledge of a prediction, typically using prior known location-specific prevalence (e.g., historical prevalence of viral diarrhea in Mali), as pre-test odds and then updates the pre-test odds using a single model or series of models based on current data. It also enables electronic real-time updating and flexibility in a “modular” fashion, such that the component models can be flexibly included or excluded according to data availability, an important consideration for LMIC settings in which prior epidemiologic data may be unavailable. The post-test odds formulation combines the likelihood ratios derived from these independent models along with pre-test odds into a single prediction. In order to externally validate the predictions from the post-test odds, we processed the data from this study to match the variables used in previously trained models as closely as possible.”</p><p>Lastly, the description of the calibration procedure used to calculate the calibration slope and intercept has expanded in the Methods section, “Calibration was assessed using calibration-in-the-large and calibration slope. The target for calibration slope is 1, where &lt;1 suggests predictions are too extreme and &gt;1 suggests predictions are too moderate. The target for calibration intercept is 0, where negative values suggest overestimation and positive values suggest underestimation.<sup>19</sup> We estimated the calibration coefficients by regressing predicted values versus the observed proportion of viral cases, calculated using the observed proportion of viral cases within 0.05 plus or minus the predicted probability” (citation Van Calster, B., McLernon, D.J., van Smeden, M. <italic>et al.,</italic> Calibration: the Achilles heel of predictive analytics. <italic>BMC Med</italic> <bold>17,</bold> 230 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-019-1466-7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Please discuss the potential impact of the rotavirus vaccine on observed study outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent point. An in-depth discussion of the potential impact of rotavirus vaccine on the model’s current (and future) performance has been added to a new Limitations section. We have clarified that the rotavirus vaccine has not yet been introduced in Bangladesh and therefore do not expect any impact on our results for the Bangladesh study site. However, in Mali, the rotavirus vaccine was introduced in 2014 with most recent available estimated coverage rates from 2019 of 63% among infants 12-23 months. Interestingly, the models performed better at the Mali study site compared to Bangladesh despite fairly high coverage rates of rotavirus vaccine with subsequently much lower rates of rotavirus detected on TAC PCR. These findings may indicate that the clinical features associated with viral diarrhea may be pathogen-independent, and that seasonal variations in viral diarrhea may still be relevant even when overall rates of rotavirus are substantially lower than in prior time periods.</p><p>We have added the following to the Limitations section:</p><p>“Rotavirus vaccination has not yet been introduced in Bangladesh although a cluster randomized trial was conducted in rural Matlab in 2008-2011, and rotavirus vaccine introduction into the routine immunization program has been planned; thus, we do not expect any effect of the vaccine on the present study results for the Bangladesh study site. However, in Mali, rotavirus vaccination was introduced into the routine immunization program in 2014, as of 2019 official coverage rate was 63% in infants 12-23 months.<sup>40–42</sup> We recognize that the App may not perform as well in places where the rotavirus vaccine has been introduced given the change in viral diarrhea epidemiology in the years since the data were collected from which the models were trained. However, there remain many countries without access to the rotavirus vaccine, notably in Asia where only a few countries have introduced the vaccine nationally or sub-nationally.<sup>41</sup> For this reason, the App may be most useful in these settings. Interestingly, the models performed better at the Mali study site compared to Bangladesh despite fairly high coverage rates of rotavirus vaccine with subsequently much lower rates of rotavirus detected on TAC PCR. These findings may indicate that the clinical features associated with viral diarrhea may be pathogen-independent, and that seasonal variations in viral diarrhea may still be relevant even when overall rates of rotavirus are substantially lower than in prior time periods. Lastly, as the rotavirus vaccine is planned to be introduced in an increasing number of countries globally, we also recognize that the model may need to be updated to account for changes in epidemiology as rotavirus vaccine is increasingly introduced and rotavirus becomes a less prominent cause of viral diarrhea.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>From what I could tell, models features are parameterized on a cloud based server and variable weights are then downloaded on to the mobile phone app. I understand the CDSS recommendations were not reported to treating clinicians but were they generated in real time (ie as soon as the staff entered the data)?. How long did it take for results to appear? Would consider describing this a little more clearly. I'm also curious to know how often the model was re-trained on the server (if at all)? Not critical to overall hypothesis but important to think about when trying to develop the infrastructure to deploy this approach in other settings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these important points. As mentioned above, we have clarified that for the purpose of this study all calculations for the primary model deployed on the App were performed on-device (i.e., not on the Cloud server) and models were not re-trained. To directly address this comment we have added:</p><p>“All calculations were performed on-device (locally on the smartphone) and allowed App use irrespective of internet connectivity.

If so, may be hard to differentiate the App's ease of use and accuracy since there will be correlation in symptom documentation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that the study nurses who entered data into the app were the same as those who entered data on the case report forms (CRFs). The purpose of evaluating this correlation was less to examine the usability of the app (which would need to be studied formally using ‘think aloud’ methods or qualitative research evaluating user experience for instance) but rather to ensure from an engineering standpoint that successful data input and transmission from the user (the study nurse) to the phone and to the server (which would be required for future implementation of the App if using real-time data sources) was feasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The change in the design of the application halfway through the first phase in Bangladesh means that data accrued prior to the change are not relevant to the evaluation of the CDSS' external validity or generalizability. I would consider dropping the '(no date restriction)' analyses from the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, however after consideration, we believe that presenting all the results (i.e., with and without date restriction) are important for the reader to understand. As mentioned by the reviewer, the primary analysis includes only the data collected when the vomiting question asked correctly, as this is how the App is intended to be used. However, the results presented demonstrating a substantial drop in the AUC may be valuable to the reader, for comparison and to highlight the potential impact of misunderstanding of the App questions in real-world scenarios. This is also important to underscore the challenges of implementing mHealth apps in diverse contexts, and the need for clarity in how questions are understood by end-users.</p><p>We have added the following to Discussion:</p><p>“Additionally, given the substantial drop in AUC when the vomiting question was asked incorrectly, a trial period to ensure precise understanding of the App’s questions among the target population would also be prudent. These findings underscore the challenges of implementing mHealth tools in diverse contexts, and the importance of ensuring cross-cultural understanding of questions by clinician and patient end-users in real-world scenarios.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unclear what is being referred to with regards to &quot;these independent models&quot; (line 337 – 338). Also, from what I could tell, the prediction model combines 3 separate prediction models in a Bayesian analysis. Why could all features not be included in a single Bayesian model? This is not my area of expertise, but I did not understand the rationale here.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this important point for clarification. We agree the model descriptions and “modular” approach were insufficiently described in our initial submission, and as described above have made major revisions to our Methods section describing the models (see response to Essential Revisions #4). We clarify the reason not all features were included in a single model was to allow for a “modular” design that is customizable based on the availability of data. In many LMICs, data such as viral seasonality curves, historical patient data or weather/climate data may be unavailable. This flexible design thus allows users to customize the most appropriate model to their unique context and target population. The line referenced, “these independent models” has therefore been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There was significant heterogeneity between the sites in terms of the percentage without a viral etiology and the distribution of organisms. As noted in the limitations section, this may be partially explained by differences in rotavirus seasonality. However, model accuracy seemed paradoxically better in Mali where almost 50% of children did not have an etiology determined. Is this presumably due to better discrimination in cases where bacterial infection is more likely? On a more general note, a deeper (or more explicit) discussion of the factors that could explain the drop in AUC between the internal and external validation studies would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these astute observations, we agree with the reviewer and likewise suspect that a primary reason for the discrepancy in attributable pathogens between the two study sites was due to the very high prevalence of rotavirus (which may be easier to attribute using AFe) during the study enrollment period due to an outbreak in the Bangladesh population at the time. We have added to the Limitations section:</p><p>“The higher proportion of non-viral pathogens in Mali may have enabled better discrimination between viral and non-viral pathogens leading to better model performance at the Mali study site.”</p><p>We have added additional description to Limitations regarding the drop in AUC between internal and external validation as suggested:</p><p>“Changes over time in the epidemiology of diarrhea at the study sites as well as the internal validation being conducted in a very large dataset (&gt;20,000 patients) from the GEMS study compared to this study with 300 patients over a short time period during a surge of rotavirus likely also contributed to the drop in AUC between the internal validation and external validation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Different model sets performed best at the different sites. Might this suggest utility in incorporating a trial period to establish which model has the best performance for a given locale? Might be a better approach than using a single model architecture globally.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. We agree that a trial period would be advisable prior to implementation of the app to determine which model has the best performance for the selected site. This approach also takes advantage of the “modular” component of the models in which different versions of the model can be selected and tailored to obtain the best performance and based on data availability. This has been added to the Discussion:</p><p>“A unique aspect of this study was the use of a modular approach to clinical prediction models. In this validation study, the version of the App deployed used a primary model of present patient + viral seasonality data based on the best performing model in internal validation studies. However, the great strength of the modular approach is that it allows for customization according to data availability and local diarrhea epidemiology. In this validation study, we found that the model performance varied depending on the study site. To that end, when possible, a trial period would be prudent prior to implementation of the App to determine which model has the best performance for the selected site.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table 4: Should the first row be called 'Patient-Intrinsic Only' to be consistent with Table 3?
