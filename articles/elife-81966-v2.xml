muscular atrophy. However, the mechanistic understanding of specific components of the regulation of protein turnover during development and disease progression in skeletal muscle is unclear. Mutations in <italic>KLHL40</italic>, an E3 ubiquitin ligase cullin3 (CUL3) substrate-specific adapter protein, result in severe congenital nemaline myopathy, but the events that initiate the pathology and the mechanism through which it becomes pervasive remain poorly understood. To characterize the KLHL40-regulated ubiquitin-modified proteome during skeletal muscle development and disease onset, we used global, quantitative mass spectrometry-based ubiquitylome and global proteome analyses of <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant zebrafish during disease progression. Global proteomics during skeletal muscle development revealed extensive remodeling of functional modules linked with sarcomere formation, energy, biosynthetic metabolic processes, and vesicle trafficking. Combined analysis of <italic>klh40</italic> mutant muscle proteome and ubiquitylome identified thin filament proteins, metabolic enzymes, and ER-Golgi vesicle trafficking pathway proteins regulated by ubiquitylation during muscle development. Our studies identified a role for KLHL40 as a regulator of ER-Golgi anterograde trafficking through ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation of secretion-associated Ras-related GTPase1a (Sar1a). In KLHL40-deficient muscle, defects in ER exit site vesicle formation and downstream transport of extracellular cargo proteins result in structural and functional abnormalities. Our work reveals that the muscle proteome is dynamically fine-tuned by ubiquitylation to regulate skeletal muscle development and uncovers new disease mechanisms for therapeutic development in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myopathy</kwd><kwd>ubiquitylation</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>genetic disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>A Foundation Building Strength</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Vandana A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56AR077017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Vandana A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM62437</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA74305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cole</surname><given-names>Philip A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005292</institution-id><institution>Brigham and Women's Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Vandana A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32HL154711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jean-Beltran</surname><given-names>Pierre M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP2002640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ravenscroft</surname><given-names>Gianina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel disease pathways underlie disease pathogenesis in Kelch-related nemaline myopathy through proteomic remodeling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fetal akinesia, arthrogryposis, and severe congenital myopathies are heterogeneous conditions of reduced fetal movement, usually presenting at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beecroft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langston and Chu, 2020</xref>). More than 50% of all causes of fetal akinesia are of neuromuscular origin, involving all points along the neuromuscular axis (motor neurons, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junction, and the skeletal muscle regulatory and contractile apparatus; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oates et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vogt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nowak et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pelin et al., 1999</xref>). These diseases exhibit a high clinical heterogeneity with a severe congenital onset with fetal akinesia to milder forms, often with a late childhood or adult-onset. At least 30 causative genes have been identified in these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ravenscroft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ravenscroft et al., 2021</xref>). However, the origin and temporal ordering of molecular events that drive the disease pathology remains poorly understood.</p><p>Skeletal muscle is made up of myofibers highly specialized for contraction. To achieve this function, each myofiber contains myofibrils, which consist of a repetition of sarcomeres. After myoblast fusion, sarcomeres are assembled through the interaction of protein complexes that form complex supramolecular structures to form functional myofibers. This requires precisely controlled dynamic turn-over of proteins without perturbing the structure of assembling sarcomeres. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) regulates the relative abundance and functional modifications of proteins during multiple stages of myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hnia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piccirillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jirka et al., 2019</xref>). The UPS is a critical process that controls protein degradation and plays a key role in protein homeostasis. RING E3 ligases play key roles through the recognition of specific protein substrates and the transfer of ubiquitin to the substrate. Mutations in KLHL40, a CUL3 family E3 substrate adaptor protein, have been reported to result in server congenital nemaline myopathy (NM). The importance of UPS in skeletal muscle development has also been identified in human diseases where mutations in genes regulating ubiquitination and protein turnover processes result in sarcomeric disarray and functional deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frosk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olivé et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Sarcomeres are present in close proximity to the triad system that is formed of T-tubules and sarcoplasmic reticulum, a modified endoplasmic compartment. In addition, different mitochondrial populations are also present in close juxtaposition to the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henderson et al., 2017</xref>). Mutations or deletions of sarcomeric genes affect the structure and function of surrounding organelles, and similarly, defects in other organelles in myofibers also affect sarcomere structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reimann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Voit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fatkin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Gasperi et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that the sarcomere and surrounding organelles act as interconnected hubs that engage in extensive communication during skeletal muscle development and maintenance. Despite this, mechanistic insight into inter-organelle communication between different membrane compartments in protein trafficking and regulation of this process in skeletal muscle development remains largely unknown. Finally, how this communication is perturbed in disease states and contributes to disease pathology is not clear.</p><p>We have identified that inter-organelle communication is critical for vesicle trafficking and skeletal muscle development by ubiquitination signaling in the sarcomere. We performed global proteomic and ubiquitylome profiling of skeletal muscle during development and disease progression in a Klhl40 deficient zebrafish model of congenital nemaline myopathy. We identified that KLHL40 acts as a regulator of membrane vesicle trafficking through ubiquitylation and subsequent protein degradation of Secretion-associated Ras-related GTPase1a (SAR1A). In the absence of this negative feedback mechanism in KLHL40 deficiency, SAR1A is abnormally localized to the ER and contributes to membrane tubulation defects and disruption of the trafficking of collagen. Our work demonstrates that inter-organelle communication between sarcomeric and endomembrane compartments is dynamically regulated by ubiquitylation and is critical for skeletal muscle development, and defects in this process underlie pathology in skeletal muscle diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KLHL40 is required for skeletal muscle development</title><p>KLHL40 deficiency in humans results in a severe form of nemaline myopathy associated with neonatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>).

As zebrafish grow ex vivo, skeletal muscle development and disease progression can be visualized in the context of a living organism. We generated loss-of-function <italic>klhl40</italic> alleles in zebrafish using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). The human orthologue of the <italic>KLHL40</italic> gene is duplicated in zebrafish as <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> and mapped on chromosome 2 and chromosome 24, respectively. <italic>klhl40a</italic> alleles created include <italic>klhl40a</italic><sup>bwg200</sup> with insertion of one base (c.250_251insA; p.Val84Aspfs*36) and <italic>klhl40a</italic><sup>bwg201</sup> with a two base pair deletion in exon 1 (c.251_252insTC;p.Val84Asnfs*36). These alleles result in frameshift mutations and are predicted to result in truncations in the N terminal BTB domain of the Klhl40a protein. For <italic>klhl40b</italic>, a CRISPR-edited allele (<italic>klhl40b</italic><sup>bwg202</sup>) had insertion of one base (c.674_675insC; p.Arg225Profs*14) in exon 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>klhl40b</italic><sup>bwg202</sup> allele is predicted to result in an frameshift mutation and truncation of the Klhl40b protein in the BACK domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As <italic>klhl40a</italic><sup>bwg200</sup> and <italic>klhl40b</italic><sup>bwg202</sup> alleles were predicted to produce the smallest truncated Klhl40 proteins, the rest of the analyses presented in this work were performed on these fish lines obtained after F3 generation and referred to as <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> in the rest of this work. The effect of different mutations on <italic>klhl40</italic> mRNA levels was evaluated by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> alleles exhibited similar <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> mRNA levels, respectively, in comparison to +/+ siblings. As truncated mutant proteins could result in a dominant gain of function, a western blot was performed on the skeletal muscle extracts obtained from <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> mutant fish to evaluate the effect of these mutations on the klhl40 protein. Western blot analysis with a KLHL40 antibody that recognizes both Klhl40a and Klhl40b proteins revealed a 50% decrease in Klhl40 protein levels in both alleles compared to control and complete absence of Klhl40 protein in <italic>klhl40a</italic>/<italic>klhl40b</italic> double knockout fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> alleles result in the loss of Klhl40 protein in the mutant zebrafish. <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> mutant embryonic (2dpf) and larval fish (5dpf) did not exhibit gross morphological defects in any of the mutants examined. Previous studies have shown that the knockdown of <italic>klhl40</italic> by morpholino results in myopathy in zebrafish embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>). The discrepancy between the morphants and mutants could be due to genetic compensatory mechanisms by other Kelch protein-coding genes or other modifier genes as described by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Brolosy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sztal et al., 2018</xref>). During the developmental transition from juvenile (1.5 months) to adult stage (3.0 months), the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutants developed a myopathic phenotype with leaner bodies, whereas <italic>klhl40b</italic> were phenotypically indistinguishable from +/+ control siblings at this age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). No other obvious morphological defects were observed. <italic>klhl40a</italic>/<italic>klhl40b</italic> double mutants appeared phenotypically similar to <italic>klhl40a</italic> fish. <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> exhibit overlapping expression in skeletal muscle, and a lack of phenotype in <italic>klhl40b</italic> mutants suggested functional redundancy similar to a large number of duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taylor and Raes, 2004</xref>).

The <italic>U<sub>max</sub></italic> values showed a significant decrease in <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutants compared to +/+ control siblings at the adult stage (3 months), indicating reduced endurance capacity of the klhl40a deficient fish.

Control fish survived to 24 months of age, whereas most of the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant fish died between 9 and 12 months.

This revealed four distinct clusters defining critical trajectories of changes in the proteome during normal and disease states. Cluster 1 represented proteins that exhibited low abundance in the control muscle and high abundance in the mutant muscle at both the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. Clusters 2 and 4 represented proteins with high levels in the juvenile stage but a significant reduction at the adult stage in the normal muscle and represented proteins in lipid catabolic process (e.g. Pck1, Pck2), vesicle trafficking (e.g. Sec16b, Srp14, Timm10), and the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine biosynthetic process indicating the involvement of vesicular trafficking pathway. Interestingly, these clusters in the mutant fish showed reduction at both juvenile (pre-symptomatic) and adult (symptomatic) stages. Finally, cluster 3 exhibited protein levels that were elevated in control muscle at both juvenile and adult stages but reduced in mutant muscle at both stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These data show extensive and dynamic remodeling of the cellular proteome during normal skeletal muscle development. Most differential proteomic changes in the Klhl40a mutant muscle emerge during the juvenile (pre-symptomatic) state. These changes are primarily static during disease onset and progression. This indicates that gene expression is subject to complex post-translational regulation in vivo, resulting in dynamic remodeling in normal skeletal muscle development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Changes in proteome reveal delayed sarcomere maturation in Klhl40a deficiency</title><p>To investigate the biological pathway associated with Klhl40a deficiency, pathway enrichment analysis was performed on proteins significantly increasing or decreasing in the mutant at each stage (FDR p&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The skeletal muscle developmental process exhibited enrichment with increased abundance at the pre-symptomatic state in the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant muscle compared to controls. Many of these proteins were expressed in differentiating myotubes during early sarcomere assembly. They were either absent or exhibited low levels in the terminally differentiated mature skeletal muscle (Obscn, Nexn, Ilk, Vcl, Fxr1, Synpo2l, Tnnt2, Flnc, Pdlim5, Smyd1, Unc45, Mybpc1, Lamb2, Cav1, Alpk3, Pleca, and TnnT1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Hierarchical clustering also revealed that sarcomeric proteins associated with mature myofibers exhibited significantly less abundance in mutant muscle at both stages. Pathway enrichment showed that proteins in this cluster include proteins of the actin cytoskeleton (e.g. Tmod, Tnnt3, Tnni2, Tpma, Rock1), sarcomere assembly (e.g. Myom, Actn3, Capz) intermediate filaments (e.g. Plec, Dsp, Mtm1) and microtubule transport (e.g. KIif5b, Mfn2, Dync2h1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, blue and cyan nodes).

A heat map of Hierarchical cluster analysis of ubiquitin sites (Ub-sites) with differential abundance between wild-type and mutants in the ubiquitylome data showed four different clusters classified into two broad categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Clusters 1 and 2 exhibited proteins with decreased Ub-sites in both pre-symptomatic and symptomatic mutant states. We expect many of these proteins to be direct targets of ubiquitylation by the Klhl40-Cul3 complex. Previous studies have shown nebulin is a direct ubiquitination target of Klhl40-Cul3 complex and was identified in cluster 1, validating our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garg et al., 2014</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the most significantly downregulated Ub-sites nodes in the mutant muscle were the peroxisome and sarcomere proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue and cyan nodes; e.g., Ttn, Myha, Myhb, Tpma, Myhc4, Myom1). Most proteins exhibited changes in Ub-sites that correlated positively at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2 supp3 supp4 supp5 supp6">Supplementary files 1–6</xref>). We did not identify any protein showing significant enrichment of Ub-sites in different directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This suggests that ubiquitylation marks by the Klhl40-Cul3 complex and potentially other ubiquitylation enzymes are robust and unidirectional in the disease state. Clusters 3 and 4 represented proteins that exhibited increased Ub-sites in the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant muscle compared to the control. As many ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylases showed differential expression between control and mutant muscle, these proteins could be direct targets of many of these enzymes. Nodes that exhibited upregulated ubiquitylated peptides included proteins in muscle development and muscle fibers formation (Obscn, Tnni1, Tmod4, Tpm2, Myom2, Tnni2, Cfl2, Ldb3, Des) and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, red and yellow nodes). Integration with the proteome data revealed that these highly ubiquitylated proteins had decreased abundance in mutant muscle (Tmod4, Tnni2, Tpm2, Cfl2, Myom2). Many of these highly ubiquitylated proteins are localized to thin filaments and contribute to nemaline myopathy, indicating other components of the ubiquitin proteasomal pathways may cause increased ubiquitylation and abnormal degradation of sarcomere proteins in mutant muscle and affect thin filaments stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8 supp9">Supplementary files 8-9</xref>). Finally, to identify potential targets of the Klhl40-Cul3 complex, analysis of fold changes of reduced Ub-sites and abundance of their cognate proteins in response to Klhl40a deficiency in opposite directions identified Sar1a (vesicle trafficking protein), glycolytic proteins (Pkmb, Aldo, Aldob) and sarcomeric proteins (Ttn, Tnnt2, Nckipsd). While the proteomic analysis indicated altered sarcomeric and glycolytic proteins might contribute to disease pathology in Klhl40a deficiency, reduced ubiquitylation of these proteins, suggest these may be directly regulated through ubiquitylation by the Klhl40-Cul3 complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Sar1a upregulation is associated with increased accumulation of ER-derived membrane-bound structures</title><p>The vesicle trafficking pathway is central in cells for transporting cargo and secretory proteins. However, the role of this process in normal and disease muscle is not completely clear. SAR1A is a small GTPase required to assemble COPII vesicles at endoplasmic reticulum exit sites (ERES) by recruiting the SEC23/24 complex for the protein trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2005</xref>). SAR1 is also involved in large cargo trafficking through large COPII structures that require TANGO1, cTAGE5, SEC23/24, and SEC13/31. While Sar1a protein levels were significantly increased, inner coat proteins of COPII vesicles Sec23b and Sec23d and Golga2 were reduced in the mutant muscle suggesting that they are co-regulated in Klhl40a deficiency. No changes were observed in the outer coat proteins of COPII vesicles (Sec13 and 31; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Proteomics analysis also showed no significant changes in the ER resident protein Sec12 or other COPII proteins, Tango1, cTAGE5, and Sec13/31 levels in Klhl40a deficiency. These changes to the vesicular trafficking proteins were regulated post-transcriptionally, as no differences were seen in these proteins at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). To investigate the possible role of Sar1a upregulation on the disease pathology in Klhl40a deficiency in skeletal muscle, western blot analysis was performed to validate the findings of the proteomics data. Western blot analysis in control and mutant <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant skeletal muscle protein extracts at the adult stage (3 months) confirmed increased Sar1a protein levels in the mutant skeletal muscle compared to the WT control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). Sar1a is expressed at low levels in normal skeletal muscle. However, the physiological roles and effects of Sar1a perturbations in skeletal muscle are unknown.

Therefore, we examined the morphology of the components of the protein trafficking process in myofibers from <italic>klhl40a</italic> and control zebrafish by immunofluorescence (3 months). Klhl40a deficient myofibers exhibited increased accumulation of Sar1a in the ER compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Moreover, an increased number of Sar1a and PDI-positive foci were observed in mutant muscle. The ultrastructure of abnormal membranous structures observed in the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant muscle was similar to ER and lacked the organization of the COPII-coated vesicles shown previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlowe et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matsuoka et al., 1998</xref>). This suggests that abnormal membranous structures in the ER-SR region in the mutant muscle originated from the ER. Immunofluorescence with Tango1 antibody revealed reduced ER exit sites (ERES) in Klhl40-deficient myofibers. Although the size of ERES sites showed variability in both control and mutant myofibers (50–500 nm), mutant myofibers showed an increased number of Tango1-positive enlarged ERES sites (~200–500 nm) (5.2 ± 1.91 %) compared to control myofibers (0.70 ± 0.39%). Examination of COPII vesicle protein Sec23B showed fewer COPII vesicles in Klhl40a deficiencyFinally, examination of the Golgi apparatus in Klha40a showed normal immunoreactivity in most of the myofibers (63 ± 14%) with varying amounts of GOLGA2-positive aggregates in other myofibers. These morphological changes are not overserved during the pre-symptomatic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2SB</xref>). As dysregulation of autophagy is associated with vesicle trafficking, we examined different autophagy markers (Atd5, Atg16l1, Atg4b, Atg9a, beclin, Lc3b, Lamp1, and Lamp2) in the proteomic data or by western blot (LC3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We did not observe any altered autophagy markers in Klhl40a deficiency. ER stress can also trigger unfolded protein response (UPR) to restore ER proteostasis. No differences were observed in Bip, Calnexin, Ero1, Ireα1, CHOP, and PERK between control and <italic>klhl40a</italic> skeletal muscle (1.5 and 3 months) by proteome or RNA-seq analysis (3 months). <italic>xbp1</italic> mRNA spliced during UPR in the ER also showed no change in the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To test if SAR1A is a direct substrate of KLHL40, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in C2C12 cells that showed SAR1A is a direct interactor of KLHL40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As SAR1A protein increases in KLHL40 deficiency, we evaluated if there is a direct reciprocal interaction between KLHL40 and SAR1A proteins by overexpression assays in C2C12 cells. A gradual decrease in KLHL40 protein levels resulted in a concomitant increase in SAR1A protein levels in muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). There was no evidence of promoter competition with KLHL40 and SAR1A plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To understand if the interaction between KLHL40 and SAR1A results in reduced levels of SAR1A through ubiquitylation-mediated protein degradation, we evaluated the effect of KLHL40 protein on SAR1A stability in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In the presence of MG132, increased stability of SAR1A was observed, suggesting that KLHL40 targets SAR1A for degradation through proteasomes. Analysis of vertebrate SAR1A protein sequences revealed that the SAR1A ubiquitylation site identified by ubiquitylome analysis is highly conserved in vertebrates suggesting that SAR1A ubiquitylation in skeletal muscle may be conserved in all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Finally, to examine whether the KLHL40-CUL3 complex can directly promote SAR1A ubiquitination, an in vitro ubiquitination assay was performed with neddylated CUL3 and recombinant SAR1A protein with wild type or disease-causing KLHL40-GST mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–F</xref>). Western blot analysis showed increased SAR1A ubiquitylation as a function of time in the presence of wild-type KLHL40 but not GST-only control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To understand the role of disease-causing KLHL40 missense variants in disease pathology through SAR1A-mediated pathways, ubiquitylation of SAR1A by NM-causing KLHL40 missense variants was also studied. Variants in the N-terminal BTB domain of KLHL40 (L86P) and BACK domain (W201L) showed similar SAR1A ubiquitylation as the wild-type protein. Still, variants in the Kelch domains (R311L and E528K) resulted in a significant reduction in SAR1A ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>). As Kelch proteins bind their targets through the C-terminal Kelch domains, this suggests that patients with loss of function or missense variants in the Kelch domains in KLHL40 may exhibit reduced SAR1A ubiquitylation. Finally, SAR1A ubiquitylation was evaluated in C2C12 cells in the presence or absence of KLHL40 with CUL3 by overexpression and immunoprecipitation assays. This showed that KLHL40 is required for SAR1A ubiquitination in the context of muscle cells by CUL3, as no ubiquitylation was observed in the absence of KLHL40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

In parallel, an extensive intracellular membrane network is established in juxtaposition to sarcomeres to produce force-generating myofibers. Rapid fine-tuning of cellular phenotypes to support the dynamic transitions are accomplished through post-transcriptional and post-translational processes. These control protein synthesis rates and modify protein functions and dynamic degradation through the UPS. The protein degradation process during skeletal muscle growth and disease onset is highly selective, as evident from the identification of mutations in components in the UPS pathway in human myopathies that perturb specific stages of muscle development and growth and result in impaired motor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olivé et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrasco-Rando and Ruiz-Gómez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cirak et al., 2010</xref>). In particular, KLHL40 and KLHL41, that functions as substrate-specific adaptors for E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL3, contribute to severe forms of congenital myopathy with neonatal lethality with extensive sarcomeric disarray and contractures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ravenscroft et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To address the gaps in the understanding of disease development and identify in vivo events that initiate the pathology and the mechanisms through which these events become pervasive in Klhl40a deficiency, we performed quantitative global proteome and ubiquitylome analysis in skeletal muscle from non-symptomatic stages to symptomatic stages of disease progression in the zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mertins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Udeshi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Satpathy et al., 2021</xref>). We identified that normal skeletal muscle proteome exhibited plasticity and was dynamically changed during growth. In contrast, Klhl40a-deficient skeletal muscle showed a highly altered proteome during the early stages of skeletal muscle growth (i.e. during pre-symptomatic stages) compared to controls that remained primarily static during the transition from juvenile to adult stages and throughout disease progression. In addition, the proteome data identified early preclinical signatures suggesting disease-causing processes are established during pre-symptomatic stages before structural and functional deficits are observed in skeletal muscle. Moreover, most of the proteome (78%) that exhibited changes during the juvenile-to-adult transition did not show significant differences in gene expression by RNA sequencing. In addition, no changes were detected at the transcriptome levels for proteins that showed significant changes in the ubiquitylation and their cognate proteins suggesting that regulatory processes such as post-transcription, post-translation, and protein degradation impact protein abundance after mRNA is made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Skeletal muscle depends on anaerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation for its bioenergetic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hargreaves and Spriet, 2020</xref>). During skeletal muscle development, aerobic glycolysis is the primary source of bioenergetics in proliferative cells, but this changes to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during differentiation. Our combined analysis of the ubiquitylome and proteome identified many glycolytic enzymes that exhibited reduced ubiquitylation and increased protein levels in Klhl40a deficiency. High glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase (Pkm2) levels lead to defects in energy metabolism and skeletal muscle atrophy in the myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao and Cooper, 2013</xref>). This suggests that Klhl40a directly or indirectly acts as a regulator of glycolysis in skeletal muscle, and a deficiency may contribute to a perturbed bioenergetic state and muscle defects. We also observed the upregulation of OXPHOS proteins in Klhl40a deficiency and associated changes in mitochondrial morphology. While no changes in the ubiquitylation of these proteins were seen, this dysregulation of mitochondrial proteins could be a response to altered glycolysis or structural abnormalities in skeletal muscle. The upregulation of mitochondrial proteins is associated with increased energetic demands of the diseased muscle and may further exacerbate the disease pathology through increased oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Toepfer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pant et al., 2015</xref>). Klhl40a-deficient muscle also showed reduced ubiquitylation and increased abundance of early sarcomeric proteins that are normally expressed in the early differentiation of myofibers and are decreased or absent during terminal myofiber differentiation. We have previously shown that reduced ubiquitylation and upregulated protein level of an early sarcomeric protein, NRAP, in KLHL41 deficient skeletal muscle contributes to myopathy by abnormal sequestration of the late sarcomeric proteins and preventing their localization to mature sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jirka et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests a similar mechanism may contribute to smaller sarcomeres and myopathy observed in Klhl40a deficiency. Nemaline myopathy is associated with defects in sarcomere structure, and it is not clear if the formation or growth of the sarcomere is affected in NM patients. Our studies demonstrate that in KLHL40-NM, sarcomeres are initially formed normally, but further sarcomere growth is perturbed and provides mechanistic insights into disease pathology.</p><p>Our studies identified that Klhl40a regulates skeletal muscle growth and function through regulation of vesicle trafficking, a poorly understood pathway in skeletal muscle. Vesicle trafficking is mediated by multiple organelles that coordinate the transport of proteins synthesized in the ER to the extracellular space or other endomembrane compartments through the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barlowe and Schekman, 1993</xref>). Human genetic studies have identified pathogenic variants in critical proteins in the vesicular trafficking pathway, resulting in myopathies in affected patients such as <italic>GOLGA2, BIDC2 and BET1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oates et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotecha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shamseldin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Neveling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Unger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shomron et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Donkervoort et al., 2021</xref>). Variants in many genes associated with congenital muscular dystrophies (<italic>POMT1</italic>, <italic>POMT2</italic>, <italic>TRAPPC11</italic>, <italic>GOSR2</italic>) encode proteins that are localized to different membrane compartments of the vesicle trafficking pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beltrán-Valero de Bernabé et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Reeuwijk et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bögershausen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larson et al., 2018</xref>). How defects in specific components in the trafficking pathway affect the distribution of secretory and extracellular proteins locally or globally and contribute to muscle diseases is not well understood. Nevertheless, our studies provide in vivo insights into the requirement of vesicle trafficking to transport ECM proteins to maintain healthy skeletal muscle. KLHL40-CUL3 acts as a regulator of this process through ubiquitylation-mediated protein degradation of SAR1A, which is required for budding COPII vesicles from ER to transport proteins. CUL3-dependent ubiquitylation is previously shown to dynamically regulate the trafficking of large COPII carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). KLHL12, another substrate-specific adapter for CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase forms a complex with CUL3 which ubiquitylates SEC31 leading to an increase in COPII vesicle size to accommodate large procollagen molecules for secretion in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jin et al., 2012</xref>). While most procollagens are trafficked through the secretory pathway, a subset is directed towards lysosomal degradation to remove excess procollagen from cells through the autophagy pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Omari et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies in skin fibroblasts have shown that the CUL3-KLHL12 complex is involved in routing procollagens to lysosomes to regulate intracellular collagen levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moretti et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, inhibition of CUL3 neddylation which is critical for the ubiquitylation activity still led to the formation of large COPII vesicles by the CUL3-KLHL12 complex, which is required for the secretion of procollagens. As CUL3-mediated ubiquitylation also regulates KLHL12 protein stability, further studies are needed to understand the ubiquitylation-dependent and independent roles of the CUL3-KLHL12 complex on procollagens secretion in different cellular contexts and physiological conditions. KLHL12 is expressed at very low levels in normal skeletal muscle compared to other cells and tissue types (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gtexportal.org">http://gtexportal.org</ext-link>). We did not identify any differential changes in Klhl12 and the target protein Sec31 in Klhl40a deficiency.</p><p>Moreover, no changes in the protein levels of autophagy markers were observed in Klhl40a deficiency at the disease states examined. CUL3 interacts with many Kelch proteins in a tissue-specific context and therefore, may regulate specific aspects of secretory and degradative pathways in response to different stimuli and disease states. Klhl40a deficient skeletal muscle showed an increased number of enlarged ERES sites compared to controls, while the overall number of ERES sites was reduced in the mutant muscle. ERES functions as an inter-organelle transport apparatus that actively modulates its shape and size while directing diverse cargo types to Golgi and increases in size during active transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weigel et al., 2021</xref>). As Klhl40a deficiency resulted in reduced procollagen trafficking from ER, this increase in the size of ERES sites could be a compensatory mechanism to enhance the secretory flux. Sar1 is associated with the ERES sites and regulates the formation of COPII vesicles. Despite the presence of increased Sar1A levels in Klhl40a-deficient myofibers, reduced or limited amounts of other proteins, such as Sec16b and COPII proteins in the mutant myofibers may underlie a reduced number of ERES sites and COPII vesicles.</p><p>While the Sar1a level was increased in the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant, no differences were observed in closely related family member Sar1b in Klhl40a deficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) showing a decrease in Sar1a and Sar1b ratio. SAR1A is 90% identical to SAR1B, and these proteins exhibit overlapping and unique functions with different biochemical properties in COPII assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Melville et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2003</xref>). While SAR1B specifically regulates chylomicron trafficking in the small intestine, both proteins are required for the trafficking of cardiac sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 protein and efficient ER export of procollagens and may be able to compensate for each other function for the trafficking of common proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cutrona et al., 2013</xref>). In Klhl40a deficiency, increased amounts of Sar1a resulted in the formation of abnormal ER-derived membrane-bound structures and decreased procollagens trafficking; therefore, downregulation of Sar1a levels in skeletal muscle may be able to restore the procollagen trafficking defects. Klhl40a deficiency muscle showed extensive ER dilation that can lead to activation of the UPR caused by the ER stress. However, most of the markers of UPR activation showed no significant difference in the Klhl40a deficiency in skeletal muscle, suggesting a lack of UPR activation in vivo.</p><p>A key clinical feature of KLHL40 NM is the presence of contractures in most individuals. Defects in ECM are directly associated with contracture in many neuromuscular diseases. Vesicle trafficking dysregulation is associated with neurodegenerative and skeletal disorders, and our findings open new avenues on this pathway in neuromuscular diseases. Our studies identified structural defects in skeletal muscle in Klhl40a deficiency and showed that Klhl40a directly regulates vesicle trafficking and contributes to disease pathology.</p><p>Overall, we provide a comprehensive temporal proteomic landscape during skeletal muscle growth and disease development, and dynamic fine-tuning of the cellular proteome by ubiquitylation is critical for muscle function. While comprehensive studies are needed to define the specific role of each of the different processes identified in skeletal muscle defects in KLHL40 deficiency, these studies suggest these altered molecular processes contribute to specific pathological defects observed in Klhl40a deficiency. Given the several pathways in which KLHL40 is involved, approaches aiming to inactivate pro-disease pathways and activate protective pathways may be a promising therapeutic strategy for at least this form of NM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish maintenance and husbandry</title><p>Zebrafish were maintained and bred using standard methods as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Westerfield, 2000</xref>).

Briefly, wild-type and <italic>KLHL40</italic> knockout myoblasts (c.1010_1011insA;p.Cys337Valfs) were co-transfected by electroporation with two plasmids (pLVX-SBP-mGFP-COL1A1; Addgene plasmid: 110726 and Str-KDEL_ST-SBP-mCherry; Addgene plasmid: 65265). The first plasmid expresses an engineered human procollagen type I alpha 1 with streptavidin binding protein and mGFP between the prosequence and triple helical region. The second plasmid co-expresses the Golgi-localized enzyme sialyl transferase-mCherry (ST-mCherry) fused to streptavidin binding protein and also KDEL-tagged streptavidin, necessary for the ER retention of both cargo proteins (mGFP-COL1A1 and ST-mCherry). Simultaneous release of both reporters from the ER was accomplished by the addition of 40 μM biotin, and live cells were monitored by fluorescence microscopy every 2 min. Images were obtained on a Nikon Livescan sweptfield confocal microscope with a×40 objective lens (NA 0.95), and the resulting movies used for quantitative fluorescence analysis were not subjected to processing. Integrated fluorescence intensity of mGFP-COL1A1 at the Golgi region (defined by the region of perinuclear intensity seen 20–30 min after biotin addition) and from the whole cell was measured using ImageJ. The ratio between fluorescent intensities within the Golgi region and the whole cell was generated for each time point. The ratio at the 0 min time point, representing ER background signal at the Golgi region, was subtracted from the corresponding ones at each time point and then normalized to the maximum value.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall myopathic effects and changes on a cellular level to the morphology of organelles and sorting sites including ER exit sites and Golgi need further analysis and quantification.</p><p>2) Analysis of biosynthetic secretion and in particular collagen mobilization in the secretory pathway or degradation that may lead to ECM deposition defects are required.</p><p>3) Further analysis of the findings on Sar1 with added controls and analysis of all COPII and ER exit site components is required to provide a clear view of the basis for secretion defects that may lead to disease onset.</p><p>4) Attention should be given to the complexity of effects leading to the overall disease phenotypes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific points.</p><p>1. Although the authors demonstrate that selective effects are derived from the deletion of KLHL40a, both a and b forms are expressed to almost the same levels (Figure S1A-E). What is the explanation for the differential effect? Is it localization? Is it a lack of different activities of the b isoform and why? Could it be that a possible intact BTB domain in the klhl40b deletion/ truncation vs the truncated BTB in the A isoform is significant here (Figure 1A-B, S1A-B)? Could it be that the klhl40a truncation is generating a dominant negative effect? This should be explored and at least discussed.</p><p>2. Although it is clear that morphological effects are observed in KLHL40a deletion muscle, these are largely undefined. Are there morphology changes to the SR-ER and Golgi at 1.5 months in KO, particularly since proteome changes are already observed at that stage? Key to understanding the effects of KLHL40a deletion are the morphological changes depicted by EM in figure 2. A-H and these will truly benefit from better analysis. The authors should utilize organelle markers and immunofluorescence, in order to define the identity and morphology of affected organelles in control and KO states (in particular the SR-ER, some shown in Figure 6 but deserves more markers and better analysis and importantly also Golgi compartments). Is the ER dilated? What is the extent of Golgi fragmentation? The presentation of the EM images will also greatly benefit from the enlargements of individual examples of organelle images and better morphological descriptions. Similar analysis will benefit Figure 5D in particular following Golgi morphology thus defining if it is the increased Sar1a levels that lead to Golgi fragmentation.</p><p>3. It has been demonstrated that the activities of biosynthetic secretion are adjusted during developmental processes by unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling. It would be an informative and important addition to the work if the authors examine their data and expand their analysis (transcriptome and proteome) to describe potential UPR activity (selected targets) both during development and in particular in KLHL40a KO where UPR is likely induced (added to Figure 4). This should provide an important control to the study and current conclusions that suggest perturbed secretion from the ER (the alternative where there is no UPR activation suggesting perhaps a subtle secretion defect or a very selective defect in collagen secretion, although the latter may not agree with Golgi fragmentation).</p><p>4. The authors describe the regulation of Sar1a yet this isoform-specific Sar1 effect is not discussed or examined. This is not trivial as Sar1b is selectively implicated in supporting traffic of large lipid particles as was also established in zebrafish by the Knapik group and was also implicated in the packaging of large-size cargo from the ER in early work from the Schekman group. Is it the ratio between the two Sar1 isoforms that are perturbed to give the observed collagen and ECM secretion/deposition defects? Is it just the excess of Sar1 proteins regardless of the isoform nature that is leading to ER tubulation and inhibition of general secretion? Given the authors finding and the body of previous work on Sar1a and Sar1b, it would markedly benefit this work to address these points. The authors should also better define when Sar1a or all isoforms are followed in their experiments.</p><p>5. The results showing elevated levels of Sar1a in KLHL40a deletion are very interesting. The authors further show that the levels of other COPII subunits are mostly reduced (Figure 5 A-C) but provide an incomplete analysis. It is known that COPII proteins including inner and outer layer components undergo ubiquitination and de-ubiquitylation cycles. The authors should specifically examine if overall Sec23 and Sec24 levels are co-regulated as these form Sec23 -Sec24 complexes. Similarly, and more importantly, the analysis ignores Sec13 and Sec31 subunits of the coat outer layer and this should be explored. In accordance, key regulatory proteins including TANGO1, cTAGE5, and in particular Sec12 should also be highlighted (all is in the data and if interesting, perhaps deserve western blot analysis).</p><p>6. It is interesting to note that the COPII protein Sec31 was previously shown to be developmentally regulated by Cul3-KLHL12 mediated Sec31 ubiquitylation to support collagen secretion. It is possible that Cul3-driven tight control over COPII subunit levels and ratios is generally at play here. Indeed, the authors suggest that levels of multiple ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylases are modified leading to the observed overall complex effects on the proteome. However special focus should be given to known regulators of COPII. Is KLHL12 expression modified in development here? Is it modified by KLHL40a deletion? The authors should examine the potential adjustments made by Cul3-KLHL12 that may control Sec31 levels. This analysis will provide a required overview of Cul3-regulated secretion proposed here and would suggest that selective control of the levels of individual COPII components (and not just Sar1a) may direct coat composition, a potentially highly significant outcome with broad implications.</p><p>7. The authors localize Sar1 in control and KLHL40a deletion mutants (Figure 6) and in KLHL40 nm patient samples (Figure 9A) but should complement this with analysis with a similar analysis of other COPII components and of ER exit site proteins such as TANGO1 or Sec16. This analysis is required to define the effects of Sar1a levels on COPII assembly and ER exit site assembly. The analysis is critical for the work, generating some mechanistic insights on the roles of KLHL40a in regulating secretion, and monitoring outcomes of elevated Sar1a levels on its downstream effectors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The phenotypes look like they could have arisen from alterations in several cellular processes, from mitochondrial activity to secretion. It seems challenging to be able to distinguish between the relative contributions from each of these processes. It would be instructive to test whether autophagy is affected as well, and include a section in the discussion to highlight as a caveat, the diverse pathways that might contribute to the phenotype.</p><p>The authors show a clear lack of correlation between the proteome and transcriptome, but in order to focus on protein ubiquitylation of specific proteins, the authors need to present a lack of correlation, between the proteomic and RNAseq data for the individual proteins studied in the manuscript.</p><p>Altered Golgi architecture and an increase in vesicular structures could arise from a number of reasons. In order to argue for a direct role of secretion, the authors need to carry out a more direct secretion assay to confirm the altered secretory rate.</p><p>From figure 7, it is challenging to distinguish between secreted (extracellular) collagen between control and mutant fish. Could the authors visualise and quantify extracellular collagen specifically? Imaging collagen fibres should show only extracellular collagen.</p><p>It is unclear why the levels of total collagen appear very different, is this due to altered collagen degradation? The authors need to show whether the observed increase in collagen is KLHL40 arises, in part, from reduced intracellular collagen degradation.</p><p>Co-localise collagen and other cellular structures including the ER, to see where collagen is retained.</p><p>The authors should test whether the excess vesicular structures in the KLHL40 fish are secretory or degradative, for instance, do they have LC3?</p><p>The authors have used C2C12 cells that have been used for immunoprecipitation analysis, the Golgi apparatus, and assay for collagen secretion.</p><p>Figure 9 is unclear. The control and affected tissues look to be from different areas, could this be resolved?</p><p>There are related published results on CUL3 and KLHL12, which could play a related role in cellular responses to collagen secretion. The results in this manuscript could suggest a common theme of proteostatic control over collagen and COPII degradation, rather than secretion, thereby resolving confusing data on the KLHL12/Cul3 model. Could the authors include a brief discussion about links between these two studies?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript could benefit from more experiments and quantitation. Specifically, The finding that KLH40A knockout leads to smaller fish is important but whether this is solely related to a skeletal muscle phenotype is less clear. For example, where are these orthologs expressed (which tissues?)? What other morphologic issues are present? The image just shows a smaller fish. I would also like to see a Kaplan Meier curve for the death of the mutant fish.</p><p>Figure 2 relies only on EM images and would be helpful to have other pathologic images to get a sense of muscle morphology. Specifically, statements such as myopathic phenotype are not clearly demonstrated. regarding sarcomere width, how does one control for the contractile state? In addition, an assay of mitochondrial function would be helpful seahorse or evidence of oxidative damage, changes in ETS components. The EM descriptions of the Golgi and basal lamina seem qualitative, can we quantify them?</p><p>The large amount of data from the RNAseq, ubiquitin remnant, and proteome data is laudable and described in extensive detail with minimal validation and lots of speculation. Is there a decrease/increase of total proteins on Western blot, the most interesting subset is the proteins that are enriched but decreased in ubiquitin remnants?</p><p>The focus on Sar1a is premature in vivo and figure 5 shows vesiculation is not convincing and needs quantitation. The altered localization is challenging to assess in Figure 6 because of the difference in morphology of the sections.</p><p>Figure 7 needs many controls for the biochemical experiments. Control vectors with just V5 or Flag. total input for the KLHL40 flag.</p><p>Control vectors/proteins for 7B are needed to assess promoter competition that can occur when expressing two different proteins at different levels. 7C could benefit from a stability assay rather than steady-state levels of the proteins. Figure 7F needs controls without the addition of the Kelch protein and just GST lysates. The ubiquitination could be occurring just with the addition of contaminating proteins.</p><p>Figure 9 needs disease controls. Hard to know if sar1 is upregulated in many myopathies. the same is true for ECM defects.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dynamic regulation of interorganelle communication by ubiquitylation controls skeletal muscle development and disease onset&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. It is suggested that the provided western blots (Figure S1) negate the potential for dominant negative effects of expressed truncated KLHL40 fragments, but can the antibody listed (directed to the C-terminus) recognize the remaining and potentially expressed N-terminal fragments in edited fish where the C-terminus is truncated (Figure 1A, Figure S1E)? Alternatively, other experiments that may address the potential (or lack of) dominant negative effects (rescue experiments, RNAi with similar phenotypes or otherwise) can be discussed.</p><p>2. It is not clear how ECM- collagen is defined in the added experiments (Figure 8 collagen panel) and how it is differentiated from intracellular accumulated procollagen 1. The procollagen antibody listed in methods may not stain mature collagen fibers. This should be addressed and the intracellular localization of accumulated procollagen 1 in KO conditions should be defined.</p><p>3. The outcomes of the RUSH-traffic experiments in KO cells are interesting and suggest a delay in PC traffic in KO vs WT cells with comparable traffic rates at later time points. Corresponding images depicting the quantified data should be added for clarity. The effects on the traffic of other cargoes should be examined to define if we are looking at a selective effect on large-size cargo such as procollagen or a more global effect on traffic from the ER. In the methods and Results sections, the authors state that an added cargo is being expressed (ST-mCherry) and its traffic (or that of another small-size cargo) from the ER in WT and KO cells should be compared to that of procollagen. This would be highly valuable and important.</p><p>4. It is suggested that the stabilization of Sar1 with MG132 negates the possibility of promoter competition in the transfection-based Sar1 expression level analysis yet there is a visible decrease in Sar1 levels in both conditions (+/- MG123). Simple normalized quantification of the presented data (Figure 7 B and C) should be added to define the selective contributions of proteasome-mediated degradation.</p><p>5. The added IF of PDI (IF, Figure 6) supports the EM analysis showing a substantive dilation of the ER in KLHL40 deleted cells. Yet the added cursory analysis of UPR (omics of Bip calnexin, CHOP, Ero1) suggests that UPR is not induced but no alternative mechanism for ER-expansion is discussed. A closer look at the UPR (phospho-Ire1, phospho-PERK, spliced XBP1) should address if subtle effects on secretion from the ER lead to a more limited UPR outcome. The added new data showing mostly intact Golgi (as opposed to previous conclusions) may support this alternative.</p><p>6. In Figure 6 S1, increase in levels of autophagy markers may (or may not) report on autophagy levels as this may also depend on other factors. Similarly, added blots provided for LC3 I/II ratios require ratio quantification. Overall, the limitations of both analyses should be discussed.</p><p>7. The definitions of TANGO1 localization as &quot;large&quot; or bigger &quot;vesicles&quot; should be clarified (both for TANGO1 and COPII staining) with TANGO1 likely not marking vesicles but instead marking ER exit sites (ERES). Increased Sar1a may lead in some undefined manner to a decrease in ERES assembly and this point should be discussed (see below).</p><p>8. The added info on Sar1b levels (not modified), suggests that indeed the ratio between Sar1a and Sar1b is modified in KLHL40 KO. If so, co-expression of Sar1a and b may nullify the effects of Sar1a overexpression. This point can be addressed and discussed, given the selective roles of Sar1 proteins in procollagen traffic.</p><p>9. The discussion on KLHL12-Cul3 should highlight both potential contributions in procollagen degradation in lysosomes and on traffic, given recent work on degradation of procollagen in KLHL12 expressing cells from the Kim and Lippincott-Schwartz labs.

In the abstract and in the title the authors use the term &quot;interorganelle communication&quot; to describe effects on multiple organelles (mitochondria ER) but this term is not clear as the work describes developmental control over organelle morphology which may be independent (Mitochondria, ER) with one explored functional outcome (biosynthetic secretion or intracellular traffic rather than communication).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81966.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall myopathic effects and changes on a cellular level to the morphology of organelles and sorting sites including ER exit sites and Golgi need further analysis and quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this critical point and apologize for not being clear previously.

These studies showed a significantly increased number of PDI-positive foci in the mutant muscle suggesting the increased number of membrane-bound structures are derived from ER. We also observed increased Sar1a immunoreactivity in the mutant myofibers co-localized with PDI. Moreover, the ultrastructure of these membrane-bound structures shows a similarity to ER and lacks the organization of CopII-coated vesicles shown previously (Barlowe et al., 1994 and; Matsuoka et al., 1998).

We have reorganized our data to reflect the major disease phenotypes and associated molecular changes. Our morphological studies point to complexity in the skeletal muscle defects in KLHL40 deficiency with reduced sarcomere size, mitochondrial changes, and abnormal vesicle trafficking. Our proteomics studies have identified reduced Ub-sites enrichment and increased abundance of their cognate proteins as potential KLHL40-CUL3 targets for vesicle trafficking (Sar1a), glycolytic (Pkm, Aldo), and early sarcomeric proteins (Ttn, Tnnt2, and Nckipsd).</p><p>Abnormal upregulation of early sarcomeric protein in mature skeletal muscle is associated with structural defects in sarcomeres, and increased rates of glycolysis in differentiated skeletal muscle lead to atrophy.

Although the authors demonstrate that selective effects are derived from the deletion of KLHL40a, both a and b forms are expressed to almost the same levels (Figure S1A-E). What is the explanation for the differential effect? Is it localization? Is it a lack of different activities of the b isoform and why? Could it be that a possible intact BTB domain in the klhl40b deletion/ truncation vs the truncated BTB in the A isoform is significant here (Figure 1A-B, S1A-B)? Could it be that the klhl40a truncation is generating a dominant negative effect? This should be explored and at least discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Genome duplication events occurred in the ancestor of all vertebrates. After duplication, one of the duplicates most frequently loses its function, and the other retains all the original functions. This redundancy in zebrafish <italic>klhl40</italic> genes is evident from a previous study that showed a similar expression pattern of <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> in zebrafish skeletal muscle but different severity of muscle phenotypes of the morphant fish. While <italic>klhl40a</italic> knockdown by morpholinos resulted in a severe phenotype, <italic>klhl40b</italic> morphant fish exhibited a relatively mild phenotype suggesting functional redundancy similar to our studies (Ravenscroft et al., 2013). <italic>klhl40a</italic> and <italic>klhl40b</italic> mutations are predicted to encode for truncated proteins. However, western blot analysis (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) showed a complete absence of klhl40 proteins in the mutant fish lines. It thus ruled out a dominant negative effect of the truncated protein. These changes are incorporated in the main text on pages 5 and 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although it is clear that morphological effects are observed in KLHL40a deletion muscle, these are largely undefined. Are there morphology changes to the SR-ER and Golgi at 1.5 months in KO, particularly since proteome changes are already observed at that stage?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking this critical question. We have performed a detailed analysis of <italic>klhl40a</italic> and control zebrafish skeletal muscle at 1.5 months (added Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and text on page 7). Evaluation of the ultrastructure by electron microscopy did not reveal any significant changes in sarcomeres or SR/ER region (Figure 2SA). We looked specifically at the ER and Golgi membranes by immunofluorescence in cultured myofibers isolated from <italic>klhl40a</italic> and control zebrafish skeletal muscle at 1.5 months. No changes were observed in the localization of the ER and Golgi markers (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Finally, we have looked at different vesicles in the control and klhl40a myofibers to define specific defects. We included that data in updated figure 6 (Please see responses 1 and 3 to the editor’s questions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Key to understanding the effects of KLHL40a deletion are the morphological changes depicted by EM in figure 2. A-H and these will truly benefit from better analysis. The authors should utilize organelle markers and immunofluorescence, in order to define the identity and morphology of affected organelles in control and KO states (in particular the SR-ER, some shown in Figure 6 but deserves more markers and better analysis and importantly also Golgi compartments). Is the ER dilated? What is the extent of Golgi fragmentation? The presentation of the EM images will also greatly benefit from the enlargements of individual examples of organelle images and better morphological descriptions. Similar analysis will benefit Figure 5D in particular following Golgi morphology thus defining if it is the increased Sar1a levels that lead to Golgi fragmentation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these excellent suggestions, and we regret omitting this critical information in the previous version of the manuscript. We have performed a detailed analysis of klhl40a and control muscle by different vesicle markers by immunofluorescence. To improve the sensitivity of immunofluorescence and rule out any freezing artifacts, we have performed these analyses in the cultured myofibers from klhl40a and control zebrafish (3 months). No changes in the ER and Golgi are observed at 1.5 months in the <italic>Klhl40</italic>a mutants compared to the control (Figure 2S). The ER appear to be dilated by electron microscopy analysis, and quantification of this is now added to Figure 2. After careful reanalysis, we do not see large-scale changes in the Golgi in Klhl40a mutants. We have analyzed a large number of myofibers (n=10-12, 3 replicates) and found normal Golgi architecture in most of the myofibers. In a small percentage of myofibers, we observed Golga2 positive aggregates. These changes are quantified and added to figure 6, and the text is added to pages 15 and 16.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It has been demonstrated that the activities of biosynthetic secretion are adjusted during developmental processes by unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling. It would be an informative and important addition to the work if the authors examine their data and expand their analysis (transcriptome and proteome) to describe potential UPR activity (selected targets) both during development and in particular in KLHL40a KO where UPR is likely induced (added to Figure 4). This should provide an important control to the study and current conclusions that suggest perturbed secretion from the ER (the alternative where there is no UPR activation suggesting perhaps a subtle secretion defect or a very selective defect in collagen secretion, although the latter may not agree with Golgi fragmentation).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for asking about this critical point. We have examined the UPR activity by evaluating differential levels of Bip, Calnexin, Ero1, Irea1, CHOP, and PERK and did not identify any significant differences between control and <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutants at 1.5 and 3 months of age by proteome and RNA seq (3 months). We observed a defect in procollagen trafficking from ER to Golgi (Figure 8, text page 19). Moreover, new IF revealed that Golgi structure is preserved in most of the myofibers (Figure 6, text pages 15-16). Future studies may be able to provide if the vesicle trafficking defects in klhl40a deficiency specifically affect collagens or other proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors describe the regulation of Sar1a yet this isoform-specific Sar1 effect is not discussed or examined. This is not trivial as Sar1b is selectively implicated in supporting traffic of large lipid particles as was also established in zebrafish by the Knapik group and was also implicated in the packaging of large-size cargo from the ER in early work from the Schekman group. Is it the ratio between the two Sar1 isoforms that are perturbed to give the observed collagen and ECM secretion/deposition defects? Is it just the excess of Sar1 proteins regardless of the isoform nature that is leading to ER tubulation and inhibition of general secretion? Given the authors finding and the body of previous work on Sar1a and Sar1b, it would markedly benefit this work to address these points. The authors should also better define when Sar1a or all isoforms are followed in their experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we apologize for not addressing this earlier. While a significant increase was observed in Sar1a protein in <italic>klhl40a</italic> knockout muscle, no significant changes were observed in Sar1b, indicating the defects observed are isoform-specific. As no differences were observed in Sar1b, all the experiments were performed with reagents specific to Sar1a (cDNA for ubiquitination and cell culture studies and antibody for Sar1a protein). The following text to reflect this is added to the main text on page 24 “While the Sar1a level was increased in the Klhl40a mutant, no differences were observed in closely related family member Sar1b in Klhl40a deficiency (Table S1). SAR1B regulates chylomicron trafficking and is 90% identical to SAR1A; these proteins exhibit different biochemical properties in COPII assembly and do not compensate for each other function in vivo (58-60). Therefore, in Klhl40a deficiency, altered levels of Sar1a contribute to procollagen trafficking defects in skeletal muscle”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The results showing elevated levels of Sar1a in KLHL40a deletion are very interesting. The authors further show that the levels of other COPII subunits are mostly reduced (Figure 5 A-C) but provide an incomplete analysis. It is known that COPII proteins including inner and outer layer components undergo ubiquitination and de-ubiquitylation cycles. The authors should specifically examine if overall Sec23 and Sec24 levels are co-regulated as these form Sec23 -Sec24 complexes. Similarly, and more importantly, the analysis ignores Sec13 and Sec31 subunits of the coat outer layer and this should be explored. In accordance, key regulatory proteins including TANGO1, cTAGE5, and in particular Sec12 should also be highlighted (all is in the data and if interesting, perhaps deserve western blot analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a detailed analysis of COPII subunits and identified that inner layer proteins sec23 and sec24 are downregulated in KLhl40a deficiency, suggesting that they are co-regulated in klhl40a deficiency. No significant changes were observed in the ER-resident protein Sec12 or outer COPII membrane proteins Sec13 and Sec31 and TANGO1 and cTAGE5 levels (added to text on page 14). While Sec31 and Sec24 antibodies didn’t work by IF or western, we have performed IF to quantify the number of vesicles formed by these proteins and provided the data in Figure 6 ( text pages 15-16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. It is interesting to note that the COPII protein Sec31 was previously shown to be developmentally regulated by Cul3-KLHL12 mediated Sec31 ubiquitylation to support collagen secretion. It is possible that Cul3-driven tight control over COPII subunit levels and ratios is generally at play here. Indeed, the authors suggest that levels of multiple ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitylases are modified leading to the observed overall complex effects on the proteome. However special focus should be given to known regulators of COPII. Is KLHL12 expression modified in development here? Is it modified by KLHL40a deletion? The authors should examine the potential adjustments made by Cul3-KLHL12 that may control Sec31 levels. This analysis will provide a required overview of Cul3-regulated secretion proposed here and would suggest that selective control of the levels of individual COPII components (and not just Sar1a) may direct coat composition, a potentially highly significant outcome with broad implications.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 has raised a very interesting point and we apologize for not addressing this earlier. Gene expression analysis showed that KLHL12 is expressed at very low levels in skeletal muscle compared to other cells and tissue types (http://gtexportal.org). KLHL12 and Sec31 expression was also not modified in Klhl40a deficiency at the protein level (Table S1). This suggests that there are tissue-specific roles of CUL3 where CUL3 interacts with different Kelch proteins and regulates different aspects of secretory pathways in different tissues. We have added this point to the discussion on page 24 in the following text.</p><p>“CUL3-dependent ubiquitylation is previously shown to dynamically regulate the trafficking of large COPII carriers (56). KLHL12, another substrate-specific adapter for CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase forms a complex with CUL3 which ubiquitylates SEC31 leading to an increase in COPII vesicle size to accommodate large procollagen molecules for secretion (56). KLHL12 is expressed at very low levels in normal skeletal muscle compared to other cells and tissue types (http://gtexportal.org). We did not identify any differential changes in Klhl12 and the target protein Sec31 in Klhl40a deficiency. CUL3 interacts with many Kelch proteins in a tissue specific context and therefore, may regulate specific aspects of secretory pathways in response to different stimuli”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors localize Sar1 in control and KLHL40a deletion mutants (Figure 6) and in KLHL40 nm patient samples (Figure 9A) but should complement this with analysis with a similar analysis of other COPII components and of ER exit site proteins such as TANGO1 or Sec16. This analysis is required to define the effects of Sar1a levels on COPII assembly and ER exit site assembly. The analysis is critical for the work, generating some mechanistic insights on the roles of KLHL40a in regulating secretion, and monitoring outcomes of elevated Sar1a levels on its downstream effectors.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this critical point.

We have now performed additional immunofluorescence on Sar1a and associated vesicles in <italic>klhl40a</italic> KO and have added that, as updated in figure 6. We have also performed IF analysis on zebrafish in figure 5d which showed increased Sar1a staining is colocalized with the ER marker PDI in zebrafish myofibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 needs many controls for the biochemical experiments.

The ubiquitination could be occurring just with the addition of contaminating proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments or added controls for previously missing experiments in Figure 7. Figure 7A: We have added the controls for control V5 and FLAG plasmids and the total input for KLHl40 FLAG as the new figure 7A.</p><p>Figure 7B: We have performed an additional experiment to assess the effect of promoter competition of KLHL40FLAG and Sar1V5 vectors. We observed that the expression of KLHL40FLAG was the same in the absence and the presence of Sar1V5. As observed previously, the expression of Sar1V5 was reduced in the presence of KLHL40FLAG. This suggests a lack of promoter competition between Sar1V5 and KLHL40 FLAG (Added as Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and text on page 17).</p><p>Figure 7C: This experiment aims to determine the effect of the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of SAR1A in the presence of KLHL40, and we show that MG132 prevents this degradation. This suggests that the reduced levels of SAR1A in the presence of KLHL40 are caused by ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation, and a cycloheximide-based half-life stability assay may not be necessary.</p><p>Figure 7F: We have performed the control experiment regarding the in vitro ubiquitination reaction for SAR1A in the presence of GST. We found that GST itself did not result in the ubiquitination of SAR1A, suggesting that the ubiquitination of SAR1A requires KLHL40. This figure has been added as a supplemental figure (added Figure 7—figure supplement 1 and text on page 18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 9 needs disease controls. Hard to know if sar1 is upregulated in many myopathies. the same is true for ECM defects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for asking this question. We have obtained skeletal muscle samples from centronuclear myopathy patients (<italic>RYR1</italic> and <italic>MTM1</italic> mutations) and quantified the amount of total SAR1A protein by western blotting (added as Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The amount of SAR1A was significantly upregulated in KLHL40 deficiency but not in other myopathies. This suggests that SAR1A upregulation is specific to KLHL40related myopathy. Due to the limited amount of muscle biopsies, we could not evaluate ECM structure. Previous studies have shown normal ECM structures in RYR1 and MTM centronuclear myopathies. Therefore, SAR1A is not associated with disease pathology in other forms of myopathies. This text is added to the text on page 20.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. It is suggested that the provided western blots (Figure S1) negate the potential for dominant negative effects of expressed truncated KLHL40 fragments, but can the antibody listed (directed to the C-terminus) recognize the remaining and potentially expressed N-terminal fragments in edited fish where the C-terminus is truncated (Figure 1A, Figure S1E)? Alternatively, other experiments that may address the potential (or lack of) dominant negative effects (rescue experiments, RNAi with similar phenotypes or otherwise) can be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated western blots with an antibody that recognizes 1-50 amino acids of the N-terminal of the KLHL40 proteins (upstream of the mutations in the different klhl40 fish lines). Western blot analysis showed the absence of the klhl40 mutant protein in the klhl40ab mutant and a reduction in protein amounts in klhl40a or klhl40b mutants compared to the wildtype control. Updated westerns are added to Figure S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is not clear how ECM- collagen is defined in the added experiments (Figure 8 collagen panel) and how it is differentiated from intracellular accumulated procollagen 1. The procollagen antibody listed in methods may not stain mature collagen fibers. This should be addressed and the intracellular localization of accumulated procollagen 1 in KO conditions should be defined.</p></disp-quote><p>To distinguish between the ECM at the periphery of myofibers and the intracellular region, we have added the panels with the sarcomeric α-actin antibody (Figure 8), and the corresponding text is added on pages 19-20. Procollagens in the mutant muscle are predominantly intracellular, as seen with actinin co-labeling. Precise localization of procollagens, while an important question, will need high-resolution imaging such as immunoEM and extensive optimization with multiple antibodies and is the beyond the scope of current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The outcomes of the RUSH-traffic experiments in KO cells are interesting and suggest a delay in PC traffic in KO vs WT cells with comparable traffic rates at later time points. Corresponding images depicting the quantified data should be added for clarity. The effects on the traffic of other cargoes should be examined to define if we are looking at a selective effect on large-size cargo such as procollagen or a more global effect on traffic from the ER. In the methods and Results sections, the authors state that an added cargo is being expressed (ST-mCherry) and its traffic (or that of another small-size cargo) from the ER in WT and KO cells should be compared to that of procollagen. This would be highly valuable and important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the images depicting the quantified data for the RUSH assay for procollagen trafficking in Figure 8B. We have also added data on the trafficking of the small cargo, sialyltransferase-mCherry, which was not significantly affected in <italic>KLHL40 KO</italic> myoblasts compared to WT control (Figure 8C). This is also added to the main text (page 20). These data suggest that KLHL40 deficiency primarily affects the trafficking of large cargo such as procollagens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is suggested that the stabilization of Sar1 with MG132 negates the possibility of promoter competition in the transfection-based Sar1 expression level analysis yet there is a visible decrease in Sar1 levels in both conditions (+/- MG123). Simple normalized quantification of the presented data (Figure 7 B and C) should be added to define the selective contributions of proteasome-mediated degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks we have added the quantification of western blots in Figures 7 B and C, which shows that the difference in SAR1A level in the presence of MG135 at different amounts of KLHL40 is not significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The added IF of PDI (IF, Figure 6) supports the EM analysis showing a substantive dilation of the ER in KLHL40 deleted cells. Yet the added cursory analysis of UPR (omics of Bip calnexin, CHOP, Ero1) suggests that UPR is not induced but no alternative mechanism for ER-expansion is discussed. A closer look at the UPR (phospho-Ire1, phospho-PERK, spliced XBP1) should address if subtle effects on secretion from the ER lead to a more limited UPR outcome. The added new data showing mostly intact Golgi (as opposed to previous conclusions) may support this alternative.</p></disp-quote><p>While we didn’t see the differences in the protein levels of the ER stress markers, we performed additional experiments to analyze phospho-Ire1, phosphor-PERK, and spliced XBP1 (Figure 6S D-E). This analysis showed lack of the spliced XBP1 in the Klhl40a mutant muscle. Western blot analysis revealed no differences in the PERK and phosphor-PERK levels between control and Klhl40a deficient skeletal muscle. We also tried two different antibodies for Phospho-Ire1alpha that showed the highest similarity with the zebrafish protein, but they failed to yield specific signals by western blots. Our proteome analysis, as well as RT-PCR assay for XBP1 and western blot analysis of phospho-PERK, showed no evidence of the UPR activation in vivo skeletal muscle. These results are added in Figure 6S, and the text is added in the main manuscript on pages 17 and 26.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 6 S1, increase in levels of autophagy markers may (or may not) report on autophagy levels as this may also depend on other factors. Similarly, added blots provided for LC3 I/II ratios require ratio quantification. Overall, the limitations of both analyses should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added quantification of the LC3II-LC3-1 ratio in Figure 6S and updated the corresponding figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The definitions of TANGO1 localization as &quot;large&quot; or bigger &quot;vesicles&quot; should be clarified (both for TANGO1 and COPII staining) with TANGO1 likely not marking vesicles but instead marking ER exit sites (ERES). Increased Sar1a may lead in some undefined manner to a decrease in ERES assembly and this point should be discussed (see below).</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified TANGO1 localization as ERES (Main manuscript, page 16) and discussed changes in ERES sites (Main manuscript, page 25) as follows.</p><p>“Klhl40a deficient skeletal muscle showed an increased number of enlarged ERES sites compared to controls, while the overall number of ERES sites was reduced in the mutant muscle. ERES functions as an inter-organelle transport apparatus that actively modulates its shape and size while directing diverse cargo types to Golgi and increases in size during active transport. As Klhl40a deficiency resulted in reduced procollagen trafficking from ER, this increase in the size of ERES sites could be a compensatory mechanism to enhance the secretory flux. Sar1 is associated with the ERES sites and regulates the formation of COPII vesicles. Despite the presence of increased Sar1A levels in Klhl40a deficient myofibers, reduced or limited amounts of other proteins, such as Sec16b and COPII proteins in the mutant myofibers may underlie a reduced number of ERES sites and COPII vesicles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The added info on Sar1b levels (not modified), suggests that indeed the ratio between Sar1a and Sar1b is modified in KLHL40 KO. If so, co-expression of Sar1a and b may nullify the effects of Sar1a overexpression. This point can be addressed and discussed, given the selective roles of Sar1 proteins in procollagen traffic.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the ratio between the Sar1a and Sar1b is modified in Klhl40a deficiency and have added this to the discussion. Sar1a and Sar1b have been shown to regulate the trafficking of common proteins such as cardiac sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 and procollagens, and therefore, co-expression of Sar1a and b may compensate for the deficiency of either of these Sar1 proteins. However, in Klhl40a deficiency, increased amounts of Sar1a resulted in the formation of abnormal ER-derived membrane bound-structures and, therefore, restoring the normal amount of Sar1a (than overexpression of Sar1b) may be able to restore the procollagen trafficking defects. This updated discussion is added to pages 25-26 in the main manuscript as follows:</p><p>“While the Sar1a level was increased in the <italic>klhl40a</italic> mutant, no differences were observed in closely related family member Sar1b in Klhl40a deficiency (Supplementary file 1) showing a decrease in Sar1a and Sar1b ratio. SAR1A is 90% identical to SAR1B and these proteins exhibit overlapping and unique functions with different biochemical properties in COPII assembly (60-62). While SAR1B specifically regulates chylomicron trafficking in the small intestine, both proteins are required for the trafficking of cardiac sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 protein and efficient ER export of procollagens and may be able to compensate for each other function for the trafficking of common proteins (62-65). In Klhl40a deficiency, increased amounts of Sar1a resulted in the formation of abnormal ER-derived membrane-bound structures and decreased procollagens trafficking; therefore, downregulation of Sar1a levels in skeletal muscle may be able to restore the procollagen trafficking defects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The discussion on KLHL12-Cul3 should highlight both potential contributions in procollagen degradation in lysosomes and on traffic, given recent work on degradation of procollagen in KLHL12 expressing cells from the Kim and Lippincott-Schwartz labs. Also, note the recent paper by Jinoh Kim and colleagues (MBoC) showing the involvement of maintaining KLHL12 in collagen levels rather than secretion</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, this is an important point, and we regret excluding this from the previous discussion. We have addressed these points in the main manuscript (Discussion, Pages 24-25). as follows.</p><p>“KLHL12, another substrate-specific adapter for CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase forms a complex with CUL3 which ubiquitylates SEC31 leading to an increase in COPII vesicle size to accommodate large procollagen molecules for secretion in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) (56). While most procollagens are trafficked through the secretory pathway, a subset is directed towards lysosomal degradation to remove excess procollagen from cells through the autophagy pathway (57). Recent studies in skin fibroblasts have shown that the CUL3-KLHL12 complex is involved in the routing of procollagens to lysosomes to regulate intracellular collagen levels (58). Moreover, inhibition of CUL3 neddylation which is critical for the ubiquitylation activity still led to the formation of large COPII vesicles by the CUL3-KLHL12 complex, which is required for the secretion of procollagens. As CUL3-mediated ubiquitylation also regulates KLHL12 protein stability, further studies are needed to understand the ubiquitylation-dependent and independent roles of CUL3-KLHL12 complex on procollagens secretion in different cellular contexts and physiological conditions. KLHL12 is expressed at very low levels in normal skeletal muscle compared to other cells and tissue types (http://gtexportal.org). We did not identify any differential changes in Klhl12 and the target protein Sec31 in Klhl40a deficiency. Moreover, no changes in the protein levels of autophagy markers were observed in Klhl40a deficiency at the disease states examined. CUL3 interacts with many Kelch proteins in a tissue-specific context and therefore, may regulate specific aspects of secretory and degradative pathways in response to different stimuli and disease states.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p><p>1. KLHL40 is defined in the text as a &quot;negative regulator&quot; of traffic, yet its deletion inhibits procollagen traffic.

In the abstract and in the title the authors use the term &quot;interorganelle communication&quot; to describe effects on multiple organelles (mitochondria ER) but this term is not clear as the work describes developmental control over organelle morphology which may be independent (Mitochondria, ER) with one explored functional outcome (biosynthetic secretion or intracellular traffic rather than communication).</p></disp-quote><p>Inter-organelle communication is used to describe the communication between different membrane compartments in protein trafficking and is clarified in the main text (page 4).</p></body></sub-article></article>
