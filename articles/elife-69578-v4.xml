resistance development. A better understanding of the drug’s action is needed to improve patient outcomes. Functional heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial to modulating drug resistance; understanding of individual patients’ TME that impacts drug response is hampered by lack of appropriate models. Lung organotypic tissue slice cultures (OTC) with patients’ native TME procured from primary and brain-metastasized (BM) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were treated with Pembrolizumab and/or beta-glucan (WGP, an innate immune activator). Metabolic tracing with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc/<sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-Gln, multiplex immunofluorescence, and digital spatial profiling (DSP) were employed to interrogate metabolic and functional responses to Pembrolizumab and/or WGP. Primary and BM PD-1<sup>+</sup> lung cancer OTC responded to Pembrolizumab and Pembrolizumab + WGP treatments, respectively. Pembrolizumab activated innate immune metabolism and functions in primary OTC, which were accompanied by tissue damage. DSP analysis indicated an overall decrease in immunosuppressive macrophages and T cells but revealed microheterogeneity in immune responses and tissue damage. Two TMEs with altered cancer cell properties showed resistance. Pembrolizumab or WGP alone had negligible effects on BM-lung cancer OTC but Pembrolizumab + WGP blocked central metabolism with increased pro-inflammatory effector release and tissue damage. In-depth metabolic analysis and multiplex TME imaging of lung cancer OTC demonstrated overall innate immune activation by Pembrolizumab but heterogeneous responses in the native TME of a patient with primary NSCLC. Metabolic and functional analysis also revealed synergistic action of Pembrolizumab and WGP in OTC of metastatic NSCLC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>non small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>tumor microenvironment</kwd><kwd>human macrophage metabolism</kwd><kwd>stable isotope resolved metabolomics</kwd><kwd>pembrolizumab</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007924</institution-id><institution>University of Louisville</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1P01CA163223-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lane</surname><given-names>Andrew N</given-names></name><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Teresa WM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007924</institution-id><institution>University of Louisville</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U24DK097215-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Higashi</surname><given-names>Richard M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fan</surname><given-names>Teresa WM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lane</surname><given-names>Andrew N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007924</institution-id><institution>University of Louisville</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5P20GM121327</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lane</surname><given-names>Andrew N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pembrolizumab activates innate immune metabolism and function in primary human non-small cell lung cancer, whereas Pembrolizumab and beta-glucan synergize in enhancing immune metabolism and tumoridical action in brain-metastasized lung cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>New checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy, such as the use of programmed death one receptor (PD-1, CD279, or PDCD1) antibody Pembrolizumab (Pembro) has significantly improved the survival of lung and other cancer patients. However, even after stratification, a large fraction of the patient population shows variable efficacy, resistance development, and intolerable toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arlauckas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meyers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morgensztern and Herbst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rizvi et al., 2015</xref>). Clearly better therapeutic prediction and understanding of the drug action are needed to improve patient care and outcomes. Functional heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial to modulating drug responses including resistance development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ostman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Qu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trédan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). However, our understanding of individual patients’ TME that impacts drug response is hampered by lack of appropriate models.</p><p>Multiple preclinical models have been established for basic and translational cancer research, ranging from 2D/3D cell cultures, 3D patient-derived organoids (PDO), ex vivo organotypic tissue slice cultures (OTC), to in vivo xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). Each model has its advantages and limitations. The use of tissue slices (with no culturing involved) was pioneered by O. Warburg who demonstrated enhanced lactic fermentation under aerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Warburg, 1924</xref>), which is now recognized as a hallmark of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). We have adopted and improved this approach by culturing ex vivo lung tissue slices derived from NSCLC patients. We have shown that such ex vivo cultures recapitulate the metabolic reprogramming observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sellers et al., 2015</xref>). This model is versatile in experimental manipulations and retains patients’ native 3D architecture/tissue microenvironment including infiltrated immune cells, which is not represented by multiply passaged mouse PDX or 3D cell models including PDO. Furthermore, the matched cancer (CA) and non-cancer (NC) tissue design provides the capacity for distinguishing on- and off-target drug actions in individual patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lane et al., 2016</xref>). We previously showed that two different PD lung OTC treated with the natural product immune activator (β-glucan) displayed distinct responses of macrophage (MΦ) metabolism that was related to variable tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>It is now widely recognized that metabolic reprogramming is crucial to immune cell activation to meet the demand for energy/anabolic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gnanaprakasam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Neill and Pearce, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palmieri et al., 2020</xref>) and specific immunomodulatory events. Notably, succinate production in MΦ stabilized HIF1α, resulting in the release of proinflammatory IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>). Tryptophan (Trp) catabolism to quinolinate fuels de novo NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and blockade of this pathway led to a pro-inflammatory state in aged MΦ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minhas et al., 2019</xref>). Reprogrammed metabolic events in the TME can also favor tumor immune escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganeshan and Chawla, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghesquière et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sica and Bronte, 2007</xref>). For example, enhanced glycolysis (e.g. induced by the expression of checkpoint ligand PD-L1) in cancer cells can deplete glucose leading to T-cell ‘anergy’ in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2017</xref>). The resulting excess release of lactate and protons into the TME can also deactivate infiltrating MΦ and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fischer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gurusamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munn and Bronte, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 2015</xref>). The expression of PD-L1 receptor, PD-1 was also shown to negatively regulate T-cell function and survival by modulating T-cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettonville et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patsoukis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tkachev et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, tumor indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) depleted Trp in the TME by oxidation to kynurenine, which led to T-cell inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joyce and Fearon, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munn and Mellor, 2013</xref>). All of these immunomodulatory events were primarily learned from animal models or in vitro human cell cultures. The question is whether they are recapitulated in the patient tumor tissues.</p><p>To address this question, we prepared ex vivo lung OTC procured from one each patient with primary and brain-metastasized (BM) NSCLC. They were subject to Pembro ± β-glucan treatments with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose or <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>,<sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>-Gln as tracers for tracking perturbations in metabolic networks by stable isotope-resolved metabolomic (SIRM) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sellers et al., 2015</xref>). We found that Pembro activated the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), glycogen turnover, and Gln uptake but blocked Gln use in the Krebs cycle, itaconate synthesis, and quinolinate buildup in the primary NSCLC OTC. For the metastatic NSCLC OTC, Pembro or β-glucan alone had little metabolic effect but the combination treatment suppressed the PPP, glycogen synthesis, and nucleotide synthesis. Reduced mitotic index and significant tissue damage were evident in Pembro-treated primary and Pembro + β-glucan-treated BM-NSCLC OTC. Metabolic changes in the primary OTCs were correlated with the release of pro-inflammatory effectors and reduced expression of cancer cell/anti-inflammatory MΦ markers. These changes point to innate immune activation by Pembro, but different TMEs responded variably as shown by digital spatial profiling (DSP) and/or immunofluorescence analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PD-1<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are present in both primary and metastatic NSCLC tumors</title><p>We performed multiplex immunofluorescent (mIF) staining on the primary (from patient UK131) and metastatic (from patient UK2035) NSCLC tissues to characterize the tumor cell type, the status of the checkpoint proteins, and immune cell properties (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, for staging and demographics). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, the UK131 tumor stained positive for KRT5 (<bold>A</bold>), which is consistent with its clinical classification as lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). Although the KRT5<sup>+</sup> cancer cells were positive for HIF1α, this staining occurred much more in the cytoplasm than in the nucleus, which suggests that the major fraction of HIF1α was not transcriptionally active. Also present were the smaller non-cancer HIF1α<sup>+</sup> cells, which are likely infiltrated immune cells (<bold>A</bold>). More notable was the presence of PD-1 expressing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<bold>B</bold>), which indicates a high likelihood of this tissue to respond to Pembro treatment.

We found that the CA OTC responded to Pembro with a metabolic shift. Namely, Pembro enhanced <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc-derived <sup>13</sup>C labeling in most of the PPP metabolites compared to the control (Ctl) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These included <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) (<bold>6</bold>, <bold>a</bold>), <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-ribulose/ribose-5-phosphate (R5P) (<bold>5</bold>, <bold>c</bold>), <sup>13</sup>C<sub>7</sub>-sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) (<bold>7</bold>, <bold>d</bold>), <sup>13</sup>C<sub>4</sub>-erythrose-4-phosphate (E4P) (<bold>4</bold>, <bold>e</bold>), and <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) (<bold>6</bold>, <bold>f</bold>), but not <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-6-phosphogluconate (6 PG) (<bold>6</bold>, <bold>b</bold>). These data point to activation of the PPP with a partial block at the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) step in the oxidative branch. As such, the non-oxidative (Nonox) branch reactions catalyzed by the transketolase (TK) and transaldolase (TA) contributed more to the <sup>13</sup>C incorporation into R5P, S7P, E4P, and F6P in Pembro versus Ctl-treated CA OTC. This agrees with the Pembro-induced higher buildup of scrambled <sup>13</sup>C isotopologues (<bold>Scr</bold>) of these metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition to PPP activation, Pembro enhanced <sup>13</sup>C labeling of glycogen (<bold>i</bold>) and its direct precursor UDP-glucose (UDPG, <bold>h</bold>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which suggests stimulation of glycogen synthesis by Pembro.

DSP is a new technology that enables high-plex analysis of many protein markers in different regions of interest (ROIs) of FFPE tissue sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zugazagoitia et al., 2020</xref>). We chose 12 ROIs at 100 or 200 µm diameter for each Ctl and Pembro-treated tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and data not shown) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). The choices were based on TME regions enriched in T cells (CD8<sup>+</sup>, red), MΦ (CD68<sup>+</sup>, yellow), cancer cells (panCK<sup>+</sup>, green), and combinations of the three cell types. ROI-dependent analysis of 58 protein markers revealed 11 markers whose expression was attenuated across most ROIs of Pembro-treated versus Ctl tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These included Ki67 as well as cancer cell markers EpCAM and Her2. The decreased expression is consistent with tissue damage and reduced cancer cell population as observed by H&amp;E and mIF imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Also evident was the reduced expression of M2-type MΦ markers, CD163 and Arg1 as well as regulatory T (Treg) cell marker CD25. CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg cells are known to induce M2-type polarization in co-cultured monocytes, as evidenced by the upregulation of CD163 and downregulation of HLA-DR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tiemessen et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, CD25 suppression may be related to reduced CD163 expression in the Pembro-treated TME. Although there was no consistent increase in HLA-DR expression across ROIs, we saw an overall increase in the ratio of this M1–MΦ marker to the M2–MΦ marker Arg1 in Pembro- versus Ctl-treated CA tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This was also the case for another human M1–MΦ marker IDO1. These data point to repolarization of M2- to M1-type MΦ in the Pembro-treated CA tissue. In contrast to the response of the Treg marker CD25, the ratio of a T-cell activation marker iCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2001</xref>) to T-cell marker CD4 largely increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) along with decreased expression of the checkpoint protein CTLA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) across all ROIs in response to Pembro. Reduced Treg cell occurrence was commonly noted in CA tissues from Pembro-treated cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2020</xref>). However, enhanced iCOS expression in T cells was not known to be induced by anti-PD-1 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wei et al., 2017</xref>). It should be noted that since no immune cell infiltration can occur in our OTC model, the Pembro-induced T-cell or MΦ marker response was derived from the resident populations only.</p><p>Moreover, we observed variable ROI-dependent distributions of immune functional and cancer cell markers in relation to the mitotic index marker Ki-67 in Pembro- and Ctl-treated CA tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In particular for Pembro-treated tissues, panCK<sup>+</sup> cancer cells-rich ROIs 3, 7, 9, and 12 had much higher granzyme B (GZMB) relative to Ki-67 levels than ROIs 6 and 8. ROIs 3, 7, 9, and 12 also displayed higher iCOS/CD4 ratios than ROIs 6 and 8. These data point to more activated T cells and reduced proliferative capacity of cancer cells in the former than the latter regions. We also noted attenuated expression of a lung cancer driver protein Her2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garrido-Castro and Felip, 2013</xref>) in ROIs 6/8 versus ROIs 3/7/9/12, which suggests a difference in cancer cell property between the two sets of ROIs. Moreover, ROI six displayed very high IDO1/Arg1 and HLA-DR/Arg1 ratios than other ROIs including ROI 8. This could reflect a particularly high polarization of TAM toward M1-type and/or IDO1 overexpression in cancer cells in ROI 6. In either case, cancer cells in this TME appeared to remain proliferative. As for ROI 8, the proliferative capacity was the highest with the lowest IDO1 or HLA-DR to Arg1 ratios but a comparable level of cytotoxic GZMB and ICOS/CD4 ratio to those of ROIs 3/7/9/12. These data implicate the presence of Pembro-resistant cancer cells in ROIs 6 and 8, which can overcome M1 polarization in ROI six and T-cell activation in ROI 8. If ROI six cancer cells were high in IDO1 activity, this can deplete Trp in the TME while producing immunosuppressive metabolites such as kynurenine, both of which could contribute to immune evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moffett and Namboodiri, 2003</xref>) and thus cancer cell resistance. IDO1 overexpression occurred in NSCLC and higher serum kynurenine to Trp ratios/QA levels were associated with NSCLC disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botticelli et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our metabolomic data showed that QA built up in response to M1-MΦ activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), which presumably resulted from a block in the downstream enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyl-transferase, which is involved in de novo NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Minhas et al., 2019</xref>). Trp-fueled NAD<sup>+</sup> repletion is required for mitochondrial signaling and metabolism during immune resolution. QA depletion by Pembro in CA OTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–d</xref>) is unlikely to result from M2-type MΦ polarization as Arg1 expression was down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Instead, it is consistent with excess Trp consumption by IDO1-overexpressing cancer cells, thereby interfering with immune activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Metastatic tumor OTCs of UK2035 patient respond to Pembro+WGP co-treatment</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Pembro+WGP blocks the Krebs cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and glycogen/nucleotide synthesis in UK2035 CA lung OTCs</title><p>We treated ex vivo OTCs of BM NSCLC tissues of patient UK2035 with none (Ctl), Pembro, WGP, or Pembro + WGP (<italic>P</italic> + W) in the presence of <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-Glc for 24 hr.

We observed metabolic responses to Pembro that are likely to be caused by M1 repolarization of TAM. By coupling with the high-plex DSP analysis, we also saw TMEs likely to be immunoevasive in primary NSCLC tissues of a patient that were overall sensitive to Pembro treatment. We further observed synergism in the tumor-killing action of Pembro and WGP in brain-metastasized NSCLC tissues. Thus, the ex vivo organotypic tissue culture system represents a unique model for interrogating patient’s responses to immunotherapeutics while informing potential resistance mechanism in highly heterogeneous TMEs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological Sample(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary patient NSCLC and matched non cancerous lung tissue</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fresh thin tissue slices from surgical resection</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Materials and methods section, this study</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological Sample(<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NSCLC metastasis to brain patient</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fresh thin tissue slices from surgical resection</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Materials and methods section, this study</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary monocytes</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Healthy volunteer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Freshly isolated from healthy male volunteer</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pembrolizumab (humanized mouse anti PD-1 monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Markey Cancer Center/Merck</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF(1:1000), WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-PanCK(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-CD8(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-CD68(mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SCBT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WGPBeta glucan</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">InvivoGen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Whole glucan particles</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MNOVA 14.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mrestlab</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAPI stain</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">D1306</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(1 µg/mL)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AlexaFluor Tyramide Superboost kits,</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Materials and methods section for detailed use</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Patient recruitment and tissue procurement/processing</title><p>Two surgical patients (UK131 and UK2035) were consented for freshly resected tissue specimens under the approved IRB protocol (14–0288-F6A; 13-LUN-94-MCC) of the University of Kentucky (UKy) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

However, each patient’s TME is unique in its own right, which provides insights into individual patient’s drug response without the need for additional comparison. In addition, the native TME and tumor architecture will be lost in the murine explant (PDX) model, which deviates from the purpose of the study. The paragraph cited in the Conclusions section was meant for overall sensitivity of the tumor OTCs, not of the patient. Since Pembro had not been approved for treating primary respectable NSCLC, we do not have the correlation of OTCs response to patient response. This is certainly of interest to pursue in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig5 it is probably a mistake of figure reporting, but the only treatment which appears with great interest (Pembro + WGP) consists of a single data point.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not a mistake.

Although we did not quantify the % of macrophages in tumor tissue slices, it is higher than 5% of tumor cells based on the CD68 and panCK staining patterns in Fig. 4C. We would also like to point out that macrophages are much bigger cells than lymphocytes and isolated macrophages show very large metabolic responses to proinflammatory (M1) activation (see Figs. S3 and S4; now Fig.1 – figure supplement 1 and Fig.2 – figure supplement 1). These responses are expected to be “diluted” in patient OTCs by the presence of other cell types, foremost cancer cells. This is consistent with the much less prominent M1-like responses in cancer OTCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to improve the quality of the paper and further support their statement the authors should perform an ex vivo treatment of fresh tumour tissues [10.1038/s41598-017-12222-9] and follow with FACS sorting [10.7554/eLife.61980] coupled with metabolomic analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. However, tissue dissociation followed by FACS sorting is known to alter cell metabolite patterns. We would expect that the tracer enrichment patterns will be even more significantly altered or even lost during the prolonged harvest procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, a NanoString approach such as nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel coupled with GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler could strengthen the metabolomic analysis and be useful to build a metabolic signature predictive for ICIs response.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that coupling RNA expression analysis with DSP and SIRM analysis would further strengthen the paper. However, we did not have additional OTCs to perform parallel RNA expression analysis, as the fresh patient tissues that we could procure were only sufficient for SIRM study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Tissue slices should be cultured in a more physiological medium (i.e. Plasmax) instead of DMEM.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that standard media such as DMEM do not represent typical physiological conditions and new medium formulations such as Plasmax more closely mimic metabolite composition of human serum. We will take this into consideration in future studies. In fact, we are exploring different culturing methods to prolong the viability of OTCs such that chronic (e.g. month-long) drug response study can be performed. We would like to point out that the metabolite composition of serum does vary from patient to patient, which makes it difficult to match with a common medium. We also need to supplement certain growth factors to maintain cancer stem cells in OTCs, which are crucial to drug resistance development. Moreover, unlike 2D cell cultures, we expect OTCs to develop localized gradient of nutrients, pH, and waste products such as lactate, which makes complete matching of the metabolite composition of the TME more complex. Suffice to say, we observed metabolic/immune functional responses of OTCs to immune modulators that were consistent with macrophage activation, regardless the use of unphysiological DMEM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In the present paper the Authors aimed at investigating the impact of immune checkpoint inhibition in the modulation of cancer cell metabolism and in the impairment of the overall immune tumor microenvironment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major strengths of the paper are the innovative model and the study design, aimed at the localization and quantification &quot;in situ&quot; of the set of molecules under investigation.</p><p>Major weaknesses are the limited statistical significance of their data and the heterogeneity of the model (poorly characterized tumor typing of both primary tumor and brain metastasis and different treatment approaches in the two models).</p><p>Based on strengths and weaknesses above, the Authors partially achieved their objectives, and the conclusions have to be supported in a validation set of experiments.

We agree that individual metabolite responses did not reach statistical significance, presumably due to the influence of intrinsic heterogeneity in OTCs. However, metabolites from the same pathway responded in the same direction, which points to altered pathway activity. Patient tissue-specific response to drugs under the influence of tissue heterogeneity is what we sought to investigate. We illustrated this with two patient examples and did not intend to draw conclusion on how NSCLC tissues respond to Pembro or WGP in general. We are continuing this type of study on other patients’ OTCs and will follow reporting many more patient examples to further address the tumor heterogeneity issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The histology of the two tumor samples is not well characterized, despite it is well known that immune-to-tumor response mechanisms are largely heterogeneous among different non-small cell lung cancer histotypes.

The same applies to Figure 5 E to H. Moreover, a quantitative or semiquantitative estimation of the markers should be performed to sustain significance of variations reported. Data illustrated in Figure 4C are also biased by the different areas evaluated. Although the Authors selected fields with enrichment of tumor cells they lose direct comparison of same tumor areas.</p></disp-quote><p>The slices in Figs. 4 and 5 (now Fig. 6) were different but prepared from the same block of patient tissue. The distributions of cells varied from slice to slice, reflecting bulk tissue heterogeneity and giving rise to somewhat different staining patterns. The quantitative image analysis for Fig. 4B was unreliable due to large and variable autofluorescence background in different regions of the stained slides. We did obtain quantitative marker data with DSP analysis of panel 4C, which were shown in panels D and E. DSP analysis was not affected by autofluorescence. Choosing different ROIs is how DSP is done such that different ROIs represent different TME. As stated on p. 8 of the revised text, our ROI selections were meant to compare different TMEs, which was enriched in cancer cells, macrophages, lymphocytes or mixed cell types. This is not a bias, rather the selections enabled comparison of different TMEs’ response to Pembro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The Authors might comment of the increased MO content in CA-Pem (figure 4A) and the reduced CD68 expression illustrated in figure 4D.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not quantify the macrophage content in Fig. 4A, so we are not sure how the reviewer came up with the “increased MO content in CA-Pem”.
