interactions shape thermal niche width is critical in an era of global change. Yet, most previous work on thermal niches has ignored detailed mechanistic information about the relationship between temperature and organismal performance, which can be described by a thermal performance curve. Here, we develop a model that predicts the width of thermal performance curves will be narrower in the presence of interspecific competitors, causing a species’ optimal breeding temperature to diverge from that of its competitor. We test this prediction in the Asian burying beetle <italic>Nicrophorus nepalensis</italic>, confirming that the divergence in actual and optimal breeding temperatures is the result of competition with their primary competitor, blowflies. However, we further show that intraspecific cooperation enables beetles to outcompete blowflies by recovering their optimal breeding temperature. Ultimately, linking abiotic factors and biotic interactions on niche width will be critical for understanding species-specific responses to climate change.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Insects, reptiles and many other animals are often referred to as being ‘cold-blooded’ because, unlike mammals and birds, their body temperature fluctuates with the temperature of their surrounding environment.

A cornerstone for understanding the distribution and associated ecological impacts of climate change on organismal fitness is the concept of the ecological niche, which describes a hyperspace with permissive conditions and requisite resources under which an organism, population, or species has positive fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutchinson, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chase and Leibold, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colwell and Rangel, 2009</xref>). More than a half century ago, Hutchinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hutchinson, 1957</xref>) distinguished the fundamental niche—characterized by abiotic environmental measures like temperature and precipitation—from the realized niche—characterized by biological interactions like competition and predation. Although numerous studies since then have used the relationship between a species’ distribution and the climate in which it occurs to estimate a species’ fundamental niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kearney and Porter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quintero and Wiens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaüzère et al., 2015</xref>), a growing number of studies have also employed theoretical, observational, or experimental approaches to evaluate the detailed mechanisms (e.g. physiological limits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huey et al., 2012</xref>), demographic factors, and species interactions that shape a species’ fundamental and realized niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monahan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nilsson-Örtman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Estay et al., 2014</xref>). In general, differentiating between how abiotic factors and biotic interactions influence niche width is critical for understanding species-specific responses to climate change. Ultimately, generating a complete understanding of a species’ ecological niche not only requires understanding how abiotic and biotic factors interact to affect organismal performance and fitness, but also identifying the detailed mechanisms that shape differences in the fundamental and realized niches.</p><p>The concept of the thermal performance curve (TPC) was first developed to study how body temperature affects ectotherms’ physiological responses and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kearney and Porter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quintero and Wiens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gaüzère et al., 2015</xref>). Although the TPC concept has received increasing attention in studies of how warming temperatures influence organismal fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clusella-Trullas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sinclair et al., 2016</xref>), it has been developed largely independently from niche-based studies. Yet, characterizing the TPC is essentially a way to mechanistically quantify a species’ thermal niche. Since the TPC describes the detailed relationship between temperature and fitness, the concept may actually be more informative than that of the thermal niche, which is typically defined as the range of temperatures over which organisms occur in nature (i.e. thermal niche width) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huey and Stevenson, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hillaert et al., 2015</xref>). In other words, the TPC concept not only describes thermal niche width, it also quantifies an organism’s optimal temperature and how fitness varies with changes in temperature. In contrast, most TPC studies focus largely on what amounts to the fundamental TPC and do not explicitly consider biotic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dillon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gunderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swaddle and Ingrassia, 2017</xref>). The few TPC studies that have considered biotic interactions have almost all focused on predator-prey interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ockendon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibert et al., 2016</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no study has differentiated between fundamental and realized TPCs, nor experimentally quantified a species’ realized TPC in the context of interspecific competition, despite the fact that ecologists have long acknowledged that interspecific competition is a key driving force shaping a species’ realized niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schoener, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eurich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, although a few studies have shown that intraspecific cooperation can also help social species expand their realized niche width (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), little is known about how intraspecific cooperation influences the realized TPCs of social organisms.</p><p>Burying beetles (Silphidae, Nicrophorus) are ideal for investigating how social interactions influence both fundamental and realized TPCs because the potentially antagonistic effects of interspecific competition and intraspecific cooperation on the realized TPC can be studied simultaneously. Burying beetles rely on vertebrate carcasses for reproduction and often face intense intra- and interspecific competition for using these limiting resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pukowski, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Scott, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rozen et al., 2008</xref>). Competition for carcass access is temperature-dependent because the beetle’s main competitors, blowflies (family Calliphoridae), are more abundant and active at higher ambient temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Blowfly maggots also grow faster and digest carcasses more quickly at higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Donovan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kotzé et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to interspecific competition, intraspecific cooperative behavior among beetles may also modulate their realized TPC. Previous studies have shown that cooperative carcass preparation and burial enables beetles to outcompete blowflies and expand their thermal niche to warmer environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we extend classic ecological niche theory by introducing the concepts of fundamental and realized TPCs. We first construct a theoretical model by using a hypothetical TPC to predict how interspecific competition influences the width and optimal temperature of realized TPCs in order to provide a general understanding of the relationship between fundamental and realized TPCs. We then describe a series of laboratory and field experiments designed to test the predicted relationship between fundamental and realized TPCs in the Asian burying beetle <italic>Nicrophorus nepalensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We began our empirical work by measuring breeding performance without interspecific competitors in the laboratory and field to determine <italic>N. nepalensis</italic>’s fundamental TPC. We also measured the beetle’s locomotor ability, which is less likely to be influenced by biotic interactions, at different temperatures to determine the physiological basis of the fundamental breeding TPCs. We then quantified breeding performance in the presence of interspecific competitors, mainly blowflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Putman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Putman, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scott, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2014</xref>), to determine the beetle’s realized TPC. Finally, we used a group size manipulation in the presence of interspecific competitors in the field to explicitly examine the role of intraspecific cooperation and interspecific competition on the beetle’s realized TPC. Experimentally distinguishing between fundamental and realized TPCs will not only serve as a starting point for better understanding the relationships between abiotic and biotic drivers of organismal performance and fitness, but also for better predicting responses to climate change as the earth continues to warm.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A summary of the experiments used to investigate <italic>N. nepalensis</italic>’s fundamental and realized thermal performance curves (TPCs).</title><p>We examined locomotor and breeding performance in the lab and field without competitors to determine the fundamental TPC.

Our stable lab population was established in 2014 from 24 male and 24 female beetles caught near Meifeng, which is 2100 m above sea level on Mt. Hehuan, Taiwan (24°5' N, 121°10'E). Since establishment, we have supplemented the lab strain with new individuals from the same location every one or two years to avoid inbreeding. We used hanging pitfall traps baited with rotting pork (mean ± SE: 100 ± 10 g) to collect adult beetles in the field. We checked traps and collected beetles on the fourth day after traps were set. In every generation, we established at least 20 families, approximately 600 individuals in total, to maintain the population within the lab. To ensure that beetles in the lab population were unrelated to each other, we always paired beetles collected from different traps. We then put one female and one male in a 20 × 13 × 13 cm box with 10 cm of soil and a rat carcass (75 ± 7.5 g). Approximately two weeks after introducing adult beetles, all of the dispersing larvae that were ready to pupate from each breeding box were collected and allocated to a small, individual pupation box. After roughly 45 days, beetles that emerged from pupae were housed individually in 320 ml transparent plastic cups and fed once a week with superworms (<italic>Zophobas morio</italic>). All breeding experiments were conducted in walk-in growth chambers that imitated natural conditions where the lab population was collected at 2100 m on Mt. Hehuan. Temperature was set to daily cycles between 19°C at noon and 13°C at midnight, and relative humidity was set to 83–100%. We completed all of the laboratory experiments within three generations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Breeding performance in the common garden experiment</title><p>To investigate breeding TPCs, we conducted solitary pairing experiments in six temperature conditions—8, 10, 12, 16, 20°C and 22°C—in a common garden with no temperature variation in the lab. For each replicate, one male and one female were arbitrarily chosen from different nests to avoid inbreeding. We chose adult beetles that were sexually mature, roughly 2 to 3 weeks after their emergence. Each individual was weighed to the nearest 0.1 mg. We then placed the pair with a mouse carcass (75 ± 7.5 g) under each temperature condition in a transparent plastic container (21 × 13 × 13 cm with 10 cm of soil depth) for two weeks. Cases in which pairs fully buried the carcass and produced offspring were regarded as successful breeding attempts. Cases in which pairs failed to bury a carcass, or they buried it but did not produce offspring, were regarded as failed breeding attempts. The only instance (of 118 replicates) when beetles died during the experiment was excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Thermal regulation of locomotor performance</title><p>To determine the TPC for locomotor behaviors, we conducted a series of treadmill experiments under three temperature conditions—12, 16°C and 20°C—in a common garden with no temperature variation in the lab. We chose these temperatures because 16°C is the optimal performance temperature for reproduction, and we wanted to further test whether this optimal temperature coincided with optimal physiological function.</p><p>We set 72 replicates in total (12°C: 25 replicates; 16°C: 25 replicates; 20°C: 22 replicates). We arbitrarily selected individuals from different nests for replicates at each temperature. The beetles were brought to the experimental chamber one day before data collection began. Monofilament glued to the pronotum by UV glue attached each beetle to the treadmill, where it was allowed to walk at a stable speed of 150 cm/min. We turned off the treadmill if a beetle’s abdomen began to drag or if the beetle started to fly, both behaviors that indicated that the beetle could no longer walk. An individual was tested only once per day. After each experiment, beetles were returned to the transparent container with 3 cm of soil for recovery.</p><p>We measured each beetle’s pronotum and the ambient temperature during running with a thermal imaging infrared camera (FLIR Systems, Inc, SC305; thermal sensitivity of &lt;0.05°C) at a resolution of 320*240 pixels. Pronotum temperature was measured at the center of the thorax and calculated as the average pronotum body temperature each minute until an individual dragged its abdomen or started flying. The ambient temperature was the average temperature of a 6 × 6 cm surface of the treadmill located near where the beetle was tested. The temperature difference was depicted by the difference between the beetle’s body and ambient temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Breeding performance in the field</title><p>Since our previous study showed that blowflies are the beetle’s main interspecific competitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2014</xref>), we conducted series of experiments in the field to investigate the breeding TPC with and without interspecific competition. In 2013 to 2016 (May-October), we investigated the natural pattern of <italic>N. nepalensis</italic> reproduction and its breeding success along an elevational gradient from 673 m to 3422 m on Mt. Hehuan in central Taiwan (24°11’ N, 121°17’ E) that encompasses broadleaf forests at lower elevations and mixed conifer-broadleaf forests at higher elevations. We chose 37 study sites, primarily in natural forests to avoid cultivated or open areas where temperatures are more variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Frenne et al., 2019</xref>) and replicated each treatment at least three times at each site. In each trial, a 75 g (± 7.5 g) rat carcass was placed on the soil to attract beetles and covered with a 21 × 21 × 21 cm (length x width x height) iron cage with 2 × 2 cm mesh to prevent vertebrate scavengers from accessing the carcass. We checked each carcass daily until it began to decay due to microbial activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Payne, 1965</xref>), was consumed by maggots or other insects, or was buried under the soil by beetles. If burying beetles completely buried the carcass, we checked the experiment after 14 days to determine if third-instar larvae appeared. Cases in which pairs produced third-instar larvae were regarded as successful breeding attempts. Cases in which pairs failed to produce larvae were regarded as failed breeding attempts.</p><p>Breeding experiments without blowflies were conducted in the same experimental sites from 2014 to 2017, and 2019 (May-October). The experimental design was the same as that described above, but we used screen mesh above the pots to also keep blowflies out. To record air temperature at every site, we placed iButton devices approximately 120 cm above the ground within a T-shaped PVC pipe to prevent direct exposure to the sun but allow for air to circulate. One male and one female beetle that were reared in the lab were released into the pot to record fundamental breeding performance. After 14 days, we checked the pots to determine whether the burying beetles’ third-instar larvae appear. Cases in which pairs fully buried the carcass and produced larvae after 14 days were regarded as successful breeding attempts. Cases in which pairs failed to bury a carcass, or they buried it but did not produce larvae, were regarded as failed breeding attempts. Criteria of data exclusion were the same as the common garden experiments. Three instances (of 178 replicates) when beetles died during the experiment were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The influence of cooperation on thermal performance in the field</title><p>To investigate how cooperative behavior influences TPCs, we manipulated the group size of beetles in the field at 38 sites along the elevational gradient. Our experimental device comprised a small plastic container (21 × 13 × 13 cm with 10 cm of soil) placed inside a large container (41 × 31 × 21.5 cm with 11 cm of soil). There were several holes on the small container’s side wall that allowed beetles to move freely between the two containers. A 2 × 2 cm iron mesh was placed around the top of the large container’s wall to let flies access the carcass but to keep out larger animals that might scavenge the carcass. Small, non-cooperative groups contained one male and one female, whereas large, cooperative groups contained three males and three females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). We captured the local beetles using the same hanging pitfall traps described above, and then conducted two group size treatments at each site. Based on our previous work exploring the natural pattern of arrival times, we released the marked beetles into the experimental device 1, 2 and 3 days after the trials began at elevations of 1700–2000 m (low), 2000–2400 m (intermediate) and 2400–2800 m (high), respectively (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Each experiment was recorded by a digital video recorder (DVR) to determine whether <italic>N. nepalensis</italic> successfully buried the carcass.

The outcome of breeding success (1 = success, 0 = failure) was fitted as a binomial response term to test for differences in the probability of breeding successfully. The variables of interest (i.e. mean daily temperature, type of experimental treatment) were fitted as fixed factors. Other environmental factors (elevation, daily minimum air temperature) were fitted to test the generality of the results. However, since elevation, daily minimum air temperature, and mean air temperature were highly correlated, we only included mean daily temperature in the final model. We also modeled the potential nonlinear effects of the environmental factors by fitting a quadratic regression model and compared the model fit with the linear model. Thus, the thermal performance curves (TPC) were determined statistically by the GLMM. To account for repeated sampling in the same plot, we set the field plot ID as a random factor (coded as 1|plot ID) in the R package lme4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2014</xref>).

Our theoretical model suggests that if thermal specialist species compete with thermal generalist species adapted to higher or lower temperatures, the optimal performance temperature of specialists will decrease or increase, respectively. Our empirical results examining competition between burying beetles (thermal specialists) and blowflies (thermal generalists) for access to carcasses support this theoretical prediction, finding that blowflies force the beetle’s optimal breeding temperature lower and the realized TPC narrower. Intriguingly, our experiment also showed that intraspecific cooperation in this facultatively social species not only enables beetles to overcome interspecific competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2019</xref>), but to better match their fundamental and realized TPCs (from 14.1°C to 15.6°C).

However, our study further suggests that a more mechanistic understanding of how interspecific competitors affect the optimal temperature performance of species will be critical for understanding how climate change affects species’ vulnerability. Since it is generally assumed in studies of macroecology and climate change that thermal performance is largely influenced by physiology, a single function is often used to describe a species’ thermal performance curve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sinclair et al., 2016</xref>). However, if biotic interactions are key to indirectly influencing the thermal performance of a species, as we have shown here, the realized TPC of a species is likely to change in time and space and should not be described by a single function to represent the thermal performance of a species.</p><p>Integrating the idea of TPCs into the ecological niche concept helps bridge two rich, but largely independent, traditions of studying thermal adaptation. By simply recognizing the concept of realized TPCs, it becomes clear that we know little about how realized and fundamental TPCs differ in most species. We show that the realized TPC provides a way to quantify how temperature mediates species interactions, which also influence organismal fitness. Thus, the realized TPC extends the realized thermal niche concept, which only considers the temperature ranges in which a species can occupy or breed successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rehfeldt et al., 2008</xref>) by considering how abiotic factors (i.e. climate) additionally indirectly affect fitness by driving biotic interactions like species competition. For example, a greater population size can facilitate intraspecific cooperation because there are more individuals to form groups quickly to outcompete interspecific competitors, as we found in burying beetles at lower elevations. We predict that Allee effects—when higher population density has a positive effect on individual fitness and population growth rate until it reaches the maximum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allee, 1931</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courchamp et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stephens and Sutherland, 1999</xref>)—will likely occur in <italic>N. nepalensis</italic> in warmer environments. Therefore, conserving high population densities, especially at lower elevations, will be crucial for <italic>N. nepalensis</italic> to compete against blowflies under increased climate warming. By examining the relationship between cooperative behavior and interspecific competition, our study thus helps understand the pressing issue of how habitat destruction affects the vulnerability of social organisms to climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Travis, 2003</xref>). When population density influences the likelihood of intraspecific cooperation in social species, habitat destruction will not only decrease habitat availability but also weaken a species’ competitive ability against interspecific competitors, which in turn will lower the realized thermal performance of social organisms.</p><p>Our study has implications beyond interspecific competition in insects. Many classic studies of TPCs investigate how changes in body temperature influence physiological or behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang and Ji, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huey et al., 2012</xref>). Body temperature is often assumed to be the same as the environmental temperature in ectotherms. However, accumulating evidence suggests that many ectotherms can at least partially regulate their own body temperature behaviorally or physiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heinrich, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tattersall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clarke, 2017</xref>). Thus, to identify fundamental TPCs, it is crucial to perform both lab and field experiments in order to understand the exact relationship between body and ambient temperature, as well as how realistic environmental conditions (e.g. temperature variation, humidity, or precipitation) influence the fundamental TPC. For example, TPCs are often considered to be left-skewed for physiological reasons (e.g. the response of thermoregulation proceeds faster at higher temperatures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Woodin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huey and Pianka, 2018</xref>), but our results and those of many other studies have shown that TPCs can be diverse in their shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monaco et al., 2017</xref>). Although we show that variation in the shape of TPCs can be due to interspecific competition, other types of biotic interactions, including mutualistic and host-parasites interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cohen et al., 2017</xref>), should also be carefully considered and compared when quantifying fundamental TPCs. Ultimately, separating and experimentally quantifying fundamental and realized thermal performance in the field and lab will be critical for understanding how both biotic and abiotic factors interact to influence organismal fitness, particularly in an era of rapid climate change.</p><p>The concept of the TPC has received renewed interest because the earth has been warming rapidly for the past few decades. Yet, apparent gaps exist between studies of physiological function and those examining fitness consequences in changing environments. Our study shows that employing the concepts of fundamental and realized TPCs can help us predict the ecological impacts of climate change, especially because environmental change will likely reshuffle ecological communities and alter the strength of species interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2016</xref>). The importance of biotic interactions in shaping species distributions and community composition is intuitively obvious, yet historically has been difficult to quantify. We believe that the concept of realized TPCs can help fill this important knowledge gap and, ultimately, deepen our understanding of the ecological impact of climate change.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is funded by Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan (103–2621-B-001–003 -MY3 and 101–2313-B-001–008 -MY3 to S-F S) and Academia Sinica (AS-SS-106–05 and AS-IA-106-L01 to S-FS).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Samuel L Díaz-Muñoz as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Per Smiseth (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes impressive work that addresses an interesting and important question: how does interspecific competition, and its interaction with intraspecific cooperation, influence the thermal performance curve of burying beetles? The authors answer this question using a combination of lab and field experiments, together with theory, to show that temperature-dependent breeding performance in burying beetles varies with the density of competing blowflies and the number of cooperative beetles. This paper combines two currents in the field: (1) the use of physiology to understand niches and how species distributions may track climate change; and (2) an examination of how inter- and intra-species interactions may change realized niches. The work is novel and likely to provide important new insights into the role that biotic interactions play in shaping the thermal niche of a population, and thereby how populations will respond to climate change. In sum, this manuscript has the potential to become a landmark paper in the field, because it integrates important research currents with formal theory and empirical data.</p><p>In preparing your response and manuscript modifications, please pay special attention to the Essential revisions section below. There are a number of them, but the majority pertain to added detail in the manuscript, and should not require new data. There was concern that the manuscript is short on detail on some key aspects of the methodology, with potential implications for the interpretation of the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should indicate more clearly the model they used and the parameters they estimated to obtain TPCs from their data (e.g., Figure 3B). They state that they used a GLMM to model a binomial response to temperature, but the nice humped shape of the curve for the probability of success requires a more complex statistical model than is suggested in the data analysis section. If they are fitting the theoretical model described in Equation 1, then they should give the parameter estimates for Topt, Tmax and σ. If they are fitting Equation 3, they should provide parameter estimates for that equation. And, if they are estimating the parameter Topt statistically, then it is unclear why they would need to derive Topt by taking the derivative of the curve generated with the estimated Topt.</p><p>2) Why does the text referring to the TPC in Figure 3A provide Chi-square and p-values? What is the null hypothesis here? Is it that breeding performance does not vary with temperature? If so, that should be stated clearly.</p><p>3) The authors mention that they included environmental covariates, elevation and daily minimum temperature, but did not indicate whether these had any influence on breeding success. Also, was there any attempt to account for year in the analysis?</p><p>4) The fact that the field group size experiments match the realized TPC in the field and the fundamental TPC in the lab exactly is curious, given how variable experiments (especially those in the field) can be. Perhaps the use of more significant figures and listing the uncertainty around these estimates would allay any concerns from readers.</p><p>5) Related to the above point: The code underlying the analyses should be included so readers can evaluate how the results were arrived at, also addressing concerns above regarding the model. (If it is not already planned to be included in the Dryad Repository, especially given the nice data break down by figure).</p><p>6) How is competition between blowflies and beetles modeled in the theoretical section? There must be some equation used to represent how access to a carcass varies with temperature due to the activity of blowflies, but we couldn't see the equation or any reference to it.</p><p>7) Materials and methods: How many traps were placed within the altitudinal range, and how far apart were they?</p><p>8) Origins of the lab strains of beetles used in the laboratory experiments: Please provide more details on how many lab strains were used in the experiments and the extent to which these lab strains originated from separate populations with distinct thermal conditions. Currently, the manuscript simply states that each lab strain derived from 2 males and 2 females caught in the field.</p><p>9) Breeding performance in the common garden experiment: Please explain why males and females from different populations were paired up in this experiment, and whether this approach had any implications for the interpretation of the results. If lab strains originated from separate populations with distinct thermal conditions, and there is local adaptation to these thermal conditions, could this approach alter the offspring's TPC compared to that of natural populations? If so, could this have implications for the interpretation of your results, such as for comparisons of breeding performance under laboratory and natural conditions?</p><p>10) Thermal regulation of locomotor performance: This experiment was conducted by beetles from different lab strains. Given that each lab strain derived from 2 males and 2 females caught in the field, there is likely to be some inbreeding in each lab strain. Could this have implications for the interpretation of these results, such as for comparisons of TPC for locomotory and breeding performance?</p><p>11) Breeding performance in the field: Our understanding is that different treatments were replicated (at least to some degree) in different years. The treatment 'with interspecific competition' was replicated in 2014 and 2015, whilst the treatment 'without interspecific competition' in 2014 and 2019? What implications, if any, could this have for the interpretation of your results?</p><p>12) The Introduction (like the Abstract) doesn't emphasize, or rather weave together, the two important currents of niche research (TPC and cooperation, as mentioned above in the summary) that are addressed explicitly and simultaneously in this paper. As in the Abstract, it may be helpful to highlight cooperation (or competition/cooperation balance) earlier in the paper. Something akin to the gem of a paragraph that starts with &quot;Integrating the idea of TPCs into the ecological niche concept helps bridge two rich, but largely independent, traditions of studying thermal adaptation.&quot; in the Discussion. A similarly strong argument earlier in the Introduction can help tie together the TPC/behavior currents.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57022.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should indicate more clearly the model they used and the parameters they estimated to obtain TPCs from their data (e.g., Figure 3B).

We compared the model fits of linear and quadratic GLMMs. Since the quadratic models fit better than the linear ones, we used the quadratic model to represent the TPC of burying beetles.

We did not account for year effects previously, but to address this concern we have now added year as the random effect in the analysis, which makes the results even more clear (e.g. the optimal temperature of TPC with blowfly access becomes even lower (from 14.1 to 13.1℃, Figure 4A) compared with the ones without blowfly access (from 14.7 to 14.6℃, Figure 4B). We have modified the Materials and methods as follows:</p><p>“Other environmental factors (elevation, daily minimum air temperature) were fitted to test the generality of the results.

Thus, rather than explicitly describing the detailed natural histories in the model, we instead described a scenario of “A low-temperature thermal specialist species resembles the burying beetle’s breeding thermal performance (Tsai, 2020), whereas a high temperature generalist species that has a similar life history to the blowfly (Figure 1A).” We also model the case of a high-temperature specialist competing with a low-temperature generalist in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Materials and methods: How many traps were placed within the altitudinal range, and how far apart were they?</p><p>8) Origins of the lab strains of beetles used in the laboratory experiments: Please provide more details on how many lab strains were used in the experiments and the extent to which these lab strains originated from separate populations with distinct thermal conditions.

We have two types of lab populations. In the primary type of lab population, we began trying to establish it in 2011 and it has become stable since 2014. The behavioral and physiological experiments of our lab are mainly conducted with this population, as we have described in Liu et al., 2020, and Chen et al., 2020. This is also the population we used for the lab experiments described in this paper.</p><p>This population is from mid-elevation on Mt. Hehuan. We have modified our description to as follows:</p><p>“Lab experiments were conducted using <italic>N. nepalensis</italic> individuals from the laboratory-reared population. […] Since establishment, we have supplemented the lab strain with new individuals from the same location every one or two years to avoid inbreeding.”</p><p>Our other type of lab population consists of five strains captured from five different locations in 2017 and 2018. This population was used specifically to test local adaptation as described in Tsai et al., 2020, but it was not used in this study. Our previous Materials and methods mistakenly described this lab population rather than our primary lab population, and we apologize for the confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Breeding performance in the field: Our understanding is that different treatments were replicated (at least to some degree) in different years.

We have added the argument in the Introduction as follows:</p><p>“Furthermore, although a few studies have shown that intraspecific cooperation can also help social species expand their realized niche width (Sun et al., 2014; Lin et al., 2019), little is known about how intraspecific cooperation influences the realized TPCs of social organisms.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
