reducing motion blur, and supporting visual self-motion estimation. In Diptera, such head movements are mediated via visual feedback from their compound eyes that detect retinal slip, as well as rapid mechanosensory feedback from their halteres – the modified hindwings that sense the angular rates of body rotations. Because non-Dipteran insects lack halteres, it is not known if mechanosensory feedback about body rotations plays any role in their head stabilization response. Diverse non-Dipteran insects are known to rely on visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback for flight control. In hawkmoths, for instance, reduction of antennal mechanosensory feedback severely compromises their ability to control flight. Similarly, when the head movements of freely flying moths are restricted, their flight ability is also severely impaired. The role of compensatory head movements as well as multimodal feedback in insect flight raises an interesting question: in insects that lack halteres, what sensory cues are required for head stabilization? Here, we show that in the nocturnal hawkmoth <italic>Daphnis nerii,</italic> compensatory head movements are mediated by combined visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback. We subjected tethered moths to open-loop body roll rotations under different lighting conditions, and measured their ability to maintain head angle in the presence or absence of antennal mechanosensory feedback. Our study suggests that head stabilization in moths is mediated primarily by visual feedback during roll movements at lower frequencies, whereas antennal mechanosensory feedback is required when roll occurs at higher frequency. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that control of head angle results from a multimodal feedback loop that integrates both visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback, albeit at different latencies. At adequate light levels, visual feedback is sufficient for head stabilization primarily at low frequencies of body roll. However, under dark conditions, antennal mechanosensory feedback is essential for the control of head movements at high frequencies of body roll.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Daphnis nerii</italic></kwd><kwd>gaze stabilization</kwd><kwd>optic flow</kwd><kwd>head stabilization</kwd><kwd>Johnston's organs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000181</institution-id><institution>Air Force Office of Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA2386-11-1-4057</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sane</surname><given-names>Sanjay P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000181</institution-id><institution>Air Force Office of Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA9550-16-1-0155</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sane</surname><given-names>Sanjay P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001502</institution-id><institution>Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12-R&amp;D-TFR-5.04-0800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sane</surname><given-names>Sanjay P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005879</institution-id><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12-R&amp;D-TFR-5.04-0900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sane</surname><given-names>Sanjay P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Compensatory head movements in hawkmoths are influenced by the combined feedback from vision and antennal mechanosensory Johnston’s organs, similar to the combined role of vision and halteres in Diptera.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For the control of locomotor behaviors such as flight or walking, the ability to stabilize gaze is of central importance for reducing motion blur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Land, 1999</xref>). In diverse animals, gaze stabilization is achieved through sensorimotor circuits that rapidly sense and correct any deviation from the intended course, typically by eliciting reflexive motor responses of their head and body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardcastle and Krapp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Land, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Waespe and Henn, 1987</xref>). Of these, a class of responses called <italic>optomotor reflexes</italic> refer to those behaviors that occur in response to optic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borst, 2014</xref>). Although gaze stabilization typically requires eye as well as neck movements, in most flying animals including insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardcastle and Krapp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kemppainen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Land, 1999</xref>), birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardcastle and Krapp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Necker, 2007</xref>), and bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eitan et al., 2019</xref>), eye movements relative to the head are either reduced or absent. Such animals stabilize their gaze primarily using head and body movements guided by optomotor reflexes.</p><p>In insects, optomotor reflexes have mostly been studied in tethered flies (Diptera) using assays in which their heads were fixed to the thorax with glue while they were presented with a moving display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Borst, 2014</xref>). In such preparations, the entire image stabilization is achieved through compensatory wing movements which may be tracked by infrared sensors or through high-speed videography (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duistermars et al., 2007</xref>). The stroke amplitude difference between the wings can then be used to close the loop between display image and wing movement, allowing the fly to control the projection of the visual environment onto their eyes. This approach has been very successful in helping to uncover diverse visual capabilities of insects. However, because the head was glued to the thorax in these preparations, the role of head movements in image stabilization typically fell out of the purview of such studies. Recent work on the fruit flies <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> suggests that head-fixation adversely affects mechanical power output for flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cellini and Mongeau, 2020</xref>). Moreover, head-fixation in tethered <italic>Drosophila</italic> impairs their ability to fixate on specific objects moving relative to ground; if an object is moving relative to a moving ground, wing movements depend on both object and ground motion, but head movements depend only on ground motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fox and Frye, 2014</xref>). Head-fixation has also been shown to affect steering maneuvers in locusts <italic>Locusta migratoria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Robert and Rowell, 1992</xref>). Head and wing movements are thus crucial in steering maneuvers during flight and contribute strongly to gaze stabilization.</p><p>In Diptera, head stabilization is mediated by feedback from multiple sensory systems. These include visual feedback from their compound eyes and the mechanosensory feedback and/or feedforward control from their halteres which are modified hindwings that detect aerial rotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hengstenberg, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hengstenberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwyn et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, mechanosensory proprioceptive structures in the ventral neck-prothorax region called prosternal organs also aid in head positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paulk and Gilbert, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Preuss and Hengstenberg, 1992</xref>). The relative contributions of these sensory systems depend on the angular speed of the maneuver because vision typically provides feedback at slower rates than mechanosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hengstenberg, 1993</xref>). Importantly, during aerial maneuvers, haltere feedback combines non-linearly with visual feedback in some neck motor neurons to determine the compensatory head movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huston and Krapp, 2009</xref>). Thus, this system offers an interesting case study for how multisensory feedback from visual and mechanosensory modalities is integrated during locomotion. Because mechanosensory feedback from halteres is transduced at faster rates than visual feedback, it is hypothesized to play a key role in guiding wing movements during rapid maneuvers, whereas visual feedback mediates slower turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sherman and Dickinson, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Fewer studies have focused on head stabilization in freely flying insects as compared to tethered insects. Free-flight studies in diverse insects (honeybees <italic>Apis mellifera;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boeddeker and Hemmi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wehner and Flatt, 1977</xref>, blowflies <italic>Calliphora vicina;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hateren and Schilstra, 1999</xref>) show that rapid head turns precede sharp saccadic turns, whereas gaze stabilization between saccades ensures that the visual field largely translates over the retina, thereby enabling depth perception. When flying through a patterned, oscillating drum surrounding their nest entrance, freely flying bees adjust their head angle based on wide-field image movement in their visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boeddeker and Hemmi, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wehner and Flatt, 1977</xref>). Moreover, visually induced head roll response is limited beyond specific roll frequencies, suggesting constraints to visually mediated gaze stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Boeddeker and Hemmi, 2010</xref>).</p><p>These studies demonstrate that optic flow plays a key role in head stabilization behavior in both tethered and freely flying insects. However, the role of mechanosensory feedback in gaze stabilization has been largely ignored in insects that lack halteres. Is head roll in these insects primarily visually driven or does it also require mechanosensory feedback from some haltere analogue? Head stabilization in wasps appears to be primarily visually mediated, although some degree of feedforward control has been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Viollet and Zeil, 2013</xref>). Similarly, in day-flying insects such as dragonflies, head stabilization appears to be dominated by visual feedback, and these insects contain adaptations that ensure passive inertial head stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gorb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardcastle and Krapp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mittelstaedt, 1950</xref>). Yet, being predatory insects, they achieve precise visual fixation of targets during prey capture in flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin and Leonardo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olberg et al., 2007</xref>). The role of mechanosensory feedback in head movements in dragonflies remains an open question, especially as their antennae are very small and they do not possess halteres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gewecke et al., 1974</xref>). In contrast, nocturnal ants can stabilize their heads in darkness during walking, suggesting mechanosensory input for stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Raderschall et al., 2016</xref>). However, the mechanosensors mediating head stabilization in non-Dipteran insects are yet to be identified.</p><p>One potential candidate for the mechanosensory mediation of head stabilization is the Johnston’s organ, which is a highly sensitive mechanosensory structure situated in the antennal pedicel-flagellar joint of all insects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gewecke, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sant and Sane, 2018</xref>). In hawkmoths, the Johnston’s organ consists of hundreds of concentrically arranged scolopidial units that are range-fractionated, which means that the scolopidial units are tuned to different frequency ranges with high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dieudonné et al., 2014</xref>). Antennal mechanosensors contribute in sensing airflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roy Khurana and Sane, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Natesan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Taylor and Krapp, 2007</xref>), and maintaining headwind orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>). In moths, flight becomes unstable when the mechanosensory load on the Johnston’s organ is reduced by clipping off their flagella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahake et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sane et al., 2007</xref>). In walking crickets, there is evidence that antennae contribute to compensatory head roll (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horn and Bischof, 1983</xref>) and electrophysiological recordings from the neck motor system in flies further revealed that the ventral cervical nerve motor neuron in flies receive input from the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To determine the relative contributions of visual and mechanosensory inputs in gaze stabilization during flight, we studied head movements in the nocturnal hawkmoth, <italic>Daphnis nerii</italic>. In our experiments, moths were tethered to rotatable motor shafts, and we measured the compensatory counter-rotation of their head at two different angular rotations of their body under variable light conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>; see Materials and methods). Additionally, we assessed their ability to use antennal mechanosensory feedback by ablating and reattaching their antennal flagellum. Our data show that at lower turning rates of the body, visual feedback is essential for head stabilization. However, at higher angular velocities, feedback from the Johnston’s organs plays a crucial role in the control of head rotations, consistent with the hypothesis that this feedback combines with vision to modulate compensatory head movements. We also show that head movements are essential for controlled flight. Thus, the observed reduction in flight performance due to the loss of mechanosensory feedback from the antenna may be related to impaired gaze stabilization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Methods and representation of experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the experimental setup illustrating the relative positions of the stepper motor, tethered moth, and camera.

Note that all three parameters must be considered to fully interpret a compensatory head response. When the gain is zero, the system offers no response and hence the phase values at this gain are uninterpretable. For non-zero gain, the phase values indicate how closely the response matches the stimulus in phase. However, in many cases, heavily delayed responses may appear as leading the stimulus in phase. Also, because gain and phase are inherently linked, they cannot be interpreted or statistically compared separately. The compensation error is a metric that enables us to statistically analyze these results.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Visual cues affect head stabilization at low frequency</title><p>To assess the role of visual cues in mediating compensatory head rotations, we provided rotating stimuli to tethered moths at different light levels (Twilight condition: ~250 lux; dark condition: &lt;0.01 lux; see Materials and methods).

Thus, at 6 Hz, severe reduction of visual feedback did not greatly hamper head stabilization, suggesting that at roll rotation of higher frequency, an additional – perhaps mechanosensory – feedback played a role in head stabilization.

The response (open and filled circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) of <italic>flagella-intact</italic> moths at 2 Hz in the dark could, therefore, potentially result from antennal mechanosensory input, in turn influencing compensatory head movements at the low frequency in the dark.</p><p>At 6 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the compensation error was significantly different between the <italic>control</italic> (twilight: 0.7±0.02, dark: 0.7±0.05) and <italic>flagella-clipped</italic> (twilight: 0.8±0.03, dark: 1.0±0.03) groups in both twilight (p=0.0064) and dark conditions (p=0.0011) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>, 5, 6). Under twilight conditions, we observed a shift in phase in the <italic>flagella-clipped</italic> moths compared to the <italic>flagella-intact</italic> group from a circular median of 173.7° to 127.8° although the gains were similar (open circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> – Cases 1 and 3). Comparable to the responses observed at 2 Hz, the gain (median: 0.1, filled circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) were lowest in <italic>flagella-clipped</italic> moths under dark conditions. These observations suggest that at 6 Hz, antennal mechanosensory input may be critical for head stabilization. Despite reduced antennal mechanosensory feedback, there are some indications of head stabilization under twilight conditions (compare open circles to filled circles, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This again suggests that visual feedback plays a role at this frequency. However, the compensation error of <italic>flagella-clipped</italic> moths under twilight condition at 6 Hz is significantly greater in comparison to 2 Hz (p=0.0156, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) because there is a shift in phase from a circular median of 174° to 127.8°. However, the gain values are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>, open circle: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>). Thus, the response due to visual feedback is reduced during faster body rolls.</p><p>Does restoring the mechanical load of flagella rescue head stabilization in the flagella-clipped moths? To determine this, we repeated the experiment in moths with reattached flagella. After reattachment of flagella, the head stabilization was similar to the performance of the moths with intact antennae, for all conditions. For both 2 and 6 Hz rotations, the compensation error in <italic>flagella-reattached</italic> moths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I-L</xref>) was not significantly different from the <italic>flagella-intact</italic> group under twilight and dark conditions (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>, 3–6 for statistical comparisons). Similar to the response of the <italic>flagella-intact</italic> group at 2 Hz, we observed a phase-shift between the twilight and dark conditions in the <italic>flagella-reattached</italic> moths from a circular median of 177° to 297.6° at 2 Hz and from 149.4° to 216° at 6 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> – Cases 5 and 6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>). For 6 Hz rotations in the dark condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), the compensation error of the <italic>flagella-reattached</italic> moths differed significantly from the <italic>flagella-clipped</italic> group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>. 6). The coherence estimates were also highly variable in <italic>flagella-clipped</italic> moths under the dark conditions in comparison to the corresponding <italic>flagella-intact</italic> and <italic>flagella-reattached</italic> groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Together, these experiments suggest that antennal mechanosensory input is required for head stabilization in hawkmoths primarily at higher frequency, besides some contribution at lower frequency as well (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Our results also indicate some contribution of visual feedback at higher frequency rotation.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" id="video2" xlink:href="elife-78410-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Role of antennal feedback in head stabilization.</title><p>Representative videos of <italic>flagella-intact and flagella-clipped</italic> moths under dark conditions at 6 Hz.</p></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The role of Johnston’s organs in head stabilization</title><p>Johnston’s organs respond to extremely subtle deformations and vibrations of the flagellum relative to pedicel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin and Leonardo, 2017</xref>).

We therefore tested the hypothesis that this effect in moths with removed flagellar load was specifically due to the reduction of mechanosensory feedback from the Johnston’s organs.

However, at lower light levels, the visual system transduces at slower rates thereby imposing severe constraints on insects, especially during aerial maneuvers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Warrant and Dacke, 2011</xref>). Previous studies on freely flying hawkmoths have documented the role of visual feedback in flower tracking by quantifying their responses at different light intensities (diurnal hawkmoths, <italic>Macroglossum stellatarum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahake et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stöckl et al., 2017</xref>), crepuscular/nocturnal hawkmoths, <italic>M. sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sponberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stöckl et al., 2017</xref>), and <italic>Deilephila elpenor</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stöckl et al., 2017</xref>). Electrophysiological studies from the wide-field motion-sensitive neurons of nocturnal hawkmoths suggest spatial and temporal tuning of their neurons to their ecological niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Theobald et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these studies show that despite the handicap of slow visual transduction rates, hawkmoths can fly or perform aerial maneuvers under low light levels.</p><p>We conducted this study on the Oleander hawkmoth <italic>D. nerii</italic> primarily because it typically flies in low light and we used similar light levels as used in the flower tracking studies of crepuscular and nocturnal hawkmoths <italic>Manduca</italic> and <italic>Dielephila</italic> (300 and 0.3 lux) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sponberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stöckl et al., 2017</xref>). Our data show that gaze stabilization in <italic>D. nerii</italic> requires visual feedback at low temporal frequency, and antennal mechanosensory feedback at higher temporal frequencies at which purely visual means of gaze stabilization may be constrained due to the requirement for both spatial and temporal pooling of photons to form images or derive motion information. Specifically, we hypothesize that gaze stabilization is enhanced by a fast response via the antennal mechanosensory feedback loop which ensures that the head remains sufficiently stable to enable temporal and spatial integration of photons by the superposition eyes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of antennal mechanosensory feedback in control of head stabilization and flight</title><p>We used two treatments to reduce the antennal mechanosensory feedback from the Johnston’s organs. In one case, we clipped off flagella to cause mechanical unloading of Johnston’s organ and in the second case, we glued the pedicel-flagellar joint. In both cases, we observed similar impairment of head stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). Moreover, regluing the flagella and thus restoring Johnston’s organ feedback caused recovery of head stabilization. These results suggest that Johnston’s organ is the key antennal mechanosensory organ involved in head stabilization. In these experiments, <italic>flagella-clipped</italic> moths were more strongly affected than the <italic>JO-glued</italic> moths, indicating some residual feedback from Johnston’s organ after gluing the pedicel-flagellar joint but not enough to ensure proper head stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Although previous experiments have indicated that antennal mechanosensory feedback is crucial for maintaining stable flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahake et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sane et al., 2007</xref>), the precise link between antennal mechanosensors and flight has remained largely unexplored. Antennae sense airflow in diverse insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gewecke, 1974</xref>), and moths and bees modulate antennal positioning during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roy Khurana and Sane, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Natesan et al., 2019</xref>). Antennae help in maintaining headwind orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuller et al., 2014</xref>), mediating abdominal flexion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hinterwirth and Daniel, 2010</xref>), and flight balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahake et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sane et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we show that Johnston’s organ feedback affects compensatory head roll. Moreover, restriction of head movement causes impediment in flight performance. Thus, flight impairment due to loss or reduction of Johnston’s organ input may result in part from their inability to control compensatory head movements.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Head stabilization in tethered hawkmoths is undercompensated</title><p>In our experiments, the gains for compensatory head movements ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 depending on the frequency of the forced body rotations under twilight condition, which meant that the head was not fully stabilized in its horizontal orientation. We ruled out the hypothesis that such low gain results from the stimulus amplitude exceeding anatomical constraints of the moth’s neck motor system limiting the angular range of head roll rotations, as the gain was less than 1 also for low-amplitude stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Previous studies in diverse insects including flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hengstenberg et al., 1986</xref>), locusts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hensler and Robert, 1990</xref>), and wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Viollet and Zeil, 2013</xref>) show that head stabilization does not fully compensate for the imposed stimulus. Undercompensated head stabilization for low stimulus amplitudes has also been previously observed in blowflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hengstenberg et al., 1986</xref>), suggesting that compensatory head rotations are only one of several components contributing to optomotor reflexes and are not the only mechanism involved in maintaining a level gaze. In free-flight, perhaps, both compensatory head rotations and body rotations would contribute to a level gaze. It remains to be seen if such undercompensation exists in freely flying conditions and has a clear function in flying insects. Alternatively, gaze stabilization in insects may be inherently undercompensated, as insects have been reported to not respond to a stable pattern (detailed discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hengstenberg et al., 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Multisensory control of reflexes</title><p>A key result of these experiments is that, just as flies integrate haltere and visual feedback for head stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hardcastle and Krapp, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hengstenberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwyn et al., 2011</xref>), the head stabilization reflex in moths also requires the integration of visual and antennal mechanosensory inputs. In absence of a detailed frequency analysis, we were unable to determine if the combinatorial effect of visual and antennal mechanosensory is linear or non-linear. A consistent result across these studies is that visual feedback influences head stabilization behavior in a lower frequency regime, whereas mechanosensory feedback – whether from antenna or halteres – influences head stability at a higher frequency regime. In flies, halteres detect fast angular velocities of thorax rotation and elicit head stabilization with a gain of 0.1 around 50°/s, which reaches a maximum of about 0.75 at around 1000°/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hengstenberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sherman and Dickinson, 2003</xref>). Similarly, in moths the antennal mechanosensory feedback affects tracking only at high frequencies (&gt;2 Hz) of flower oscillations, whereas visual feedback is key at lower frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahake et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, the frequency range in which visual and antennal inputs influence head stabilization in the present study is similar to the frequency range reported in studies on freely flying moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahake et al., 2018</xref>). In flies, some neck motor neurons require simultaneous activation of halteres and visual pathways for eliciting spikes, thus setting up a gating mechanism which would enable compensatory head movements in a dynamic range that is in between the maximum sensitivities of the motion vision and haltere system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huston and Krapp, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Theobald et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas head wind and visual stimuli together elicit spikes in the ventral cervical nerve motorneuron (VCNM) of the neck motor system, they do not individually fire action potentials in VCNM in the blowfly, <italic>Calliphora vicinia</italic>. In that study, the removal of the arista of the antenna abolished this VCNM response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haag et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, flies may also possess a similar gating mechanism in the visual and antennal pathways that acts at the level of neck motor neurons. It is likely that similar gating exists in the visual and antennal mechanosensory pathways in non-Dipteran insects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Head wobble</title><p>In all the recordings of head stabilization, we observed small-amplitude head oscillations (or head wobble; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chatterjee et al., 2022</xref>) at approximately 12 Hz, which did not correspond to the wingbeat or any other frequency that we have investigated. These regular oscillations are a predicted outcome of the multisensory negative feedback loop that we have proposed, and depends on the lag in the sensory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chatterjee et al., 2022</xref>), or its translation to motor commands in addition to the mechanical properties of head-neck apparatus. Alternatively, it may result from active head movements that the moth performs to ensure active visual feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cellini and Mongeau, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stamper et al., 2012</xref>). Such head movements may help increase the dynamic range of the visual pattern movement speeds encoded by the insect motion-vision system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Windsor and Taylor, 2017</xref>). A formal model of the head stabilization system requires a full systems characterization of the mechanical properties of the head-neck system, which will be explored in a future study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our experiments demonstrate that head stabilization in hawkmoths requires the combined feedback from the compound eyes and antennal mechanosensors. Under sufficient lighting and during slower turns, hawkmoths are able to stabilize their head using visual feedback. However, under dark conditions or during faster turns, the role of antennal mechanosensory feedback from the Johnston’s organs is also essential. In absence of gaze stabilization, flight control in freely flying hawkmoths is severely impaired. Taken together, these results show that the loss of flight control due to reduction of antennal mechanosensory feedback may result at least partly from an inability to stabilize gaze. Thus, our results point to the importance of visual and mechanosensory integration in head stabilization behavior of insects. In Diptera, this has been shown to involve mechanosensory feedback from halteres in addition to the neck proprioceptive feedback from prosternal organs and other potential contributions from mechanosensory feedback in legs, wings, and abdomen. The data presented here show that for non-Dipteran insects such as hawkmoths, mechanosensory feedback is derived partly from the antennal Johnston’s organs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resource availability</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Lead contact</title><p>Further information and requests for resources and reagents should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Prof. Sanjay P Sane (sane@ncbs.res.in).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Materials availability</title><p>This study did not generate new unique reagents.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>The datasheets and codes are deposited in Mendeley data and available in the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/2trxj9gwsw/draft?a=89356c26-e581-40c6-935d-c1d4a0401074">https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/2trxj9gwsw/draft?a=89356c26-e581-40c6-935d-c1d4a0401074</ext-link>.</p><p>Any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental model and subject details</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Moth breeding</title><p>We used adult ~1-day post-eclosion <italic>D. nerii</italic> bred in a greenhouse for experiments.

The tether was bent into a U-shape to ensure that the longitudinal axis of the moth aligned with the shaft axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To achieve smooth motion, we used a low-noise microstepping driver (Leadshine ND556) with a 125 microstep resolution (i.e. 25,000 steps/revolution) in all our experiments. Using a microcontroller board (PJRC Teensy 3.5, 120 MHz), we generated stimuli of desired frequencies. We used split magnets for tethering the moths, one on the dorsal thorax and the other at the end of the tether rod. In this procedure, neodymium magnets were split using a flat file and the two half-magnets were joined to prevent slipping of the magnets about the yaw axis. The tether was rotated with a sinusoidal stimulus of peak-to-peak amplitude of 60° (±30°) and the moth head was aligned with the shaft of the motor to ensure that the roll stimulus was around the longitudinal axis going through the head, approximately aligned with the pivot point of the neck motor system. We ensured that the moths were actively flapping their wings during the experiments.</p><p>We placed a high-speed camera (V.611, Phantom) frontally and filmed the moths at 1200 frames/s using 200 μs exposure. We painted the region between the two eyes along the midline of the moth head with black acrylic color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, icon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), put small white papers on it and the tether rod for easy digitization. IR LEDs (wavelength: 850 nm, Mouser: 720-SFH4715) were mounted around the lens for additional lighting. All the groups were filmed in the laboratory environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) in two ambient light conditions under which the moths are typically active (<italic>twilight</italic>: ~250 lux; <italic>dark</italic>: &lt;0.01 lux). We used a lux meter (center 337; range: 0.01–40,000 lux) to measure light intensity around the moth. These experiments were carried out in the ambient setting of the laboratory which contained both 3D and depth cues (for details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The surrounding visual features were kept constant across all the experiments. Each experimental treatment was always compared with its corresponding control (i.e. intact or sham treatment under same visual background). Because our conclusions are based only on the difference between the control and experimental scenario regardless of the actual visual cues presented, our results are expected to be robust for any arbitrary visual environment.</p><p>We rotated the tether at two frequencies: 2 Hz (low) and 6 Hz (high) for 8 cycles each, corresponding to mean angular speeds of 240°/s (low) and 720°/s (high), respectively. The maximum stimulus frequency our stepper motor could reliably generate was 6 Hz. Frequencies of 2 Hz and 6 Hz are in alignment with the dynamic range of stimuli provided in previous studies of flower tracking in other hawkmoth species. In the diurnal hawkmoth, <italic>M. stellatarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dahake et al., 2018</xref>), antennal mechanosensory feedback was reported to play a significant role in flower tracking in the frequency range of 2–5 Hz. Further, under similar light levels used in our study, flower tracking was affected between the light levels in another study in the crepuscular hawkmoth, <italic>M. sexta</italic>, approximately in the frequency range of 2–8 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sponberg et al., 2015</xref>). At the beginning and end of each stimulus period, a quarter of the sinusoidal oscillation of the tether movement was replaced with a linear ramp to avoid excessive accelerations and thus, potential shifts of the magnetic tether. The corresponding time periods of the responses were excluded from our analysis. The sequence of the light conditions and the roll frequencies tested were randomized across all moths.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Analysis</title><p>The videos were digitized using a custom C++ program in OpenCV library.

Initially, all the groups were cold-anesthetized by placing them in –20°C for approximately 8–12 min. <italic>Control</italic> moths did not undergo any head restriction treatment, but went through the same anesthesia procedures as the other two groups. In the experimental <italic>head-restricted</italic> group, we partially removed the scales in the dorsal neck-prothorax region using a paintbrush and put tiny drops of molten dental wax at the neck using a heated wire. The wax solidified to make a bridge between prothorax and the posterior head, restraining any relative motion between head and thorax. In the <italic>sham</italic> group, we partially descaled the dorsal neck-prothorax region and put a similar amount of molten wax on another part of the prothorax, thus allowing the head to freely move relative to the thorax. All the moths were allowed to recover for 1 hr after the treatment.</p><p>The hawkmoths were next released inside a transparent acrylic flight chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and their flight performance were observed and filmed both before (as internal control) and after treatment for each of the <italic>control</italic>, <italic>sham,</italic> and <italic>head-restricted</italic> groups. These experiments were conducted in a large greenhouse in the evening around dusk during their naturally active periods. Before the experiments commenced, moths with obvious flight defects were discarded. Moths with no obvious flight defects underwent the three treatment conditions and their flight performance was filmed. Two tripod-mounted monochrome cameras (Pointgrey BFS-U3-13Y3M) were placed orthogonally and synced together to film the behavior simultaneously through transparent walls of the flight chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A low-power bulb (Philips Deco Yellow 15 watts) hung approximately 15 cm above the ceiling of the flight chamber provided nearly uniform, low-intensity illumination inside the arena. The light intensity, as measured by a light meter (center 337; range: 0.01–40,000 lux), was ~1.56 lux at the center of the arena’s base, the area around which the moth was released. The moth was stimulated with air-puff to initiate flight. The behavior was filmed at a resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixels at 30 frames per second with an exposure time of 33 ms.</p><p>In a separate batch of moths, we tested the efficacy of the wax treatment by restricting the insect head movements using the previously described tethered assay for roll stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using this assay, we ascertained that head movements relative to the thorax were completely abolished in moths with waxed neck joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Analysis</title><p>The duration of a flight bout was defined as the time spent between post-warmup take-off and termination of wing flapping upon landing. The take-off time was noted when the legs left the ground, whereas the landing time was noted when the moth finally touched down and ceased flapping its wings. In some cases, the partially airborne moth skidded on the ground or crawled with forelegs touching the side walls even while the wings were flapping at high amplitude (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). These moths were not considered flying as long as their legs touched the ground, and thus time spent in any intermediate skidding and crawling was subtracted from the total duration of a flight bout. Collisions with the side walls were observed and noted. Skidding and crawling were not considered as collisions, except the initial contact with the wall. Collision frequency was calculated as the total number of collisions with any side wall divided by the flight bout duration.</p><p>Although these videos were filmed at 30 fps, each video frame encompassed a large volume of the flight chamber (1 m × 1 m × 0.8 m), and hence the moths occupied a very small fraction of image. Moreover, the low-light conditions meant that some blur was added to the image during rapid movements. This made it difficult for us to determine the precise instant at which the legs were off the ground (to determine flight onset) or when they touched the ground (to determine the flight cessation). Thus, when measuring the time duration of flight, we have rounded off the time to the nearest second resulting in some discretization in the estimation of collision/s (for instance, 5/8 points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> occur at 1 collision/s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Because the groups were unpaired and did not have a Gaussian distribution, we statistically compared flight bout duration and collision frequency between the <italic>control</italic>, <italic>sham,</italic> and <italic>head-restricted</italic> moths using a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by a post hoc Nemenyi test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

In it, the authors use several manipulations to convincingly show that hawkmoths use mechanosensory feedback from their antennae to stabilize their head when their body rotates quickly or when they have little visual input. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that control of head angle in insects that lack halteres results from a multimodal feedback loop that integrates visual and antennal mechanosensory feedback. This advances our understanding of how such stabilizing reflexes work beyond Dipteran flies, where much prior work has focused.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78410.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>Damon A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03v76x132</institution-id><institution>Yale University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Dacke</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/012a77v79</institution-id><institution>Lund University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Sweden</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.15.484547">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.15.484547v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marie Dacke (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that there were four essential revisions the authors should make.</p><p>1) This study focuses on how antennal information is integrated with visual information to stabilize head roll. However, the authors do not provide much information about what the visual environment was for these studies. This should be rectified.</p><p>2) The authors should provide some concrete (quantitative?) predictions made by the feedback controller model and compare those to the data.</p><p>3) The single scalar error metric should be better explained, and more effort should be made to explain why/how it is superior to examining the gain and phase separately (or jointly).

The manipulations, and especially the re-attached antennal segments, were especially convincing. I noted a few places where I thought the paper could be more complete, noted below.</p><p>1) The visual feedback was important to this behavior, but I didn't see any description of what the visual environment was about the moth during these experiments. This seems important to describe. This relates also to line 372 of the discussion, where the authors discuss the &quot;3d distribution of objects&quot;? I didn't follow what this sentence was referring to, and I generally did not follow the discussion on this line through line 378.</p><p>2) Figure 5. I would love to see predictions of this model for the various cases here: visual and antennal feedback, or one eliminated, at 2 Hz and 6 Hz… With the simplest possible parameters and assumptions about linearity, I guess, which give the qualitative responses seen here. It might be nice to compare the gain-phase plots to data under some of these different parameters…</p><p>3) I was a little puzzled by the error metric, \epsilon. If \epsilon (&quot;compensation error&quot;) is a scalar (Cartesian) deviation in the polar gain plot from (1,180d), then I don't really understand why it's constrained to be in the range [0,2]. Couldn't the gain be 4 and the phase be 180 d? This single number also seems to have some strange properties – it makes the most sense when epsilon is small. But in Figure 2C, the phase differences between conditions in 6 Hz case don't show up with this metric – and maybe didn't matter in that case. But one could imagine other cases where one could be led astray. Is there any reason not to just have a gain and a phase and do statistics on each separately for the different conditions? This would provide more information – for example, emphasizing that some manipulations changed phases, but not gains, which is visible in the current data, but not emphasized by statistical tests.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few changes to the text and figures would improve clarity and ease of reading.</p><p>1) The conceptual model shown in Figure 5 is helpful, but it would be nice to actually show some simulations with this model and compare them to the experimental data.</p><p>2) The authors might provide further quantitative descriptions of how flight trajectories change after head stabilization in Figure 6.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) There are a few points regarding the methods that needs to be described more in detail prior to publication. My main concern is about the visual environment of the moth in the experimental set-ups. Were visual structures for head stabilization provide by the general clutter of the set-up or was the environments more controlled? For minor comments, see below.</p><p>2) Could the authors please explain why they did not include the flagella-clipped moths also in the free flight experiments. This would have provided a valuable dataset for comparison with the head-stabilized moths as both groups could, according to the conclusion of this study, be expected to be similarly affected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78410.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that there were four essential revisions the authors should make.</p><p>1) This study focuses on how antennal information is integrated with visual information to stabilize head roll.

Yes, we agree with the reviewers that the wording “3D distribution of objects” is unclear, so we have now elaborated on this description in the methods section. We consciously opted to work in the standard lab environment, instead of using a 2D display screen (e.g. a chequerboard pattern printed on paper, or a video display) because:</p><p>a) Previous studies have highlighted the importance of 3D cues for flight. In our experimental design, we therefore wanted to retain 3D / depth cues in the visual environment presented to the moths. We are mindful that for pure roll motion, depth/parallax cues are minimal. However, in these experiments the head was not glued to the thorax, and hence we could not rule them out.</p><p>b)More importantly: in this paper, we were careful to ensure that each experimental treatment was always compared with its corresponding control. This means that we focused only on the differences between the control and experimental scenarios which ensures that our results and conclusions should be robust for any arbitrary visual environment. Again, for this, the regular laboratory environment was sufficient.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows images of (a) the moth’s visual field during these experiments, (b) of the apparatus to which the moth was tethered and oscillated during the experiments, and (c) a layout of the overall room layout and its dimensions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 5. I would love to see predictions of this model for the various cases here: visual and antennal feedback, or one eliminated, at 2 Hz and 6 Hz… With the simplest possible parameters and assumptions about linearity, I guess, which give the qualitative responses seen here. It might be nice to compare the gain-phase plots to data under some of these different parameters…</p></disp-quote><p>The model in Figure 5 is a conceptual and not yet a formal control model. It was constructed based on the experimental data, but quantitative predictions will only be possible after the model has a proper formal (mathematical) structure. We had earlier on tried to develop a model based on linearity assumptions, but soon realized that we lacked key inputs that were required to simulate the multimodal head stabilization loop. The key missing inputs for a formal model include neck muscle / joint mechanics, estimates of delay and damping coefficients, dynamics of the visual and antennal mechanosensory systems, and the nature of the operators (i.e. linear or non-linear). We also have no information on the neural controller block, which integrates visual and antennal mechanosensory inputs to generate a motor output. Moreover, there are strong indications that such integration could be non-linear (e.g. Huston and Krapp, 2009, Haag et al., 2010), and thus assuming linearity at this stage may not be correct.</p><p>Nevertheless, the conceptual model presented here can make specific testable predictions, as described below:</p><p>Any process that is modelled as a negative feedback loop has inherent oscillatory dynamics that depends on the latencies of the feedback and actuation. If these latencies are well-matched and fast, then the system’s output will undergo small-amplitude oscillations about the set point. However, if we increase the latencies of the feedback by modifying the sensory feedback, then we expect that the system will find it harder to maintain a stable state and the fluctuations will be of larger amplitude, as the system strays more from its set point.</p><p>Because head stabilization is modelled here as a multimodal (antennal mechanosensory and visual) negative feedback loop, we expected that head position should also be in a state of dynamic equilibrium. If its dynamics depends on feedback from both systems, then altering the antennal and visual feedback should also cause alterations in this dynamic equilibrium. From this conceptual model, we predict that this dynamic equilibrium will manifest as small-amplitude oscillations which will change their properties if we manipulate each feedback.</p><p>We observed exactly such small-amplitude oscillations, which we then experimentally tested by manipulating the feedback. These data have been submitted as a separate paper (uploaded to https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.24.489321v1). We have now added a new section in the discussion in which we mention these oscillations as a predicted outcome of the negative feedback loop, with a citation to this BioRxiv paper, which is in review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I was a little puzzled by the error metric, \epsilon. If \epsilon (&quot;compensation error&quot;) is a scalar (Cartesian) deviation in the polar gain plot from (1,180d), then I don't really understand why it's constrained to be in the range [0,2]. Couldn't the gain be 4 and the phase be 180 d? This single number also seems to have some strange properties – it makes the most sense when epsilon is small. But in Figure 2C, the phase differences between conditions in 6 Hz case don't show up with this metric – and maybe didn't matter in that case. But one could imagine other cases where one could be led astray. Is there any reason not to just have a gain and a phase and do statistics on each separately for the different conditions? This would provide more information – for example, emphasizing that some manipulations changed phases, but not gains, which is visible in the current data, but not emphasized by statistical tests.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. In a nutshell: performing statistics separately on gain and phase would be both misleading and incorrect. To illustrate this point, consider the following hypothetical dataset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78410-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>If gain and phase are separate errors, then the mean of the above dataset would be gain = 0.5, phase = 0 (blue “x” in plot) which is incorrect. The actual mean is gain = 0.3898, phase = 0 (green filled circle in plot). This example illustrates why it is misleading to interpret or statistically analyse gain and phase separately.To remedy this, following the method similar to that outlined in Sponberg et al. (2015), Dahake et al. (2018), and Windsor and Taylor (2017), we constructed a tracking error metric (in our case, the compensation error) which combines gain and phase in a manner that readily enables statistical comparisons. However, this metric also does not by itself present a full picture. We need all three quantities: gain, phase, and compensation error, to obtain an unambiguous picture. Hence, in the manuscript, we have provided all three quantities to the readers.</p><p>In general, it is always challenging to find an optimal metric that can describe the nuances of a complex behaviour using a single number. We explain below why the error metric as outlined here is a reasonable way of presenting these results. The above query is broken down into subparts, each answered independently.</p><p>a) why is the compensation error constrained to be in the range [0,2]. Couldn't the gain be 4 and the phase be 180 d?</p><p>In principle, the compensation error can exceed 2 if the gain exceeds 1 (i.e. the head moves much more than the stimulus). Although theoretically possible, this was never observed either in our system, or in any other study of head stabilization in the literature. For this reason, the Y-axis in the compensation error plots range from 0-2. We have clarified this in the methods section. The added portion now reads, “In this representation, the compensation error (ɛ) can range from 0 to 2 (for gain ≤ 1) with an ɛ of 0 representing perfect head stabilization and corresponds to (r = 1, &lt;inline-graphic mimetype=&quot;image&quot; mime-subtype=&quot;png&quot; xlink:href=&quot;media/image1.png&quot; /&gt; = 180<sup>º</sup>) in the polarscatter plots (Figure 1E).”</p><p>To aid the intuition further, we have plotted Figure 2A with colour gradient of compensation error to better relate gain-phase values with compensation error, and added this in the Supplementary section (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2)</p><p>b) But in Figure 2C, the phase differences between conditions in 6 Hz case don't show up with this metric – and maybe didn't matter in that case. But one could imagine other cases where one could be led astray.</p><p>As stated above, the compensation error metric is, by itself, incomplete. To get the full picture, we need to combine it with phase and gain values which were provided in the polarscatter plots and supplementary information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A few changes to the text and figures would improve clarity and ease of reading.</p><p>1) The conceptual model shown in Figure 5 is helpful, but it would be nice to actually show some simulations with this model and compare them to the experimental data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks much for this comment. As explained in our response to the comment #2 for Reviewer#1, the effort to quantitatively model or simulate this system was premature at this stage because we lacked some key mechanical and dynamical inputs, such as the mechanics of neck muscles, values of various latencies, and the nature of various transformation functions, which we do not yet have. However, we certainly plan to provide a more formal treatment of the model in the near future.</p><p>Nevertheless, our experimental data are consistent with the specific predictions from the multimodal negative-feedback model presented here, as explained in our response to Reviewer#1. The small-amplitude head oscillations (head wobble) observed in our system may be arise from to the inherent dynamics of such a feedback loop.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors might provide further quantitative descriptions of how flight trajectories change after head stabilization in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment was not clear. Perhaps, Reviewer #2 meant that we should provide the flight trajectories after “head-restriction&quot; rather than “head-stabilization”. In any event, this experiment (which recapitulates the free flight experiments in Sane et al. 2007) was not set up to measure the flight trajectories, which would require two synchronized and calibrated high-speed cameras which were not used here, especially because we were filming over large time periods. Instead, our focus was on quantifying the gross flight defects in a freely flying moth in the style of Sane et al., 2007.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) There are a few points regarding the methods that needs to be described more in detail prior to publication. My main concern is about the visual environment of the moth in the experimental set-ups. Were visual structures for head stabilization provide by the general clutter of the set-up or was the environments more controlled?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. This was also the question in comment #1 of R#1. To summarize that response: the moths were filmed within the laboratory environment.</p><p>The surrounding visual features were kept constant across all the treatments. Because all our conclusions were based on comparisons with the corresponding controls, we are confident that these results should hold true in any arbitrary visual environment. We have now included additional text in the Methods and supplementary figures to explain the visual structure of the moths</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could the authors please explain why they did not include the flagella-clipped moths also in the free flight experiments. This would have provided a valuable dataset for comparison with the head-stabilized moths as both groups could, according to the conclusion of this study, be expected to be similarly affected.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment suggested by the reviewer (flagella-clipped moths in free-flight experiments) were described by Sane et al., 2007 in the hawkmoth <italic>Manduca sexta</italic>, and are consistent with our observations in <italic>Daphnis nerii</italic>. That paper is cited here. Here too, we assume that the referee meant “head-restricted” rather than “head- stabilized” moths. Head restriction already causes a severe flight defect (as shown here), as does flagella-clipping (as shown in Sane et al. 2007). Thus, combining these two strong effects, may not be particularly informative, as it is difficult to parse which of these manipulations causes the catastrophic failure</p></body></sub-article></article>
