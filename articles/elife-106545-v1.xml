a sex bias in early research, risking the validity of biological knowledge. The first step towards change is effectively challenging misconceptions, allowing researchers to perceive sex inclusive research as doable. Utilising the theory of planned behaviour, we quantified researchers’ intention as a proxy measure for conducting sex inclusive research and explored attitude (value of the behaviour), subjective norm (perceived social pressure), and behavioural control (ability to conduct the behaviour). Additionally, we quantified the knowledge gap, prevalence of misconceptions, and assessed perceived benefits and barriers. We tested a workshop intervention that directly challenges the cultural embedded barriers. The data shows researchers’ intentions were high, but they had weak statistical knowledge and misunderstandings leading to a perception that inclusive research is prohibitive due to cost and animal use. We demonstrate that participation in the training intervention improved knowledge, altered the perceived barriers, and cultural expectations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sex-inclusive research</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd><kwd>research design</kwd><kwd>meta research</kwd><kwd>theory of planned behaviour</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04r9x1a08</institution-id><institution>AstraZeneca (United Kingdom)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Inclusive Research Intervention</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahluwalia</surname><given-names>Amrita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>British Journal of Pharmacology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Inclusive Research Intervention</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahluwalia</surname><given-names>Amrita</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeted education corrects key misconceptions and identifies methods to influence intent to use sex-inclusive designs in in vivo studies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Research culture encompasses the values, ideals, norms, and thus the resultant behaviours of a community. This resulting culture, in turn, has a substantial impact on how research is conducted and communicated. There is a long-established embedded practice of studying only a single (typically male) sex in preclinical research and then generalising the results to a wider population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkley, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Since the 1990s, it has been recognised that this approach is highly limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nunamaker and Turner, 2023</xref>), with an emerging body of published evidence highlighting that sex may profoundly influence biological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karp et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2001</xref>). Consequently, there has been growing awareness that unless sex is factored into experimental design, its influence remains unknown. Importantly, it is now appreciated that single-sex studies result in a knowledge bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mogil, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clayton, 2016</xref>). The need to drive cultural change has been highlighted, with the goal of enabling equitable research at the exploratory stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rich-Edwards and Maney, 2023</xref>) which delivers a translational body of knowledge relevant to the broader population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shansky and Murphy, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Heidari et al., 2016</xref>) provide guidance that ‘Where the subjects of research comprise organisms capable of differentiation by sex, the research should be designed and conducted in a way that can reveal sex-related differences in the results, even if these were not initially expected’. This is a default position of inclusion where the sex can be determined and an analysis assessing for sex-related variability in response. Historically, sex has, of course, been included in studies where sex is a primary variable of interest (confirmatory sex inclusion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karp, 2025</xref>). The additional attention is focusing on sex inclusion in research studies where sex is not the primary variable of interest (exploratory sex inclusion). The goal of inclusion in these studies is to assess the generalisability of the treatment effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karp, 2025</xref>). As the objectives are very different, the underpinning design considerations are distinct. In exploratory sex inclusion, the N is shared between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phillips et al., 2023</xref>). With this research strategy, if the effect is very different between the sexes, the statistical power passes from the main effect to the interaction term indicating that sex is significant at explaining variation in the treatment. This finding can then be used to generate sex-specific hypothesis and depending on the effect size and biology, a decision as to whether this should be explored further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karp, 2025</xref>). Of course, when a research proposal has a hypothesis that is specific to a sex (e.g. it is related to oestrogen levels), it would be appropriate to only study the relevant sex. The recently published Sex Inclusive Research Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karp et al., 2025</xref>) gives support to evaluate research proposals in terms of sex inclusion and allows an exemption for such a scenario classifying such proposals ‘Single sex study justified’.</p><p>Despite numerous funding bodies establishing initiatives to encourage researchers to routinely integrate males and females into basic, preclinical, and clinical research, little progress has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zucker et al., 2022</xref>). As a response to the status quo, numerous funding bodies have recently issued inclusion mandates requiring justification for single-sex studies and analysis that considers sex-related variability in the response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rich-Edwards and Maney, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Medical Research Council, 2022</xref>). Positively, the proportion of published papers including females and males has improved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rechlin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>). A comprehensive study comparing inclusion between 2009 and 2019 across nine biological disciplines found that six out of the nine disciplines saw improved representation, and overall inclusion improved from 26 to 48% of published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>). Whilst these studies demonstrate progress in inclusion, the proportion still represents a minority of studies, and notably, this inclusion was not associated with an increase in the proportion of studies that included data analysed by sex. Additionally, studies identified methodological issues when males and females were included. Examples include: a failure to report the proportion of the sexes in the cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stanford et al., 2023</xref>) and inappropriate data analysis such as disaggregation, pooling, or comparison of <italic>p</italic> values to assess for treatment by sex interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rechlin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney, 2021</xref>). There is a need to not only improve inclusion but also improve the analysis of the subsequent data to ensure the integrity of the conclusions made.</p><p>Notionally, scientists support efforts to improve sex representation in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Medical Research Council Working Group, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Woitowich and Woodruff, 2019</xref>). However, sociological research suggests that many researchers believe inclusion is not ‘doable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gompers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waltz et al., 2021</xref>). The perceived barriers cited encompass ethical, financial, statistical, and practical constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Medical Research Council Working Group, 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phillips et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karp and Reavey, 2019</xref>). An analysis of 30 single-sex justifications identified six themes: concern around a known sex difference or sex effect (30%), fear of increased experimental variability (27%), experimental conditions limiting use of female and male animals (13%), limited sample size (13%), inability to sex subjects (10%), and issues with animal husbandry (7%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>). Many of the barriers have been highlighted as culturally ingrained misconceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karp and Reavey, 2019</xref>). For example, a commonly proffered argument for exclusion is that female animals are inherently more variable, and thus inclusion will lead to the need for a larger sample size (N). This is despite a wealth of studies that reject this thesis of inherent increased variability across a range of biologically relevant endpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prendergast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beery, 2018</xref>). The Sex Inclusive Research Framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karp et al., 2025</xref>) provides support for nuanced thinking on this topic. First, it challenges the generic argument but allows for an individual proposal justification with project-relevant data, along with a cost-benefit analysis to support the use of single-sex studies where necessary. Another common misconception includes the perception that inclusion will require a doubling of the sample size as standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waltz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fields, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Medical Research Council Working Group, 2022a</xref>). Furthermore, many researchers have also questioned the value of studying multiple sexes in preclinical research, suggesting that single sex in vivo studies can be generalisable to the wider population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waltz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The scale of the misconceptions and statistical misunderstandings that result in barriers to inclusion have resulted in a call for training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rich-Edwards and Maney, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karp and Reavey, 2019</xref>). We developed a workshop directed at equipping participants with knowledge of the current best practice for sex inclusion. The workshop included material designed to explicitly address many of the known misconceptions and barriers to sex-inclusive research. To evaluate the efficacy of this intervention, we ran two independent experiments using a survey to collect quantitative and qualitative data regarding self-efficacy (confidence to conduct inclusive research), knowledge, and views of scientists on the issues regarding incorporating males and females into preclinical in vivo research. The first experiment was conducted at an international conference with a parallel group design testing the general population attending the conference, those who expressed interest in the topic before attending a related seminar and those who attended the intervention. The second experiment was conducted at a UK Russell Group university with a pre- and post-intervention design. The survey was based on the theory of planned behaviour, as an established strategy for evaluating and understanding human behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). The theory of planned behaviour is a psychological theory that quantifies behavioural intention as a proximal determinant of behaviour through three core beliefs (attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control: See Appendix 9 for a glossary of these terms). We then assessed the impact of the intervention, with three key objectives: (1) to capture and quantify the scale of misconceptions around sex-inclusive studies within the research community, (2) to assess whether the intervention led to an improvement in knowledge, (3) to explore statistically the impact of the intervention on the intention to conduct sex-inclusive research, alongside identification of other predictors of intention. Taken together, the studies demonstrate that the intervention is effective and gives insight into how the research community can expedite change in research practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demographic results</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Study 1</title><p>Across the three test groups, the demographics and distribution for the potential predictor variables were found to be balanced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We did not expect differences between the baseline and interested group but hypothesised that we would observe a shift in the intervention group following the workshop, with a reduction in those identifying misconceptions as barriers and an increase in the advantage statements selected. However, power is low to see a change in this exploratory proportion data due to the low sample size of eligible attendees at the workshop. Two exceptions occurred in the benefit question. First, for the preset option: ‘efficient use of all animals from breeding,’ we saw a statistically significant increase for the intervention group selecting this as a benefit of inclusive research (34.2% and 37.5% selecting this option in the baseline and interested group, respectively, which then increased to 80% in the intervention group). We also observed a statistically significant increase for the intervention group selecting the translatability option (74% baseline, 68% interested, 100% intervention group).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Exploration of the perceived barriers and benefits of inclusion of males and females in in vivo research from study 1.</title><p>Evaluation of survey data collected in study 1 with 39 participants in the baseline group, 51 in the interested group, and 15 in the intervention group.

A statistical analysis assessed which variables could explain variation in intent to conduct sex-inclusive research (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Two of the three theories of planned behaviour attributes, subjective norm and attitude, significantly positively correlated with intent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). The data indicates that as the participant’s attitude increases (i.e. feel incorporating males and females is important) their intention to incorporate females and males increases, with a high mean attitude of 6.5 ± 0.87. The subjective norm attribute had a similar positive correlation with intent, indicating that when participants perceived higher societal pressure, they had higher intention. Subjective norm differed from attitude in that, at the population level, the score was in the mid-range (4.7 ± 1.4). The intent for those who attended the workshop was significantly higher, with approximately a 20% increase in the intention score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, no significant difference in intent was found between the baseline and interested treatment groups. The only other variable to have some evidence of predictive ability was how often a participant was involved in or could influence the planning of experiments, which positively correlated with intent to incorporate females and males (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Across the two studies, the benefits of sex-inclusive research were selected at a similar rate with a higher proportion of participants valuing the benefits associated with generalisability of the findings (ability to understand sex differences and translation) over robust ethical research. This recognition of the benefit of inclusive research aligns with previous suggestions that scientists are generally supportive of efforts to improve sex representation in biomedical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karp and Reavey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Medical Research Council Working Group, 2022a</xref>). However, the focus on the ability to understand sex differences aligns with a common misconception that the goal of inclusion is to identify sex differences. This misconception causes a dissonance with the recommendation to share the sample size (N) for a treatment effect between the two sexes, as this approach does not power experiments to identify sex differences. Being explicit on the experimental design goals and the impact on the design was raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rich-Edwards and Maney, 2023</xref> who developed a ‘4 Cs’ decision framework to guide researchers in sex-inclusive research by focusing on four steps: Consider, Collect, Characterise, and Communicate. Within this framework, they identify two pathways depending on whether the study is an exploratory study (where males and females are included to improve generalizability) versus confirmatory study (those actively exploring sex-related differences) and guide researchers in the design and analysis implication of this. There is a culture shift needed that the primary goal in exploratory sex inclusion is to deliver generalisable results where large differences in sex-related variation will be identified. It is this understanding of the difference between exploratory versus confirmatory sex-inclusive research that, in our opinion, is deficient.</p><p>Research has found that scientists do not believe that inclusion is ‘doable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gompers, 2018</xref>) due to a range of perceived barriers to inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Medical Research Council, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phillips et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Karp and Reavey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prendergast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), 2023</xref>). This study provides the first quantification of the scale of these perceived barriers, of which many are misconceptions, and finds them endemic. Seldom did the sampled community express the absence of barriers. Cost was the most cited barrier, approaching half of the community raising this as a concern. This was followed by, on average, a third of the community selecting barriers related to misconceptions such as experimental design complexity, sample size concerns, and female variability.</p><p>For some of the barriers, we observed a statistically significant difference between studies (test material availability and male animal aggression), which could represent a difference in the local culture or research interests impacting the perceived barriers. For example: In study 1, male mouse aggression was raised by 30% of the respondents but only 10% in study 2. This finding is at odds with the observation that male animal research predominates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Woitowich et al., 2020</xref>) but could relate to welfare management practices prioritised within that community. Sharing best practices and working on housing and husbandry conditions could minimise the impact of this concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Van Loo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blankenberger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jirkof et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The responses to the knowledge questions also give an opportunity to directly assess whether participants are holding a misconception. By focusing on the baseline and interested group in study 1 or the pre-intervention data in study 2, we get an estimate of the general research population. This finds that misconceptions dominate the research community beliefs. For example, the misconception that inclusion of males and females would double the N (80% of study 1 N=90, 79% of study 2 N=28) held this view. This is probably arising from the perception that sex-inclusive designs increased variability and, therefore, require a larger overall sample size (90% of study 1 N=90, 93% of study 2 N=28). This perception has been acknowledged in previously published articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Medical Research Council, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waltz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gompers, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prendergast et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beery, 2018</xref>), however, this is the first known quantification of the extent of these viewpoints.</p><p>Regarding the data analysis, most researchers (75.6% in study 1 general population N=90, and 72% of the participants in pre-assessment of study 2 N=28) correctly knew that sex should be included in the statistical model. Questions that are more specific about analysis strategies find the proportion of incorrect answers to be very high. For example, most thought the data could be pooled across the sexes (81.1% in study 1 general population, 83% study 2 pre-assessment) and that the data should be disaggregated (80% in study 1 general population, 72% study 2 pre-assessment). The prevalence of incorrect ideas around data analysis aligns with a published meta-analysis that analysis mistakes are common when females and males are included in addition to the intervention of interest in research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney, 2021</xref>). The high proportion of correct answers for the initial question to include sex but then high proportion of agreeing with poor analytical strategies suggests that participants have a sense they need to do something but either don’t know what the right analysis strategy is or are unaware of the problems with the suboptimal analysis strategies.</p><p>It is of note that no one selected data analysis concerns in study 1 and infrequently in study 2 (7% in the pre-test assessment) as a barrier to inclusion which suggests researchers are unaware of this shortcoming. This aligns with research identifying that statistical errors in the analysis of sex-inclusive datasets are common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney, 2021</xref>). The difficulty in recognizing one’s own incompetence is a known cognitive bias, described as the Dunning-Kruger effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kruger and Dunning, 1999</xref>). Research has shown that training not only improves participants skills but also helps the individuals recognize the limitations of their ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kruger and Dunning, 1999</xref>). This highlights the importance of investing in training researchers in experimental design and data analysis and that this is a critical step to enable sex-inclusive research.</p><p>These findings highlight the scale of the misconceptions hindering engagement with sex-inclusive research and the need for research practice leaders to focus on both the imbedded these general misconceptions but also to determine local barriers that need exploration with their research communities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Exploration of intention to inclusive research</title><p>While training is crucially important, it alone is unlikely to completely solve the embedded cultural problem we currently face. Simply knowing that one should exercise to improve your health, does not mean one will get up every morning to go to the gym. Thus, knowing exactly what drivers are needed to influence the required behavioural change are equally as important as making sure people receive training to enact the change. The theory of planned behaviour provides us with key insights on how to influence intention and ultimately behavioural change. This is key as the intention to conduct sex-inclusive research in the future was generally positive (5.51 ± 1.25 in study 1 general population, 5.71 ± 1.08 study 2 pre-assessment out of a total score of 7) and attitude was very high (6.41 ± 0.92 in study 1 general population, 6.66 ± 0.67 study 2 pre-assessment out of a score of 7). This indicates that scientists generally view sex inclusive research as beneficial, useful, and the right thing to do. Despite this, when asked how often in the past 5 years participants had included female and male samples in their experiments, 35% (general population) in study 1 and 55% in study 2 (pre-assessment) indicated almost always or often (51–100% of the time) incorporating male and female samples in their studies. Thus, confirming the above posit that simply knowing sex-inclusive research is important is not enough to influence active incorporation, and since attitude is already high, it leaves little room for further influence on behavioural intent.</p><p>Although attitude was high, subjective norm differed at the population level where the score was more in the mid-range (4.6 ± 1.4 in study 1 general population, 5.14 ± 1.11 study 2 pre-assessment). This factor was also the only one of the three theories of planned behaviour’s beliefs found to significantly influence intent in both studies with large effect sizes. Understanding the strong positive correlation between subjective norm and intent allows for focused interventions to increase societal pressure on the scientific community which should then improve overall intention towards sex-inclusive research.</p><p>While researchers may have the right motivation, performing the behaviour is dependent on other non-motivational factors such as the time, money, or skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). A behaviour can only be conducted if the researcher is the decision maker. Not only does actual control influence behaviour but so does the perception of behavioural control, such as self-efficacy. Self-efficacy encompasses both how well a person can do the behaviour but also how confident they feel about doing it. Self-efficacy opinions can influence choice of activities, preparation, as well as effort. In this case, we believe that the lack of significance in our model is due to the false perception of how to accurately design and analyse factorial designs, evidenced by the low knowledge score. According to Ajzen, perceived behavioural control may not be realistic if a participant has little knowledge about the behaviour in question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). Again, based on the low knowledge scores of how to design and analyse sex-inclusive data may indicate that this measure may not add much accuracy to behavioural prediction. However, it does indicate the overwhelming need to create a training that is accessible and practical to all in vivo scientists.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Impact of the intervention on intention</title><p>We had an opportunity to incorporate a workshop at an international conference and as part of this, we decided to assess how effective that training was. As many have experienced, the practical aspects and decisions that need to be made in an in vivo experiment are rarely covered in traditional statistics courses. This often leaves scientists unsure how to apply what they have learned in the real world. Furthermore, 26–29% of the participants in this study had received no formal statistical training, and yet 71–75% can always or often influence the experimental design, illustrating the need for continuing education and practical instruction for established scientists. In the first study, trained attendees had the highest level of intent to conduct sex-inclusive research in the future, potentially indicating that our workshop was effective. However, it is also plausible that those who signed up inherently had a higher level of intent. Thus, we felt it was important to evaluate attendees’ intent before and after the training. This naturally led to our second study, where we found that intent was not altered by the workshop, because it was already high. Even though intent was not statistically altered (Pre: 5.71 ± 1.08; Post: 6.00 ± 1.03), participants knowledge increased and fewer barriers were selected after the training. This illustrates that education alone may not be enough to change behaviour but utilizing the insight gained that social pressure may be the best avenue to influence actual behavioural change.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Impact of the intervention on perceived benefits and barriers</title><p>The primary goal of the intervention was to challenge misconceptions; however, the workshop material naturally started the learning journey by exploring the drivers for, and barriers preventing, change. When focused on the benefits, we found that following the training intervention, participants tended to select each of the benefits at a higher proportion compared to other groups. There was a statistically significant change in a few of the benefits: a large increase in the selection of efficient use of animals and translatability in study 1 and reproducibility in study 2. The infrequent statistical significance of the change at the individual benefit level is likely to arise from low statistical power due to the high baseline signal and low sample size.</p><p>An exploration of the study 2 data found that the intervention did not generally reduce the selection of barriers but did decrease the selection of the barriers associated with the misconceptions. This demonstrates that the targeted intervention was effective, with a meaningful effect size (a 28% reduction on average), at improving the perception that generalisable sex-inclusive research is feasible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Impact of intervention on knowledge</title><p>It has been highlighted previously that early career researchers lack awareness of best practice recommendations across their areas of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morahan et al., 2024</xref>). To address this, it is important that training initiatives directed at improving knowledge of best practice are put in place by institutions, with the goal of continuously improving practice and supporting cultural change. This means that training must extend beyond that provided simply as part of graduate and post-graduate studies, and that implementing training opportunities is part of continuing professional development of research staff.</p><p>In the baseline and pre-intervention data, performance on the panel of knowledge questions was generally poor, with only the question around whether sex should be included in analysis answered correctly by more than half the participants. This is consistent with previous findings that statistical approaches, even studies designed as sex inclusive, are frequently erroneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia-Sifuentes and Maney, 2021</xref>). Encouragingly, post-intervention participants demonstrated significant improvements in knowledge. For example, far more post-intervention researchers correctly identified that disaggregation and/or pooling of the sexes within a statistical analysis was a mistake, particularly in study 2.</p><p>Given that the majority of commonly cited barriers stem from misconceptions which are arising from knowledge gaps, the evidence that targeted interventions can directly enhance knowledge offers promise for promoting cultural change through educational initiatives. Despite across-the-board improvements in performance, the outcomes still leave room for further improvement. For example, nearly 40% of post-intervention participants still expressed the view that inclusion of female and male samples required a doubling of the sample size. This highlights that a single session is likely insufficient to equip researchers with all relevant knowledge and would thus support a future strategy of continuous improvement through multiple training and learning strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Whilst the data indicate a clear benefit of the workshop intervention, there are several caveats and limitations that should be considered and acknowledged. First and foremost, we did not directly measure the behaviour of interest, and it is possible that participants may have over-exaggerated their current and future use of sex-inclusive designs. The basis of the theory is that people are more likely to perform a behaviour if they plan to do so (intentions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajzen, 1991</xref>) and has been shown to be highly predictive. Therefore, measuring intention can still provide valuable insight into the perspectives of scientists and how their beliefs may impact implementation of sex-inclusive designs. For both studies, university researchers made up the majority of the population. The workshop was hosted by a recognised senior leader (Professor Ahluwalia) both at the World Congress (role: WCP2023 Secretary-General) and within the university setting (role: Dean for research at the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry). It is possible that participant awareness of the views of the senior leader may have influenced the positive outcome of the intervention. For study 1, the congress was specifically focused for pharmacologists, and it is possible that the outcomes reflect only this sector of biomedical research. However, for study 2, the workshop was advertised across a multi-faculty university and likely represented a more specialty-diverse population. Whether the workshop would effect a similar change in understanding from those who work within the pharmaceutical industry requires further evaluation. The impact of the workshop could depend on the skills and experience of the trainers. Furthermore, the results could be specific to a face-to-face training event and whether a virtual course (which has the benefit of scale) would have a similar benefit would need further exploration. This workshop focused on the barriers and misconceptions around the design and analysis. The material did not tackle any of the practical barriers e.g. management of welfare issues with male mice. There will be a need for future work to explore how to support and address these barriers. Finally, the questions posed to workshop attendees did not state whether the queries were being posed for a first exploratory study or not. It is possible that had this been made explicit then the responses could have differed.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>An endemic and persistent sex bias in early research has been raised as a risk to the validity of biological knowledge. Sociological research finds that scientists believe sex matters, but change has been limited. Funders are actively trying to change behaviour by requiring a justification for exclusion. Changing the status quo requires individuals to buy into a new direction that aligns with their values and beliefs. Here, we demonstrate that a workshop intervention can rescue the core beliefs that hinder sex inclusive research. We also provide evidence that institutes, funders, and professional bodies can help this journey by raising awareness of best practice, as this will change the perceived cultural norms.

Participants attending the poster sessions on 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> July were recruited by circulating staff to contribute to the baseline treatment group, thus sampling the general population that attended the conference. Participants for the interested group were recruited by approaching attendees who were in attendance at a related symposium advertised in the conference proceedings on the 4 July 2023 (entitled: ‘The importance of interrogating sex differences in cardiovascular physiology and disease’). Participants for the intervention group were recruited by advertising a free educational workshop in the conference proceedings entitled ‘Best practice for sex inclusive research’ conducted on the 5 July 2023 and data were collected post-intervention. Workshop participants were given the option to participate in the survey at the end of the workshop. To compensate participants in any of the treatment groups for their time, they received an entry into a drawing for one of ten £50 Amazon e-gift cards. Participants were included if they conducted research on a disease or biological phenomenon that affects males and females and were able to influence the plan or conduct of in vivo research. At the point of data collection, the organisers were not masked (blinded) as we knew the hypothesis and the intervention group in the study.

When possible, validated instruments were used (i.e. questions based on the TBP). When validated instrumentation did not exist, new items were created, reviewed by statistical experts, piloted, and revised as necessary. Two cycles of pilots were conducted with in vivo pharmacology researchers (N=9) from both academic and pharmaceutical settings. Survey 1 consisted of 39 questions and survey 2 had a maximum of 34 questions in a testing phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Demographic questions were omitted from the post-question format in Study 2 and data from the same individual were aligned between the pre- and post-questions through the 3+ initials inputted by the researcher (pre-survey: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref> and post-survey: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p><p>The initial four questions obtained consent and assessed whether participants met the inclusion criteria. If the participant did not grant consent or failed to meet the inclusion criteria on any question, the survey was terminated. Thereafter, all questions were presented to each participant. Participants were asked demographic questions which included age, gender, geographic region (study 1 only), and highest level of education. Several questions captured information about their work including type of institution (e.g. academic, contract research organisation; study 1 only), primary type of research (e.g. applied, basic, regulatory), and number of years working with laboratory animals. In addition, questions were included to capture data on potential explanatory variables. These included their ability to influence the construct of experiments, the amount of statistical education they had received, familiarity with factorial designs, how often they incorporate males and females into their experimental designs, their knowledge on how to analyse data when females and males were collected, and the impact of including males and females on statistical power. Finally, a list of pre-identified advantages and barriers were provided to participants to list perceived reasons why incorporating females and males was considered advantageous or challenging. Participants were provided with an empty text box to list any other advantages or barriers in addition to the list provided.</p><p>Motivations, outlined by the theory of planned behaviour, regarding sex-inclusive research were assessed using a series of thirteen questions. Participants answered four closed-ended quantitative questions about their behavioural attitudes (relative perception about the positive or negative valence of sex inclusive research), three questions on subjective norms (social and professional pressures to conduct sex inclusive research) and three questions on perceived behavioural control (general confidence/control over the ability to run sex inclusive studies). The perceived behavioural control variable is different from self-efficacy as it asks participants about external control factors, such as whether inclusive designs are under the control of the participant. One open-ended question was included at the end of survey to assess if there were any other thoughts or comments participants wanted to share on the topic. Finally, three questions were used to assess participants’ future intent to implement sex-inclusive research.</p><p>The survey includes a question to determine whether participants are answering the question as part of the baseline/interested/intervention group (study 1) or pre-/post-assessment (study 2). Multiple participation was not anticipated due to the length of the survey and the time constraints for data collection.</p><p>The surveys were constructed to ensure that the only identifiable information was the optional input of an email address to support the draw of the Amazon vouchers. To maintain anonymity, once data was downloaded, an ID code was assigned, email addresses removed, and the email information only used for the draw. The final data was stored in an encrypted, password-protected file accessible only to the research team.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Workshop construct</title><p>The workshop, or training intervention, was developed by statisticians who have published, presented internationally, and taught on this topic . One of the statisticians has a formal teaching qualification and a background in education. The training consisted of a 1 hr 45 min workshop with didactic, interactive activities and introduced a framework to evaluate research proposals from a sex-inclusive perspective (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Prior to study 1, it was run as a pilot with a small group of scientists to test the material. Following the results of study 1, the workshop material was refined by amending the multiple-choice questions one and two to be more explicit in driving a discussion around whether data should be analysed by pooling, disaggregation or with a factorial test. Furthermore, multiple-choice question six was added to re-enforce learning that a baseline sex difference can be separated from an intervention effect.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Participant inclusion</title><p>In study 1, a total of 194 participants started the survey. Of these, 105 met the inclusion criteria questions (N=39 baseline, N=51 interested, and N=15 intervention). While all 105 met the inclusion criteria, seven participants left the question about age blank. Therefore, the final dataset to evaluate intent included 98 participants (N=35 baseline, N=48 interested, and N=15 intervention).</p><p>In study 2, a total of 63 individuals registered for the workshop, 42 participants attended all, or part of the workshop, and survey data was collected from 31 individuals. However, due to some not meeting the inclusion criteria, or not completing one of the surveys, we received data from 28 individuals for the pre-survey and 28 for the post.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Variable coding</title><p>For the theory of planned behaviour questions, each question had a scale from 1 to 7. An average score was calculated for each motivation (attitude, perceived behavioural control, and social norm) and for intent. This strategy required that each participant answer at least 50% of the questions for each motivation, otherwise, their data was discarded. All participants answered at least 50% of the theory of planned behaviour questions and, therefore, no participant’s data were discarded based on these criteria.</p><p>To aid analysis, demographic categories with less than ten responses were combined with similar-themed options into larger categories. For example, the question that asked about previous statistical training, the categories of ‘No training’ and ‘Primarily informal/practical’ were collapsed into a category called ‘No courses.’ Missing data for categorical variables (gender, geography, etc) were coded as ‘unknown’.</p><p>Within the survey, two (survey 2) to three (survey 1) questions had opportunities for participants to add a free-text answer in response to a question as an additional option provided to a question. Those questions were about the perceived barriers to or advantages of using males and females in preclinical research. For these questions, all free-text submitted were reviewed by the research team and categorised based on perceived theme. Generally, very few free responses (Survey 1: 12 for barrier question only; Survey 2: 6 for barrier question only) were provided (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app8table1">Appendix 8—table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app8table2">Appendix 8—table 2</xref>).</p><p>Five knowledge questions were posed to the participants based on misconceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phillips et al., 2023</xref>) concerning using females and males simultaneously in an experiment and variability in the female sex.

As fixed effects of interest, the statistical model included ‘Treatment_Group’ for study 1 and ‘Intervention’ for study 2. In addition, three theories of planned behaviour attributes: average attitude (Attitude), average behavioural control score (Beh_Control) and average social norm (Soc_Norm) were included as fixed effects. Furthermore, potential explanatory variables (e.g. demographic variables) were included in the model as fixed effects. A full model containing all possible terms (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> study 1 and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> study 2) was used, as we had no strong prior information that we could use to select predictive variables. For the data from study 2, a mixed model analysis was used as we included a random term for participant to account for the repeat nature of the data. For both studies, the baseline group was set as the reference group. Since a study of this kind has not been conducted before and the social factors (age, gender, previous statistical experience, etc.) are not reported as explaining/not explaining variability in data such as this, we left all potential explanatory variables in the model to provide data on demographic variables for future social science work of this kind. We evaluated the final model with and without these non-significant variables and the inclusion or exclusion, did not affect the results presented.

While all 105 met the inclusion criteria, seven participants left the question about age blank. As age was included as a predictor in the analysis of intent, the missing values were managed with listwise deletion, assuming missing at random, reducing the dataset size to 98 participants (N=35 baseline, N=48 interested, and N=15 intervention). To test for a statistically significant difference (association) between the treatment groups, a Pearson’s Chi-square test was used for categorical variables, ordered logistic regression for nominal variables, and ANOVA test for continuous variables. Institute type was collected as a demographic, the resulted population sampled was predominately academic and this variable was therefore removed from downstream analysis due to the lack of predictive ability to assess institute type on the outcome of interest.

While 31 unique individuals met the criteria, an individual may not have responded to both surveys (N=29 pre-survey and N=28 in the post-survey). For instance, two participants did not meet the inclusion criteria for the pre-survey but met the criteria for the post-intervention survey. For the intention analysis, some missing data was observed in the demographic data. To reduce survey burden, the post-survey only included one demographic question (the participant’s age) to support alignment of data, just in case duplicate initials were used as an identifier. Two responders did not include the age information in the study and were managed with listwise deletion, assuming missing at random.

It is important to acknowledge that part of the impetus for SABV is to gain more scientific knowledge on females. This will require within sex analyses and dedicated research to uncover how unique characteristics for females can influence physiology and health outcomes. This will only be achieved with the use of female-only studies. The overemphasis on investigations of sex influences limits the work done for women's health, for example, as within-sex analyses are equally important.</p></disp-quote><p>The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines (1) provide guidance that “Where the subjects of research comprise organisms capable of differentiation by sex, the research should be designed and conducted in a way that can reveal sex-related differences in the results, even if these were not initially expected.”. This is a default position of inclusion where the sex can be determined and analysis assessing for sex related variability in response. This position underpins many of the funding bodies new policies on inclusion.</p><p>However, we need to place this in the context of the driver of inclusion. The most common reason for including male and female samples is for those studies that are exploring the effect of a treatment and then the goal of inclusion is to assess the generalisability of the treatment effect (exploratory sex inclusion)(2). The second scenario is where sex is included because sex is one of the variables of interest and this situation will arise because there is a hypothesized sex difference of interest (confirmatory sex inclusion).</p><p>We would argue that the SABV concept was introduced to address the systematic bias of only studying one sex when assessing treatment effect to improve the generalisability of the research. Therefore, it isn’t directly to gain more scientific knowledge on females. However, this strategy will highlight when the effect is very different between male and female subjects which will potentially generate sex specific hypotheses.</p><p>Where research has a hypothesis that is specific to a sex (e.g. it is related to oestrogen levels) it would be appropriate to study only the sex of interest, in this case females. The recently published Sex Inclusive Research Framework gives some guidance here and allows an exemption for such a scenario classifying such proposals “Single sex study justified” (3).</p><p>We have added an additional paragraph to the introduction to clarify the objectives behind inclusion and how this assists the research process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It should be acknowledged that although the variability within each sex is not different on a number of characteristics (as indicated by meta-analyses in rats and mice), this was not done on all variables, and behavioral variables were not included. In addition, across-sex variability may very well be different, which, in turn, would result in statistical sex significance. In addition, on some measures, there are sex differences in variability, as human males have more variability in grey matter volume than females. PMID: 33044802.</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript was highlighting the common argument used to exclude the use of females, which is that females are inherently more variable as an absolute truth. We agree there might be situations, where the variance is higher in one sex or another depending on the biology. We have extended the discussion here to reflect this, and we also linked to the Sex Inclusive Research Framework (3) which highlights that in these situations researchers can utlise this argument provided it is supported with data for the biology of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors need to acknowledge that it can be important that the sample size is increased when examining more than one sex. If the sample size is too low for biological research, it will not be possible to determine whether or not a difference exists. Using statistical modelling, researchers have found that depending on the effect size, the sample size does need to increase. It is important to bare this in mind as exploratory analyses with small sample size will be extremely limiting and may also discourage further study in this area or indeed as seen the literature - an exploratory first study with the use of males and females with limited sample size, only to show there is no &quot;significance&quot; and to justify this as an reason to only use males for the further studies in the work.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a common problem: where researchers have frequently argued that if they find no sex differences in a pilot then they can proceed to study only one sex. The SAGER guidelines (1), and now funder guidelines (4, 5), challenge that position. Instead, the expectation is for inclusion as the default in all experiments (exploratory inclusion strategy) to allow generalisable results to be obtained. When the results are very different between the male and female samples, then this can be determined. This perspective shift (2) requires a change in mindset and understanding that the driver behind inclusion is of generalisability not exploration of sex differences. This has been added to the introduction as an additional paragraph exploring the drivers behind inclusion.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that if the researcher is interested in sex differences in an effect (confirmatory inclusion strategy, aka sex as a primary variable) then the N will need to be higher. However, in this situation, one, of course, must have male and female samples in the same experiment to allow the simultaneous exploration to assess the dependency on sex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The investigators tested a workshop intervention to improve knowledge and decrease misconceptions about sex inclusive research. There were important findings that demonstrate the difficulty in changing opinions and knowledge about the importance of studying both males and females. While interventions can improve knowledge and decrease perceived barriers, the impact was small.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The investigators included control groups and replicated the study in a second population of scientists. The results appear to be well substantiated.

We appreciate your recognition of the value and practical implications of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I found the figures difficult to understand and would have appreciated more explanation of what is depicted, as well as greater space between the bars representing different categories.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved the figures and figure legends to improve clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript aims to determine cultural biases and misconceptions in inclusive sex research and evaluate the efficacy of interventions to improve knowledge and shift perceptions to decrease perceived barriers for including both sexes in basic research.</p><p>Overall, this study demonstrates that despite the intention to include both sexes and a general belief in the importance of doing so, relatively few people routinely include both sexes. Further, the perceptions of barriers to doing so are high, including misconceptions surrounding sample size, disaggregation, and variability of females. There was also a substantial number of individuals without the statistical knowledge to appropriately analyze data in studies inclusive of sex. Interventions increased knowledge and decreased perception of barriers.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) This manuscript provides evidence for the efficacy of interventions for changing attitudes and perceptions of research.</p><p>(2) This manuscript also provides a training manual for expanding this intervention to broader groups of researchers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting these strengths. We appreciate your recognition that the intervention was effect in changing attitudes and perception. We deliberately chose to share the material to provide the resources to allow a wider engagement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major weakness here is that the post-workshop assessment is a single time point, soon after the intervention. As this paper shows, intention for these individuals is already high, so does decreasing perception of barriers and increasing knowledge change behavior, and increase the number of studies that include both sexes? Similarly, does the intervention start to shift cultural factors? Do these contribute to a change in behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>Measuring change in behaviour following an intervention is challenging and hence we had implemented an intention score as a proxy for behaviour. We appreciate the benefit of a long-term analysis, but it was beyond the scope of this study and would need a larger dataset size to allow for attrition. We agree that the strategy implemented has weaknesses. We have extended the limitation section in the discussion to include these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I would ask them to think about alternative explanations and ask for free-form responses, and to revise with the caveats written above - sample size does need to be increased depending on effect size, and that within sex studies are also important. Not all studies should focus on sex influences.</p></disp-quote><p>The inclusion of the additional paragraph in the introduction to clarify the objective of inclusion and the resulting impact on experimental design should address these recommendations.</p><p>We have also added the free-form responses as an additional supplementary file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>This is an important set of studies. My only recommendation to improve the data presentation so that it is clear what is depicted and how the analyses were conducted. I know it is in the methods, but reminding the reader would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revisited the figures and included more information in the legends to explain the analysis and improve clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>There are parts in the introduction which read as contradictory and as such are confusing - for example, in the 3rd paragraph it states that little progress on sex inclusive research has been made, and in the following sentences it states that the proportion of published studies across sex has improved. The references in these two statements are from the same time range, so has this improved? Or not?</p></disp-quote><p>The introduction does include a summation statement on the position: “Whilst a positive step forward, this proportion still represents a minority of studies, and notably this inclusion was not associated with an increase in the proportion of studies that included data analysed by sex.” We have reworded the text to ensure it is internally consistent with this summary statement and this should increase clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In discussing the results, it is sometimes confusing what the percentages mean. For example, &quot;the researchers reported only conducting sex inclusive research in &lt;= 55% of their studies over the past 5 years (55% in study 1 general population and 35% study 2 pre-assessment).&quot; Does that mean 55% of people are conducting sex inclusive research, or does this mean only half of their studies? These two options have very different implications.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the sentence is confusing and it has been reworded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Addressing long-term assessments in attitude and action (ie, performing sex inclusive research) is a crucial addition, with data if possible, but at least substantive discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have add this to the limitation section in the discussion</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One minor but confusing point is the analogy comparing sex inclusive studies with attending the gym. The point is well taken - knowledge is not enough for behavior change. However, the argument here is that to increase sex inclusive research requires cultural change. To go to the gym, requires motivation.This seems like an oranges-to-lemons comparison (same family, different outcome when you bite into it).</p></disp-quote><p>At the core, both scenarios involve the challenge of changing established habits and cultural norms in action based on knowledge (the right thing to do). The exercise scenario is a primary example provided by the original authors to describe how aspects of the theory of planned behaviour (perceived behavioural control, attitude, and social norms) may influence behavioural change. Understanding which of these aspects may drive or influence change is why we used this framework to understand our study population. We disagree that is an oranges-to-lemons comparison.</p><p>References</p><p>(1) Heidari S, Babor TF, De Castro P, Tort S, Curno M.
