regulation of rare cell populations because most metabolites are hard to detect in small numbers of cells. We previously described a method for metabolomic profiling of flow cytometrically isolated hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that detects 60 metabolites in 10,000 cells (Agathocleous et al., 2017). Here we describe a new method involving hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography and high-sensitivity orbitrap mass spectrometry that detected 160 metabolites in 10,000 HSCs, including many more glycolytic and lipid intermediates. We improved chromatographic separation, increased mass resolution, minimized ion suppression, and eliminated sample drying. Most metabolite levels did not significantly change during cell isolation. Mouse HSCs exhibited increased glycerophospholipids relative to bone marrow cells and methotrexate treatment altered purine biosynthesis. Circulating human melanoma cells were depleted for purine intermediates relative to subcutaneous tumors, suggesting decreased purine synthesis during metastasis. These methods facilitate the routine metabolomic analysis of rare cells from tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>hematopoietic stem cell</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>circulating cancer cell</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathews</surname><given-names>Thomas P</given-names></name><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK11875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA228608</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP180778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Morrison</surname><given-names>Sean J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 HL 135975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeVilbiss</surname><given-names>Andrew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003390</institution-id><institution>Fritz Thyssen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tasdogan</surname><given-names>Alpaslan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>German National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina Fellowship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LPDS 2016-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tasdogan</surname><given-names>Alpaslan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A method was developed for the metabolomic analysis of small numbers of flow cytometrically isolated cells from rare cell populations such as hematopoietic stem cells and circulating cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolomics is typically performed using millions of cells, often using cultured cells, whole tissues, or tumor specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jang et al., 2018</xref>). This measures average metabolite levels across the cells in a specimen but is blind to metabolic differences among cells in the same sample. As a result, we have limited insights into metabolic heterogeneity among cells within tissues or tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim and DeBerardinis, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muir et al., 2018</xref>). This limitation is particularly apparent when considering rare cells, such as stem cells or circulating cancer cells, that may be metabolically different from other cells. The difficulty in performing metabolomics on small numbers of these cells is compounded by the need to purify them from tissues, introducing additional technical challenges for metabolic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llufrio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lau et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>It is extremely difficult to isolate a million cells from a rare cell population by flow cytometry. One study isolated over 1 million CD34<sup>-</sup>Flt3<sup>-</sup>Lineage<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>+ </sup>hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by flow cytometry but pooled bone marrow cells from 120 mice to do it, precluding the analysis of multiple replicates or routine application of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takubo et al., 2013</xref>). Metabolomics has also been performed on hundreds of thousands of flow cytometrically isolated Lineage<sup>-</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup> (LSK) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Naka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karigane et al., 2016</xref>), a more heterogeneous population of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Since only a small minority of these cells are HSCs, this strategy provides limited insights into metabolite levels in HSCs themselves. Others have characterized the phenotypes of mutant mice or metabolism in cultured hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simsek et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ito et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ansó et al., 2017</xref>). However, it remains difficult to routinely compare metabolite levels between HSCs and other hematopoietic progenitors.</p><p>Metabolites have been profiled in single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comi et al., 2017</xref>). However, these studies often use very large cells like Xenopus eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Onjiko et al., 2015</xref>) or Aplysia neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nemes et al., 2012</xref>). Other single cell analyses have focused on small numbers of metabolites or specific subsets of metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo and Li, 2017</xref>). Single cell metabolomics methods often involve mass spectrometry without chromatographic separation, making it more difficult to identify the detected species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duncan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We recently described a method for metabolomic analysis of highly purified, flow cytometrically isolated CD150<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>-</sup>LSK HSCs that detected approximately 60 metabolites in 10,000 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>). Cells were kept cold during the entire purification process and sorted directly into 80% methanol to immediately quench enzymatic activity and extract metabolites. This method revealed that HSCs take up more ascorbate than other hematopoietic cells and depend upon ascorbate for epigenetic regulation and leukemia suppression, though coverage of many metabolic pathways was limited.</p><p>The challenge of performing metabolomic analysis in rare cells is not limited to stem cells as illustrated by a paucity of information about the metabolic state of circulating cancer cells. Many tumors spontaneously shed cancer cells into the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Micalizzi et al., 2017</xref>) but these cells are extremely rare, limiting the amount of material for analysis. We have developed methods for the flow cytometric isolation and characterization of circulating human melanoma cells from the blood of xenografted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piskounova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tasdogan et al., 2020</xref>). These cells undergo reversible metabolic changes during metastasis to survive oxidative stress, but these changes are just beginning to be characterized. Mass spectrometric analysis of single circulating cancer cells from the blood of patients revealed metabolites that differed among various kinds of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hiyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abouleila et al., 2019</xref>). Fluorescent probes have also been used to characterize metabolism in circulating cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here we present a new method for the metabolomic analysis of rare stem cell and cancer cell populations isolated by flow cytometry. We have increased the number of metabolites we can detect in 10,000 HSCs to approximately 160. Using this method, the levels of most metabolites did not significantly change during cell preparation and sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chromatography and mass spectrometry</title><p>In order to significantly increase the numbers of metabolites we detected in small numbers of flow cytometrically isolated cells, we re-examined the chromatography and mass spectrometry approaches we used. A key limitation is discriminating the low levels of metabolites present in small numbers of cells from background signals. Background reflects contamination from various sources as well as the co-association of salts with organic compounds in mass spectrometers to generate organic salt clusters (matrix ions) that obscure the detection of metabolites. We reasoned we could improve the signal to noise ratio in low abundance samples and reduce interference by matrix ions by transitioning to a mass spectrometer with higher mass resolving power.</p><p>We chose a Q-Exactive HF-X hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific) because it offers four advantages over the triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer used in our previous method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>). First, whereas the triple-quadrupole instrument acquires data for a predetermined number of metabolites, the orbitrap instrument captures spectra for the full mass range (80–1200 Daltons) with each scan, greatly increasing the number of metabolites detected. Second, orbitrap mass analyzers have higher mass resolving power and higher mass accuracy, increasing the ability to discriminate relevant analytes from background ions. Third, through untargeted acquisition of product ion spectra, orbitrap instruments enable the comparison of spectra from experimental samples with annotated spectrum libraries for high-confidence identification of metabolites. Finally, compared to other orbitrap models, the HF-X front end optics increase the number of ions that can pass into the mass spectrometer, boosting the signal from low abundance analytes.</p><p>We also wondered if a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) system would improve the separation of polar metabolites as compared to the reverse phase chromatography method in our original study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>). To test this, we extracted metabolites from 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> mouse whole bone marrow (WBM) cells in 500 µl of 80% methanol, dried the extracts in a vacuum concentrator, and reconstituted in water for reverse phase chromatography or 80% methanol for HILIC. Polar analytes eluted from the reverse phase column between 3 and 5 min, and from the HILIC column between 2 and 15 min, indicating that HILIC improved polar metabolite separation (data not shown).</p><p>When we ran high abundance samples either by reverse phase or HILIC we identified hundreds of metabolites by spectral database matching and manual peak review (data not shown). However, the improved metabolite separation and peak quality we observed with HILIC yielded more high confidence identifications of metabolites via spectral database matching alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). HILIC also enabled the detection of early-eluting lipid metabolites, which were not detected using reverse phase chromatography. They were well-resolved chromatographically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>) and were detected within the linear range of the mass spectrometer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). Finally, HILIC eliminated the requirement for sample drying, which can alter the levels of certain metabolites and increase contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). We thus selected HILIC for further method development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sample processing and chromatography parameters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of metabolites identified with high confidence spectral database matching in whole bone marrow (WBM) samples after HILIC or reverse phase chromatography (n = 3 replicates per group from one experiment).

To determine which metabolites were detected in low abundance samples we created a list of metabolites with known masses and chromatographic retention times from the analysis of high abundance samples. We first used unbiased metabolite identification software (Compound Discoverer) to compare experimentally observed mass spectra with annotated spectrum libraries to identify 571 metabolites. We confirmed the identities of each metabolite in the library by reviewing the MS2 spectra for each metabolite. We confirmed the retention times and mass spectra for over 450 metabolites in the library by running chemical standards. This library was used to determine how many metabolites were detected in low abundance samples by manually analyzing chromatographic peaks derived from extracts of 100,000 WBM cells. This resulted in a low abundance library containing 283 detectable metabolites that was used for manual metabolite quantitation in low abundance samples. This manual approach was more time consuming but more accurate than relying upon automated peak-calling algorithms, which often failed to accurately integrate LC-MS peaks from low-abundance samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Reducing sources of contamination</title><p>Background signals arose from the staining medium in which we suspended the cells, the flow cytometer sheath fluid, the solvent we used to extract metabolites from the sorted cells, and the drying and reconstitution of samples prior to liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>). While these very low levels of background would be negligible when analyzing high abundance samples, they did interfere with the ability to detect some metabolites in low abundance samples.</p><p>When performing reverse phase separation, metabolites were extracted using 80% methanol and then dried in a vacuum concentrator so they could be reconstituted in water for chromatography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>). Transitioning to HILIC made it possible to directly inject organic solvents into the column, without drying and reconstituting in water. To test if contamination was reduced by not drying in a vacuum concentrator, we sorted droplets of sheath fluid with no cells in volumes equivalent to that required to sort 10,000 cells and processed the samples side-by-side in three ways. Some samples were dried in a standard vacuum concentrator, then reconstituted in 80% methanol, and injected into the HILIC column. Some samples were dried in a new vacuum concentrator housed in a HEPA-filtered PCR hood to minimize contamination from the air, then reconstituted in 80% methanol and injected into the HILIC column. The remaining samples were sorted into 80% methanol and injected directly into the HILIC column without drying. The highest level of background contamination was in the samples dried in the standard vacuum concentrator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The lowest background was in the samples injected into the column without drying, suggesting drying increased contamination.</p><p>To test if we could detect more metabolites above background in low abundance samples if we did not dry and reconstitute, we sorted samples of 10,000 WBM cells, along with sheath fluid negative controls, and processed the samples side-by-side either with drying in a standard vacuum concentrator, with drying in a new vacuum concentrator in a HEPA-filtered PCR hood, or without drying. We detected 98, 123, or 130 metabolites significantly above sheath fluid background (always fold change &gt;2 and false discovery rate [FDR] &lt; 0.05) in the samples dried in a standard vacuum concentrator, a HEPA-filtered vacuum concentrator, or undried, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We thus detected more metabolites above background in low abundance samples if we avoided sample drying and incorporated this approach into the method.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Acetonitrile extraction</title><p>Metabolites are most commonly extracted from cells using miscible aqueous-organic solvents, with the elimination of proteins, non-soluble components, and cellular debris by centrifugation. Different metabolites require different solvents for extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rabinowitz and Kimball, 2007</xref>). To test different solvents, we extracted metabolites from 100,000 pipetted WBM cells using 80% methanol in water, 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water, or 80% acetonitrile in water. Using HILIC and orbitrap mass spectrometry we detected an average of 317 metabolites in samples extracted with 80% acetonitrile and 266 or 273 metabolites in samples extracted with 80% methanol or 40:40:20 methanol:acetonitrile:water, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While we observed considerable overlap in the metabolites detected using each solvent, 80% acetonitrile yielded a number of metabolites that were not detected using the other solvents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We thus selected 80% acetonitrile for further method development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ion suppression and cell numbers</title><p>Ion suppression of metabolite signals can occur as a result of the salt in the phosphate buffered saline (PBS) sheath fluid used for flow cytometric sorting: 1–3 nl of sheath fluid is sorted along with each cell depending on whether a 70 µm or 100 µm nozzle is used. Flow cytometry sheath fluid must contain salt to electrostatically charge droplets for sorting; sorting more cells also sorts more salt. When using reverse phase chromatography, we reduced ion suppression by using 0.5× PBS sheath fluid and a 70 μm nozzle in four-way purity sort mode to minimize droplet volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>). After changing to HILIC, we retested whether 0.5× PBS or the 70 μm nozzle affected the number of metabolites we detected from 10,000 WBM cells. Sorting with the 70 μm nozzle increased the number of metabolites we could detect above sheath fluid background as compared to the 100 μm nozzle, regardless of PBS concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We found no significant difference in the number of metabolites detected above background using 0.5× (157 ± 2) versus 1.0× (149 ± 9) PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>We found 18 metabolites that significantly differed among samples sorted with 0.5× versus 1× PBS sheath fluid (always fold change &gt;2 and FDR &lt; 0.05; see the list of metabolites in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>, Supplementary Table 1). Pathway enrichment analysis did not identify any pathways that were significantly enriched among the changed metabolites. It is unlikely that these differences are a consequence of hypotonic shock because the laminar flow within the cytometer minimizes the mixing of the cell sample buffer (1× Hank's Buffered Salt Solution [HBSS]) and the sheath fluid. Cells pass through the flow cytometer in less than a second and are immediately lysed upon sorting into the extraction solvent. Differences between 0.5× and 1× PBS sheath fluid are more likely to reflect reduced ion suppression in samples sorted with 0.5× PBS and altered metabolite extraction efficiency. We selected 0.5× PBS as the sheath fluid for further method development as we tended to detect somewhat more metabolites and higher levels of some metabolites when using 0.5× PBS.</p><p>Next we tested if the number of metabolites we detected above background increased with increasing numbers of cells. We pipetted 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 50,000, or 100,000 WBM cells (in equal volumes of HBSS buffer) directly into 80% acetonitrile and quantitated metabolites. The number of metabolites detected above sheath fluid background increased significantly with increasing numbers of cells, from 157 ± 4 metabolites in 10,000 cells to 222 ± 9 metabolites in 100,000 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In the same experiment, we detected an average of 155 ± 2 metabolites from 10,000 flow cytometrically sorted WBM cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We thus detected similar numbers of metabolites in flow cytometrically sorted and unsorted samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effect of flow cytometry on metabolite levels</title><p>To determine if metabolic differences between cells are preserved during cell sorting using the methods described above, we sorted or pipetted 10,000 HNT-34 AML cells or 10,000 DND-41 T-ALL cells into 80% acetonitrile. We detected 143–167 metabolites above background in each sample. Principal component analysis revealed differences between sorted and pipetted AML cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; see the list of metabolites in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1—source data 3</xref>, Supplementary Table 2) whereas differences among sorted and pipetted ALL cells were subtle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; see the list of metabolites in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata4">Figure 1—source data 4</xref>, Supplementary Table 3). Forty-three metabolites significantly differed between sorted and pipetted AML cells while 19 metabolites differed between sorted and pipetted ALL cells (fold change &gt;2 and FDR &lt; 0.05). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that metabolites that differed between sorted and pipetted AML cells were significantly enriched in ‘cysteine and methionine metabolism’. No pathways were significantly enriched among metabolites that differed between sorted and pipetted ALL cells.</p><p>Irrespective of whether cells were sorted or pipetted, similar differences were observed between AML and ALL cells. Among sorted samples, 85 metabolites significantly differed between AML and ALL cells while among pipetted samples, 71 of the same metabolites differed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>; see the list of metabolites in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata5">Figure 1—source data 5</xref>, Supplementary Table 4). Approximately 84% of the metabolites that significantly differed among sorted cells also significantly differed among pipetted cells and 73% of the significant differences among pipetted samples also significantly differed among sorted samples. Of the 14 metabolites that significantly changed in sorted but not pipetted cells, 12 trended in the same direction in both sets of samples. Of the 26 metabolites that changed in pipetted but not sorted samples, 19 trended in the same direction in both sets of samples. Thus, most metabolites exhibited similar differences among AML and ALL cells irrespective of whether the cells were sorted.</p><p>To more systematically assess the similarity of pipetted and sorted samples, we plotted log2-transformed fold change values between AML and ALL cells for all metabolites above background in sorted versus pipetted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). The slope of the regression was near 1 (y = 0.96 × –0.06) and the correlation was strong for most metabolites (Spearman correlation coefficient, r = 0.81). When we restricted the analysis to metabolites that significantly differed between sorted AML and ALL cells (fold change &gt;2, FDR &lt; 0.05), the correlation was even stronger (y = 0.95 × – 0.15; r = 0.92; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). While the levels of some metabolites did change during sorting, most metabolites strongly correlated in sorted and unsorted samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Effect of time on metabolite levels</title><p>It typically took up to 2 hr to sort HSCs into acetonitrile, starting from when the mice were killed. We wondered to what extent metabolite levels changed over time during cell isolation. To test this, we quickly flushed bone marrow from the long bones and made single cell suspensions in HBSS that we kept on ice. We pipetted 10,000 cell aliquots of WBM cells into acetonitrile at 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after killing the mice then performed metabolomic analysis on each sample. At all time points, we detected 170–179 metabolites above sheath fluid background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Relative to the samples collected at 5 min, only two metabolites significantly changed (fold change &gt;2 and FDR &lt; 0.05) in the samples collected at 15 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). The number of metabolites that significantly changed increased over time, but most of the changes occurred by 120 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>; see the list of metabolites that changed over time in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata6">Figure 1—source data 6</xref>, Supplementary Table 5). The only metabolic pathway that was significantly enriched among metabolites that changed over time was ‘purine metabolism’ as purines were enriched in samples that incubated longer on ice. Thus, some metabolites did change over time but these represented less than 20% of detected metabolites.</p><p>To more broadly assess the similarity of the samples over time, we plotted log2-transformed values for all detected metabolites in 5 min versus 120 min samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). The slope of the regression was near 1 (y = 0.97 × +0.62) and the correlation was strong, r = 0.98. We also plotted non-transformed values for all detected metabolites in 5 min versus 120 min samples, observing a similarly high correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). Finally, to most clearly show the differences between 5 and 120 min samples, we plotted only metabolites with signal intensity &lt;1 × 10<sup>8</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>). Again, the slope of the regression was near 1 (y = 0.95 × +1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup>) and the correlation was strong, r = 0.97. Thus, most metabolite intensity values strongly correlated among samples that incubated on ice for different periods of time. However, some metabolic changes may occur within seconds of harvesting a tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2017</xref>) in a way that was not reflected in this experiment as the 5 min time point was the earliest at which a bone marrow cell suspension could be reliably obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Effect of cell suspension buffer on metabolite levels</title><p>We typically prepare hematopoietic cell suspensions using HBSS, which contains glucose. To test if this affected metabolite levels, we prepared bone marrow cell suspensions in HBSS or PBS then sorted 10,000 cells for metabolomic analysis.

The metabolite that most differed between these samples was glucose, which was substantially enriched in cells isolated from HBSS. Pathway enrichment analysis did not detect any pathways enriched among the metabolites that differed among HBSS and PBS samples. Therefore, the presence of glucose in the cell suspension buffer did affect glucose levels in the sorted cells but had little effect on the levels of other metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Metabolomic profiling of HSC/multipotent progenitors (MPPs)</title><p>To assess the metabolite profile of HSCs/MPPs we sorted 10,000 cell aliquots of CD48<sup>-</sup>Lineage<sup>-</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells and WBM cells.

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and AICAR transaminase (ATIC), steps in de novo purine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baggott et al., 1986</xref>). Methotrexate treatment did not significantly affect bone marrow cellularity or the frequencies of HSCs, MPPs, or LSK cells in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Methotrexate treatment also did not significantly affect the reconstituting potential of WBM cells upon competitive transplantation into irradiated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Metabolomic analysis of 10,000 HSC/MPPs from the bone marrow of methotrexate-treated and control mice revealed that the only pathway that was significantly enriched among the metabolites that differed was ‘purine metabolism’. While methotrexate would also be expected to alter folate metabolism, folate species are very difficult to detect by metabolomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) and are not detected by our method.

We subcutaneously transplanted M405 patient-derived melanoma cells into NSG mice.

Pathway enrichment analysis of all metabolites that significantly differed between subcutaneous tumor and circulating melanoma cells (p&lt;0.05) found one pathway that significantly (FDR &lt; 0.01) differed, ‘purine metabolism’. Several purine biosynthesis intermediates were depleted in circulating melanoma cells as compared to subcutaneous tumors, including insoine monophosphate (IMP), xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>, Supplementary table 1).

We improved signal to noise ratio by using HILIC and an orbitrap mass spectrometer. We decreased contamination by eliminating sample drying and improved chromatographic performance by extracting metabolites with 80% acetonitrile. In principle, this method can be used to analyze any cell population isolated by flow cytometry, though in practice it is most useful when cell numbers are limited and when enzymatic dissociation is not required. We normalized for input variation among samples by ensuring that the average signal intensity values of metabolites detected above background were equal in the samples being compared. While it is impractical to include isotopically labeled internal standards within the initial metabolomic analysis, since the relative levels of hundreds of different metabolites are assessed, we routinely follow-up metabolomics with other methods optimized to extract and quantitate specific metabolites of interest. In those follow-up assays we include labeled internal standards to determine absolute concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tasdogan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ubellacker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piskounova et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Metabolomic profiling of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) isolated by flow cytometry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the method.

This is a particular problem when cells are enzymatically dissociated as they exchange metabolites with the dissociation medium, or when cells are sorted into buffers that require additional processing steps before cell lysis and metabolite extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lau et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Binek et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Llufrio et al., 2018</xref>). To avoid changes in metabolites during cell processing, we worked quickly and kept the cells cold from the time they left the animal until they were sorted into acetonitrile. Cellular metabolism is immediately quenched by sorting into cold acetonitrile. The levels of most metabolites strongly correlated in sorted and unsorted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–K</xref>). Some metabolites exhibited changes over time during cell processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) but the levels of most metabolites strongly correlated in samples at 5 and 120 min after removal from the mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N–P</xref>). Therefore, most metabolite levels were not significantly changed by cell preparation and sorting, at least beyond 5 min after the mouse was killed. However, some metabolite levels might change less than a minute after the removal of cells from their normal physiological environment in a way that would not have been detected in our experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). If so, it will not be possible to quantitate these metabolites in flow cytometrically isolated cells.</p><p>Transitioning to HILIC provided several advantages relative to reverse phase chromatography. We were able to avoid sample drying, which significantly reduced contamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). We reduced ion suppression compared to our prior method because salt eluted after the metabolites of interest on HILIC columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Third, HILIC improved the separation of polar metabolites, such as central carbon metabolites, while also enabling the detection of many lipid species. Nonetheless, some metabolites are better resolved and detected by reverse phase chromatography. Therefore, while HILIC provided a net advantage for our purposes, adapting this low cell number method to other chromatographies could improve the detection of certain classes of metabolites.</p><p>Prior studies have explored many aspects of metabolomics methods, including extraction solvents and drying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Theodoridis et al., 2012</xref>). Methanol–water and acetonitrile–water mixtures have been reported to capture more metabolites than other solvents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Want et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jiye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masson et al., 2010</xref>). Methanol is nucleophilic and can degrade metabolites with electrophilic moieties, such as nucleoside phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rabinowitz and Kimball, 2007</xref>). Data quality and accuracy are also improved by minimizing sample manipulation after metabolite extraction, including by avoiding drying, which can promote oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siegel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2017</xref>). We found that acetonitrile–water solvent and avoiding drying yielded the highest number of metabolites detected above sheath fluid background. HILIC resolution of metabolites was also improved when samples were injected in acetonitrile–water instead of methanol–water.</p><p>The extraction conditions we used are not suitable for the quantitation of some metabolites, including those that spontaneously oxidize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lu et al., 2018</xref>). For example, ascorbate spontaneously oxidizes upon extraction from cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Washko et al., 1992</xref>; therefore, in our prior study we added EDTA to the extraction solvent to prevent spontaneous oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>). In an effort to devise a general method in the current study, we did not add EDTA to the extraction solvent and therefore did not measure ascorbate levels accurately. Consistent with this, ascorbate was one of the three metabolites that differed between HSCs and WBM cells in our prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agathocleous et al., 2017</xref>) that we did not detect as different in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The other two were spermidine and betaine, which were not detected using the new method.</p><p>We observed differences in the abundance of glycerophospholipids between HSCs/MPPs and WBM cells. Functional studies will be required to assess the biological significance of this difference. Few studies have examined lipid metabolism in HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pernes et al., 2019</xref>), partly because methods have not been readily available to quantitate lipid levels in HSCs. The ability of the new method to detect more than 60 lipids in 10,000 HSCs may facilitate future studies of lipid metabolism in stem cells. We also performed metabolomics on circulating melanoma cells from xenografted mice. Cancer cells must undergo metabolic changes to survive oxidative stress during metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Piskounova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tasdogan et al., 2020</xref>).

Mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation. Bones were rapidly dissected and stored on ice in HBSS without Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (HBSS, Corning). Muscle was stripped from the bones, then they were crushed in 2.5 ml of HBSS using a pre-cooled mortar and pestle, on ice. Bone marrow cells were filtered through a 40 µm strainer into a 50 ml conical tube. The cells were then stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against B220 (FITC, Tonbo), Gr-1 (FITC, Tonbo), Ter119 (FITC, Tonbo), CD2 (FITC, Tonbo), CD3 (FITC, Tonbo), CD5 (FITC, BioLegend), CD8 (FITC, Tonbo), c-kit (APC-eFluor780, eBiosciences), Sca-1 (PerCP-Cy5.5, BioLegend), CD48 (APC, eBiosciences), and CD150 (PE, BioLegend) for 30 min on ice. Beginning 10 min before adding the antibodies and continuing after the antibodies had been added, para-magnetic beads conjugated to anti-c-kit antibodies (Miltenyi) were added to the cells to facilitate pre-enrichment of c-kit<sup>+</sup> cells in samples from which HSCs were sorted. To ensure that WBM cells were processed in the same way, these samples were enriched by positive selection of para-magnetic beads bound to anti-CD45 antibodies (Miltenyi). Positive selection was performed in the cold room at 4°C using a QuadroMACS manual separator (Miltenyi) and LS Columns (Miltenyi). Cells were eluted from columns in 2 ml of HBSS, centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g, and resuspended in HBSS with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 µg/ml, Sigma) for flow cytometry.

At this point, single cell suspensions were obtained by dissociating tumors mechanically with a scalpel on ice followed by gentle trituration. Cells were filtered through a 40 μm strainer to generate a single cell suspension. Blood was collected from mice by cardiac puncture with a syringe pretreated with citrate–dextrose solution (Santa Cruz).</p><p>Subcutaneous tumor and blood specimens were first incubated on ice for 10 min with ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysing buffer to eliminate red blood cells. The cells were washed with PBS and then stained with antibodies prior to flow cytometry. All antibody staining was performed for 20 min on ice, followed by washing with PBS and centrifuging at 200 × g for 5 min. Cells were stained with directly conjugated antibodies against mouse CD45 (APC, Tonbo Biosciences), mouse CD31 (APC, Biolegend), mouse Ter119 (APC, Tonbo Biosciences), and human HLA-A, -B, -C (G46-2.6-FITC, BD Biosciences). Human melanoma cells were isolated as cells that were positive for HLA and DsRed (melanoma cells were tagged with constitutive DsRed before subcutaneous transplantation), and negative for mouse endothelial (CD31) and hematopoietic markers (CD45 and Ter119). Cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in DAPI (1 μg/ml, Sigma) to eliminate dead cells from sorts and analyses.

To confirm the identity of these cell lines, we performed qRT-PCR and western blot analyses of several leukemia signature genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ng et al., 2016</xref>). We also performed RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing and compared the results with previous studies. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination using the Lonza MycoAlert kit (Lonza # LT07-118). No cell lines used in this study were found in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee (ICLAC) or the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) BioSample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sorting versus pipetting of cultured cells for metabolomics</title><p>HNT-34 AML cells and DND-41 T-ALL cells were cultured non-adherently in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were maintained at a density of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml, and cultured at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. AML or ALL cells were removed from the incubator and centrifuged at 4°C to pellet the cells, then resuspended in ice-cold PBS and centrifuged again, before being resuspended in ice cold PBS at a density of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. Ten microliters of the AML or ALL cell suspension was then pipetted into 40 µl of 100% acetonitrile to create a final metabolite extract of 10,000 cells in 50 µl 80% acetonitrile (10 min total processing time). Ten thousand AML or ALL cells from the same cell suspensions were also sorted into 40 µl of 100% acetonitrile to create a final metabolite extract of 10,000 cells in 50 µl of 80% acetonitrile (30–60 min processing time). The cells were kept ice cold before and during sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Flow cytometer preparation</title><p>Flow cytometers were thoroughly cleaned before sorting low abundance samples to minimize background. All flow cytometry was performed using a FACSAria II or a FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences). The fluidics shutdown protocols were performed using 80% ethanol before each sort. A clean, metabolomics-dedicated FACSAria sheath tank was rinsed with ultrapure water several times to reduce contamination, before being filled with 4 l of 0.5× PBS made from tablets (Sigma) dissolved in ultrapure water. The metabolomics sheath tank was connected to the sorter using a dedicated 0.22 µm filter. The fluidics startup protocol was performed using freshly made 0.5× PBS sheath fluid. The sorter was configured to use a 70 µm nozzle but before the nozzle was inserted two cycles of clean flow cell protocols were performed with Windex. The sheath fluid was then run through the flow cytometer without a nozzle for 5 min to flush Windex and any remaining debris from the flow cell. At the same time, the 70 µm nozzle was sonicated for 5 min to remove contamination and debris, and the cleanliness of the nozzle was confirmed by microscopy. The sheath fluid stream was turned off and the sort chamber was cleaned with a lint-free wipe and cotton swabs. The nozzle was then inserted and the stream was turned on. The sample line was cleaned again by running a 5 ml sample tube of Windex for 5 min, followed by ultrapure water for 5 min. Four-way purity sort mode was used to minimize droplet size. The cell sample, the sorting chamber, and the collection tube adapter were all maintained at 4°C during sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sorting cells for metabolomics</title><p>The Eppendorf tubes into which cells were sorted were loaded with 40 µl of 100% acetonitrile (Optima, Fisher Scientific) or methanol (Optima, Fisher Scientific) before sorting. We used a freshly opened bag of clean Eppendorf tubes (USA Scientific) and filtered pipette tips. The Eppendorf tubes were maintained at −20°C until just prior to sorting. Cell samples were filtered through a 40 µm strainer before sorting. The flow rate was minimized to reduce shear stress. Just before sorting, the Eppendorf tubes were opened using a clean microfuge tube opener (USA Scientific) to avoid contamination. After sorting, the tubes were sealed, vortexed, and centrifuged briefly to collect all the liquid in the bottom of the tube, and placed on dry ice. Metabolites were extracted by vortexing again for 1 min at high speed, followed by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to auto-sampler vials with low volume inserts and analyzed immediately by LC-MS (see details below).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry</title><p>Liquid chromatography was performed with a Vanquish Flex UHPLC (Thermo Scientific). The reverse phase method used a Waters HSS C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 μm) with a binary solvent gradient. Mobile phase A was water with 0.1% formic acid and mobile phase B was acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. Gradient separation proceeded as follows: from 0 to 5 min, 0% B; from 5 min to 45 min mobile phase B was ramped linearly from 0% to 100%; from 45 min to 52 min, mobile phase B was held at 100%; from 52 to 52.1 min, mobile phase B was ramped linearly to 0%; from 52.1 to 60 min, mobile phase B was held at 0%. Throughout the course of the method, the solvent flow rate was kept to 100 μl/min and column temperature was held at 30°C.</p><p>The HILIC method used a Millipore Sigma ZIC-pHILIC column (2.1 × 150, 5 μm) with a binary solvent gradient. Mobile phase A was water containing 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 9.8 with ammonium hydroxide; mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile. Gradient separation proceeded as follows: from 0 to 15 min mobile phase B was ramped linearly from 90% to 30%; from 15 min to 18 min, mobile phase B was held at 30%; from 18 min to 19 min, mobile phase B was ramped linearly from 30% to 90%; mobile phase B was held at 90% from 19 min to 27 min to regenerate the initial chromatographic environment. Throughout the method, solvent flow rate was kept at 250 μl/min and the column temperature was maintained at 25°C. For low abundance samples, 20 μl of sample was injected onto the column. For high abundance samples, 10 μl was injected.</p><p>All mass spectrometry data were acquired using a Thermo Scientific (Bremen, Germany) QExactive HF-X mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). For low abundance samples, polarity-switching MS1 only acquisition was used. Each polarity was acquired at a resolving power of 120,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM); the automatic gain control (AGC) target was set to 1,000,000 with a maximum inject time of 50 ms. The scan range was set to 80–1200 Daltons. High-abundance samples analyzed for library construction were acquired with two separate ddMS2 methods – one for positive mode and another for negative mode. Precursor MS1 data for this method were acquired with the exact same settings as those described above. Product ion MS data were acquired with a resolving power of 15,000 FWHM; the AGC target was set to 200,000, with a maximum inject time of 150 ms. A top-10 data dependent MS scheme was used with an isolation window of 1 Da and an isolation offset of 0.5 Da. Analytes were fragmented with stepped collision energies of 30, 50, and 70 normalized collision energy (NCE) units. The minimum AGC target was 8000 with a dynamic exclusion of 30 s.</p><p>Instrument performance was evaluated before each experiment by analyzing a quality control sample, 20 µl of freshly obtained rat serum. We compared peak areas of individual metabolites and the total number of metabolites detected in the control sample with control samples run in prior experiments. If the peak area values and total metabolite identifications fell outside of 1 standard deviation from the historical average, the instrument was cleaned to re-optimize sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Metabolite library development</title><p>To develop the metabolite library we used to analyze samples, we acquired LC-MS/MS data from high abundance samples using a data dependent MS/MS method. Metabolites were identified in an unbiased fashion using Compound Discoverer 3.0 (ThermoScientific). Metabolites were added to the initial library only if they met the following criteria. First, chromatographic peaks had to align in all samples, and peak intensity had to increase with cell number. Second, precursor mass accuracy had to be within 5 ppm of theoretical mass, with an naturally occurring isotope pattern that matched that predicted by the chemical formula. Third, the MS/MS product ion spectra had to either match an annotated database (mzCloud, Human Metabolome Data Base, Lipid Maps, and ChemSpider) or had to be confirmed by analysis of chemical standards. This process yielded a 590 metabolite library with known masses and chromatographic retention times. This library was imported into the manual peak review software Trace Finder 4.1 (ThermoScientific) for manual peak integration of all low abundance LC-MS data. To narrow this list of 590 metabolites to the metabolites that might be detected in 10,000 sorted cells, we determined which of the 590 metabolites were observed in 100,000 WBM cells. We found 289 metabolites that were detected in 100,000 WBM cells. This 289 metabolite library was used for manual analyses of LC-MS data from low abundance samples. When additional metabolites were observed in new experiments they were added to the library.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Melanoma specimens</title><p>Melanoma specimens were obtained with informed consent from all patients according to protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan Medical School (IRBMED approvals HUM00050754 and HUM00050085 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quintana et al., 2012</xref>) and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (IRB approval 102010–051).

For all experiments, mice were kept on normal chow and fed ad libitum. The mice used in all experiments were 8–12-week-old C57BL/Ka mice, with the exception of melanoma studies, which were subcutaneously xenografted into 4–8-week-old NOD.CB17-<italic>Prkdc<sup>scid</sup> Il2rg<sup>tm1Wjl</sup></italic>/SzJ (NSG) mice. Both male and female mice were used. For melanoma experiments, the maximum permitted tumor diameter was 2.5 cm. Subcutaneous tumor diameters were measured weekly with calipers until any tumor in the mouse cohort reached 2.5 cm in its largest diameter. At that point, all mice in the cohort were killed, per approved protocol, for analysis of subcutaneous tumors and circulating melanoma cells. For each replicate, subcutaneous tumors and circulating melanoma cells were pooled from 6 to 10 mice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Methotrexate treatment</title><p>Eight- to twelve-week old C57BL/Ka mice were intraperitoneally injected daily with methotrexate (1.25 mg/kg/day) or DMSO control, for 3 days.

The data were visualized using multiple methods, including violin-box plots, histograms, clustered heatmaps, principle component analysis, and correlation plots to assess data quality and identify batch effects. To assess the statistical significance of differences in metabolite levels between samples we used R’s generalized linear models (GLM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobson and Barnett, 2018</xref>) function with the Gaussian distribution on log-transformed data. To compare metabolite levels in cell samples to sheath fluid samples we used GLM with log<sub>2</sub>(x+1)-transformed, non-normalized data. Metabolites with fold change &gt;2 and FDR &lt; 0.05 were considered above background. To assess the statistical significance of differences in metabolite levels between two types of cells, we normalized the cell samples using the relative log expression (RLE) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anders and Huber, 2010</xref>), and log<sub>2</sub>-transformed the normalized data. For all comparisons between samples, we used the half-minimum imputation to replace zero values with half of the minimum nonzero value for each metabolite, and used R’s GLM method. To adjust for multiple comparisons we used the FDR method. For comparisons between different cell samples, we used fold change &gt;2 and FDR &lt; 0.05 as cutoffs for statistical significance. When samples (such as HSCs and WBM cells) were from the same mice we used pairing as an independent variable in the GLM. When batch effects were observed, we used batch as an independent variable in the GLM. R packages used by this tool include stats, openxlsx, data.table, gtools, matrixStats, cplm, ggplot2, cowplot, pheatmap, ggcorrplot, eulerr, and GGally.</p><p>The metabolomics data analysis tool can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.biohpc.swmed.edu/CRI/ODA">https://git.biohpc.swmed.edu/CRI/ODA</ext-link> for academic use. This tool includes an ODA.R script file, an accompanying Excel data template file, and example analyses. The script can be run from Linux/MacIntosh Terminal or Windows PowerShell using the Rscript command followed by the Excel input file name and the Excel output file name. R with the Rscript command (version 3.5.1 or later is recommended) and internet access are required to run this tool as other R packages must be auto-downloaded by the tool.

Prior to analyzing the statistical significance of differences among treatments, we tested whether the data were normally distributed and whether variance was similar among treatments. To test for normal distribution, we performed the Shapiro–Wilk test when 3 ≤ n &lt; 20 or the D'Agostino Omnibus test when n ≥ 20. To test if variability significantly differed among treatments, we performed <italic>F</italic>-tests (for experiments with two treatments) or Levene’s median tests (for more than two treatments). When the data significantly deviated from normality or variability significantly differed among treatments, we log2-transformed the data and tested again for normality and variability. If the transformed data did not significantly deviate from normality and equal variability, we performed parametric tests on the transformed data. Fold change data were always log2-transformed.</p><p>All the statistical tests we used were two-sided, where applicable. To assess the statistical significance of a difference between two treatments, we used Student’s t-tests or paired t-tests (when a parametric test was appropriate). To assess the statistical significance of differences between two cumulative frequency distributions, we used the Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. Multiple Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were followed by Holm–Sidak’s multiple comparisons adjustment. To assess the statistical significance of differences between more than two treatments, we used paired sample one-way or two-way ANOVAs (when a parametric test was appropriate) followed by Tukey’s, Dunnet’s, or Sidak’s multiple comparisons adjustment. To assess the statistical significance of differences between transplant data, we used mixed-effects analysis (when a parametric test was appropriate and there were missing data points) followed by Sidak’s multiple comparisons adjustment. To assess the correlation between two sets of samples, we calculated Spearman correlation coefficients (r, the data were not normally distributed) and performed linear regression analysis.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism 8.3. All data represent mean ± standard deviation. Samples sizes were not pre-determined based on statistical power calculations but were based on our experience with these assays. No data were excluded; however, mice sometimes died during experiments, presumably due to complications associated with irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. In those instances, data that had already been collected on the mice in interim analyses were included (such as donor contribution to peripheral blood chimerism over time).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>SJM is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator, the Mary McDermott Cook Chair in Pediatric Genetics, the Kathryn and Gene Bishop Distinguished Chair in Pediatric Research, the director of the Hamon Laboratory for Stem Cells and Cancer, and a Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas Scholar.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thales Papagiannakopoulos (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>In this paper the authors report methods to measure metabolites in a small numbers of cell. This work has broad applications for metabolite analysis in rare cell populations and will be a good resource for the field.</p><p>Overall, the three reviewers found the work to be of interest and well done, but felt some additional controls and/or discussion be included prior to publication. We are providing a summary of the 6 points below we feel need to be fully addressed. In addition, please address the technical concerns raised by reviewer #2 (below). We are also providing the other full reviewer #1/#3 comments for your reference, which are not required for publication but if you have any additional text comments or data those would be welcome.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide more details on how the sorting versus pipetting control was performed, and specify which metabolites were most sensitive to sorting.</p><p>2) A comparison of sorted and un-sorted cells (a rapidly quenched sample) would be useful to include, again with those metabolites that are most sensitive to sorting specified.

They also use methods to measure metabolite changes after sorting, and use these methods to measure metabolite changes after methotrexate treatment or between subcutaneous melanoma cells and circulating tumor cells. The work is well done and should be a valuable resource for field, although potential caveats to consider when applying the method could be better discussed to help guide its use by other groups.</p><p>1) It is important that the authors tested variables like extraction solvent and drying techniques in their system, although it would be appropriate to also cite the published literature describing which metabolite classes are enriched in different extraction solvents and the effects of different drying methods.</p><p>2) In Figure 1H-J, the authors investigate metabolite changes from sorting and found that most metabolite differences between unsorted cells were also found from comparing sorted cells. They conclude that sorting does not affect detection of most metabolite differences, however there was still some effect of sorting, particularly for the AML cells, as shown by PCA in Figure 1H. It could be helpful to more explicitly state which metabolites are sensitive to sorting.</p><p>3) It is surprising that most metabolite levels do not over time with cell isolation, although it is worth pointing out that the comparison is to a time point 5 minutes after harvesting. Some might argue that a comparison to a rapidly quenched sample is needed too, although practical considerations may make this difficult for the cell types considered in the study. Nevertheless, some discussion of this point could be helpful as some in the field argue it is necessary to go to great lengths to quench metabolism for assessment of some rapidly changing processes.</p><p>4) The metabolites that change from Figure 1—figure supplement 1 appear to be largely nucleotide or lipid related metabolites. Did amino acids and glucose-derived metabolites such as pyruvate and lactate also change over this time course? It might be expected that levels of some would change as levels are known to be sensitive to exchange with the media and cells were maintained in HBSS after being flushed from bone marrow. Since HBSS contains glucose, this buffer may help stabilized some metabolite levels over the conditions compared, but what is included in this buffer may also influence what is measured and is stable over time. Thus, what solution cells are isolated in is thus another variable that could be considered when applying this technique.</p><p>5) Another point to consider is that the cutoff used for counting a metabolite level as enriched or depleted in Figure 1 is a fold change of 2 or greater. However, in some cases a &lt;2 fold change in metabolite levels may be significant depending on the question considered as another issue to consider when applying this method.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The majority of metabolomic measurements are carried out on bulk populations of cells that do not reflect the heterogeneity of biological tissues. The Morrison lab previously published methods for isolating metabolites from abundant sorted cells (Agathocleous et al., 2017). Here, the authors use HILIC chromatography and a high resolution Orbitrap MS to detect a larger number of metabolites in smaller numbers of cells. The authors isolate HSCs and circulating melanoma cells using their method, and demonstrate that expected metabolites such as AICAR increase in HSCs following methotrexate treatment.</p><p>The method will be useful and of interest to the general community if the authors can address the following technical queries:</p><p>1) The sheath fluid, 0.5x PBS, is hypotonic. The authors should comment on the effects of hypoosmotic stress on these cells and ideally provide EM or dye exclusion (e.g. π or trypan blue) data to verify the integrity of cells incubated in 0.5% PBS for the duration of the sort.</p><p>2) The authors verified the identities of their metabolites with chemical standards. To the best of this reviewer's understanding, though, the differences in metabolites are based on changes in counts. There were no standard curves run with a concentration range of these small molecules to demonstrate that these counts were within the dynamic range of the instrument. I also could not determine if LC-MS performance was assessed with internal standards included in the extraction buffer. Please correct me if I am wrong on both of these.</p><p>If there are no internal standards, then the authors should include, at a minimum, a set of isotopically labeled internal standards or an unnatural amino acid such as norvaline in the extraction solvent to which all counts should be normalized to account for changes in instrument performance. Standard curves should also be run for the metabolites that change to verify that the changes in metabolite abundance are within the dynamic range of the MS detector and that the counts are neither too low nor saturating.</p><p>3) Along the same lines, the non-polar metabolites that elute at the beginning of a HILIC run often partition poorly onto the column. The authors should confirm that these metabolites, or at least a subset (given that there are many lipid species) have good peak shapes and widths indicative of chromatographic resolution of these metabolites (at least 5 points on either side of the peak; see Kadjo et al., Anal. Chem. 2017, 89, 3884−3892) and provide standard curves for at least the classes of these metabolites to show that changes in standard concentrations of these small molecules are reflected in the peaks and counts that they see.</p><p>4) In Figure 1I, the authors compare sorted and AML and ALL cell metabolite abundances and find that most of the metabolites that differed between the cell lines also differed between when the same cell line was sorted or pipetted. These data are very important as they are critical to the utility of the method. The authors use a cutoff &gt;2-fold change with an FDR of &lt;0.01 as a cutoff for significant differences, but a 2-fold change in many metabolites, including NADPH (which is one of the metabolites that changes significantly) is quite important. Could the authors provide the counts and fold changes for all detected metabolites in pipetted and sorted cells, and also describe how many metabolites are significantly changed if the cutoffs are less stringent (for example, 1.5-fold with an FDR of 0.05)? This will give the community a good idea of the metabolites that are stable following sorting.</p><p>5) In Figures 1O and P, the abundances of many of the metabolites, including aspartate and malate, are in the 1E8-1E9 range, which are very high for an Orbitrap, particularly for 10000 cells. This may be due to the Orbitrap AGC settings (1E6 target ion counts; max inject time of 50 ms). Could the authors include details on how they optimized their AGC settings and how often this target count is reached?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>DeVilbiss et al. describe an improved method to analyze metabolites of rare cell populations in vivo. The authors adjusted their previously described techniques to increase the overall number of metabolites detected and to reduce contaminants from sample prep.</p><p>The technique described in this manuscript enables the authors to reliably detect 160 metabolites, more than 2.5X the number of metabolites using previous method, from a population of 10,000 sorted cells. The method is robust with the majority of metabolites showing strong correlation between sorted and unsorted samples and only a minority of metabolites differing significantly over time periods necessary for sample prep and processing. Overall this manuscript describes a valuable new method to interrogate metabolic changes in rare cell populations in vivo that will further the field.</p><p>With a few revisions this manuscript is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) How was the minimum number of cells necessary determined (10,000)? What is the minimum number of cells necessary to identify a similar number of metabolites reliably? While this represents a significant improvement to previous methods, pooling of material would still be required in certain contexts. To acquire 10,000 circulating melanoma cells for analysis in Figure 3, the authors pooled 6-10 mice for analysis.</p><p>2) Are certain metabolites/classes of metabolites more robust during the sorting process? Please provide a table related to Figure 1I listing the metabolites that significantly differed between sorting vs. pipetting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61980.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide more details on how the sorting versus pipetting control was performed, and specify which metabolites were most sensitive to sorting.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Materials and methods section to include a more detailed description of how this experiment was performed. Non-adherent cultures of AML or ALL cells were removed from the incubator and centrifuged at 4°C to pellet the cells, then the cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS and centrifuged again to wash, before being resuspended in ice cold PBS at a density of 1x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. 10 µl of this AML or ALL cell suspension was then pipetted into 40 µl of 100% acetonitrile to create a final extract of 10,000 cells in 50 µl 80% acetonitrile. This was all done in less than 10 minutes after removing the cells from the incubator. In the other arm of the experiment, 10,000 AML or ALL cells from the same cell suspensions were sorted into 40 µl of 100% acetonitrile by flow cytometry to extract metabolites from 10,000 cells in 50 µl of 80% acetonitrile. Sorting of these samples was completed within 30 to 60 minutes after removing the cultures from the incubator. The cell suspensions were always kept ice cold before and during sorting. As detailed in points 2 and 3 below, we have added source data files to the revised manuscript listing which metabolites differed between sorted and unsorted samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A comparison of sorted and un-sorted cells (a rapidly quenched sample) would be useful to include, again with those metabolites that are most sensitive to sorting specified.

The unsorted cells were quenched in acetonitrile less than 10 minutes after removal from the incubator, whereas the sorted cells were quenched in 30-60 minutes. In pipetted samples, we detected 97 metabolites that significantly differed between AML and ALL cells (fold change &gt; 2.0 and FDR &lt; 0.05) (Figure 1I). In sorted samples, we detected 85 metabolites that significantly differed between AML and ALL cells. Of these, 71 significantly differed among AML and ALL cells in both sorted and pipetted samples. Figure 1—source data 3 lists all of the metabolites that significantly differed between sorted and pipetted AML cells. Figure 1—source data 4 lists all of the metabolites that significantly differed between sorted and pipetted ALL cells. Figure 1—source data 5 lists all of the metabolites that significantly differed between AML and ALL cells in both sorted and pipetted samples, or only in the sorted samples, or only in the pipetted samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Consider providing a table listing the metabolites that significantly differed in sorted populations relative to various controls</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided 6 source data files (5 of them new) listing metabolites that differed among various conditions.</p><p>– Related to Figure 1F, we list the metabolites that significantly differed among cells sorted with 1x PBS sheath fluid versus 0.5x PBS sheath fluid (new Figure 1—source data 2)</p><p>– Related to Figure 1H, we list the metabolites that significantly differed between sorted and pipetted AML cells (new Figure 1—source data 3) and between sorted and pipetted ALL cells (new Figure 1—source data 4)</p><p>– Related to Figure 1I, we list the metabolites that significantly differed between AML and ALL cells in sorted and pipetted samples, only in the sorted samples, and only in the pipetted samples (new Figure 1—source data 5)</p><p>– Related to Figures 1L-P, we list the metabolites that differed between cells that were incubated on ice for increasing amounts of time (Figure 1—source data 6).</p><p>– We provided new data identifying the metabolites that significantly differed between whole bone marrow cells suspended in HBSS versus PBS (Figure 1—source data 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please specify how the minimum number of cells needed for analysis was determined?</p></disp-quote><p>It’s not that there is a minimum number of cells for analysis, it’s just that the number of metabolites detected declines as cell number declines. So we try to analyze as many cells as can readily be isolated by flow cytometry. For rare cell populations, such as HSCs (0.007% of whole bone marrow cells) it is difficult to routinely isolate more than 10,000 cells in a single experiment. Consequently, we performed many of our control experiments to evaluate the quality of the metabolomic data using 10,000 sorted cells. We compared the numbers of metabolites detected above background in aliquots of 10,000 to 100,000 cells in Figure 1G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please discuss whether factors such as hypo-osmolarity or addition of glucose to the sorting buffer may affect metabolite measurements, and if any data are available to address how this affects adding it may be useful for the field..</p></disp-quote><p>The 0.5x PBS sheath fluid is not likely to cause hypotonic stress during sorting because the cells were suspended in 1x HBSS and there is laminar flow within the cytometer such that there is limited mixing of the sample buffer and the sheath fluid.

Using 0.5x PBS we detected 157±2 metabolites above background and using 1x PBS we detected 149±8 metabolites above background. 18 metabolites significantly differed between samples sorted with 0.5x versus 1x PBS sheath fluid (see new Figure 1—source data 2). Apart from potential effects of hypo-osmolarity, these differences also reflect differences in ion suppression or metabolite extraction efficiency as a result of the differences in salt concentrations in the extraction buffer. We have updated the text related to Figure 1F to reflect these new data.</p><p>To assess the effect of glucose in the sample buffer, we compared the metabolomic profiles of 10,000 bone marrow cells sorted from samples suspended in either HBSS (which contains glucose) or PBS (which does not). When cells were suspended in HBSS we detected 162 metabolites above background and when suspended in PBS we detected 150 metabolites above background. Only 5 metabolites significantly differed between the HBSS versus PBS samples (Figure 1—source data 7). As expected, glucose levels were substantially higher in the cells that had been suspended in HBSS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please clarify if internal standards were used to quantify metabolites, and address any other technical questions and concerns revised by reviewer #2.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolute metabolite concentrations can be measured using isotopically-labeled internal standards in methods designed to quantitate small numbers of metabolites but this is impractical with metabolomics methods designed to measure hundreds of different metabolites.

We routinely follow-up metabolomics analyses with other methods optimized to extract and quantitate particular species.

We included data in the revised manuscript showing the standard curves for each of these lipid classes including phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (Lyso-PE), and lysophosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E-H). All regression analyses were highly linear (R<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.95) and lipids from these classes extracted from 10,000 bone marrow cells fell within the linear range.</p><p>Other questions from each of the reviewers are addressed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors described mass spectrometry methods for measuring metabolites in small numbers of cells. They also use methods to measure metabolite changes after sorting, and use these methods to measure metabolite changes after methotrexate treatment or between subcutaneous melanoma cells and circulating tumor cells. The work is well done and should be a valuable resource for field, although potential caveats to consider when applying the method could be better discussed to help guide its use by other groups.</p><p>1) It is important that the authors tested variables like extraction solvent and drying techniques in their system, although it would be appropriate to also cite the published literature describing which metabolite classes are enriched in different extraction solvents and the effects of different drying methods.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we cited a study that found that acetonitrile-based extraction is superior to methanol extraction for certain classes of metabolites (Analytical Chemistry 79:6167) and a study that showed that drying accelerates the decomposition of some metabolites (Nature 510:298). We have addressed this issue in more depth in the revised manuscript by adding a new paragraph to the Discussion that cites additional papers that address the advantages and disadvantages of different extraction solvents and drying methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1H-J, the authors investigate metabolite changes from sorting and found that most metabolite differences between unsorted cells were also found from comparing sorted cells. They conclude that sorting does not affect detection of most metabolite differences, however there was still some effect of sorting, particularly for the AML cells, as shown by PCA in Figure 1H. It could be helpful to more explicitly state which metabolites are sensitive to sorting.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added files listing the metabolites that significantly differed between sorted AML cells versus pipetted AML cells (Figure 1—source data 3), and sorted ALL cells versus pipetted ALL cells (Figure 1—source data 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is surprising that most metabolite levels do not over time with cell isolation, although it is worth pointing out that the comparison is to a time point 5 minutes after harvesting. Some might argue that a comparison to a rapidly quenched sample is needed too, although practical considerations may make this difficult for the cell types considered in the study. Nevertheless, some discussion of this point could be helpful as some in the field argue it is necessary to go to great lengths to quench metabolism for assessment of some rapidly changing processes.</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult to address this issue in the context of our study because 5 minutes is already very fast for getting bone marrow cells out of a mouse. Even getting cells growing in suspension out of a culture dish, and centrifuging to eliminate the culture medium would take a few minutes. Therefore, in the context of a protocol that involves the isolation of cells by flow cytometry it is hard to test the idea that some metabolites may change in less than a minute after cells leave their normal physiological environment. Nonetheless, as noted by the reviewer this issue has previously been addressed by other studies that did not examine sorted cells (Annu Rev Biochem. 20:277). We have cited this review in the Discussion of our paper and noted that some metabolites may change in less than a minute after leaving their normal physiological environment in a way that would not have been detected in our experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The metabolites that change from Figure 1—figure supplement 1 appear to be largely nucleotide or lipid related metabolites. Did amino acids and glucose-derived metabolites such as pyruvate and lactate also change over this time course? It might be expected that levels of some would change as levels are known to be sensitive to exchange with the media and cells were maintained in HBSS after being flushed from bone marrow.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1 is now Figure 1—source data 6 in the revised manuscript. We did not observe changes in amino acid levels over time in cell suspensions that incubated on ice and we did not detect pyruvate in any of these samples so do not know whether it changed. Lactate did not significantly change at most time points, including after 4 hours of incubation, but was significantly reduced at 3 hours as compared to 5 minutes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since HBSS contains glucose, this buffer may help stabilized some metabolite levels over the conditions compared, but what is included in this buffer may also influence what is measured and is stable over time. Thus, what solution cells are isolated in is thus another variable that could be considered when applying this technique.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the metabolic profiles of 10,000 bone marrow cells sorted from samples suspended in either HBSS or PBS.

However, in some cases a &lt;2 fold change in metabolite levels may be significant depending on the question considered as another issue to consider when applying this method.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that any fold change cutoff is arbitrary and that there are advantages and disadvantages to raising or lowering it. It is true that some changes less than 2-fold could be biologically important. On the other hand, changes less than 2-fold are less likely to be confirmed in follow up experiments and we wanted to use a reasonably robust threshold when determining the number of metabolites detected above background. To balance these considerations, and in an effort to use common thresholds throughout the paper, we have consistently identified metabolites that differed among samples based on fold change &gt; 2 and FDR &lt; 0.05. To address the concern that some metabolites with fold change &lt; 2 might be biologically significant we have added additional lists of metabolites to Figure 1—source data 2-7 that show metabolites that were fold change = 1.5 to 2.0 and FDR &lt; 0.05.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The method will be useful and of interest to the general community if the authors can address the following technical queries:</p><p>1) The sheath fluid, 0.5x PBS, is hypotonic.

The authors should confirm that these metabolites, or at least a subset (given that there are many lipid species) have good peak shapes and widths indicative of chromatographic resolution of these metabolites (at least 5 points on either side of the peak; see Kadjo et al., Anal. Chem. 2017, 89, 3884−3892) and provide standard curves for at least the classes of these metabolites to show that changes in standard concentrations of these small molecules are reflected in the peaks and counts that they see.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this we added graphs of chromatographic peaks of four lipid species that we detected in extracts of 10,000 bone marrow cells, representing the major lipid classes including a PC, a PE, a Lyso-PC, and a Lyso-PE (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-D).

These data are very important as they are critical to the utility of the method. The authors use a cutoff &gt;2-fold change with an FDR of &lt;0.01 as a cutoff for significant differences, but a 2-fold change in many metabolites, including NADPH (which is one of the metabolites that changes significantly) is quite important. Could the authors provide the counts and fold changes for all detected metabolites in pipetted and sorted cells, and also describe how many metabolites are significantly changed if the cutoffs are less stringent (for example, 1.5-fold with an FDR of 0.05)? This will give the community a good idea of the metabolites that are stable following sorting.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that any fold change cutoff is arbitrary and that there are advantages and disadvantages to raising or lowering it.

These parameters were also used in our prior studies (Nature 577:115, Nature 585:113).
