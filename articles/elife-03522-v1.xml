How cells detect the accumulation of misfolded proteins remains unclear. In this study, we identify a noncanonical interaction between the ATPase domain of the ER chaperone BiP and the luminal domains of the UPR sensors Ire1 and Perk that dissociates when authentic ER unfolded protein C<sub>H</sub>1 binds to the canonical substrate binding domain of BiP. Unlike the interaction between chaperone and substrates, we found that the interaction between BiP and UPR sensors was unaffected by nucleotides. Thus, we discover that BiP is dual functional UPR sensor, sensing unfolded proteins by canonical binding to substrates and transducing this event to noncanonical, signaling interaction to Ire1 and Perk. Our observations implicate BiP as the key component for detecting ER stress and suggest an allosteric mechanism for UPR induction.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03522.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03522.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03522.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform many essential tasks in cells, but to be able to work they first have to correctly fold into a specific three-dimensional shape. Within the cell, many proteins are folded with the help of ‘chaperone’ proteins. If any proteins fold incorrectly, the normal workings of the cell can be disturbed, which may damage the cell. This is more likely to happen if a cell suddenly requires a large number of proteins to be made, which can overwhelm the chaperone proteins.</p><p>In humans and other eukaryotic organisms, many proteins are folded in a compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum. Inside this compartment there is a system called the unfolded protein response that detects misfolded proteins and boosts the cell's capacity to re-fold them. As part of this system, two sensor proteins detect when misfolded proteins are present, but it is not clear how they do so. It has been suggested that a chaperone protein called BiP may be able to activate these sensor proteins in order to turn on the unfolded protein response.</p><p>In this study, Carrara et al. studied the sensor proteins and BiP using an artificial set-up in the laboratory. The experiments show that both of the sensor proteins can bind to a section of the BiP chaperone called the ATPase domain. However, in the presence of an unfolded protein, BiP stopped interacting with the sensor proteins, which could allow the sensor proteins to activate the unfolded protein response. The experiments also show that BiP must bind to the unfolded protein to activate the unfolded protein response.</p><p>Carrara et al.'s findings suggest that BiP has a dual role in cells: to sense unfolded proteins by binding to them, and then to activate the sensor proteins that trigger the unfolded protein response.</p><p>Together, these results suggest a new model for how cells detect and respond to misfolded proteins within the endoplasmic reticulum, and may provide new targets for therapies to treat diseases caused by defects in protein folding.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03522.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03522.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>UPR</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd><kwd>Ire1</kwd><kwd>perk</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C33269/A11161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>Maruf MU</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council (MRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/L007436/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>Maruf MU</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The chaperone protein BiP forms complexes with Ire1 and Perk that dissociate when unfolded proteins bind to BiP to activate the unfolded protein response in the ER.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an essential eukaryotic organelle responsible for a number of processes including folding and maturation of secretory proteins destined for the extracellular space. The sudden requirement for processing large quantities of secretory proteins can be immense and results in over burdening the folding machinery within the ER, leading to accumulation of misfolded proteins and ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</xref>). The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cell signaling system that detects the presence of misfolded proteins within the ER and carries out a varied cellular response to maintain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Malhotra and Kaufman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hetz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang and Kaufman, 2012</xref>).

Early studies within the field provide evidence for the role of BiP (ER Hsp70 chaperone) in UPR activation by binding to the luminal domains and maintaining them in an inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>).

By primarily using biophysical/biochemical techniques, we discover a direct noncanonical interaction between the ATPase domain of BiP to the luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk, clearly indicating a UPR signaling role. This interaction is unaffected by nucleotide binding to BiP. We further show that unfolded protein C<sub>H</sub>1 binds to the canonical BiP substrate binding domain; this relieves the interaction between BiP and luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk. Moreover, our data indicate that this model is consistent in cells. Overall, our observations suggest a novel allosteric model for UPR induction that involves BiP as the key component for detecting ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Noncanonical binding of Ire1 and Perk luminal domains to BiP ATPase domain</title><p>We initially expressed and purified full-length human Ire1 and Perk luminal domains along with full-length BiP encompassing both the ATPase domain and the substrate binding domains. To assess the role of BiP in UPR sensing, we first examined whether there was an interaction between the luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk to full-length BiP. Using microscale thermophoresis, we found that both Ire1 and Perk luminal domains bound to BiP with binding affinities of K<sub>d</sub> = 1.33 μM and 1.92 μM, respectively, consistent with a typical transient protein–protein interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). To dissect the molecular basis of the interaction between Ire1 and Perk with BiP, we tested if this interaction was mediated by the canonical substrate binding domain, as it is the case for this chaperone, or the ATPase domain. Both BiP's ATPase and substrate binding domains were expressed and purified separately and assessed for their ability to bind to Ire1 and Perk luminal domains. Analysis of binding by thermophoresis revealed that in contrast to full-length BiP, we measured no binding between luminal domains and BiP's substrate binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Surprisingly, we discovered that BiP's ATPase domain bound to both Ire1 and Perk luminal domains with binding affinities of K<sub>d</sub> = 1.97 μM and 2.05 μM, which were almost identical to full-length BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). These results reveal that BiP binding to the luminal domains of Ire1 or Perk does not involve BiP's substrate binding domain. Rather, the interaction between BiP with Ire1 and Perk luminal domains is entirely mediated by BiP's ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Such an interaction with BiP ATPase domain is novel, and suggests that the BiPATPase domain interaction with Ire1 or Perk is distinct from the classical chaperone-substrate interaction, and may serve some key signaling functions that we set out to elucidate. To confirm that the noncanonical interactions detected by microscale thermophoresis were robust, we developed an independent assay. Pull down assays with purified proteins recapitulated our previous results: His<sub>6</sub>-tagged full-length BiP and BiP ATPase domain proteins were able to form an interaction with luminal domain of Ire1 and Perk, while His<sub>6</sub>-tagged BiP substrate binding domain did not bind to Ire1 and Perk luminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, we have here recapitulated the interaction between full-length BiP and Ire1 and Perk luminal domains. Moreover, we confirm that Ire1 and Perk luminal domains bind to BiP's ATPase domain.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03522.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Noncanonical binding of BiP ATPase domain to Ire1 and Perk.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Microscale thermophoresis (MST) analysis showing sigmoidal binding curves for interaction between full-length BiP and the complete luminal domains (region I–V) of (<bold>A</bold>) Ire1 luminal domain (K<sub>d</sub> = 1.33 μM) and (<bold>B</bold>) Perk luminal domain (K<sub>d</sub> = 1.92 μM).

To further characterize the novel interaction between BiP, Ire1, and Perk, we next assessed if the formation of the complex between BiP ATPase domain and the UPR luminal domain was affected by the presence of nucleotides. Using thermophoresis, we measured the binding of full-length BiP to luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk in the presence of 10 mM ATP, ADP, AMPPNP, and also in the absence of nucleotide. We observed the affinity of interaction was very similar both in the presence of the various nucleotides, and when nucleotide was absent. Therefore, the addition of ATP, AMPPNP, and ADP had no effect upon the formation of the full-length BiP-Perk and full-length BiP-Ire1 luminal domain complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

We designed a range of constructs based upon this classification in order to determine more precisely the interaction site between Ire1 and Perk luminal domains with BiP's ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). One point to note, is that using this assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kimata et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2007</xref>) yeast Ire1 luminal domain possesses an extended region I, whilst the equivalent region in human Ire1 is essentially absent. The implication for human Ire1 is that both regions I and II are very close together and map onto the equivalent of yeast region II. Next, we measured the binding affinities for BiP's ATPase domain interacting with human Ire1 and Perk luminal domains comprising of various regions between I and V. We found that binding affinities for region II–IV were essentially the same as those measured for binding to the full-length luminal domain construct region I–V, indicating the core interaction between UPR luminal domains and BiP maps to the luminal domain region II–IV and ATPase domain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). To reinforce the in vitro data, we assessed whether the interaction between Ire1 luminal domain regions II–IV and BiP occurs in cells. Principally, we conducted a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using an Ire1 region V deletion mutant (Ire1ΔV; Δ390–430) with a BiP construct possessing an N-terminal HA-tag, in the absence and presence of ER stress, and then compared with full-length Ire1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the absence of ER stress, immunoblotting with Ire1-specific antibody clearly indicates the presence of bands that are consistent for both Ire1 ΔV mutant and full-length protein co-immunoprecipitating with BiP. Upon ER stress, both Ire1 ΔV mutant and full-length Ire1 protein display a reduced level of interaction with BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We also assessed direct binding with BiP ATPase domain to both Ire1 full-length and ΔV mutant—observing an interaction consistent with in vitro data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results suggest that BiP interacts with Ire1 region II–IV in cells and that region V is dispensable for this interaction to occur, reinforcing the previous in vitro analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Ire1 luminal domain region II–IV has been suggested to be important for stress sensing in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Credle et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we identified region II–IV as the binding site for human BiP-luminal domain protein interaction.

It is highly likely that some sort of oligomerisation event occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>), preceding from a dimer state, which makes signal propagation more efficient, although exactly how this happens is not clearly understood. To understand luminal domain oligomerisation and how BiP affects this process, if at all; we analyzed the effects of cross linking upon Ire1 luminal domain protein in the absence and presence of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged BiP ATPase domain protein. The BiP ATPase domain interacts directly with Ire1 luminal domain, but perhaps more importantly—for clarity of results—it exists as a monomer both in absence and presence of cross linker. Thus, making the identification of the Ire1-BiP multimer bands an easier task. Upon addition of cross linker, Ire1 luminal domain forms two distinct species: a dimer and tetramer state. When we added BiP ATPase in a 1:1 ratio with Ire1 luminal domain protein, and then subjected the mixture to cross linking, we see a reduction in size of the tetramer band; concomitantly, there appears a band that corresponds to a trimer in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Immunoblotting against His<sub>6</sub> peptide reveals that the dimer band in the 1:1 mixture sample contains BiP ATPase; similarly, the trimer band also contains BiP ATPase. The tetramer band is exclusively made up of Ire1 luminal domain protein, and consequently does not show up when immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The data suggest that Ire1 luminal domain dimer and tetramer formation is being impeded by BiP, which binds in a 1:1 hetero dimer and 2:1 hetero trimer interaction, with Ire1. The caveat here is that since full-length BiP may also form dimers, we cannot rule out a 2:2 association between BiP and Ire1. Nonetheless, the data do suggest that BiP may act to impede Ire1 luminal domain dimer and tetramer formation.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03522.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>BiP impedes Ire1 LD dimer and tetramer formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ire1 luminal domain (LD; regions II–IV) and His<sub>6</sub>-tagged BiP ATPase domain proteins, both individually and in 1:1 molar ratio mixture, were visualized as control lanes on a 4–12% Bis-Tris SDS-PAGE gel.

An early BiP dependent model describes the central role of BiP in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ma et al., 2002</xref>). In this model, the interaction between luminal domains and BiP represses UPR signaling. Upon ER stress, BiP releases from the sensors, Ire1 and Perk, leading to activation. Experimental evidence for this comes from a series of studies that show an interaction between BiP and Ire1 in unstressed cells that dissociate in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>). However, there have been a number of issues with this model. It was originally thought that this interaction was regulated by nucleotide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>); thereby, suggesting a chaperone substrate type interaction—a non-productive association for UPR signaling—thus complicating analysis. But perhaps more significantly, the model failed to delineate a precise mechanism of BiP release upon accumulation of misfolded proteins, leading to the idea that BiP is competitively titred from luminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>): a notion that has some weakness, not least because UPR is sensitive in response to ER stress.</p><p>The present study clarifies this interaction by indicating that it occurs solely via the ATPase domain of BiP, and is unaffected by nucleotides, clearly suggesting a UPR significant role. Previous studies conducted in cells may have been unable to separate this specific ATPase interaction from the chaperone substrate interaction that may occur due to induction of stress and expression of recombinant protein; a process that would no doubt require some BiP acting in a chaperone capacity, and only by analysis in a clean in vitro system that this becomes apparent.</p><p>The binding interaction analysis between Ire1 luminal domains (regions I–V) and BiP, to our knowledge is the first biophysical measurements giving specific affinities for association. Surprisingly, we see the previously implicated BiP binding region, Ire1 luminal domain region V, is completely dispensable for association to occur. A key study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kimata et al., 2004</xref>) suggested that this region, an area proximal to the ER membrane, was important for BiP binding and that region V deletion mutants were perfectly able to respond to ER stress, leading to the idea that BiP release was not the principal determinant for Ire1 activity—but acts as a first step, followed by unfolded protein binding to luminal domains in a two step mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Kimata et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2007</xref>). Structural descriptions of yeast Ire1 luminal domain supported this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Credle et al., 2005</xref>). The formation of a groove upon dimerization that resembles an MHC type fold suggested that unfolded proteins bound to luminal domains directly, bypassing BiP for UPR activation. This model has recently gained prominence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Promlek et al., 2011</xref>); a study showed direct binding of unfolded peptide mimics to yeast Ire1 luminal domain in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>). The binding of these peptides was observed to cause oligomerisation of luminal domains, with the implication that this leads to UPR activation. In our study, we initially used such peptides to mimic ER stress, observing binding directly to luminal domains, but curiously not to BiP. Moreover, the peptide mimic in our system had no impact upon the noncanonical interaction between BiP ATPase and luminal domains. We noted that certain peptide mimics required addition of a number of charged residues to make it soluble and were derived from non-ER signal peptides. Our attention turned to using C<sub>H</sub>1 substrate, a previously characterized authentic ER unfolded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Feige et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>). Using this substrate, we measure robust binding to both full-length BiP and to the substrate binding domain, but not to the ATPase domain of BiP. Furthermore, we do not observe an interaction between C<sub>H</sub>1 and luminal domains in vitro. Therefore, the suggestion is that unfolded proteins bind exclusively to BiP's substrate binding domain, a notion that is well accepted for Hsp70 chaperones and for ER isoform BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Marcinowski et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2013</xref>). Indeed the recent crystal structure of isolated Hsp70 substrate binding domain with unfolded peptide mimics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) indicates that the substrate binding domain alone is also capable to bind unfolded peptide substrates.</p><p>Interestingly, a study attempted to reconcile the involvement of BiP in UPR activation with direct binding of unfolded protein to luminal domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>). In this model BiP sequesters inactive Ire1. Upon high levels of ER stress, unfolded proteins bind to Ire1 causing the formation of a higher order active complex, which then recruits inactive monomers from BiP in a competitive fashion. Experimental evidence for this comes from differences in activation between wild-type Ire1 and mutant version of Ire1 (Ire1 ΔV a.k.a Ire1<sub>bipless</sub>) that is unable to bind BiP. The mutant Ire1 was unable to offer any buffering capacity since it was thought to be lacking the BiP binding region, and hence sensitized Ire1 to low unfolded protein load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>). The idea that Ire1, BiP, and unfolded proteins exist in some dynamic equilibrium is certainty plausible—however, our data suggest that region V is dispensable for BiP binding to occur. Surprisingly, we do not observe C<sub>H</sub>1 unfolded protein directly interacting with luminal domains in any of our assays, thus providing evidence against direct association of unfolded protein—a role that is usually reserved for molecular chaperones. Interestingly, one noticeable feature of least some of the previous UPR models mentioned is that they involve a level of competition between components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>); our present model suggests an allosteric mechanism at the heart of UPR induction.</p><p>In summary, we identify a noncanonical interaction between BiP ATPase and luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk that dissociates when unfolded protein binds to the canonical substrate binding domain of BiP. Thus, implicating BiP as a central player in detecting ER stress and suggesting a novel allosteric mechanism for UPR induction.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification</title><p>All human BiP, Ire1 and Perk proteins used in this study were expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21 (DE3) cells (Invitrogen, UK) as fusion proteins with an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tag followed by a PreScission Protease cleavage site.

All experiments were performed at 25°C. The sample cell contained BiP, Ire1 or Perk at approximately 40 μM concentrations and the syringe contained ∆EspP at approximately 450 μM concentrations. Heat of dilution, as determined by titrating ∆EspP into the buffer alone, was subtracted from the raw titration data before analysis. Data were fit by least-squares procedure assuming a one-site binding model using Microcal Origin (version 7.0). K<sub>d</sub> values were averaged over three measurements, standard error values are indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Size-Exclusion Chromatography Multi-Angle Light Scattering (SEC MALS)</title><p>To measure the absolute MW of protein species, SEC MALS was carried out using an Agilent 1260 system equipped with a miniDAWN TREOS (Wyatt Technologies) Light Scattering detector and an Optilab T-rEX (Wyatt Technologies) Refractive Index detector. Briefly, 100 μl Ire1 or Perk at 100 μM was mixed with excess ∆EspP (100 μl at 500 μM) for 15′ at RT. In control experiments, 100 μl of buffer B was added instead. Samples were run on a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer B. Data were analyzed with the ASTRA software (Wyatt Technologies, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Magda Reis for the initial cloning, Prof P Freemont and Prof X Zhang and their respective laboratories use of equipment especially for MST.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The ER-localized Hsp70 chaperone BiP/Grp78 has been shown to associate with the ER stress sensors, Ire1 and Perk, under unstressed conditions. ER stress dissociates BiP from both sensors, triggering dimer/oligomer formation and activation of the cytosolic effector domains of the sensors by trans-autophosphorylation. Dissociation of BiP is thus required to activate IRE1 and/or Perk. In yeast, which have an evolutionarily conserved Ire1, subregion V, juxtaposed to transmembrane domain of Ire1, has been identified as a BiP-binding region (Ref. 13; PLoS Biol. 8, e1000415, 2010), and the BiP binding region of mammalian Perk has also been identified as the membrane proximal, luminal segment (JBC, 277, 18728, 2002). Two groups have reported that the luminal core domain of yeast Ire1 interacts directly with unfolded or misfolded protein in vivo and in vitro (Ref. 14; MBC, 22, 3520, 2011; PNAS, 102, 18773, 2005; Science, 333, 1891, 2011).</p><p>The paper by Ali et al. presents data showing that the luminal domains of Ire1 and Perk (between 40 and 50 kD each) bind BiP, but not through subregion V. The ATPase domain of BiP, not the substrate domain, is the site of interaction, which is nonetheless independent of nucleotide. Addition of an unfolded protein -- the C<sub>H</sub>1 region of an immunoglobulin -- to full-length BiP eliminates the observed association with the luminal domain of either Ire1 or Perk. Unfolded C<sub>H</sub>1 does not bind the luminal domains themselves, leading to the conclusion that the conformational change in BiP engendered by peptide binding must in some way alter access to the site(s) of luminal-domain binding. The authors have used microscale thermophoresis to determine luminal-domain binding and confirmed the results by pull-down, which has then been used to study the effect of C<sub>H</sub>1 binding. The conclusion, assuming it were to hold up in cells, would be biologically satisfying, with the implication that BiP inhibits Perk and Ire1 signaling unless bound with an unfolded protein. BiP would then be the primary unfolded protein detector, consistent with its known activities, and Perk and Ire1 would be downstream signal transducers.</p><p>The reviewers concurred that the results are interesting and that they constructively challenge existing models. The reviewers also concurred that this revisionist view will not be convincing without in vivo data. The authors therefore need to carry out experiments that address the following points:</p><p>1) Does the proposed model hold in vivo? One way to ask this question is to show that BiP mutants deficient in substrate binding retain Ire1/Perk inhibition and hence attenuate Ire1 and Perk activation, even in the presence of unfolded protein (ER stress). Readout would be the state of Ire1 and Perk phosphorylation, XBP1 mRNA splicing, or other indicators of the activated state. The authors may have a better way. In any case, they need to include clear predictions that they test in cells.</p><p>2) Does deletion or alteration of subregion V in Ire1 and Perk affect the binding of their luminal regions to BiP in cells? The authors need to test their model, which differs from published data.</p><p>3) An in vitro experiment: Luminal domains of both Ire1 and Perk are known to be dimers and to oligomerize. Apart from their supplementary data showing that these domains are dimers and unaffected by the EspP signal peptide, he authors of the present study do not directly address the state of oligomerization of the luminal domains.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>Many groups have studied the association of BiP with Ire1 and Perk in vivo by IP. In yeast Ire1, BiP binding region has been assigned to a subregion V, a region neighboring transmembrane domain of Ire1 by Kimata et al. (2004, J Cell Biol, 167, 445-456; Promlek, 2011, Mol Biol Cell 22, 3520-3532) and another group provided supporting evidence (Ref. 20). Subregion V of mammalian Ire1 has been also reported as a BiP binding region, but this region is longer than the corresponding region in yeast Ire1 (Oikawa et al., ECR, 2009). The deletion of subregion V greatly decreases the basal level of BiP binding, and the deletion of both subregion 1 and 5 increases basal activation level of yeast Ire1 (Kimata et al., 2004, J Cell Biol, 167, 445-456; Ishiwata et al., Genes Cells, 2013). In mammalian Ire1, the deletion of subregion V decreased the amount of Ire1 but increased the basal Ire1 activity (Oikawa et al., ECR, 2009). Subregion V of Perk is also reported as a BiP binding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ma et al., 2002</xref>, J Biol Chem 277, 18728-18735). These data clearly show that the deletion of subregion V of Ire1 and Perk decreases BiP binding and increases Ire1 basal activity, which is tightly regulated. Furthermore Dr. Walter's group reported that the groove constructed by a dimer of the Ire1 core region directly binds unfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Credle et al., 2005</xref>, PNAS, 102, 18773-18784), an idea supported by other reports (Kimata et al., The Journal of Cell Biology, 179, 75-86; Gardner et al., 2011, Science 333, 1891-1894; Promlek, 2011, Mol Biol Cell 22, 3520-3532).</p><p>In vivo experiments are especially important for clarifying the authors’ claim, and the new experimental data in the revised manuscript are not sufficient.</p><p>The authors should carry out the following experiments:</p><p>1) They should show the in vivo interactions of the BiP ATPase domain with Ire1 and Ire1ΔV, respectively, and compare them.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, their data show only an interaction between BiP and Ire1ΔV; the authors should compare Ire1ΔV-BiP association with that of wild-type Ire1-BiP. Because BiP is an ER chaperone that binds many proteins, it is not surprising that BiP interacted with Ire1ΔV in their experiments. They need to coexpress full length Ire1 and Ire1ΔV (separately, of course) with full length BiP in the absence or presence of ER stress. If their claim were correct, the data would show the following:</p><p>a) In the absence of ER stress, similar amounts of BiP should associate with Ire1 and Ire1ΔV.</p><p>b) In the presence of ER stress, the amount of BiP associated with Ire1 should decrease, and the decreased level should not depend on the deletion of region V.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the authors should examine not only Ire1 and Perk but also Ire1ΔV and PerkΔV.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03522.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Does the proposed model hold in vivo?

We have, as the reviewers have suggested, used the state of Ire1 and Perk phosphorylation as readouts of activated state. In line with our predictions, the BiP deletion mutant, lacking the substrate binding domain, displays attenuated UPR signaling in comparison to full length BiP. This result greatly enhances the manuscript. See section “BiP deletion mutants that lack substrate binding domain attenuate UPR signaling” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Does deletion or alteration of subregion V in Ire1 and Perk affect the binding of their luminal regions to BiP in cells? The authors need to test their model, which differs from published data</italic>.</p><p>We conducted a co immunoprecipitation experiment using Ire1 mutant that lacked region V (Ire1 ΔV) with HA-tagged BiP. We can confirm that we see Ire1 ΔV co-immunoprecipitating with BiP, reinforcing the in vitro data, where we measured robust binding (kd = ∼2μM) between Ire1 ΔV and BiP. This data clearly suggests that region V is dispensable for BiP binding. See section “BiP binds to region II-IV of luminal domains” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) An in vitro experiment: Luminal domains of both Ire1 and Perk are known to be dimers and to oligomerize.

Is it affected by BiP binding?</italic></p><p>We decided to use cross-linking as a method to address this question. The difficulty in this experiment is obtaining a result that is clear to interpret, and key to this experiment working was using the ATPase domain of BiP. The ATPase domain interacts with Ire1 exclusively, without the requirement of substrate binding domain. But more importantly, it remained a monomer in presence and absence of cross linker. Thus, making analysis of multimer bands an easier task. The cross link clearly identifies Ire1 as a dimer and tetramer species. Upon addition of BiP, and subsequent immunoblotting, reveals that BiP binds to Ire1 in two possible ratios. The key conclusion here is that the presence of BiP impedes the formation of tetramers by binding to Ire1 monomers and dimers. See section “BiP impedes Ire1 luminal domain tetramer formation” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Discussion points:</italic></p><p><italic>a) Cite and discuss some of the past work and how it differs or is consistent with the present results, and admit some of the complexities that may impact the interpretation of the present results.
