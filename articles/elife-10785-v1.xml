Complexes (NPCs) are key cellular transporter that control nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic cells, but its transport mechanism is still not understood. The centerpiece of NPC transport is the assembly of intrinsically disordered polypeptides, known as FG nucleoporins, lining its passageway. Their conformations and collective dynamics during transport are difficult to assess in vivo. In vitro investigations provide partially conflicting results, lending support to different models of transport, which invoke various conformational transitions of the FG nucleoporins induced by the cargo-carrying transport proteins. We show that the spatial organization of FG nucleoporin assemblies with the transport proteins can be understood within a first principles biophysical model with a minimal number of key physical variables, such as the average protein interaction strengths and spatial densities. These results address some of the outstanding controversies and suggest how molecularly divergent NPCs in different species can perform essentially the same function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10785.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10785.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10785.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal, plant and fungal cells contain a structure called the nucleus, inside which the genetic material of the cell is stored. For the cell to work properly, certain proteins and other molecules need to be able to enter and exit the nucleus. This transport is carried out by pore-like molecular “devices” known as Nuclear Pore Complexes, whose architecture and mode of operation are unique among cellular transporters.</p><p>Nuclear Pore Complexes are charged with a daunting task of deciding which of the hundreds of molecules it conducts per second should go through and which should not. Small molecules can pass freely through Nuclear Pore Complexes. However, larger molecules can only pass through the pore efficiently if they are bound to specialized transport proteins that interact with the proteins – called FG nucleoporins – that line the pore. A unique feature of the FG nucleoporins is that, unlike typical proteins, they do not have a defined three-dimensional structure. Instead, they form a soft and pliable lining inside the Nuclear Pore Complex passageway.</p><p>Exactly how interacting with transport proteins affects the structure and spatial arrangements of the FG nucleoporins in a way that allows them to control transport is not well understood. This is in part because existing experimental techniques are unable to study the structures of the FG nucleoporins in enough detail to track how they change during transport. The complexity and the diversity of the FG nucleoporins also make them difficult to model in detail.</p><p>Vovk, Gu et al. have developed a theoretical model that is based on just three basic physical properties of the FG nucleoporins – their flexibility, their ability to interact with each other, and their binding with the transport proteins. Future work can refine the model by incorporating further molecular details about the interactions between FG nucleoporins and transport proteins.</p><p>The predictions made by this simple model agree well with experimental results in a wide range of situations – from single molecules to complex spatial assemblies. They also explain why some of the experimental results appear to contradict each other and suggest how several outstanding controversies in the field can be reconciled. Because the model invokes only fundamental physical principles of FG nucleoporin assemblies, it shows that some of their general properties do not depend on the exact conditions. In particular, this might shed light on why Nuclear Pore Complexes in different organisms perform essentially the same function, although the details of their molecular structure may differ. This also suggests how the FG nucleoporins can be manipulated to build artificial devices based on the same principles.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10785.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10785.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nulcear pore complex</kwd><kwd>biophysics</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered proteins</kwd><kwd>polymers</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>theory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Grant RGPIN 4025901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vovk</surname><given-names>Andrei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zilman</surname><given-names>Anton</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Chad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant 31003A_146614</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kapinos</surname><given-names>Larisa E</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Roderick YH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CHE-1464551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coalson</surname><given-names>Rob D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simple biophysical considerations explain the collective behavior of molecularly diverse complex protein assemblies that regulate transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic organisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) are biological 'nanomachines' that conduct all the transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. NPCs participate in a vast number of regulatory processes in the cell, as well as pathological conditions such as viral disease and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dickmanns et al., 2015</xref>). Transport through the NPC is fast, highly selective and robust with respect to molecular noise and structural perturbations. Transport of relatively small cargoes up to several nanometers in size, or approximately 30–40 kD, occurs by pure diffusion, without specific interactions with the NPC constituents. By contrast, transport of larger macromolecules, such as import of transcription factors and export of mRNA particles is tightly controlled by the NPC. For efficient transport, macromolecules larger than several nanometers in size must be shuttled through the NPC by soluble nuclear transport proteins from a highly conserved family, known as Karyopherins (Kaps) in yeast or Importins/Transportins in vertebrates. Remarkably, despite its high selectivity and efficiency, the NPC does not consume metabolic energy during transport and does not possess an obvious 'gate' opening or closing during transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Terry and Wente, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wente and Rout, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Stewart, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Feldherr and Akin, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mohr et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The spatial organization of the NPC and its transport mechanism are unique.

This passageway is lined by a set of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>200</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> intrinsically disordered polypeptide chains, collectively known as 'FG nups' due to the large numbers of Phenylalanine-Glycine (FG) repeats in their sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Terry and Wente, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wente and Rout, 2010</xref>). Although the actual sequences of the FG nups can vary widely among different species, the overall structure, organization and the transport mechanism of the NPC are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Terry and Wente, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schmidt and Görlich, 2015</xref>). As the key component of the NPC transport mechanism, the FG nups set up the permeability barrier that prevents free passage of large macromolecules and serve as a template for the transient binding of the cargo-carrying transport proteins. NPCs are also remarkably resilient with respect to structural perturbations: many of the FG nups can be genetically deleted without impairing cell viability and without major effect on transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Strawn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Popken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Feldherr et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). Cargo-carrying transport proteins bind to the FG nups through multiple, yet relatively weak contacts. This binding is crucial for selective transport: interfering with it decreases the transport efficiency, or abolishes the transport altogether. Conversely, particles or molecules that normally cannot penetrate the NPC can be transported after chemical modifications that enables the to interact directly with the FG nups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wente and Rout, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayliss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Naim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kumeta et al., 2012</xref>). NPC geometry and architecture are schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10785.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of spatial arrangements of the FG nups in the NPC and in vitro models.</title><p><italic>Left</italic>: schematic rendering of the NPC geometry (not to exact scale).

The consensus is that the binding of the transport proteins to the FG nups enables them to overcome the permeability barrier. The strength of this binding controls the transport selectivity and efficiency. Hence, transport proteins can be informally viewed as 'glorified enzymes' that lower the free energy barrier for the translocation through the NPC. Basic models that describe the transport as facilitated diffusion through the FG nup medium, modulated by the interactions with the FG nups, provide a good explanation of the selectivity of the NPC even in the presence of large amounts of molecular noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wente and Rout, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zilman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fernandez-Martinez and Rout, 2012</xref>). The overall veracity of these general principles has been demonstrated by creation of artificial nanochannels and nanomaterials that mimic NPC function and recapitulate many of its transport properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zilman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schmidt and Görlich, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zilman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jovanovic-Talisman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kowalczyk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caspi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jovanovic-Talisman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Various models of the mechanistic involvement of the FG nups in transport have been proposed. In the 'virtual gate' model, the permeability barrier arises due to the entropic repulsion from the fluctuating FG nup chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zilman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rout et al., 2003</xref>). In a related idea, an entropically stabilized FG nup 'brush' can be collapsed by the transport proteins thus opening the transport passageway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2008</xref>). In another scenario, the permeability barrier arises from a gel-like network, stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions between the FG repeats. Transport proteins disentangle this gel via their binding to the FG repeats thereby allowing their passage through the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frey et al., 2006</xref>). More complex models have been proposed that take into account the sequence inhomogeneity and local molecular properties of the FG nups, their possible spatial localization and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Peters, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mincer and Simon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardarelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Solmaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>). It is likely that the majority of the effects invoked in all these models contribute to the NPC transport mechanism to some degree. In particular, the FG nups possess various degrees of intra- and inter-chain 'cohesiveness' that can lead to formation of single and multi-chain aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schmidt and Görlich, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Patel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hough et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Milles and Lemke, 2011</xref>).One major contribution to FG nup cohesiveness is believed to arise from the weak binding of the hydrophobic FG repeats to each other. However, intrinsically disordered proteins are notoriously prone to aggregation and the cohesiveness can have multiple sources, including electrostatic, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-charge interactions as well as non-specific interactions between the non-FG parts of the chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Uversky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Milles et al., 2013</xref>). Cohesiveness of individual FG nups correlates with the ratio of the numbers of the hydrophobic to charged residues in their sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). However, the relative importance of the cohesiveness and its specific role in the transport mechanism are still under debate.</p><p>To add to the complexity of the system, the transport proteins are present in large numbers within the NPC, and can strongly affect FG nup conformations and dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zilman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zilman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jovanovic-Talisman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yang and Musser, 2006</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lowe et al., 2015</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schoch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Milles et al., 2013</xref>). However, several controversies persist with respect to their contributions to the architecture and the function of the NPC.

Consequently, computational and theoretical approaches - from atomistic to highly coarse grained - have become increasingly important in the investigations of the possible configurations of the FG nups and the transport dynamics within the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zilman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mincer and Simon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Opferman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Osmanović et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tagliazucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moussavi-Baygi et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ghavami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gamini et al., 2014</xref>). However, parameterizations of such models still remain difficult because of the sheer complexity and diversity of the FG nups, exacerbated by conflicting or non-existent measurements of the relevant parameters. The existing parameterizations differ significantly in their physical assumptions and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tagliazucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ghavami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ando et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gamini et al., 2014</xref>). As a case in point, even the radii of gyration of the FG nups and their interaction affinities with the transport proteins are still under debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tetenbaum-Novatt and Rout, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isgro and Schulten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eisele et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>For further progress, it is imperative to establish the most pertinent physical features and variables controlling the FG nup conformations induced by the transport proteins. Recent in vitro studies provide the basis for systematic understanding of the conformations of the assemblies of the FG nups with transport proteins in order to relate their molecular properties to their nanomechanical behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schmidt and Görlich, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eisele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2013</xref>). In one typical experimental setup, an FG nup assembly is grafted to a rigid surface in the presence of varying concentrations of the transport proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The FG nup conformations are inferred from the measurements of layer height. Even this relatively simple experimental setup resulted in conflicting observations. Depending on the experimental conditions and the measurement technique, the transport proteins can either increase or decrease the layer height, or in some cases cause no measurable change. However, despite the variability between different FG nups and transport proteins, general behavior motif is emerging from these experiments. Typically, at low concentrations, the transport proteins do not affect the layer height. This is followed by a partial layer collapse and height decrease, accompanied by accumulation of the transport protein in the layer. Increasing the concentration further reverses the collapse and eventually leads to the swelling of the layer. Virtually all studied mixtures of the FG nups and transport proteins regardless of the species of origin or the natural localization in the NPC exhibit this general pattern of behavior although the degree of collapse and swelling may vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eisele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2013</xref>). Related patterns of behavior are observed in experiments with bulk solutions of FG nups mixed with various transport proteins. At sufficiently high concentrations, the FG nups form a dense phase which either absorbs or excludes the transport proteins, depending on the size of the latter and their interaction strength with the FG nups see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The behavior is very general and is observed in a wide range or FG nups from different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schmidt and Görlich, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hough et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The generality of these behaviors - despite the large number of molecular factors affecting the FG nup behavior - suggests that it might be understood in terms of a small number of core organizing principles. In this paper we develop a coarse grained theory of the transport proteins-FG nup assemblies that captures only the essential physical features: (i) the flexible nature of the FG nups, (ii) their potential cohesiveness and (iii) the attractive interactions with the transport proteins. The model is investigated using mean field theory supported by coarse-grained simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Opferman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Opferman et al., 2013</xref>). Our approach is inspired by the successes of the simplified theories in explaining the properties of highly chemically complex and diverse materials in polymer science and soft condensed matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Doi and Edwards, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Flory, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Gennes, 1979</xref>). Systematic comparison of the model predictions with extensive experimental data shows that the model captures and explains the observed behavior in different regimes. The model suggests a resolution of some of the apparent conflicts in the experimental results and proposes how to reconcile the outstanding controversies regarding the relative importance of the cohesive and the entropic effects for FG nup behavior and NPC selectivity. The model also sheds light on the long standing discrepancies in the measurements of the binding affinities of transport proteins to FG nups.</p><p>The model identifies the key physical variables controlling the conformational behavior of FG nup-transport protein assemblies and suggests experimental ways of manipulating them. This essential theoretical framework can be systematically developed in the future with additional molecular and structural details. Beyond the NPC, the results of the model are interesting in a broader context of intrinsically disordered proteins and nanotechnological applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Stuart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Tagliazucchi and Szleifer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coalson et al., 2015</xref>). Many aspects of the unfolded protein behavior are still puzzling, and the conceptual and computational frameworks - many of which are built on the foundation of polymer physics - are currently being developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Uversky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tcherkasskaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sherman and Haran, 2006</xref>). The model described here demonstrates the power of such approaches on a concrete example of an important family of intrinsically disordered proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Mathematical model</title><p>Many of the molecular parameters determining the behavior of the FG nup assemblies and their interactions with transport proteins are not fully known. In particular, the number of binding sites on the transport proteins and affinities of their binding to the FG repeats are a matter controversy. The degree of inter- and intra- FG nup cohesion or the relative importance of the electrostatic vs hydrophobic effects are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayliss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schoch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tagliazucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tetenbaum-Novatt and Rout, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isgro and Schulten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eisele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pyhtila and Rexach, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Otsuka et al., 2008</xref>). To capture the most salient mechanical and energetic properties responsible for the collective conformational behavior of the FG nups, we model them as flexible polymeric chains. Although not all intrinsically disordered proteins can be described in this way (for instance, due to residual secondary structure), the nanomechanical and the statistical properties of the FG nups can be well described by the polymer worm-like chain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lim et al., 2007</xref>). The chains can be imagined as consisting of 'monomers', where each monomer roughly corresponds to one or several amino-acids; as will be shown below, the predictions of the model turn out to be insensitive to the exact choice of the monomer size within a realistic range (see the Results section). The transport proteins are modeled as rigid particles of appropriate volume that interact attractively with the FG nup chains. Although the interaction between the transport proteins and FG nups is believed to be predominantly mediated by Phenylalanines of the FG repeats lodging themselves into the hydrophobic grooves on the transport proteins, it is likely that other amino acids and other interactions, such as electrostatic interaction, participate in the binding as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayliss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tagliazucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isgro and Schulten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colwell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Stewart, 2005</xref>). Thus, the interactions of the FG nups with the transport proteins are taken into account on a coarse-grained level parameterized by an interaction parameter <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, which is proportional to the average binding energy of a monomer to a transport protein molecule. The main contributions to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> are enthalpic, although water network re-arrangement entropy contributes to the hydrophobic interaction as well. We discuss the range of experimentally motivated values of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> below.

This description is appropriate for high salt concentrations conditions (150–300 mM) of the experiments, where the electrostatic interactions are highly screened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhulina et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrat and Joanny, 1997</xref>).

It was shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al.

Roughly speaking, the attractive interactions favor more compact structures because they allow formation of higher numbers of energetically favorable contacts, while the entropy of chain configuration favors more diffuse and open conformations.

In principle, this entropic repulsion from the flexible polymer layer is sufficient for creating the permeability barrier for non-binding molecules. It is crucial to bear in mind that the polymer chains are not static but highly fluctuating entities. It is the entropy of these molecular motions that is responsible for the penetration barrier; thinking of a polymer layer as a static entity with some amount of free space can lead to erroneous conclusions. The barrier could be enhanced by other effects, such as, for instance, inter-chain cohesion.</p><p>Thus, at low concentrations the transport proteins penetrate the layer if their attractive interaction with the FG nups is strong enough. However, they do not cause significant conformational changes - essentially occupying the available empty space inside the layer. At higher densities of the transport proteins, or higher interaction strengths, the number of transport proteins in the layer increases, and collective effects start to play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Opferman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Halperin and Kröger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim and O’Shaughnessy, 2006</xref>). Further addition of the transport proteins causes a cooperative conformational transition of the FG nups leading to either collapse or swelling of the layer, correlated with the accumulation of the transport proteins inside the layer. The magnitude of the collapse and swelling depend on the transport protein size, concentration, interaction strength with the FG nups, the grafting density, and the cohesion strength. Typical height responses to transport protein concentration are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. One important conclusion of the theory is that the FG nup response to the addition of the transport proteins (for instance, 'swelling' vs. 'collapse') is not an intrinsic property of an FG nup, but can be modulated by the grafting density, transport protein size and the interaction strength. The overall repertoire of predicted behavior as a function of parameters is shown in the 'phase diagrams' in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>. The model captures the general salient features of the experimental observations. In particular, at the same grafting distance and the cohesion strength, the collapse is more pronounced for a smaller protein such as NTF2, in accord with the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, higher grafting distance results in more collapse - because the entropic repulsion of the transport proteins by the chains is lower at lower chain density. Different experimental results can be placed in the different parts of the 'phase diagram', potentially explaining the observed discrepancies. Notably, the theory predicts a high degree of collapse at large grafting distances, in agreement with the experiments of (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lim et al., 2007</xref>). Another interesting prediction of the model is that changing the grafting distance affects small and large transport proteins in a different way. For large ones (e.g. Karyopherin), increasing the grafting distance enhances the penetration into the layer because it reduces the repulsive barrier due to lower monomer density in the layer. By contrast, for small transport factors (such as NTF2), for which the repulsion is less important, increasing the grafting distance decreases the penetration into the layer because it reduced the density of available binding sites in the layer.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10785.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Layer collapse and swelling: effect of cohesion and of the grafting distance.</title><p><italic>Upper panel:</italic> Theoretical curves show that FG nup cohesion can convert layer collapse to swelling.

Due to the experimental accuracy limitations and large uncertainly in the known values of all the parameters, the fitting of the parameters to the data is not unique and has limited information content. Rather, we focus on clearly distinguishable trends, such as the difference between the behavior of Karyopherin-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf145"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> vs. NTF2 on the Nsp1 layer, reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner et al. (2015)</xref>. These measurements, performed on the same FG nup in approximately same range of grafting distances, allow us to examine the effects of the transport protein size and the binding strength, unconfounded by other factors. Karyopherin-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf146"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and NTF2 have significantly different sizes and binding strengths. NTF2 is ∼ 4 times smaller in volume and has only two binding sites, while Karyopherin-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf147"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> can have up to ten specific FG-binding sites and a significantly larger surface area with potentially much larger number of non-FG interactions with the FG nups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bayliss et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isgro and Schulten, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Stewart, 2005</xref>). We focus on one clearly discernible difference in the experimental behavior: significant penetration of NTF2 starts at higher concentrations but causes stronger compaction of the layer compared to Karyopherin-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf148"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Comparison of the theoretical predictions with the experimental results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> in the range of concentrations where direct comparison is possible. Because of the relatively large uncertainty in the measurements of the absolute layer height, the grafting distance (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the binding strengths, the theoretical predications are shown for a range of values approximately corresponding to the experimental ones. The model reproduces the observed differences in the behavior of Karyopherin-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf149"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and NTF2 on Nsp1 at physically plausible values of the parameters in the regime of its validity. It might also explain why no significant change in the layer height (or very limited swelling) was observed upon addition of transport proteins by other experimental groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eisele et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2012</xref>): the behavior of both NTF2 and Karyopherin-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf150"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> can be easily shifted into the swelling regime by relatively small changes in the grafting distance, cohesion or interaction strength, the latter of which can be modulated by small changes in the <italic>pH</italic> or salt and denaturant concentrations. Other patterns revealed by the experimental data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, such as the dependence of the maximal compaction concentration on the grafting distance, are also qualitatively explained by the theory. Quantitative comparison of these features requires more analysis of the data and more detailed approximations, including the sparse and high transport protein density regimes, and will be presented elsewhere.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10785.013</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the theoretical predictions with the experimental data in the layer geometry.</title><p>Theoretical predictions for the range of the parameter values approximately corresponding to the experimental ones for Nsp1 layers infiltrated by Karyopherin-<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf151"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathsize="111%">β</mml:mi><mml:mo mathsize="90%" mathvariant="normal">⁢</mml:mo><mml:mn mathsize="111%" mathvariant="normal">1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and NTF2. <italic>Upper panel</italic>: layer height vs bulk concentration of the transport protein.

At low cohesion, insufficient to cause the phase separation of the FG nups alone, addition of the transport proteins can trigger the phase separation and the formation of the mixed dense phase. Further increase in the cohesiveness <italic>promotes</italic> formation of an even denser phase and enhances Importin partitioning into it, contrary to the naive expectation that cohesiveness always inhibits particle penetration in to the FG Nup medium. Nevertheless, further increase in cohesiveness prevents penetration of the transport proteins into the dense phase, thereby enhancing the permeability barrier as has been suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Frey and Görlich, 2007</xref>).

One has to rely on the interpretation of indirect measurements of the FG nup properties in vitro, which are partially incomplete or conflicting. On the theoretical side, the progress is hampered by the lack of a universally accepted comprehensive theory of intrinsically disordered proteins that is able to incorporate all the factors dictating the physico-chemical and nanomechanical properties of the FG nups.</p><p>The theoretical model developed here provides a rigorous physical framework for organizing the known phenomenology of the observed FG nup behaviors and suggests ways to reconcile the apparently contradictory experimental findings and models of transport. The model relies on the minimal number of key physical concepts and variables to describe the FG nups and their interactions with the transport proteins, integrating the multitude of molecular details into a small number of variables, thus avoiding the over-fitting problem, inherent to models with multiple unknown parameters. It has been already suggested that the biophysical properties and dimensions of individual FG nups can be, to a large extent, captured in one phenomenological parameter, the hydrophobic to charged amino acid content ratio, paralleling our cohesiveness strength <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf252"><mml:msub><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>). Our model extends these concepts into the regime of multiple chain assemblies interacting with transport proteins. We have found that this limited set of concepts is sufficient to qualitatively, and even semi-quantitatively, explain the experimentally observed patterns and trends. We expect that explicit inclusion of several important factors such as the spatial distributions of ions, discrete nature of the binding sites on the transport proteins, non-linear elasticity of the chains, potential heterogeneity of the FG nup sequence, and more careful modeling of the microscopic structure of the FG nups assemblies will lead to better quantitative agreement. Additional sources of discrepancy are the possible length polydispersity of the FG nups, transport protein aggregation, and inherent biases of the experimental techniques (for instance, in the SPR method, for technical reasons the measurement of the layer height lags behind in time after the measurement of the protein adsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>). The theory provides clear experimental predictions for the variation of the properties of FG nup-transport protein assemblies with the experimental conditions such as the grafting density. Such measurements would allow further systematic refinement of the model.</p><p>The analysis of this paper shows that both entropic ('brush-like') and entalpic/cohesive ('gel-like') effects naturally cooperate in determining the spatial structures of the assemblies of FG nucleoporins with the transport proteins, and suggests how the 'brush' and the 'gel' concepts can be reconciled. Although the overall qualitative predicted behavior of the surface layers is similar for cohesive and non-cohesive chains alike, quantitative comparison with experiments was only possible by assuming a certain amount of cohesiveness for the studied FG nups. Our analysis indicates that all FG nups likely possess some degree of intra- and inter-chain cohesiveness, although only for some of them it is sufficiently strong to cause aggregation in bulk solutions. The model also shows that the different classes of 'extended' and 'collapsed' FG nups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yamada et al., 2010</xref>) can be accounted for by different values of the cohesiveness <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf253"><mml:msub><mml:mi>χ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Another puzzling observation of the resilience of the NPC transport with respect to the deletion of large numbers of FG nups might be attributed to the fact that the permeability and the selectivity of the FG nup assemblies are relatively insensitive to the grafting density in a significant range - at lower grafting densities, the neighboring chains simply expand, maintaining selective permeability properties of the layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Popken et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, relatively weak interaction energies of the FG nups among themselves and with the transport proteins inferred from our analysis are consistent with the high local molecular mobility inside the dense aggregates observed experimentally in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schmidt and Görlich (2015)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hough et al. (2015)</xref>.</p><p>The success of the theory relies on the very robust physical mechanisms underlying it. Attractive interactions between long flexible filaments and compact objects, such as folded proteins, cause their surface assemblies to attain more compact conformations at low concentrations of the transport proteins and swollen conformations at higher concentrations. Similarly, in bulk solutions of ungrafted chains, inter-chain interactions and the interactions with transport proteins lead to phase separation and formation of a dense phase at sufficiently high concentrations. These behavior motifs are always expected irrespective of the nature of the interactions on the molecular scale. In this sense, all such systems lie in the same 'universality class' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Gennes, 1979</xref>). The ability of the model to capture the behavior of different FG nups in different geometries under a variety of experimental conditions makes it a useful tool for the development of further, more refined, models. Finally, the analysis of this paper underscores the importance of always considering the presence of the transport factors when thinking about NPC architecture.</p><p>The theory also sheds light on the discrepancies in the experimental measurements of the binding affinities of the FG nups to transport proteins. Depending on the experimental procedure, the values of the measured dissociation constants range from several nanomolars to several micromolars. Moreover, some of these measured affinities appear to be inconsistent with the observed transport times in the millisecond range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yang and Musser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tetenbaum-Novatt and Rout, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tetenbaum-Novatt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Denning et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ma, 2010</xref>). Our theory shows how these discrepancies might stem from the fundamental statistical thermodynamics of the transport protein-FG nup interaction. First, as shown in this paper, penetration of the transport proteins into an FG nup layer is a cooperative process, not described well by a single Langmiur isotherm typically used in the interpretation of binding assays. Second, penetration of the transport proteins into the layer is determined not only by enthalpic but also entropic effects and therefore the measured effective affinity does not directly reflect the interaction energies. Finally, even the purely enthalpic part of the interaction can vary with the experimental conditions, because the average number of monomers available to bind to a transport protein depends on the monomer concentration, which in turn depends on the layer height and grafting distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kapinos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schoch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Sethi et al., 2011</xref>). All this highlights the fact that the classical characterization of inter-molecular interactions by a single affinity value is not informative for complex multivalent interactions of spatially extended objects such as the FG nups. It is also worth bearing in mind that a <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf254"><mml:mn>1000</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>-fold difference in the dissociation constant translates into <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf255"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>7</mml:mn><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> difference in the effective interaction strength - a relatively small difference that can be easily influenced by many factors.</p><p>The results of this paper have important implications for the behavior of the Nuclear Pore Complex and design of bio-molecular sorters based on the same principles. One has to be careful in making inference about the NPC properties based on the in vitro results because the detailed features of the actual spatial morphologies of FG nup assemblies in the channel-like geometry of the NPC are likely to differ from flat and bulk geometries. Analysis of this paper establishes the pertinent parameters that constrain possible scenarios and guide future model building. Recent work on coarse grained models of flexible chains in channel geometries allows us to gauge the implications of the findings in the flat and bulk geometries for FG nup morphologies within the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Osmanović et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coalson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Peleg et al., 2011</xref>). Behavior of non-cohesive or weakly cohesive chains in relatively wide pores - wider than the natural height of the planar layer - is expected to be qualitatively similar to that of flat layers. In this case, the chains form a relatively dense layer along the inner surface of the channel, and increase in cohesiveness compacts the layer towards the walls. Addition of transport proteins causes either collapse or swelling of this surface layer, analogously to the behavior in the flat geometry. In the other limit of strongly cohesive chains in relatively narrow channels, the monomers of the chains accumulate at the pore center in a plug-like shape. It is still unknown in what regime the NPC lies, and further computational and experimental work is required. These findings are also interesting in the more general context of intrinsically disordered proteins, where physics concepts are often invoked to organize and explain the experimental observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Uversky, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although the qualitative behavior motifs predicted by the theory and borne out by the experiments are very general, the specific quantitative features such as the exact height or the degree of compaction are rather sensitive to the parameter values, such as the grafting distance, the density and the interaction strength. This has been already noted in other computational theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Popken et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Osmanović et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tagliazucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gamini et al., 2014</xref>). This raises a question - how the Nuclear Pore Complex functioning remains so invariant across species despite the large variations in sizes and spatial organization. Similarly puzzling in this light is the ability of the NPC to maintain its function despite large structural perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Strawn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hülsmann et al., 2012</xref>). One possible solution to this puzzle is that the NPC is exquisitely ”fine tuned” in a sense that it works correctly only when all the molecular details are right - the FG nup sequence and localization, local pH, ionic strength and concentrations of other molecules - and these conditions are maintained by the cellular homeostasis. On the other hand, the results of this model suggest another possibility - that the NPC is 'robust' in a sense that any structure with the approximately right physical properties will function nearly optimally, which could explain the NPC resilience with respect to structural damage and re-arrangements. This provides an interesting example of functional conservation in the absence of sequence conservation. The importance of this question goes beyond the NPC and arises in the discussion of many cellular machines and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bialek, 2012</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AZ acknowledges the support of the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and Compute Canada.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper develops a self-consistent-field theory for a model of transport through nuclear pores. The model is properly formulated based on well-established and long-standing concepts in polymer physics. Though several theoretical models have been previously published attempting to describe the biophysical nature of nuclear transport, the model presented here has the considerable attraction that it is less inclined than these other models to try to pitch a particular mechanism – rather, it sets up a computational framework that can be adapted and added to upon additional data, giving researchers a computational framework for a more rigorous analysis of data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, it is used to perform a new set of analyses of previously published work from two of the co-authors, Kapinos and Lim. The model re-capitulates certain previously puzzling behaviors seen for FG nups and provides a biophysical hypothesis for these behaviors. This model could therefore be a valuable new tool. However, our enthusiasm for the paper is considerably diluted by two issues.</p><p>Firstly, the manuscript oversells itself as having resolved the controversies, and furthermore, the comparisons with experiment are qualitative. Qualitative comparisons are fine, but rephrasing some of the text so that it accurately reflects the accomplishments is essential.</p><p>Secondly, and more importantly, to establish itself as a useful computational platform, additional work is necessary. In the paper, the model is fit to existing data from some of the co-authors. To make a compelling case that the model indeed captures the essential features of nuclear pore transport, it is necessary to show that the model is predictive – that is, take published data from several groups (not the co-authors') that was explicitly not included in building the model, and without re-adjusting the parameters used to fit the authors' data, show that the model describes these additional data. Without demonstrating this capability, the model cannot be considered predictive or explanatory. We suggest that you consider describing the data presented in the following references: 1) Strawn et al., 2004: can the model describe the observation here that so much of the FG mass can be deleted without completely disrupting transport? 2) Yamada et al.: can the model explain why might there are two classes of cohesiveness as suggested in this paper? 3) Popken et al., 2015: Compare the coarse grained simulations and data in this paper with those described in the manuscript. 4) Patel et al., 2007: which also contains interesting data. Of course, you could choose other data sets that you believe are illustrative.</p><p>Some additional detailed points that need to be addressed are listed below.</p><p>1) The model completely ignores sequence information and electrostatic interactions. The problem with this is that there is clear evidence from bioinformatics studies (see ref. 68) and theory (see ref. 50) that clearly show the need to consider the role of electrostatics. These studies seem to consider similar screening conditions as that in the present manuscript. Moreover, ref. 50 (a theoretical study) shows that smearing the sequence leads to qualitatively different behavior. Therefore, these points need to be mentioned explicitly as refs. 68 and 50 suggest that it may be difficult to describe the NPC using minimal models adequately, as is claimed in the last sentence of the manuscript.</p><p>2) If the minimal model provides an excellent description of nuclear pores, why can synthetic systems not recapitulate the behavior of nuclear pores? The manuscript should emphasize that the model describes some universal features, and more details will have to be added upon considering additional data – this point might become more vivid or refuted by addressing the second major point made above.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> presents well known results, as is noted in the manuscript, but the original work of Alexander is not cited. Also use of the term &quot;cross-link&quot; here is misleading since this is just a model van der Waals interaction.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the two limits that a brush can have from maximal repulsion (stretching) to completely compact. The fact that the experimental observations fall between these two asymptotic limits is expected. But, why is the same nup at different grafting densities suggesting very different values of <italic>χ</italic>?</p><p>5) It appears that the model assumes macroscopic uniform planar layers grafted with one type of FG repeat. Does the model also make accurate predictions for geometries that more accurately resemble the NPC i.e. nanoscopic pores, or mixtures of different FG repeat types?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Simple biophysics underpins collective conformations of intrinsically disordered proteins of the Nuclear Pore Complex&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan as Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and one reviewer. The revised manuscript is much improved, and most of the points we raised previously have been fully addressed. If the remaining points detailed below can be addressed, we think that there is a very good chance that the paper will be accepted for publication.</p><p>1) In the Abstract, we still feel &quot;These results reconcile some of the outstanding controversies…&quot; is strong, given that this work does not concretely reconcile, but rather suggest solutions, to the current controversies. Perhaps &quot;These results address some of the outstanding controversies…&quot; would be better.</p><p>2) In the Discussion, the sentence &quot;The suggests how the ‘brush’ and… effects&quot; is grammatically incorrect and unclear – can you please re-write?</p><p>3) On use of data by others: You addressed our comments by including a work that focuses only on Nup98, which represents only one type of FG, one that can form gels in vitro, but are not necessarily representative of others. Even if an experiment is not possible, could you still replicate computational findings by others, if not at a quantitative, at a qualitative level? In the absence of an independent test, again, we would recommend a more cautious approach on claims that the current work resolves different findings. Instead, perhaps emphasize rather that this work presents a tool of utility to future studies.</p><p>4) On the omitting of some aspects of FGs, etc.: A) Sequence: the explanation about the randomized AA sequence is much improved. However, it would be nice to have a demonstration of the thesis in a case with a simple heterogeneity in sequence, such as in Nsp1 (i.e. difference in property in N-terminal and C-terminal regions). Such a demonstration would also reinforce the paper by possibly recapitulating the computational finding in Yamada et al. (difference in expected structure on N and C-termini). B) On the geometry of FG grafts: Although further computational investigation of this topic may be beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth discussing the limitations of the current presentation of the simple monolayer geometry and the possible differences/changes in FG behavior/conformation (and/or lack thereof) that could arise from change in geometry (e.g. grafting them in a pore lumen, etc.).</p><p>5) In the Abstract, there is a sentence: &quot;NPC transport relies on the conformational transitions of assembly…&quot;.

Qualitative comparisons are fine, but rephrasing some of the text so that it accurately reflects the accomplishments is essential.</italic> </p><p>We have modified the text in the Introduction, the Discussion, as well as the title and the Abstract accordingly to reflect more accurately the results and the achievements of the paper and their relation to the outstanding experimental puzzles.

In the paper, the model is fit to existing data from some of the co-authors. To make a compelling case that the model indeed captures the essential features of nuclear pore transport, it is necessary to show that the model is predictive</italic> – <italic>that is, take published data from several groups (not the co-authors') that was explicitly not included in building the model, and without re-adjusting the parameters used to fit the authors' data, show that the model describes these additional data. Without demonstrating this capability, the model cannot be considered predictive or explanatory. We suggest that you consider describing the data presented in the following references: 1) Strawn et al., 2004: can the model describe the observation here that so much of the FG mass can be deleted without completely disrupting transport? 2) Yamada et al.: can the model explain why might there are two classes of cohesiveness as suggested in this paper? 3) Popken et al., 2015: Compare the coarse grained simulations and data in this paper with those described in the manuscript. 4) Patel et al., 2007: which also contains interesting data. Of course, you could choose other data sets that you believe are illustrative.</italic> </p><p>We thank the editors and the reviewers for this very important comment. In order to address it, we chose to compare our model with the experimental data from the following paper: Schmidt and Görlich, &quot;Nup98 FG domains from diverse species spontaneously phase-separate into particles with nuclear pore-like permselectivity.&quot; <italic>eLife</italic> 4 (2015): e04251. We chose this work because it contains extensive and systematic study of the morphologies of in vitro assemblies of FG nucleoporins with nuclear transport proteins. Unlike the previous “gels”, in this work, the FG nup aggregates with the transport factors are formed through an equilibrium phase separation mechanism, allowing meaningful comparison with our model; this study parallels the experimental work on FG nup monolayers. The chosen paper provides semi-quantitative data that can be meaningfully and informatively compared with the theoretical predictions in order to validate or refute the model. It also satisfies the other requirements of the reviewers: the experiments are done in a different geometry – bulk solutions rather than in surface layers – and by a different group, using entirely different experimental techniques (see below for additional reasons for choosing this work as opposed to other experimental work).</p><p>The chosen work investigates the phase separation of FG nups (specifically, Nup98 and its yeast homologues) and the penetration of Importins into the dense FG nup phase. The theoretical model predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental data for parameter values that are very close to those describing the behavior of Nup98 with Karyopherins in grafted surface layers. However, we emphasize that the validity of the model is not determined by parameter fitting, but rather through addressing clear cut trends and patterns – such as the dependence of the Importin penetration into the dense phase on the cargo size. Small differences in parameter values (as long as they lie in the relevant physical regime) are expected and can be attributed to a number of factors – inherent molecular differences between Kap-<italic>β</italic> and Imp-<italic>β</italic>, different buffers (as a case in point, the buffers in the work of Lim and coworkers do not contain denaturant, while those used by Schmidt and Görlich do) and differences between the FG nups from different species.</p><p>We have expanded the Model section to include the description of bulk solutions of FG nups mixed with transport factors and have added a whole new section in the Results, titled “Phase separation in bulk solutions of FG nups mixed with transport proteins”, which describes the comparison of the theoretical model with the data, including several new figures, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> and corresponding Figure Supplements that also include the sensitivity analysis with respect to the parameter choices. We have also modified the Introduction and the Discussion sections accordingly. We have also expanded the Supplementary Text with the details of the theoretical calculations of the phase separation.</p><p>We have added text in the Discussion regarding the relation of our model to other experimental works suggested by the editors and the reviewers. Unfortunately, the suggested works are less suitable for meaningful theoretical analysis. The data in Patel el al. Cell (2007) are qualitative; Yamada et al. Mol. Cell. Prot. (2010) does not provide quantitative information about the interactions of Karyopherins and FG nups while FG nup dimensions are determined through size fractionation, analysis of which is beyond the scope of the present work. The experimental work by Strawn et al. Nat. Cell. Biol. (2004) and the subsequent work by Popken et al. Mol. Biol. Cell (2015) deal with a much more complex situation in vivo that could be affected by a number of factors that are not included in our model. The computational model used in Popken et al. does not consider the effect of the Karyopherins on the FG nup conformations and has been parameterized for yeast FG nucleoporins, precluding quantitative comparison. Nevertheless, our model is consistent with the findings of all these works. For instance, the two classes of the cohesive and non-cohesive FG domains reported in Yamada et al. can be accommodated through different values of the cohesiveness strength <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic>. Robustness of the NPC transport with respect to FG nup deletions observed in Strawn et al. and Popken et al. can potentially be attributed to the fact that the flexible FG nup chains entropically swell at lower densities (as already been suggested by us in Zilman et al., PLoS Comp Biol 2007). Also, we have also recently reported results of our coarse-grained model in the NPC-like geometry in Coalson et al., JPC(2015) predicting polymer density distributions similar to those described in more detailed models of Onck and collaborators and Szleifer and collaborators. Thus, our model agrees with the morel detailed models (at least qualitatively) in the regime of its validity. However, we feel that the full discussion of the detailed model predictions for the NPC transport is beyond the scope of the present work, and will be performed in future works.</p><p><italic>Some additional detailed points that need to be addressed are listed below. 1) The model completely ignores sequence information and electrostatic interactions. The problem with this is that there is clear evidence from bioinformatics studies (see ref. 68) and theory (see ref. 50) that clearly show the need to consider the role of electrostatics. These studies seem to consider similar screening conditions as that in the present manuscript. Moreover, ref. 50 (a theoretical study) shows that smearing the sequence leads to qualitatively different behavior. Therefore, these points need to be mentioned explicitly as refs. 68 and 50 suggest that it may be difficult to describe the NPC using minimal models adequately, as is claimed in the last sentence of the manuscript.</italic> </p><p>We thank the referees for these crucial points and we regret that they were not clearly explained in the previous version of the paper.</p><p>Electrostatics: Although we do not explicitly model the ion distributions as in, for instance, Tagliazzucci et al., PNAS (2013), the electrostatic interactions are included in the model in the same fashion as in other computational models of the FG nups (Ghavami et al., BJ 2014) and other unfolded proteins (Leermakers, Soft Matter, 2010) – through the screened electrostatic interaction. Electrostatics contributes to the interaction parameters <italic>χ</italic> and <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic>, along with all other interactions, such as the hydrophobic, π-π and others. This is a commonly used and well established approximation, which has been successfully applied to a variety of biopolymers. For the system under study, modeling the screened electrostatic interaction as a short range potential is a reasonable approximation because the Debye screening length is about 1 nm in the experimentally used salt concentrations, comparable to the size of the chain “monomers”. We note in passing that the microscopically realistic modeling of electrostatics of proteins in ionic solutions is extremely challenging because, among other things, soluble ions and charged side chains affect the hydrogen bonding structure of water and hence affect the hydrophobic interactions; at present all existing models employ various approximations, to the best of our knowledge. We added text in the Model section and the Discussion elucidating this point.</p><p>Sequence: Crucially, our model does not correspond to a randomized FG nup sequence, such as those discussed in the computational models of Tagliazucchi et al. PNAS (2013) and Ghavami et al., BJ (2014), and does not contradict their findings indicating that the sequence could significantly affect the behavior of FG nup assemblies. In all comparisons with the experimental data, we use a “monomer” of approximately four amino acids, which corresponds to an XXFG patch on an FG nup. The sequence motif of Glycin (G) following Phenylalanine (F) is known to be structurally important for the FG nup binding to the binding pockets on the transport proteins (for instance, Bayliss et al. JBC 2002 and Bayliss et al. Cell 2000). Randomization of the FG nup sequence would destroy the binding of FG nups to Karyopherins/Importins or make it much weaker, which in our model would correspond to lower interaction parameters <italic>χ</italic> and <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic>. We have modified the text in the Model to make this point clearer and added several new references.</p><p><italic>2) If the minimal model provides an excellent description of nuclear pores, why can synthetic systems not recapitulate the behavior of nuclear pores? The manuscript should emphasize that the model describes some universal features, and more details will have to be added upon considering additional data</italic> – <italic>this point might become more vivid or refuted by addressing the second major point made above.</italic> </p><p>We are in complete agreement with the referees. Synthetic pores – whether using the actual FG nups or synthetic polymers – do not fully reproduce the behavior of the NPC. However, they do recapitulate many aspects of its selectivity – in particular discrimination between the transport proteins and the neutral molecules (Jovanovic-Talisman etal, Nature 2009, Kowalczyk, Nat. Nanotech. 2011, Caspi and Elbaum, Nano Lett 2008 and others). Indeed, these results were one of the motivations for our work because they suggest certain universal features that can be encapsulated in a relatively coarse-grained model. Further details of the NPC transport – such as the multiple FG nup types and RanGDP, to mention a few – need to be introduced into the model to capture the full complexity of NPC architecture and transport. In this respect, our model provides constraints and guides the inclusion of the important molecular details in more detailed theories. We revised the text in the Introduction and Conclusions to emphasize this point and added several new references.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> presents well known results, as is noted in the manuscript, but the original work of Alexander is not cited. Also use of the term &quot;cross-link&quot; here is misleading since this is just a model van der Walls interaction.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this oversight. We have added the reference to the original Alexander paper, as well as to the later work by Sanchez and Haran. We removed the term “cross-link” altogether, and stick to “cohesiveness” throughout the paper. We have rewritten the text in the Model section to explain that <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic>includes all interactions between the chains, including van der Waals, hydrophobic, electrostatic and other possible interactions such as π-π or π-charge interactions.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the two limits that a brush can have from maximal repulsion (stretching) to completely compact. The fact that the experimental observations fall between these two asymptotic limits is expected. But, why is the same Nup at different grafting densities suggesting very different values of</italic> χ<italic>?</italic> </p><p>We are in complete agreement with the referee that this behavior is expected on the polymer physics grounds. However, it was not a priori clear that the grafted FG nup layer can be well described by the polymer brush theory. A number of factors could have led to deviations from this polymer brush behavior – for instance, significant residual secondary structure. This figure indicates that the polymer concepts are applicable to this complex system and serves as the stepping stone for further model with Karyopherins. We revised the text to enhance this point.</p><p>If we understand correctly the second part of the question – the value of <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic> is not determined from the brush height at one value of the grafting distance but from the exponent <italic>g</italic> that characterizes the dependence of the layer height <italic>h</italic> on the grafting distance <italic>a</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf272"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>~</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>The values of <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic> and <italic>χ</italic> are indeed different for different FG nups, reflecting the different sequence and the hydrophobic vs. charge content. We have re-plotted <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and have rewritten the corresponding text to clarify this point.</p><p><italic>5) It appears that the model assumes macroscopic uniform planar layers grafted with one type of FG repeat. Does the model also make accurate predictions for geometries that more accurately resemble the NPC i.e. nanoscopic pores, or mixtures of different FG repeat types?</italic> </p><p>We thank the referee for raising this point. At the moment there are no quantitative data for mixed layers or quantitative experiments in vitro in an NPC-like geometry that could be directly compared with the model. Nevertheless, simulations of the coarse grained representation of the FG nups in the NPC-like geometry (Coalson et al. JPC, 2015) show that the model predictions for the FG nup distribution in such geometry are in general agreement with the more molecular coarse-grained models of Taglizaucchi et al. PNAS 2013 and Ghavami et al. BJ 2014. However we feel that further discussion beyond the scope of the present work, and we intend to investigate it in detail in future work.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p> <italic>1) In the Abstract, we still feel &quot;These results reconcile some of the outstanding controversies</italic>…<italic>&quot; is strong, given that this work does not concretely reconcile, but rather suggest solutions, to the current controversies. Perhaps &quot;These results address some of the outstanding controversies</italic>…<italic>&quot; would be better.</italic></p><p>We revised the Abstract accordingly.</p><p><italic>2) In the Discussion, the sentence &quot;The suggests how the ‘brush’ and</italic>… <italic>effects&quot; is grammatically incorrect and unclear</italic> – <italic>can you please re-write?</italic></p><p>We have rewritten that part of the Discussion.</p><p> <italic>3) On use of data by others: You addressed our comments by including a work that focuses only on Nup98, which represents only one type of FG, one that can form gels in vitro, but are not necessarily representative of others. Even if an experiment is not possible, could you still replicate computational findings by others, if not at a quantitative, at a qualitative level? In the absence of an independent test, again, we would recommend a more cautious approach on claims that the current work resolves different findings. Instead, perhaps emphasize rather that this work presents a tool of utility to future studies.</italic> </p><p> <italic>4) On the omitting of some aspects of FGs, etc: A) Sequence: the explanation about the randomized AA sequence is much improved. However, it would be nice to have a demonstration of the thesis in a case with a simple heterogeneity in sequence, such as in Nsp1 (i.e. difference in property in N-terminal and C-terminal regions). Such a demonstration would also reinforce the paper by possibly recapitulating the computational finding in Yamada et al. (difference in expected structure on N and C-termini).</italic> </p><p>We thank the referee and the editors for suggesting this. We have revised the text along the suggested lines to more accurately frame our results in the context of previous works. In addition, we have analysed the data from Yamada (2010) using our model and find a very good agreement.</p><p>We regret that the assumptions of our model and its relation to previous works were not explained clearly. In fact, our treatment of FG nup cohesiveness is conceptually similar to the analysis of Yamada et al. (2010). That work showed that a single coarse-grained phenomenological parameter could capture the cohesiveness of diverse FG nups. Specifically, FG nup dimensions and biophysical properties were categorized into two distinct classes according to the ratio of the number of hydrophobic to the number of charged amino acids in the FG nup sequence. Our model puts this notion onto a rigorous physical footing, quantitatively defining the cohesiveness via by the parameter <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic>. We stress that this treatment does not assume a randomized sequence but rather integrates the effects of the amino acid composition on the cohesiveness into one model parameter, <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic>. The main focus of our work is the extension of this approach to systematic analysis of the spatial structures of the assemblies of multiple FG nups and their interactions with the transport proteins.</p><p>To put our model in context and to further examine its predictive abilities, we analysed the data in Yamada (2010) from the vantage point of our model, focusing on Nsp1m, Nsp1n, Nup116m and Nup110n. We chose these segments because they are representative of the two classes of FG nups reported in Yamada (2010): the “cohesive” collapsed coils – such as the N terminal domain of Nsp1, (Nsp1n), Nup116m, Nup110n – and the “non-cohesive” extended coils, such as the C terminal domain of Nsp1, Nsp1m. Moreover, this choice enables direct comparisons with grafted planar layers of Nsp1 used in Wagner et al. (2015), which share an overlapping sequence with Nsp1m, grafted layers of Nup98 used in Kapinos et al. (2014) and Nup98 in bulk solutions used by Schmidt and Görlich (2015). Nup116 and Nup100 are yeast analogues of Nup98 and share similar biophysical and functional properties.</p><p>Our results are summarized in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and its Supplement. Briefly, our analysis recapitulates the bimodal distribution of Yamada et al. by using different values of <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic> to characterise the collapsed coils (Nsp1n, Nup100n, and Nup116m) and the “extended coils” (Nsp1m). The values of <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic> arising from the analysis of the Yamada et al. data are entirely consistent with those obtained from the analysis of grafted planar layers of Nsp1 in Wagner et al. (2015), Kapinos et al. (2014) and of Nup98 in Kapinos (2014) and the cohesive bulk solution of Nup98, Nup110, Nup116 in Schmidt and Görlich (2015) barring small quantitative differences in <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic> that can be attributed to intrinsic sequence variations between the used FG nup segments, different buffer conditions and inherent difficulties in inferring chain dimensions from hydrodynamic radii in Yamada et al.</p><p>Consequently, our model is in agreement with other computational models in the regimes where they agree with each other and were compared with the experimental data. For instance, all theories agree that the Nup98/Nup100/Nup116 is more “cohesive” than the C terminal domain of Nsp1. However, current models in the literature lack consistency in their parameterizations as well as in their predictions. For instance, Taglizaucci et al. (2013) predict dimensions of the FG nup coils that are much larger than those predicted by Onck and coworkers, Gamini and Schulten (2014) report formation of FG nup “braids” while the model of Ghavami and Popken does not show those, etc. In light of these discrepancies, our goal was the development of a quantitative model that potentially can explain and reconcile FG Nup behavior observed in independent experiments and computational studies.</p><p>To summarize, with these new results, our theory accounts for the experimentally observed behavior of both cohesive and non-cohesive FG nups and their assemblies (alone and with transport proteins of various sizes). Moreover, model parameterization is consistent across different geometries (planar layers and bulk solutions) and buffers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the most extensive comparison of a theoretical model with experimental data. Hence, we believe that it forms an appropriate basis and a useful tool for future studies of the spatial architectures of the FG nups in various geometries. We modified the text in line with the referee and the editor requests to reflect these points more accurately.</p><p><italic>B) On the geometry of FG grafts: Although further computational investigation of this topic may be beyond the scope of this paper, it is worth discussing the limitations of the current presentation of the simple monolayer geometry and the possible differences/changes in FG behavior/conformation (and/or lack thereof) that could arise from change in geometry (e.g. grafting them in a pore lumen, etc).</italic> </p><p>We thank the referee and the editors for this comment. We have added the appropriate commentary in the Discussion.</p><p> <italic>5) In the Abstract, there is a sentence: &quot;NPC transport relies on the conformational transitions of assembly…&quot;. It is true that the conformation is known to change in in vitro experimental setups, but is there any evidence in NPC-context that supports this statement (i.e. conformational transitions)?</italic> </p><p>This is a good point. Indeed, direct exploration of the conformational changes of the FG nup assemblies within the NPC in vivo is difficult, due to the lack of appropriate experimental methods. However, most of the models (with the possible exception of the virtual gating theory) postulate such transitions based on in vitro observations, generating considerable controversies. Our goal was to address some of these controversies and clarify the salient physical factors governing the behavior of FG nup assemblies with transport proteins.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is some direct evidence of conformational changes of the FG nup assemblies in the NPC: Ma et al., PNAS, (2012) showed that addition of Kap-<italic>β</italic>1 induces changes in the permeability of the NPC that can be interpreted as the conformational changes in the FG nup layer. Eibauer et al., Nature Comm, (2015) found that structural transitions at the nucleoplasmic ring of the NPC resemble the transitions of Nup153 between compact conformation when bound to a transport receptor and an extended conformation in the unbound state. Gratton and coworkers showed that Nup153 is likely to undergo long range conformational changes during transport – Cardarelli et al., PNAS, (2012).</p><p>We have revised the Abstract and the Introduction to more accurately reflect these points.</p><p> <italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is rather crudely rendered, and does not accurately represent the positions of the FG nups indicated. Krull et al., 2004 can be used for Nups 98 and 153, while recent crystallographic work (Chug et al., 2015) indicates the position of Nup62 to be symmetric and immediately adjacent to Nup93 (Krull et al., 2004). Also, the lower two panels as they stand don't really help readers understand what you call the &quot;experimental situation.&quot; This figure should be polished further.</italic> </p><p>We have improved the presentation and revised the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Depiction of the NPC is only schematic with the purpose of illustrating the NPC geometry and architecture. Nevertheless, we agree about the importance of keeping the depiction as accurate as possible, and revised the figure accordingly. We use Chatel et al. (2012) to inform our rendering of the approximate locations of the FG nups on the NPC scaffold. We have added this reference and the references suggested by the reviewer and the editors.</p><p> <italic>7) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, it can be guessed from the context that different curves correspond to different</italic> χ<italic>s, but it's better to specify which curve correspond to what value (or add some direction like an arrow with &quot;increasing</italic> χ<italic>,&quot; etc.</italic> </p><p>We added an arrow indicating the direction of increasing <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic>, and now provide the values of <italic>χ<sub>cr</sub></italic> in the caption.</p><p> <italic>8) For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, please consider omitting &quot;experimental evidence of cohesiveness&quot; from the figure title.
