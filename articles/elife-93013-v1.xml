loss, or isolated eye coloboma. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of human cytoskeletal γ-actin carrying mutation E334Q, a mutation that leads to a hitherto unspecified non-muscle actinopathy. Following expression, purification, and removal of linker and thymosin β4 tag sequences, the p.E334Q monomers show normal integration into linear and branched actin filaments. The mutation does not affect thermal stability, actin filament nucleation, elongation, and turnover. Model building and normal mode analysis predict significant differences in the interaction of p.E334Q filaments with myosin motors and members of the ADF/cofilin family of actin-binding proteins. Assays probing the interactions of p.E334Q filaments with human class 2 and class 5 myosin motor constructs show significant reductions in sliding velocity and actin affinity. E334Q differentially affects cofilin-mediated actin dynamics by increasing the rate of cofilin-mediated de novo nucleation of actin filaments and decreasing the efficiency of cofilin-mediated filament severing. Thus, it is likely that p.E334Q-mediated changes in myosin motor activity, as well as filament turnover, contribute to the observed disease phenotype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>actinopathy</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>myosin</kwd><kwd>cofilin</kwd><kwd>rare disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA1081/23-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manstein</surname><given-names>Dietmar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA1081/28-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manstein</surname><given-names>Dietmar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GM1922B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manstein</surname><given-names>Dietmar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EJP RD COFUND 825575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Di Donato</surname><given-names>Nataliya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005624</institution-id><institution>Hannover Medical School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HiLF I</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greve</surname><given-names>Johannes N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norddeutscher Verbund für Hoch- und Höchstleistungsrechnen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>nib00018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manstein</surname><given-names>Dietmar J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutation E334Q in cytoskeletal γ-actin leads to impaired interaction of actin filaments with actin-binding proteins belonging to the myosin and ADF/cofilin families.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoskeletal β- and γ-actin are the basic building blocks of the actin cytoskeleton in human non-muscle cells. The spatio-temporal regulation of these two actin isoforms, mediated by distinct actin-binding proteins (ABPs), drives the establishment and maintenance of specialized cytoskeletal compartments that are defined by their network architecture and the presence of specific filamentous actin-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pollard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Plastino and Blanchoin, 2018</xref>). The regulated ATP-dependent turnover of these actin networks as well as the coordinated interplay of actin with network-specific ABPs contributes to essential cellular processes like directed migration, adhesion, division, and mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ponti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abercrombie et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Pollard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lauffenburger and Horwitz, 1996</xref>).</p><p>β- and γ-actin differ by only four amino acids in the N-terminal region of the molecule but show isoform-specific spatial organization in studies performed with monoclonal antibodies. In motile and stationary cells, β-actin is found in contractile stress fibers and the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dugina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Latham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dugina et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, γ-actin localization is less static. During cell movement, γ-actin is recruited to the leading edge of the cell, resulting in an enrichment of the isoform in the lamellipodium together with β-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dugina et al., 2009</xref>). In non-moving cell states, γ-actin is co-localized with β-actin in stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dugina et al., 2009</xref>). In order to reconcile the highly similar protein sequences with the varying localization, several hypotheses on isoform regulation were put forward. These include the preferential interaction of ABPs with a particular isoform depending on the minor differences in the protein sequence, post-translational modifications as a means of isoform-specific regulation, and differences in the translation speed of <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1,</italic> the genes encoding cytoskeletal β-actin and γ-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vedula et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pavlyk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Müller et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Diseases associated with heterozygous pathogenic variants in <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> are typically referred to as non-muscle actinopathies. These include a spectrum of rare syndromes that manifest themselves as more or less pronounced developmental disorders in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Verloes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Donato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Latham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rivière et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baraitser and Winter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cuvertino et al., 2017</xref>). Baraitser–Winter cerebrontofacial syndrome (BWCFF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baraitser and Winter, 1988</xref>) is a condition that affects the development of multiple organs, but particularly results in facial anomalies and brain malformations. BWCFF occurs due to various missense mutations in <italic>ACTB</italic> or <italic>ACTG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Verloes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Donato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rivière et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Donato et al., 2016</xref>). BWCFF patients show a recognizable facial gestalt, with variants in <italic>ACTB</italic> generally resulting in a stronger facial phenotype than mutations in <italic>ACTG1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Donato et al., 2014</xref>). BWCFF patients regularly suffer from cortical malformations that lead to severe developmental and mental impairments. In addition, symptoms such as hearing loss, dystonia, hypotonia, and polydactyly occur with increased frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Donato et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rivière et al., 2012</xref>). Variants in <italic>ACTB</italic> alone are responsible for two other well-defined syndromes. <italic>ACTB</italic>-associated pleiotropic malformation syndrome and <italic>ACTB</italic>-associated syndromic thrombocytopenia can be caused by single-point missense mutations, truncating mutations, frameshift mutations, or deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Latham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cuvertino et al., 2017</xref>). These <italic>ACTB</italic>-associated syndromes differ from BWCFF in that they cause only mild craniofacial malformations and developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cuvertino et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Latham et al., 2018</xref>). Selected single-point missense mutations in <italic>ACTG1</italic> lead to a non-syndromic form of hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rendtorff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">van Wijk et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>How exactly mutations in the ubiquitously produced actin isoforms of the cytoskeleton lead to various syndromes and mutation-specific symptoms remains unclear. Currently, four main disease mechanisms are under discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greve et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa et al., 2004</xref>). First, mutations in the actin isoform can lead to functional haploinsufficiency, where the produced molecule is either intrinsically unstable and therefore degraded by the proteasome or unable to associate with other actin molecules and thus unable to partake in the necessary steps involved in the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. This results in a reduced amount of ‘active’ actin molecules, which cannot fully be compensated for by the remaining allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vang et al., 2005</xref>). Second, the mutant protein is produced in normal quantities and integrated into filaments but interferes with actin filament turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa et al., 2004</xref>). Third, the mutation perturbs interactions with ABPs, either by direct or allosteric disturbance of actin–actin or actin–ABP interaction interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greve et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hundt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Müller et al., 2012</xref>). Fourth, the mutant protein shows an increased propensity for forming toxic rod-like oligomeric structures, which can potentially harm the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ilkovski et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schröder et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, one of the significant challenges is elucidating the relationship between the disturbed molecular mechanisms of the cell’s actin dynamics and disease patterns observed in patients. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to resolve the structure–function relationship of the various actin mutations at the molecular level.</p><p>Here, we report the biochemical characterization of p.E334Q, a cytoskeletal γ-actin variant, which causes a syndromic form of non-muscle actinopathy. Features associated with the production of p.E334Q include mild facial anomalies and an abnormal gyral pattern of the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Donato et al., 2016</xref>). At 4 y (age of diagnosis), a patient carrying this mutation showed developmental delay and severe muscle hypotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Donato et al., 2016</xref>). Although the patient was initially reported within the <italic>ACTG1</italic>-associated BWCFF cohort, careful reassessment of the phenotype revealed that the clinical phenotype cannot be classified as BWCFF and is therefore assigned as an unclassified NMA.</p><p>Structural analysis of the disease-causing mutation shows that residue E334 is located in the hinge region of the actin molecule, which connects the two subdomain pairs of the protein. The region’s flexibility and ability to act as a pivot point are essential for the subdomain rearrangement when actin monomers polymerize into filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furthermore, E334 is part of a contact region on the F-actin surface that interacts with the so-called cardiomyopathy loop in the motor domain of cytoskeletal myosin isoforms and contributes to the formation of the actin–cofilin complex (Figure 3).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of actin folding, thermal stability, and nucleotide exchange.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Homology model of human cytoskeletal γ-actin (based on PDB ID: 2BTF).

The thermal stability of p.E334Q resembles that of the wild-type protein, both as a monomer and following integration into filaments. The mutant protein efficiently copolymerizes with wildtype (WT) monomers and integrates into linear and branched filament networks. In contrast, the interaction of mutant filaments with non-muscle myosin-2A/C and myosin-5A is strongly impaired, as shown by in vitro motility experiments and solution kinetics.

The effect of cofilin-1 on existing WT and mutant filaments was initially tested by performing pyrene-based dilution-induced disassembly experiments with actin filaments polymerized for 16 hr and containing predominately ADP actin. Cofilin-1 has previously been shown to increase the bulk disassembly rate of actin in this experimental setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greve et al., 2022</xref>).

The addition of cofilin-1 increased the observed rate of the dilution-induced disassembly in a concentration-dependent manner for both mutant and WT filaments.

However, they cannot distinguish between cofilin-1 binding defects and a disassembly efficiency change. To analyze the perturbed interaction of p.E334Q with cofilin-1 in more detail, we first performed high-speed co-sedimentation assays with constant concentrations of F-actin (5 µM) and increasing concentrations of cofilin-1 (0.0625–20 µM) at pH 6.5 and 7.8. Cofilin-1 binds faster but severs filaments less efficiently under slightly acidic pH conditions, whereas a weakly basic environment favors cofilin-mediated severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wioland et al., 2019</xref>). We first performed experiments at pH 6.5. This endpoint experiment showed that cofilin-1 binds to and disassembles p.E334Q and WT filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Most pellet fractions from the experiments conducted with WT filaments were found to contain less cofilin-1 as higher disassembly efficiency results in more cofilin-1 being bound to actin monomers and retained in the supernatant fraction. We repeated the experiment at pH 7.8 with an equimolar and a twofold excess of cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). In experiments with equimolar cofilin-1, we found significantly less WT actin in the pellet fraction than at pH 6.5, consistent with a higher disassembly efficiency at pH 7.8. The shift to pH 7.8 did not have the same enhancing effect on the disassembly of p.E334Q filaments, as indicated by an increase in p.E334Q actin in the pellet fraction. The endpoint measurements show that cofilin-1 binds to p.E334Q filaments but severs them less efficiently. Next, we performed fluorescence quench experiments with pyrene-labeled WT and p.E334Q filaments as it was previously shown that cofilin-1 efficiently quenches the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanchoin and Pollard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De La Cruz, 2005</xref>).

This setup allows us to observe the binding of eGFP-cofilin-1 to individual filaments and the resulting disassembly of the filaments in real time. eGFP–cofilin-1 was shown to bind to actin filaments and disassemble actin as efficiently as WT cofilin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wioland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Wioland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breitsprecher et al., 2011</xref>). Immediately after mixing 300 nM ‘aged’ actin filaments, capped at their barbed end by human capping protein (CP), with 100 nM eGFP-cofilin-1, the reaction mixture was flushed into a flow chamber and imaging was started. The delay between mixing and the start of imaging was approximately 15 s for each sample. At the end of the experimental dead time, almost twice as many cofilin clusters had formed in the field of view on WT filaments (151 ± 29) as on p.E334Q filaments (82 ± 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the number of both WT and mutant actin filaments had doubled from initially about 95 to about 200 filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and the Atto 655 fluorescence of the WT filaments had decreased to 30% of the starting value, whereas the Atto 655 fluorescence of p.E334Q filaments remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). During the following 500 s, total eGFP-cofilin-1 fluorescence increased linearly, with the rate of increase being approximately twice as fast for WT as for p.E334Q filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). While the total eGFP-cofilin-1 fluorescence in the presence of p.E334Q filaments continued to increase linearly over the next 1000s, the signal for WT filaments began to saturate and reached a plateau value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The number of cofilin clusters on WT filaments decreased steadily during the observation period of 1500s. In contrast, their number increased in the presence of p.E334Q filaments, reaching a maximum after 500 s, followed by a plateau of 400 s and a subsequent slow decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The changes in the number of actin filaments showed similar time dependencies, a steady decrease for WT filaments, and an initial increase for p.E334Q filaments, followed immediately by a linear decrease without an intervening plateau phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). For WT and p.E334Q filaments, the size of eGFP-cofilin-1 clusters on the steadily shrinking filaments expanded continuously until either severing occurred or the actin filament was fully decorated.

To investigate the impact of the mutation on actomyosin affinity using transient kinetic approaches, we determined the dissociation rate constants using a single-headed NM2A-2R construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). NM2A–2 R is a constitutively active motor–domain construct generated by fusing the motor–domain of NM2A to two spectrin–like repeats serving as a rigid lever arm extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anson et al., 1996</xref>).

The dissociation rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>-A</sub> is 5.6–fold increased from 0.08×10<sup>–3</sup> s<sup>– 1</sup> to 0.45×10<sup>–3</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> for NM2A–2 R when p.E334Q filaments are used. A similar change from 0.31×10<sup>–3</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> to 1.70×10<sup>–3</sup> s<sup>–1</sup> was observed for the analogous NM2C–2 R construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we determined the affinities of NM2A–2 R for WT and p.E334Q filaments in the absence of nucleotide (K<sub>A</sub>) and the presence of saturating concentrations of ADP (K<sub>DA</sub>). We performed affinity–titration experiments with pyrene–labeled, phalloidin–stabilized filaments and NM2A–2 R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kurzawa and Geeves, 1996</xref>). The values measured under rigor conditions show a 9.9-fold reduced affinity of NM2A-2R for p.E334Q filaments (<italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> = 16.9 ± 1.3 nM) compared to WT filaments (<italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub> = 1.7 ± 0.3 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).

The apparent ATP affinity (1<italic>/K</italic><sub>1</sub>), the maximal dissociation rate of NM2A from F-actin in the presence of ATP (<italic>k</italic><sub>+2</sub>), and the apparent second-order rate constant of ATP binding (<italic>K</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>k</italic><sub>+2</sub>) showed no significant differences for complexes formed between NM2A and WT or p.E334Q filaments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the effects of the E334Q mutation on the motile activity of the processive motor Myo5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Since the lysine residue corresponding to K429 in the CM loop of NM2C is also present in all human myosin-5 isoforms, the resulting changes in binding strength and thermodynamic coupling are expected to reduce the motor activity of Myo5A upon interactions with p.E334Q filaments. Structural studies have shown that the interaction between actin residue E334 and the CM loop in the Myo5A motor domain is maintained from the rigor to the ADP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pospich et al., 2021</xref>). We performed unloaded in vitro motility assays to evaluate the effect of the mutation on the interaction with Myo5A-HMM. The rapid transition from weak to strong binding with a slow and rate-limiting ADP release leading to a high working ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De La Cruz et al., 1999</xref>) allows the in vitro motility assay to be performed on surfaces with a low motor density. In initial experiments, we found a Myo5A-HMM surface density of 770 molecules µm<sup>–2</sup> to be optimal for experiments with WT filaments. This much lower optimal motor surface density compared to the NM2A-HMM construct, which requires densities above 10,000 molecules per μm<sup>2</sup>, is a manifestation of the processive properties of the Myo5A-HMM construct. Movement was steady and filament breaks were practically non-existent at 770 molecules µm<sup>–2</sup>, while higher surface densities led to increased filament breaks, resulting in rapid fragmentation. At all Myo5A-HMM surface densities used, the sliding velocity was significantly reduced for p.E334Q compared to WT filaments. In experiments with p.E334Q filaments, a fourfold higher Myo5A-HMM surface density was required to achieve a similar actin surface decoration and optimal motile activity. Furthermore, filament breaks occurred less frequently, indicating a weaker actomyosin interaction. The number of moving filaments and their sliding velocity decreased sharply below surface densities of 770 molecules µm<sup>–2</sup> for WT filaments and 3100 molecules µm<sup>–2</sup> for p.E334Q filaments. Below a surface density of 380 Myo5A-HMM molecules µm<sup>–2</sup>, no productive attachment events were observed with p.E334Q filaments. Thus, mutation E334Q in cytoskeletal γ-actin leads to an impairment of the interaction of the actin filament with Myo5A, similar to the changes observed with NM2A and NM2C, but with additional manifestations specific to processive motors.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Analysis of the interaction of human Myo5A-HMM with WT and p.E334Q γ-actin in the unloaded in vitro motility assay at different Myo5A surface densities.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The interaction of surface-immobilized Myo5A-HMM with WT γ-actin and p.E334Q γ-actin filaments was analyzed using the unloaded in vitro motility assay.

Two mutants showed abnormal polymerization behavior, indicated by a reduced polymerization rate (p.V370A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2006</xref>) or an increased propensity for bundle formation (p.E241K) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morín et al., 2009</xref>). The mutants p.K118N/M showed a perturbed interaction with the Arp2/3 complex, reducing branching efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kruth and Rubenstein, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jepsen et al., 2016</xref>). A significantly reduced protein stability was observed for two mutant proteins (p.P264L, p.P332A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bryan et al., 2006</xref>). Perturbed interactions with cofilin were observed for a range of mutations. p.T89I, p.E241K, p.T278I, and p.V370A are characterized by an increased sensitivity to cofilin-mediated filament severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bryan and Rubenstein, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, mutation p.P332A, close to the analyzed mutation p.E334Q, enhances resistance toward cofilin-mediated severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bryan and Rubenstein, 2009</xref>). The perturbed cofilin interaction is the only overlap between the spectrum of molecular phenotypes observed for syndromic deafness-associated mutations and mutation p.E334Q, which results in a non-syndromic actinopathy. It has to be noted that all cited studies relied on the use of actin purified from budding yeast for their biochemical studies, which shows 91% sequence identity to human cytoskeletal γ-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ng and Abelson, 1980</xref>).</p><p>Here, we describe mutation E334Q in cytoskeletal γ-actin that leads to a syndromic actinopathy with hypotonia and is not associated with non-syndromic hearing loss. Our biochemical analysis shows that the mutation does not affect the folding of the actin monomer or the stability of the monomer and the resulting filaments, demonstrating that mutations in the hinge region do not necessarily affect protein stability. The mutant protein displays a robust interaction with the VCA-activated Arp2/3 complex. Its polymerization kinetics are equivalent to those of the WT protein, with which it effectively copolymerizes in vitro. Based on these observations, we exclude functional haploinsufficiency as a potential disease mechanism and favor a mechanism in which p.E334Q integrates into the cytoskeletal actin networks of the cell but shows defects in the interaction with key binding partners. Consistent with this hypothesis and based on several structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pospich et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behrmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Robert-Paganin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Risi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fujii and Namba, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gyimesi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gurel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">von der Ecken et al., 2016</xref>) as well as our initial modeling of complexes formed by p.E334Q filaments, we observed perturbed interactions with cofilin-1 and human cytoskeletal myosin isoforms NM2A, NM2C, and Myo5A (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>We interpret the observed changes in the interaction with NM2A, NM2C, and Myo5A to primarily reflect the weakening of complementary interactions between actin residue E334 and a core contact triad in the myosin CM loop, which in the case of NM2C consists of K429 and hydrophobic residues I420 and V427 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Analogous changes in the interaction of mutant filaments with Myo1D, Myo1G, NM2B, Myo5B, Myo5C, and Myo19 are expected due to the presence of the core contact triad residues in their CM loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In contrast, the absence of a basic residue corresponding to K429 in NM2C and additional changes affecting their CM loop structure make it difficult to predict the consequences for the interaction of p.E334Q filaments with the cytoskeletal myosin isoforms Myo1A, Myo1C, Myo1E, Myo1F, Myo3A, Myo3B, Myo15, Myo18A, Myo18B, and Myo19.</p><p>In addition to primary consequences, reflected in the observed changes in the binding interactions with NM2A and cofilin-1, our results point to significant changes that result from allosteric perturbations. The results from our transient kinetic analysis of the complexes formed by p.E334Q with NM2A-2R indicate that reduced allosteric coupling between the actin- and nucleotide-binding sites within the myosin motor domain contributes to the observed decrease in motor activity. The coupling efficiency is given by the ratio of the dissociation equilibrium constants for actin binding in the absence (<italic>K</italic><sub>A</sub>) and presence of ADP (<italic>K</italic><sub>DA</sub>). The value for <italic>K</italic><sub>DA</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> obtained for the interaction of NM2A-2R in the presence of p.E334Q (20.9) is 3.5-fold lower than the value measured in the presence of WT actin (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Allosteric perturbations are also major contributors mediating the impact of mutation E334Q to the changes in elastic properties and the rate of actin filament disassembly in the presence of cofilin-1. Our results are consistent with the E334Q mutation slowing the initial complex formation due to less favorable charge interactions and allosteric perturbations having a major impact on subsequent steps.</p><p>Patients carrying mutations in <italic>ACTB</italic> or <italic>ACTG1</italic> predominately suffer from developmental disabilities, which can be directly linked to cortical malformations of varying severity. Therefore, neuronal cells and/or neuronal progenitor cells are assumed to be the most affected cell population in the patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Verloes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Donato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rivière et al., 2012</xref>).

Studies of the spatial localization of the cytoskeletal actin isoforms in the mature neuron are contradictory. A study showing that β- and γ-actin strongly colocalize in hippocampal and cerebral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheever et al., 2012</xref>) appears to contradict previous studies, which reported spatial enrichment of β-actin in dynamic structures such as the dendritic spine and exclusion from less dynamic structures such as the axon shaft, where γ-actin was found to be enriched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Weinberger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Micheva et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bassell et al., 1998</xref>). Based on our results, we conclude that p.E334Q actin is readily produced and integrated into the cytoskeletal actin networks of neuronal cells, where it perturbs interactions with cytoskeletal myosin isoforms that play essential roles in the function and maintenance of healthy neurons. The functions of myosin-5 isoforms in neuronal cells are all linked to their role as actin barbed-end-directed processive cargo transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hammer and Wagner, 2013</xref>). Several of the myosin-5-driven transport processes are important contributors to synaptic plasticity, that is, the ability of the neurons to change synaptic strength based on previous activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hammer and Wagner, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The different NM2 isoforms are found in a wide range of cell types in the brain, but they show varying spatial expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murakami and Elzinga, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Golomb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rochlin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kawamoto and Adelstein, 1991</xref>). NM2A is predominately enriched in the vasculature of the brain, consistent with the importance of NM2A for angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). NM2B and NM2C are mainly found in growth cones and dendritic spines of neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murakami and Elzinga, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Golomb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Rochlin et al., 1995</xref>). NM2 isoforms are known to contribute to various neuronal processes, but unlike for Myo5A, their exact role is less well understood. NM2B was shown to determine the maturation and morphology of the dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons and was additionally linked to basal synaptic function and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rex et al., 2010</xref>). NM2C and NM2B contribute to the differentiation of oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domingues et al., 2020</xref>). The NM2 isoforms compete with proteins of the ADF/cofilin family for binding to F-actin, and this competition is essential for stable actomyosin contractility and an intact cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wiggan et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In line with this, ADF/cofilin family members are highly abundant in growth cones and dendritic spines and essential for spine morphology and determination of spine length by modulating actin turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Star et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hotulainen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Namme et al., 2021</xref>). Cofilin-mediated severing and nucleation were previously proposed to synergistically contribute to global actin turnover in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Du and Frieden, 1998</xref>). Our results show that the mutation affects these different cofilin functions in actin dynamics in opposite ways. Cofilin-mediated filament nucleation is more efficient for p.E334Q monomers, while cofilin-mediated severing of filaments containing p.E334Q is significantly reduced. The interaction of both actin monomers and actin filaments with ADF/cofilin proteins involves several distinct overlapping reactions. In the case of actin filaments, cofilin binding is followed by structural modification of the filament, severing and depolymerizing the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De La Cruz and Sept, 2010</xref>). Cofilin binding to monomeric actin is followed by the closure of the nucleotide cleft and the formation of stabilized ‘long-pitch’ actin dimers, which stimulate nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>).</p><p>While the number of disease-associated mutations reported for <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> is steadily increasing, the total number of patients affected remains low compared to patients with disease-associated mutations in muscle actin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). High sequence and structure conservation across all actin isoforms enable us to extrapolate our findings obtained with cytoskeletal γ-actin to diseases associated with mutations of E334 in other actin isoforms. Mutations of residue E334 in α-skeletal actin (encoded by <italic>ACTA1</italic>) are reported to result in nemaline myopathy (E334K; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laing et al., 2009</xref>) or core myopathy (E334A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaindl et al., 2004</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parker et al., 2020</xref>). The mutations either lead to the inversion of the charge at residue 334 (E334K) or the complete loss of charge (E334A). Our study shows that loss of charge at actin residue 334 leads to the loss of a conserved core contact between actin and the myosin motor domain of cytoskeletal class 2 myosin. Skeletal muscle myosin-2 is a central component of the sarcomere. The myosin forms the thick filaments that interact with the thin filaments formed by actin and regulatory proteins, generating force that powers muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sweeney and Hammers, 2018</xref>). Because the core contact triad that interacts with actin residue E334 is present in all class 2 myosin isoforms, it is reasonable to assume that mutations of residue E334 in α-skeletal actin affect the interaction with skeletal muscle myosin-2 to a similar extent, resulting in less efficient force generation and thereby contributing to the development of myopathy in patients.</p><p>Interestingly, a recent study analyzing the prevalence of cytoskeletal actin mutations in cancer using the cBioPortal database found that mutations in <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> are associated with lymphoid cancers, specifically mutations in <italic>ACTB</italic> with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and mutations in <italic>ACTG1</italic> with multiple myeloma. When the authors extended the analysis to all cancer types, they found that the observed mutations in the two genes were scattered across the entire actin sequence, with no apparent preference for a particular region. Nevertheless, the group identified residue E334 in <italic>ACTB</italic> as a potential hotspot as the missense variants p.E334Q/p.E334K are more frequent in all analyzed datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Witjes et al., 2020</xref>). In this article, we investigated the impact of the E334Q exchange on the function of cytoskeletal γ-actin in the context of developmental diseases. However, the high sequence similarity between the cytoskeletal actin isoforms makes it highly likely that the E334Q mutation in cytoskeletal β-actin results in similar molecular perturbations of actin dynamics but with potentially different consequences for the organism due to varying enrichment of the two isoforms in functional compartments of the actin cytoskeleton. Although future studies are needed to determine the role of <italic>ACTB</italic> and <italic>ACTG1</italic> mutations as driver or passenger mutations in different cancers, our data show a possible link between impaired cytoskeletal actomyosin dynamics, cofilin-mediated actin turnover, and cancer development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>The coding sequence of human cytoskeletal γ-actin (UniProt ID: P63261) was fused via a C-terminal linker to a His<sub>6</sub>-tagged thymosin β4 moiety (UniProt ID: P62328), as previously described for yeast actin (UniProt ID: P60010) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Noguchi et al., 2007</xref>).

This work thoroughly characterizes the effect of the E334Q mutation in cytoplasmic gamma-actin on two binding partners: cofilin and myosin (non-muscle myosin 2 and myosin 5).

A TIRF assay showed a small but significant reduction in the rate of elongation of the mutant actin suggesting only a mild polymerization defect.</p><p>Based on in silico analysis of the close location of the actin point mutation and bound cofilin, cofilin was chosen for further investigation. Faster de novo nucleation by cofilin was observed with mutant actin. In contrast, the mutant actin was more slowly severed. Both effects favor the retention of filamentous mutant actin. In solution, the effect of cofilin concentration and pH was assessed for both WT and mutant actin filaments, with a more limited repertoire of conditions in a TIRF assay that directly showed slower severing of mutant actin.</p><p>Lastly, the mutated residue in actin is predicted to interact with the cardiomyopathy loop in myosin and thus a standard in vitro motility assay with immobilized motors was used to show that non-muscle myosin 2A moved mutant actin more slowly, explained in part by a reduced affinity for the filament deduced from transient kinetic assays. By the same motility assay, myosin 5A also showed impaired interaction with the mutant filaments.</p><p>The Discussion is interesting and concludes that the mutant actin will co-exist with WT actin in filaments, and will contribute to altered actin dynamics and poor interaction with relevant myosin motors in the cellular context.

These results indicate a reduction in binding affinity and coupling efficiency, with a likely impact on processivity. We expect only a small incremental gain in knowledge about the extent of changes by performing additional experiments with an inverted assay geometry, given that under physiological conditions the motor properties of Myo5A and other cytoskeletal myosins are modulated by other factors such as the presence of tropomyosin isoforms and other actin binding proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Greve et al. investigated the effects of a disease-associated gamma-actin mutation (E334Q) on actin filament polymerization, association of selected actin-binding proteins, and myosin activity.

While the recombinant actin in the 2013 study was produced tag-free and purified by affinity chromatography using the column-immobilized actin-binding domain of gelsolin (G4-G6), we have no reason to assume that the purification strategy using the actin-thymosin-β4 changes the efficiency of the N-terminal processing in Sf-9 cells. This is supported by our, yet unpublished, mass-spectrometric studies on recombinant human α-cardiac actin purified using the actin- thymosin-β4 fusion construct, which revealed actin species with an acetylated aspartate-3. This N-terminal modification of α-cardiac actin is catalyzed by the same actinspecific acetyltransferase (NAA80) as the acetylation of asparate-2 or glutamate-2 in cytoskeletal actin isoforms (Varland et al., 2019, Trends in Biochemical Sciences). Furthermore, additional studies that used the actin-thymosin-β4 fusion construct for the production of recombinant human cytoskeletal actin isoforms in Pichia pastoris reported robust N-terminal acetylation, when the actin was co-produced with NAA80 (In contrast to Sf-9 cells, NAA80 is not endogenously expressed in Pichia pastoris) (Hatano et al., 2020, Journal of Cell Science).</p><p>We therefore, added the following statement to the manuscript:</p><p>“Purification of the fusion protein by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, followed by chymotrypsin–mediated cleavage of C–terminal linker and tag sequences, results in homogeneous protein without non–native residues and native N-terminal processing, which includes cleavage of the initial methionine and acetylation of the following glutamate. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors do not use the best technique to assess actin polymerization parameters.

These experiments show clearly that, especially at the higher cofilin-1 concentration (100 nM), the filament number is strongly increased in experiments performed with mutant actin. Inspection of the corresponding videos of these TIRFM experiments suggest that the increased number of filaments must result from an increased number of de novo nucleation events and not primarily from a mutation-induced change in severing susceptibility. The observation of a cofilin-stimulated increase in the de novo nucleation efficiency of actin was initially described by Andrianantoandro &amp; Pollard (2006, Molecular Cell) using TIRFMbased experiments and is thought to arise from the stabilization of thermodynamically unfavorable actin dimers and trimers by cofilin. While the exact role of this cofilin-mediated effect in vivo is not completely clear, it is thought to contribute to cofilin-meditated actin dynamics synergistically with cofilin-mediated severing. It is therefore necessary, to clearly distinguish between the two effects of cofilin in vitro: stimulation of de novo nucleation and stimulation of filament disassembly. Our data indicated that the E334Q mutation affects these two effects differentially, as we state in the abstract and in the discussion.</p><p>Abstract: “E334Q differentially affects cofilin-mediated actin dynamics by increasing the rate of cofilin-mediated de novo nucleation of actin filaments and decreasing the efficiency of cofilin-mediated filament severing.”</p><p>Discussion: “Cofilin-mediated severing and nucleation were previously proposed to synergistically contribute to global actin turnover in cells (Andrianantoandro &amp; Pollard, 2006; Du &amp; Frieden, 1998). Our results show that the mutation affects these different cofilin functions in actin dynamics in opposite ways. Cofilin-mediated filament nucleation is more efficient for p.E334Q monomers, while cofilin-mediated severing of filaments containing p.E334Q is significantly reduced. The interaction of both actin monomers and actin filaments with ADF/cofilin proteins involves several distinct overlapping reactions. In the case of actin filaments, cofilin binding is followed by structural modification of the filament, severing and depolymerizing the filament (De La Cruz &amp; Sept, 2010). Cofilin binding to monomeric actin is followed by the closure of the nucleotide cleft and the formation of stabilized “long-pitch” actin dimers, which stimulate nucleation (Andrianantoandro &amp; Pollard, 2006)”.</p><p>We interpret the reviewer's suggestion to mean that additional pyrene-actin-based bulk polymerization experiments should be performed to investigate the bulk-polymerization rate of ATP-G-actin in the presence of cofilin-1. In our understanding, these experiment would not provide additional value as (1) An observed increase of the bulk-polymerization rate cannot be directly correlated to a change of the efficiency of de novo nucleation or severing and (2) the effect of the mutation on cofilin-mediated filament disassembly was extensively analyzed in other experiments starting from preformed actin filaments. Moreover, our results are consistent with in silico modelling and normal mode analysis of the WT and mutant actin-cofilin complex.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 5 A: in the pyrene disassembly assay, where actin is diluted below its critical concentration, cofilin enhances the rate of depolymerization by generating more free ends.

When heterofilaments were used, the effect of the mutation was reduced to a 2.2-fold difference compared to WT filaments (1.54 × 10-4 ± 0.11 × 10-4 nM-1 s-1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 5 B and C: the cosedimentation data do not seem to help elucidate the underlying mechanism.

We think the co-sedimentation experiments are useful, as they show that cofilin-1 efficiently binds to mutant filaments, but is less efficient in stimulating disassembly in these endpoint-experiments.

We interpret this statement as advice to be cautious when extrapolating the observed perturbances of cofilin-mediated actin dynamics in vitro to the in vivo context. We think we are cautious about this throughout the manuscript.</p><p>The author expects a U-shape curve, as high cofilin concentrations are reported to stabilize actin filaments by completely decorating the filament before severing-prone boundaries between cofilin-decorated and undecorated regions are generated. We have also performed these experiment with cytoskeletal β-actin and human cofilin-1 and never observed this U shape. This indicates that significant filament disassembly also happens at high cofilin concentrations, most likely directly after mixing of F-actin and cofilin. We cannot rule out that the incubation time plays an important role and that the U-shape only appears after longer incubation times. We also want to direct the reviewer to the publication “A Mechanism for Actin Filament Severing by Malaria Parasite Actin Depolymerizing Factor 1 via a Low Affinity Binding Interface” (Wong et al. 2013, JBC) in which comparable co-sedimentation experiments were performed (Figure 5E-G) with rabbit skeletal α-actin and human cofilin-1 and also no Ushaped curves were observed, even at higher molar excess of cofilin-1 compared to our experiments and with longer incubation times (1 hour vs. 10 minutes).</p><p>We now included an exemplary gel showing co-sedimentation experiments performed with WT, mutant actin and different concentrations of cofilin at pH 7.8 in the manuscript (Figure 5 – figure supplement 2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Figure 5 D: these data show that the binding of cofilin to WT and E334Q actin is approximately the same, with the mutant binding slightly more weakly.

Rather, this jiggling is more likely to be related to a lower duty ratio of the myosins, which appears to be the conclusion reached for the myosin-V data.

For NM2A-HMM densities below about 10,000 molecules per μm2, the average sliding speed for cytoskeletal actin filaments drops steeply (Hundt et al, 2016). Filaments formed by p.E334Q actin move 5fold slower, resulting in an observed average sliding velocity of 39.1 ± 3.2 nm/s. Filaments copolymerized from a 1:1 mixture of WT and p.E334Q actin move with an average sliding velocity of 131.2 ± 10 nm s–1 (Figure 8A, B).

Therefore, we changed the paragraph in the Results section concerning this experiment to:</p><p>“The apparent ATP–affinity (1/K1), the maximal dissociation rate of NM2A from F-actin in the presence of ATP (k+2), and the apparent second-order rate constant of ATP binding (K1k+2) showed no significant differences for complexes formed between NM2A and WT or p.E334Q filaments (Table 1, Figure 8 – figure supplement 3).”</p><p>and the section in the Material and Methods to:</p><p>“The apparent ATP–affinity of the actomyosin complex was determined by mixing the apyrase–treated, pyrene–labeled, phalloidin–stabilized actomyosin complex with increasing concentrations of ATP at the stopped–flow system. Fitting an exponential function to the individual transients yields the ATP–dependent dissociation rate of NM2A–2R from F–actin (kobs). The kobs–values were plotted against the corresponding ATP concentrations and a hyperbola was fitted to the data. The fit yields the apparent ATP–affinity (1/K1) of the actomyosin complex and the maximal dissociation rate k+2.</p><p>The apparent second–order rate constant for ATP binding (K1k+2) was determined by applying a linear fit to the data obtained at low ATP concentrations (0 – 25 µM).”</p><p>For a better understanding of the numerous rate and equilibrium constants, we have now included a figure showing the kinetic reaction scheme of the myosin ATPase cycle (Figure 8 – figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The subdomains of actin are mislabeled in Fig. 1A.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>The labeling of the subdomains has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Additional experimental data addressing the 3 weaknesses noted in the public review would be informative but are not essential in my opinion.

The results obtained in the presence of 100 nM cofilin allow a particularly informative depiction of the differences observed with mutant and WT actin. This applies to the image series showing the changes in filament length, cofilin clusters, and filament number as well as to the graphs showing time dependent changes in the number of filaments and total actin fluorescence. We have not included the results for a 50:50 mixture of WT:mutant actin because its attenuating effect is documented in several other experiments in the manuscript.</p><p>Our results with Myo5A show a less productive interaction with mutant actin filaments as indicated by a 1.7-fold reduction in the average sliding velocity and an increase in the optimal Myo5A-HMM surface density from 770 to 3100 molecules per µm2. These results indicate a reduction in binding affinity and coupling efficiency, with a likely impact on processivity. Given that Myo5A is only one of many cytoskeletal myosin motors and that the motor properties of all myosins are modulated by the presence of tropomyosin isoforms and other actin binding proteins, we expect only a small incremental gain in knowledge by performing additional experiments with an inverted assay geometry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors should address the concerns regarding the statistical methodologies.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>We have gone through the manuscript carefully to correct any errors in the statistics, as explained below.</p><p>Figure 1B, 5B, 5C, 5D, 8D, 9B, and 8 – figure supplement 2 all show the mean ± SD, as also correctly reported for Figure 8E and 8F in the figure legend.
