Both peptides and their receptors are expressed at high levels in pain-responsive neurons from the periphery to the brain making them attractive therapeutic targets. However, drugs targeting these pathways individually did not relieve pain in clinical trials. Since Substance P and CGRPα are extensively co-expressed, we hypothesized that their simultaneous inhibition would be required for effective analgesia. We therefore generated <italic>Tac1</italic> and <italic>Calca</italic> double knockout (DKO) mice and assessed their behavior using a wide range of pain-relevant assays. As expected, Substance P and CGRPα peptides were undetectable throughout the nervous system of DKO mice. To our surprise, these animals displayed largely intact responses to mechanical, thermal, chemical, and visceral pain stimuli, as well as itch. Moreover, chronic inflammatory pain and neurogenic inflammation were unaffected by loss of the two peptides. Finally, neuropathic pain evoked by nerve injury or chemotherapy treatment was also preserved in peptide-deficient mice. Thus, our results demonstrate that even in combination, Substance P and CGRPα are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>somatosensation</kwd><kwd>neuropeptides</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZIAAT000028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chesler</surname><given-names>Alexander Theodore</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001710</institution-id><institution>Branco Weiss Fellowship - Society in Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacDonald</surname><given-names>Donald Iain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacDonald</surname><given-names>Donald Iain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Even in combination, Substance P and CGRPα are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over a hundred neuropeptides are expressed by mammalian neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Russo, 2017</xref>). Neuropeptides are released through the secretory pathway and activate G-protein coupled receptors to control neuronal excitability and synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pagani et al., 2019</xref>). They can also influence the function of immune cells in peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu et al., 2012</xref>). Drugs acting on neuropeptides or their receptors are now widely used in the clinic, including therapeutics for obesity and migraine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drucker, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ogunlaja and Goadsby, 2022</xref>). Which peptides can be targeted successfully and for what indications thus remain key questions for neuroscience and drug development.</p><p>Among the most challenging diseases to treat is chronic pain. With over 20% of the population suffering from chronic pain, we urgently need to find new analgesic targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nahin et al., 2023</xref>). The two neuropeptides most strongly implicated in chronic pain are Substance P and CGRPα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Matteis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Paige et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yaksh et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zieglgänsberger, 2019</xref>). Substance P is an 11-amino acid peptide first discovered as a tissue extract with contractile activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">V Euler and Gaddum, 1931</xref>). CGRPα is a 37-amino acid peptide and potent vasodilator identified as the alternatively spliced product of the calcitonin gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amara et al., 1982</xref>). Both Substance P and CGRPα are highly expressed in pain-responsive neurons throughout the nervous system. In the periphery, strong activation of nociceptor sensory neurons is reported to cause peptide secretion and neurogenic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, release of Substance P and CGRPα in the spinal cord and brainstem may alter pain transmission in ascending pain pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Latremoliere and Woolf, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Löken et al., 2021</xref>). In the brain, these molecules are prominently enriched in areas known to be involved in pain, including the periaqueductal grey, parabrachial nucleus and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palmiter, 2018</xref>). Thus, decades of research implicate Substance P and CGRPα as critical drivers of pain, including modulating tissue inflammation, sensory hypersensitivity, pain chronification and unpleasantness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Matteis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zieglgänsberger, 2019</xref>).</p><p>However, selective antagonists of the Substance P receptor NKR1 failed to relieve chronic pain in human clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill, 2000</xref>). Although CGRP monoclonal antibodies and receptor blockers have proven effective for subsets of migraine patients, their usefulness for other types of pain in humans is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Matteis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). In line with this, knockout mice deficient in Substance P, CGRPα or their receptors have been reported to display some pain deficits, but the analgesic effects are neither large nor consistent between studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Felipe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salmon et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Salmon et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zimmer et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, ablating or inhibiting peptidergic nociceptors causes profound decreases in heat sensitivity, inflammatory heat hyperalgesia, and some forms of mechanical allodynia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cowie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCoy et al., 2013</xref>). Mice with silenced Substance P or CGRPα-expressing neurons in brain areas such as the parabrachial nucleus also show impaired pain behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). In the periphery, Substance P and CGRPα are expressed by largely the same nociceptors, in mice and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>). The two peptides are also co-expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pauli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>). Redundancy is built into pain pathways because of their importance for survival and may explain why attenuating the signaling of a single peptide does not recapitulate the analgesic effect of silencing the cell secreting it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vandewauw et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Given the well-described roles for peptidergic neurons in pain and the widespread co-expression of Substance P and CGRPα, we reasoned that removal of both peptides should reveal roles for peptidergic signaling that might be masked by redundancy. We therefore generated and characterized <italic>Tac1::Calca</italic> double knockout (DKO) mice lacking both Substance P and CGRPα peptides. We predicted these DKO animals might recapitulate the striking absence of inflammatory pain observed in naked mole rats that release glutamate but not Substance P or CGRPα from nociceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2003</xref>).

We began by developing a cell-based assay to monitor signaling through the Substance P receptor (NKR1) by generating HEK293 cells stably expressing NKR1, GCaMP6s and Gα15 (so-called ‘Substance P-sniffer’ cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These cells responded to low nanomolar concentrations of Substance P (EC<sub>50</sub>=21 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but were insensitive to CGRPα. We reasoned that in co-cultures with DRG neurons, application of the potent TRPV1 agonist capsaicin (10 μM) would stimulate nociceptors to release Substance P and thereby activate neighboring Substance P-sniffer cells. Control DRGs treated with capsaicin evoked robust GCaMP responses in surrounding Substance P-sniffer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). In contrast, capsaicin stimulated DKO-DRG neurons induced no Substance P-sniffer cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><p>We also developed a cell-based approach to monitor CGRP release from nociceptors. The CGRP receptor consists of two co-receptors encoded by the genes <italic>Calcrl</italic> and <italic>Ramp1</italic>. We therefore engineered a stable inducible HEK293 sniffer cell line that expressed Calcrl, Ramp1, GCaMP6s and Gα15. These cells responded to low nanomolar concentrations of CGRPα (EC<sub>50</sub>=27 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but were insensitive to Substance P. When we cultured WT DRG neurons with the CGRP-sniffer cells, we observed strong increases in calcium consistent with CGRP receptor activity in response to capsaicin application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). However, DKO neurons evoked markedly reduced activity in the adjacent sniffer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Thus, <italic>Calca</italic> deletion largely abolished endogenous CGRPα signaling. In combination, these experiments demonstrate that deletion of <italic>Tac1</italic> and <italic>Calca</italic> completely blocks the endogenous activation of Substance P and CGRP receptors by nociceptor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of Substance P and CGRPα does not affect acute pain or itch</title><p>To understand whether neuropeptide signaling is required for pain sensation, we performed a comprehensive battery of somatosensory behavior tests on DKO and wild-type control mice (WT). Notably, regardless of the type of mechanical or thermal stimulus, groups of animals showed no difference in their behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, responses to mechanical stimulation by von Frey hairs, pinpricks or an alligator clip were quantitatively indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). In addition, withdrawal responses to radiant heat stimulation (Hargreaves’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), and to two noxious Hot Plate temperatures were unaffected in DKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Responses to cold evoked by acetone and dry ice were also the same between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). Intraplantar injection of the Trpv1 agonist capsaicin evoked coping-like licking responses in both genotypes; however, responses were variable and although decreased licking was observed in some DKO mice, differences did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Therefore, to explore this potential difference using an independent measure, we quantified capsaicin-evoked Fos staining as a correlate of dorsal horn network activation. No differences in dorsal horn Fos expression were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Furthermore, intraplantar injection of a different algogen (the Trpa1 agonist allyl isothiocyanate, AITC) evoked similar licking behavior to capsaicin that was unaffected by peptide deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Together these data suggest that loss of the two neuropeptides does not alter acute withdrawal or coping-like responses to multiple modalities of damaging stimuli applied to the paw.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tac1::Calca DKO mice respond to acute painful and itching stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 50% withdrawal threshold for von Frey punctate stimulation (log g). n=14 (7M, 7 F) for WT &amp; n=14 (7M, 7 F) for DKO.

Next, DRGs were mechanically triturated with three fire-polished glass Pasteur pipettes of gradually decreasing inner diameter. Dissociated cells were then centrifuged again at 300 revolutions per minute, the supernatant was discarded and cells were re-suspended in the required volume of DMEM supplemented with FBS and nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml). Finally, cells were plated onto 8-well glass slides coated with poly-L-lysine (1 mg/ml) and laminin (1 mg/ml), and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. 24 hr later, Substance P-sniffer cells were resuspended in DMEM/F-12, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and nerve growth factor (50 ng/ml). 70,000 cells were dispensed into each imaging well containing DRG neurons, and incubated for at least a further 24 hr before imaging was performed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>In vitro imaging</title><p>Imaging was performed in Ringer’s solution: 125 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 10 mM HEPES (all from Sigma-Aldrich), adjusted to pH 7.3 with 1 M NaOH, and osmolality measured ~280 mmol/kg. SP-sniffer cells alone, or co-cultured with DRGs, were rinsed in Ringer’s solution and imaged in Ringer’s solution at room temperature on an Olympus IX73 inverted microscope using a pco.panda sCMOS back-illuminated camera at 2 frames/s. Tac1-RFP was excited at 560 nm LED and GCaMP6f at 488 nm. All imaging trials began with 15 s of baseline measurement and then the cells were treated with chemicals by micropipette. The chemicals used were capsaicin (10 μM) and Substance P amide (1 pM to 1 μM). The peak ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was calculated to quantify the changes in fluorescence associated with chemical application, with F<sub>0</sub> defined as the mean fluorescence intensity of the entire field of view in the 5 s immediately preceding stimulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral assays</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Von Frey</title><p>Punctate mechanical sensitivity was measured using the up-down method of Chaplan to obtain a 50% withdrawal threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>). Mice were habituated on a mesh wire stand for 1 hr. A 0.16 g Von Frey hair was applied to the plantar region of the paw for 2 s. A response was recorded when the mouse swiftly lifted its paw in response to the stimulus. A positive response resulted in application of a filament of lesser strength on the following trial, and no response in application of a stronger filament. To calculate the 50% withdrawal threshold, five responses surrounding the 50% threshold were obtained after the first change in response. The pattern of responses was used to calculate the 50% threshold = (10[χ+κδ]/10,000), where χ is the log of the final von Frey filament used, κ=tabular value for the pattern of responses and δ the mean difference between filaments used in log units. The log of the 50% threshold was used to calculate summary and test statistics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Pinprick</title><p>Mice were habituated on a mesh wire stand for 1 hr. A 27-gauge needle was blunted and used to apply pressure to the hind paw. A withdrawal response was quantified as the mouse lifting the paw swiftly away from the blunted needle. The pinprick stimulation was repeated for 5 or 10 trials with 5-min breaks inbetween. The percentage of withdrawal responses was calculated for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Clip</title><p>Mice were habituated in opaque chambers on a plexiglass stand for 1 hr. The mouse was restrained and an alligator clip was applied to the hindpaw just in front of the heel. The mouse was returned to the chamber. The mouse’s behavioral response was recorded from below using a video camera. After 60 s, the clip was removed. The amount of time the mouse spent attending the clip and associated paw was quantified post-hoc by a blinded observer. Attending was defined as biting/handling the clip, and biting/licking the paw.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Hargreaves</title><p>Mice were habituated on a plexiglass stand for 1 hr with the Hargreaves machine turned on in a dark room. The radiant heat stimulus was aimed for the centre of the plantar region of the mouse’s hind paw. The active intensity of the low stimulus was 40 intensity units, and of the high stimulus 55. The response latency was recorded for five trials with 10 min breaks in between each trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Hot/cold plate</title><p>The plate was set to the desired temperature. A camera set up with a mirror was used for better visibility of the mouse on the hot plate. A clear cylindrical tube was placed around the hot plate to ensure the mouse cannot escape. Once the hot plate reached the set temperature, the mouse was placed on the hot plate and the top of the cylinder was covered. At the cut-off time, the mouse was taken off the hot plate and placed back in the cage. The latency to lick was scored post-hoc using the recorded videos by a blinded observer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Dry ice</title><p>Mice were habituated on a plexiglass floor stand for 1 hr. A 2 ml plastic syringe was cut in half to allow for crushed dry ice to be compacted into the tube. The dry ice was pushed up against the glass where the mouse’s hind paw was resting. Withdrawal latency was recorded with a stopwatch. 10 min were given in between each trial. The procedure was repeated five times and an average of the withdrawal latencies was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Acetone</title><p>Mice were habituated on a plexiglass floor stand for 1 hr. Mice were videotaped as acetone was applied to the plantar region of their hind paw. Acetone was applied using a custom-made applicator, consisting of a 1 ml syringe and plastic well where acetone was pushed out to generate a droplet for applying to the paw. Behavior was scored post-hoc by a blinded observer and the total amount of time spent licking the paw in a 60 s time interval was recorded. The experiment was repeated for a second trial and average scores were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Chemical algogens</title><p>Mice were habituated on a plexiglass stand for 1 hr. 0.3% capsaicin in 80% saline / 10% Tween-80 /10% ethanol or 1% AITC in saline was injected into the plantar surface of the hind paw. The injected volume for both was 20 µl. Mice were video-taped for 5 min. A blinded observer scored the amount of time in seconds the mouse spent licking the injected paw in a 5-min time period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-9"><title>Acetic acid</title><p>Mice were habituated on a plexiglass stand for 1 hr. 0.6% of acetic acid was injected intraperitoneally at a dose of 10 μl/g weight of the animal. Mice were videotaped for 20 min. The number of writhes was quantified post-hoc by a blinded observer during a 15-min interval between 5 and 20 min after injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-10"><title>Conditioned taste aversion</title><p>Mice were single-housed and habituated for 3 days to drink from two glass bottles with stainless-steel ball-bearing spouts. Mice then received 3 days of training, where they were water-deprived for 22 hr followed by 30 min exposure to a single water-containing bottle, then 90 min exposure to both bottles. On the conditioning day, after 22 hr of water deprivation, mice were exposed to a single bottle containing saccharin water (15 mM) for 45 min. Mice were then injected with lithium chloride (200 mg/kg) or PBS, and then given ordinary water for 75 min. The animals were then water deprived for a further 22 hr. On the test day, mice were simultaneously exposed to a bottle containing water and a bottle containing saccharin for 45 min. The volume of each solution consumed was measured by weighing the bottles before and after. To calculate the saccharin preference index of each animal, the volume of saccharin consumed was divided by the total of fluid consumed, with a value less than 0.5 indicating the development of an aversion to saccharin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-11"><title>Chloroquine-induced itch</title><p>Hair from the nape of the mouse’s neck was removed 2–3 days prior to behavioral experiments using VEET hair removal cream and the area thoroughly washed and moisturizing cream applied. Mice were habituated to transparent acrylic chambers (10cm x 10cm x 13 cm) 30 min prior to injection. Post habituation, a blinded investigator injected 20 μl of 25 μM Chloroquine diphosphate salt (Sigma-Aldrich: C6628) solution in 0.9% saline intradermally into the nape of the neck using a 31 G insulin syringe. Videos were quantified by a separate blinded investigator with a scratching bout counted each time the mouse attended to the injected area with the hind paw after the paw was removed from the floor or mouth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-12"><title>Inflammatory pain models</title><p>CFA and PGE2 was purchased from Sigma. 20 μl of CFA was injected into the heel of the hind paw. PGE2 (20 μl, 500 nM) was injected into the plantar surface of the hindpaw, and behavior was assessed over the same time-frame that produces in vivo sensitization of nociceptor responses (up to 120 min). Inflammation-induced hypersensitivity was measured using the Hargreaves and the von Frey, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-13"><title>Spared nerve injury</title><p>The mouse was anesthetized with isofluorane. The mouse was placed under the nose cone, belly down, and the left hind limb area was shaved. The area was wiped clean with an ethanol wipe and coated with betadine. Once the mouse was unresponsive, a 1-inch horizontal cut was made in the skin right along the femur. Once the natural separation of muscles was located, a small scissor tool was used to puncture the fascia and separate out the muscles. Once the sciatic nerve was located, curved forceps were used to separate out the nerve from the muscle. The nerve was traced towards the knee until the branch of three nerves (perineal, tibial, and sural) was found. The sural nerve was spared and the perineal and tibial nerves were cut. The mouse was sutured up and placed back in the homecage for recovery without postoperative analgesics. Mechanical allodynia was assessed using the von Frey assay from 2 to 21 days post surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-14"><title>Oxaliplatin</title><p>Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy was induced in mice by intraplantar injection of oxaliplatin into the left hind paw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MacDonald et al., 2021</xref>). Oxaliplatin was made up to a dose of 80  µg in 40  µl of 5% glucose solution, due to its instability in chloride-containing saline solution. The number of nocifensive behaviors in 5 min was assessed on the Cold Plate held at 10 °C 24 hr later.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Neurogenic inflammation</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Evans blue assay</title><p>Mice were anesthetized using isoflurane. 200 μl of Evans Blue dye was injected into the mouse’s tail vein. 15 mins later, one hindpaw was injected with an algogen. After a further 30 min, the volume of each paw was measured by displacement using a plethysmometer (Ugo Basile). Both paws were then cut at the ankle and placed in tubes in the oven at 55 °C for 24 hr to dry. 1 ml of formamide was then added to each paw and incubated for 4-6 days at 55 °C to extract the dye from the paw tissue. 50 μl samples of dye-infused formamide from each paw were then dispensed to a 96-well plate in duplicate, along with a range of Evans blue dilutions in formamide to generate a standard curve. The optical density of each sample was then measured using a plate-reader, and the concentration of Evans Blue per paw sample interpolated from the standard curve to generate an index of extravasation in that paw.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality of the data.

The investigators used two methods to confirm knockout of these neuropeptides: traditional immunolabeling and a neat in vitro assay where sensory neurons from either wildtype or double knock are co-cultured with substance P &quot;sniffer cells&quot;, HEK cells stably expressing NKR1 (a substance P receptor), GCaMP6s and Gα15. It should be noted that functional assays confirming CGRPα knockout were not performed. Subsequently, the authors assayed double knockout mice (DKO) and wildtype (WT) mice in numerous behavioral assays using different pain models, including acute pain and itch stimuli, intraplanar injection of Complete Freund's Adjuvant, prostaglandin E2, capsaicin, AITC, oxaliplatin, as well as the spared nerve injury model. Surprisingly, the authors found that pain behaviors did not differ between DKO and WT mice in any of the behavioral assays or pain paradigms. Importantly, female and male mice were included in all analyses. These data are important and significant, as both substance P and CGRPα have been implicated in pain signaling, though the magnitude of the effect of a single knockout of either gene has been variable and/or small between studies.</p><p>The conclusions of the study are largely supported by the data; however, additional experimental controls and analyses would strengthen the authors claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their insightful comments and have answered them below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The authors note that single knockout models of either substance P or CGRPα have produced variable effects on pain behaviors that are study-dependent. Therefore, it would have strengthened the study if the authors included these single knockout strains in a side-by-side analysis (in at least some of the behavioral assays), as has been done in prior studies in the field when using double- or triple-knockout mouse models (for example, see PMID: 33771873). If in the authors hands, single knockouts of either peptide also show no significant differences in pain behaviors, then the finding that double knockouts also do not show significant differences would be less surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we found no phenotypic differences between WT and DKO mice, suggesting Substance P and CGRPα are largely dispensable for pain behavior. We agree that if we had we observed significant changes in behavior, it would have been interesting to examine the effects of knocking out each gene individually to determine which peptide is responsible for the phenotype. However, given the double deletion had no effect, we can predict that loss of each alone would have no or minor effects. In line with this, a more recent study that comprehensively phenotyped the Calca KO mouse found no deficits in a range of danger related behaviors (PMID: 34376756). Overall, as we are reporting negative data about the Double KO, we do not believe extensive studies of the single KOs is necessary to support the findings of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is unclear why the authors only show functional validation of substance P knockout using &quot;sniffer&quot; cells, but not CGRPα. Inclusion of this experiment would have added an additional layer of rigor to the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Imaging of CGRPα release is more challenging using the ‘sniffer’ approach because functional CGRP receptors require the expression of two genes: Calcrl (or Calcr) along with Ramp1. We now have succeeded in generating a new stable cell line expressing Calcrl and Ramp1, along with GCaMPs and human Galpha15 and include new data in the revised Figure 1F-H and Figure Supplement 1B. These cells respond robustly to CGRPalpha, but not to SP. In contrast, the existing SP cell line responds to SP but not CGRPalpha. Capsaicin evokes a strong response in these cells in co-culture with DRGs. This response is dramatically reduced in the DKO. This data therefore confirms our mice have a loss of CGRPalpha signaling as indicated by IHC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors should be a bit more reserved in the claims made in the manuscript. The main claim of the study is that &quot;CGRPα and substance P are not required for pain transmission.&quot; However, the authors also note that neuropeptides can have opposing effects that may produce a net effect of no change. In my view, the data presented show that double knockout of substance P and CGRPα do not affect somatic pain behaviors, but do not preclude a role for either of these molecules in pain signaling more generally. Indeed, the authors also note that these neuropeptides could be involved in nociceptor crosstalk with the immune or vascular systems to promote headache. The authors only assayed pain responses to glabrous skin stimulation. How the DKO mice would behave in orofacial pain assays, migraine assays, visceral pain assays, or bone/joint pain assays, for example, was not tested. I do not suggest the authors include these experiments, only that they address the limitations/weaknesses of their study more thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an important point that we agree with. Our study assesses acute and chronic pain in peptide DKO mice lacking Substance P and CGRPα. Most of our data focuses on the hindpaw as pain in the paw is the gold-standard approach for phenotyping pain targets and numerous well-validated chronic pain models have been developed for this body site. However, to extend the conclusions to other tissues, we did also look at visceral pain and GI distress using acetic acid and LiCl models (Figure 2J and Figure 2 supplement). We agree with the reviewer that given the utility of CGRP monoclonal antibodies, migraine experiments would be interesting for future studies using these mice, a point we highlight in the discussion. Bone/joint pain is also clearly important from a translational perspective, but outside the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A more minor but important point, the authors do not describe the nature of the WT animals used. Are the littermates or a separately maintained colony of WT animals? The WT strain background should be included in the methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>The WT strain are C57/BL6j from Jackson Lab. This has been added to the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper aimed to examine the effect of co-ablating Substance P and CGRPα peptides on pain using Tac1 and Calca double knockout (DKO) mice.

The authors first generated the double knockout (DKO) mice and validated their animal model. This is then followed by a series of acute and chronic pain assessments to evaluate if the global DKO of these neuropeptides are important in modulating acute and chronic pain behaviors. Authors found that these DKO mice Substance P and CGRPα are not required for the transmission of acute and chronic pain although both neuropeptides are strongly implicated in chronic pain. This study does provide more insight into the role of these neuropeptides on chronic pain processing, however, more work still needs to be done. (see the comments below).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their detailed and constructive feedback, and below outline the steps we have taken to answer their concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) In assessing the double KO (result #1), why are different regions of the brains shown for substance P and CGRPα (for example, midbrain for substance P and amygdala for CGRPα)? Since the authors mentioned that these peptides co-expressed in the brain (as in the introduction), shouldn't the same brain regions be shown for both IHC? It would be ideal if the authors could show both regions (midbrain and amygdala) in addition to the DRG and spinal cord for both peptides in their findings.</p><p>In addition, since this is double KO, the authors should show more representative IHC-stained brain regions (spanning from the anterior to posterior).</p></disp-quote><p>We could not co-stain both SP and CGRP in the same sections as the DKO mouse has endogenous GFP and RFP fluorescence, limiting us to one channel (far red). Specifically, we use a Calca KO that is a Cre:GRP knock-in/knockout (Chen et al 2018, PMID30344042) and Tac1 KO is a tagRFP knock-in/knockout (Wu et al 2018 PMID29485996). This is why we show different brain sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is also unclear as to why the authors only assessed the loss of substance P signaling in the double KO mice. Shouldn't the same be done for CGRPα signaling? Either the authors assess this, or the authors have to provide clear explanations as to why only substance P signaling was assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our response to Reviewer 1, imaging of CGRP release is more challenging using the ‘sniffer’ approach because functional CGRP receptors require the expression of two genes: Calcrl (or Calcr) along with Ramp1. We have now generated this cell line and performed the experiment (see revised Figure 1 and Figure 1 Supplement).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Has these animal's naturalistic behavior been assessed after the double KO (food intake, sleep, locomotion for example)? I think this is important as changes to these naturalistic behaviors can affect pain processes or outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that assessment of naturalistic behavior including food intake, sleep and locomotion would be interesting to look at in DKO mice. However, our study is focused on acute and chronic pain behavior of these animals, and therefore a comprehensive phenotypic assessment of naturalistic home-cage behavior is outside the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 2H: The authors acknowledge that there is a trend to decrease with capsaicin-evoked coping-like responses. However, a close look at the graph suggests that the lack of significance could be driven by 1 mouse. Have the authors run an outlier test? Alternatively, the authors should consider adding more n to these experiments to verify their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We were reluctant to add more animals searching for significance. Instead, we investigated the potential phenotype further by looking at cfos staining in the cord and found no differences (Figure 2, supplement 1). This result suggests loss of the two peptides does not grossly disrupt capsaicin evoked pain signal transmission between the nociceptor and post-synaptic dorsal neurons in the spinal cord.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Similarly, the values for WT in the evoked cFos activity (Figure 2- Suppl Figure 1) are pretty variable. Considering that the n number is low (n = 5), authors should consider adding more n.</p><p>Also, since the n number is low in this experiment (eg. 5 vs 4), does this pass the normality test to run a parametric unpaired t-test? Either the authors increase their n numbers or run the appropriate statistical test.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the statistical tables, the Shapiro-Wilk test indicates these data do pass the normality test. Therefore, we retain the use of the unpaired t test, which demonstrates no significant difference between the groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In most of the results, authors ran a parametric test despite the low n number. Authors have to ensure that they are carrying out the appropriate statistical test for their dataset and n number.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a table of the statistical results, which provides detailed information about all statistical tests performed in this study. For experiments where we make a single comparison between the two distributions (WT vs DKO), we have run a Shapiro-Wilk test. Where the data from both groups pass the normality test, we retain the use of the unpaired t test. Where the Shapiro-Wilk test indicates data from either group are unlikely to be normally distributed, we now use a Mann-Whitney U test to compare the groups, as this non-parametric test makes no assumptions about the underlying distribution.</p><p>Many experiments involved two factors (genotype, and e.g. temperature, drug, time-point). These data were analyzed in the original submission using 2-WAY ANOVA or Repeated Measures 2-WAY ANOVA, followed by post-hoc Sidak’s tests to compute p values adjusted for multiple comparisons. Because there is no widely agreed non-parametric alternative to 2-WAY ANOVA for analyzing data with two factors and that enables us to account for multiple comparisons, we used 2-WAY ANOVA as is typically used in the field for these kinds of experiments. We reasoned sticking with the 2-WAY ANOVA was the best course of action based on information provided by the statistical software used for this study - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/with-two-way-anova-why-doesnt-prism-offer-a-nonparametric-alternative-test-for-normality-test-for-homogeneity-of-variances-test-for-outliers/">https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/with-two-way-anova-why-doesnt-prism-offer-a-nonparametric-alternative-test-for-normality-test-for-homogeneity-of-variances-test-for-outliers/</ext-link></p><p>We note that regardless of the test, our conclusion that there are no major changes in acute or chronic pain behaviors are clear and strongly supported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Along the same line of comment with the previous, authors should increase the n number for DKO for staining (Figure 4) as n number is only 3 and there is variability in the cFos quantification in the ipsilateral side.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this is not necessary as the finding is clear that there is no difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Authors should provide references for statement made in Line 319-321 as authors mentioned that there are accumulating evidence indicating that secretion of these neuropeptides from nociceptor peripheral terminals modulates immune cells and the vasculature in diverse tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide several references to primary papers and reviews supporting this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Authors state that the sample size used was similar to those from previous studies, but no references were provided. Also, even though the sample sizes used were similar, I believe that the right statistic test should be used to analyze the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now cited several classic studies phenotyping mouse KOs in pain in the methods that used similar sample sizes. As detailed above, we have taken the reviewer’s feedback on board and performed normality testing to ensure the correct statistical test is used for each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) In the discussion, the authors noted that knocking out of a gene remains the strongest test of whether the molecule is essential for a biological phenomenon. At the same time, it was acknowledged that Substance P infusion into the spinal cord elicits pain, but it is analgesic in the brain. The authors might want to expand more on this discussion, including how we can selectively assess the role of these neuropeptides in areas of interest. For example, knocking out both Substance P and CGRPα in selected areas instead of the global KO since there are reported compensatory effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This is highlighted in the closing paragraph: “Emerging approaches to image and manipulate these molecules (Girven et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2023), as well as advances in quantitating pain behaviors (Bohic et al., 2023; MacDonald and Chesler, 2023), may ultimately reveal the fundamental roles of neuropeptides in generating our experience of pain.” The Kim preprint (now published, and so the citation has been updated in the text) describes a method of inactivating neuropeptide transmission in select brain regions in a cell-type specific manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I do not have any major comments.

Although CGRP monoclonal antibodies and receptor blockers have proven effective for subsets of migraine patients, their usefulness for other types of pain in humans is unclear (De Matteis et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2018). In line with this, knockout mice deficient in Substance P, CGRPα or their receptors have been reported to display some pain deficits, but the analgesic effects are neither large nor consistent between studies (Cao et al., 1998; De Felipe et al., 1998; Guo et al., 2012; Salmon et al., 2001, 1999; Zimmer et al., 1998).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Figure 1E: What does chambers mean? Additionally, are the 12 chambers equally from the male and female samples (6 from male and 6 from female)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed this to well. Each replicate is an individual well from 8 well chamber slide. In all these experiments, the wells are approximately evenly distributed by mouse, because from each mouse we cultured around 8 wells’ worth of DRGs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1D: What does low and high mean in the Hargreaves test?</p></disp-quote><p>These refer to a low and high active intensity of the radiant heat stimulus.

For example, Figure 2-Supplementary Figure 1 and Figure 2- Supplementary Figure 2 can be combined as just Supplementary Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer this would be clearer, but we have followed eLife’s convention for labelling and numbering supplements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3 is mislabeled as Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

We tested to 21 days. We will replace with three.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Authors should specify what &quot;one day&quot; means (Line 267). For example, how many days after the intraplantar oxaliplatin treatment? Also, authors should justify why that specific time point was selected or have a reference for it.</p></disp-quote><p>This means one day after - 24 hours. Please see PMID: 33693512.

It is in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) In the methods section, authors state that both male and female mice were used for all experiments. However, only female mice were used in the CFA experiment (see minor comment #6). Authors should verify and correct this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct. We only used female mice for one of the groups.

We do not perform explicit habituation to the investigator such as repeated handling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) Authors need to provide more information on the semi-automated procedure they are referring to in Line 397. Also, authors should also provide the criteria for cFos quantification (eg. Intensity, etc).

We chose the 15 minute interval because it reduces burdensome hand scoring time by 50% versus doing the whole 30 mins. We reasoned that in the first 5 mins post injection the animal behaviour may be contaminated by stress related to handling, injection and return to chamber. Thus, 5 and 20 minutes provided a sensible time-frame for scoring the behavior when it is at its peak.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(18) Authors have to provide more information/explanation on how they decide on the conditioned taste aversion protocol. Like why they do 30 mins exposure to a single water-containing bottle followed 90 mins exposure to both bottles. If this has been published before, they should provide the reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We read dozens of different published protocols in the literature, and piloted one that was something of an amalgam of some of them with various adaptations of convenience. Because it worked on our first attempt, we stuck to it. The advantage of the CTA assay is it is incredibly robust to changes in the specificities of the paradigm, evincing the clear survival value of learning to avoid tastes that make you sick.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(19) Authors again should provide more detail in their methods section.</p><p>a.
