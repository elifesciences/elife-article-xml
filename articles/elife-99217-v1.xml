Here, we show that cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) regulate the phosphorylation of threonine 118 (T118) in PNKP. This phosphorylation allows recruitment to the gapped DNA structure found in single-strand DNA (ssDNA) nicks and/or gaps between Okazaki fragments (OFs) during DNA replication. T118A (alanine)-substituted PNKP-expressing cells exhibited an accumulation of ssDNA gaps in S phase and accelerated replication fork progression. Furthermore, PNKP is involved in poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-dependent replication gap filling as part of a backup pathway in the absence of OFs ligation. Altogether, our data suggest that CDK-mediated PNKP phosphorylation at T118 is important for its recruitment to ssDNA gaps to proceed with OFs ligation and its backup repairs via the gap-filling pathway to maintain genome stability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PNKP</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>Okazaki fragment</kwd><kwd>DNA

DNA is threatened by intrinsic factors such as oxidative stress derived from mitochondria-dependent energy metabolism and extrinsic factors such as ionizing radiation (IR), ultraviolet radiation, and chemical compounds. These factors generate various types of DNA damage, such as base damage, DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs), and double-strand breaks (DSBs). Because DNA lesions cause chromosomal aberrations, leading to aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, DNA repair machinery has evolved in living organisms. Polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) is a key enzyme with a dual role that bears 3′-phosphatase and 5′-kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chappell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karimi-Busheri et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jilani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coquelle et al., 2011</xref>). Human PNKP consists of 521 amino acids, including the forkhead-associated (FHA) domain (amino acid residues 1–110) in the amino-terminal region, and phosphatase (146–337) and kinase (341–516) domains in the carboxy-terminal region, which are connected by a linker region (111–145). PNKP is recruited to SSBs and DSBs sites depending on its interactions via the FHA domain of PNKP with XRCC1 and XRCC4, respectively, and is involved in base excision repair (BER), SSB repair, and non-homologous end joining for DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breslin and Caldecott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsukada et al., 2021</xref>). The PNKP linker region includes a nuclear localization signal and phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukada et al., 2020</xref>). Phosphorylation of PNKP at serine 114 by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is required for protein stability and efficient DNA repair for cellular survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segal-Raz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parsons et al., 2012</xref>). Mutations in PNKP are associated with the human inherited disease microcephaly and seizures (MCSZ), a neurodevelopmental disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2010</xref>), ataxia oculomotor apraxia 4 (AOA4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bras et al., 2015</xref>), and Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMT2B2), a neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pedroso et al., 2015</xref>). These mutations are mostly located in the phosphatase or kinase domains and attenuate the phosphatase and kinase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalasova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bermúdez-Guzmán et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The BER and SSBs repair intermediates form gapped DNA structures, which are the main targets of PNKP. These DNA gaps are also found in Okazaki fragments (OFs) during DNA replication. DNA replication integrity is essential for ensuring genomic stability and accurate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Donnell et al., 2013</xref>). DNA replication is initiated at the origin of replication in the leading strand and at short RNA-primed DNA fragments, known as OFs, in the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leonard and Méchali, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okazaki et al., 1968</xref>). Recent reports suggest that single-strand DNA (ssDNA) gap-filling machinery is involved in OFs maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanzlikova et al., 2018</xref>). Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP1/2) is involved in the repair of SSBs, DSBs, and multiple DNA replication processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ray Chaudhuri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ray Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>). PARP1 activity is required for efficient SSBs repair and ssDNA gap-filling pathway in OFs during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanzlikova et al., 2018</xref>). The DNA replication machinery is precisely controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which phosphorylate several replication factors to allow them to enter the S phase and promote DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swaffer et al., 2016</xref>). During replication fork progression, ssDNA is fragile and protected by replication protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wold, 1997</xref>). When replication forks stall, ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related protein (ATR) is activated and phosphorylates CHK1 and RPA to resolve or eliminate the impediment, promoting replication fork recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cortez et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, DNA damage, such as base damage, SSBs, and DSBs, occurs upon genotoxic stress and replication errors, which lead to DNA replication stress, genomic instability, genetic mutation, and tumorigenesis.</p><p>In this study, we found that PNKP was required for the ssDNA gap-filling pathway during DNA replication. Defects in PNKP induce the accumulation of single-strand gaps in OFs and genome instability. We also found that CDKs phosphorylate PNKP on threonine 118 (T118), mainly in the S phase, and that CDK-mediated PNKP phosphorylation allows it to be recruited to ssDNA gaps on OFs. Moreover, PNKP enzymatic activities, especially phosphatase activity, are required for processing of the ends of single-strand gaps on OFs. Taken together, our data suggest that phosphorylation-mediated PNKP recruitment to ssDNA gaps on OFs and the end-processing activity of PNKP are critically important for preventing genome instability through appropriate regulation of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of PNKP knockout U2OS cell line</title><p>In a previous study, we found that the depletion of PNKP resulted in impaired cell growth in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shimada et al., 2015</xref>).

These findings confirm deficiencies in both SSB and DSB repair in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, aligning with observations from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalasani et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells showed increased sensitivity to the inhibition of DNA replication by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

Since cell proliferation is associated with DNA replication, we analyzed the cell cycle distribution of <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells using flowcytometry. The analysis revealed an accumulation of <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells in the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2H</xref>). Considering that increased endogenous genotoxic stress can lead to improper S phase progression, we assessed the endogenous level of DNA damage in our two <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> clones. Given that one of the known targets of PNKP in DNA repair is SSBs, including ssDNA gap structures, we anticipated that PNKP might be involved in the formation of ssDNA gaps during cell proliferation, not only in the repair of exogenous DNA damage. To test this, we performed PAN ADP-ribosylation assays combined with poly ADP-ribose glycohydrolase inhibitor (PARGi) treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukada et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalasova et al., 2020</xref>). Our two <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> clones exhibited significantly higher levels of ADP-ribosylation, a marker of ssDNA gaps/breaks, compared to WT cells, indicating that <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells face a pronounced amount of endogenously induced ssDNA gaps/breaks. To investigate whether the accumulated ssDNA gaps are generated in S phase during DNA replication, we assessed PAN ADP-ribose levels in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells in combination with treatment with HU or Emetine (EME), a DNA replication inhibitor that blocks single-strand gap formation on replication forks via proteosynthesis inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burhans et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lukac et al., 2022</xref>). In WT cells, HU treatment increased the amount of poly ADP-ribosylation, yet statistically non-significant (p = 0.067), whereas EME prevented poly ADP-ribosylation by inhibiting single-strand nick and/or gap formation in the S phase of U2OS WT cells (p = 0.0093). These results were consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanzlikova et al., 2018</xref>). Although <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells showed high levels of ADP-ribose intensity spontaneously, HU and EME treatment rescued the increased ADP-ribose intensity in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, albeit higher, yet statistically non-significant, extent than WT cells. This suggests that loss of PNKP leads to an accumulation of ssDNA gap structures during DNA replication. To directly detect DNA replication-mediated ssDNA gap formation in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, we performed an S1 DNA fiber assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). Cells were labeled with 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU) for 15 min, followed by 60 min of 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine (CldU) labeling. The individual tract lengths of CldU-labeled nascent DNA in IdU/CldU-double positive DNA fiber were quantified. Where indicated, labeled DNA was treated with a single-stranded DNA/RNA-specific endonuclease, S1 nuclease, to detect post-replicative ssDNA gaps by the shortened DNA tract length due to digestion of ssDNA gaps by S1 nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Despite the slower cell growth, <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells exhibited faster progression of DNA replication fork than WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This result suggests that PNKP may be involved in the progression of DNA replication forks, as a similar phenotype has been reported in PCNA polyubiquitination mutant (K164R) cells, which were unable to reduce the replication fork speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thakar et al., 2020</xref>). PCNA KR mutant cells also showed slow cell proliferation due to accelerated replication speed failing to protect nascent DNA from degradation. This resulted in a slower cell proliferation phenotype, reminiscent of that observed in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, although indeed recent study revealed that PNKP is involved in the fork protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mashayekhi et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells exhibited significantly shortened DNA fibers upon S1 nuclease-mediated DNA digestion, unlike U2OS WT cells. This observation suggests that the loss of PNKP results in the accumulation of ssDNA gaps on nascent replicated DNA, leading to improper cell proliferation due to high levels of endogenous DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>PNKP is involved in canonical OFs maturation and ssDNA gap-filling pathways</title><p>The phenotype of increased tract length in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells is observed in two of <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> clones, indicating that this phenotype is not clonal issue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This phenotype in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells is evocative of deficiencies in DNA replication factors involved in canonical OFs maturation, such as FEN1 and LIG1, or factors in the ssDNA gap-filling pathway, an alternative/backup pathway of OFs maturation, such as PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thakar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maya-Mendoza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cong et al., 2021</xref>). Considering these points, we hypothesized that PNKP plays a critical role in preventing the accumulation of ssDNA gaps on replicating DNA during OFs maturation. To test this hypothesis, we first assessed DNA tract length in cells treated with HU or a flap endonuclease 1 inhibitor (FEN1i), which prevents the resection of overhanging nucleotides from the ends of OFs, leading to unligated OFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Exell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ward et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zheng and Shen, 2011</xref>). Indeed, FEN1i treatment induced increased CldU tract length, whereas HU treatment led to stalled forks, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thakar et al., 2020</xref>). Upon deficient canonical FEN1-mediated OFs maturation, post-replicative ssDNA gaps arise from unligated OFs, which are sensed by PARP1 and repaired via the PARP1-dependent gap-filling pathway for OFs maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaitsiankova et al., 2022</xref>). The PARP1-dependent gap-filling pathway is associated with XRCC1, a binding scaffold protein of PNKP in the SSB repair pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hanzlikova et al., 2018</xref>). To determine whether PNKP plays a critical role in the PARP-dependent gap-filling pathway, we performed an S1 DNA fiber assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Cells were labeled with IdU for 15 min, followed by 60 min of CldU labeling in the presence or absence of an FEN1 inhibitor and/or PARP inhibitor, and the ratio of the individual tract lengths of nascent DNA labeled with IdU or CldU were quantified. Where indicated, labeled DNA was treated with S1 nuclease. Double treatment of FEN1i and PARPi in U2OS WT cells, followed by S1 nuclease treatment, showed significantly lower CldU/IdU ratio, indicating extensive DNA fiber digestion by S1 nuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Although single treatment with either FEN1i or PARPi in U2OS WT cells, followed by S1 nuclease treatment, led to DNA fiber digestion, the extent was limited compared to the double treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>), indicating that both pathways: FEN1-dependent canonical OFs maturation and PARP-dependent ssDNA gap-filling pathway, are coordinately required to prevent the emergence of ssDNA gaps during DNA replication, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaitsiankova et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells with S1 nuclease treatment showed extensive DNA fiber digestion even without FEN1i and PARP1i treatments, and this was not further increased by FEN1i and PARPi treatment. These results suggest that PNKP itself is involved in both pathways mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, loss of PNKP results in a phenotype similar to the loss of FEN1 in terms of canonical OFs maturation, but also, like PARP inhibition, there is an additional effect in repairing ssDNA gaps created under FEN1 loss conditions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) is involved in Okazaki fragment maturation pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Quantified results of DNA fiber length in U2OS WT and <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> C1 and C2 cells.

Amino acids S114, T118, and S143 are highly conserved among mammalian species. S114 and S126 form a typical SQ/TQ motif, with S114 being phosphorylated by ATM and S126 by ATM and DNA-PKcs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segal-Raz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zolner et al., 2011</xref>). T118, T122, and S143 are novel phosphorylation sites, with T118 predicted to be a CDK phosphorylation substrate motif (S/TP). To elucidate the importance of these amino acids in DNA replication, we constructed phosphorylation-mutant vectors containing five predicted phosphorylated amino acids substituted with alanine and measured the growth rates of these transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).

However, the reduction of pT118, possibly due to dephosphorylation of T118, was not as robust as the reduction in Cyclin A2 expression levels at the 12 hr time point. This effect was very weak during mitosis, suggesting that T118 phosphorylation plays a specific role in the S phase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) phosphorylate T118 on polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) for the recruitment of PNKP to nascent DNA on replication forks.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme and protein expression levels of GFP-PNKP-expressing HCT116 cells after release from double thymidine block.

CDK1/Cyclin A2 and CDK2/Cyclin A2 markedly phosphorylated PNKP, whereas CDK4/Cyclin D1 and CDK2/Cyclin E1 phosphorylated PNKP to a lesser extent, suggesting that CDK1/CyclinA2 and CDK2/CyclinA2 complexes are potential kinases of PNKP T118. We subsequently investigated the phosphorylation levels of PNKP at T118 under co-overexpression of Cyclin A2 and CDK1 or CDK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Overexpression of both CDK2/Cyclin A2 and CDK1/Cyclin A2 showed an increased phosphorylation level at T118, supporting that these complexes are potential kinases of PNKP T118.</p><p>In line with this observation, we assessed protein interactions between PNKP and CDK1 or CDK2 using GFP-PNKP-pulldown assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). PNKP T118A mutant showed a reduced amount of protein interaction with both CDK1 and CDK2, with CDK2 appearing as a stronger binding partner of PNKP. These results indicate that CDK1/2, especially CDK2, are the kinases of T118 on PNKP. To elucidate the role of PNKP T118 phosphorylation in DNA replication, we isolated proteins from nascent DNA using iPOND (isolation of proteins on nascent DNA) technique to confirm interactions between PNKP and nascent DNA on replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). After 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation for 20 min in GFP-PNKP-expressing HEK293 cells, proteins bound to nascent DNA were extracted and detected by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We found that replication fork-associated proteins, including FEN1, RPA2, and PCNA, as well as WT-PNKP and T118-phosphorylated PNKP interacted with nascent DNA. Additionally, the recruitment of PNKP to nascent DNA was reduced by the T118A mutation, which strongly suggests T118 phosphorylation is crucial for its recruitment to replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Since XRCC1 is a scaffold protein of ssDNA gap-filling pathway, we investigated whether the recruitment of PNKP to nascent DNA is dependent on XRCC1 using the iPOND technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Depletion of XRCC1 by siRNA treatment reduced the amount of PNKP recruited to nascent DNA, indicating the involvement of PNKP in ssDNA gap-filling pathway. However, some PNKP still bound to nascent DNA, suggesting an alternative recruitment pathway of PNKP to DNA replication forks, possibly for mediating canonical OF maturation. Taken together, these results suggest that the CDK1/Cyclin A2 or CDK2/Cyclin A2 complex potentially regulates the phosphorylation level of PNKP T118 in the S phase, facilitating PNKP recruitment to DNA replication forks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Phosphorylation of PNKP at T118 is required for preventing the formation of unligated OFs</title><p>In order to examine the effect of T118 phosphorylation loss in DNA replication, we first investigated the FEN1-related phenotype of increased tract length in T118A- and T118D (a phospho-mimetic mutant)-expressing cells using a DNA fiber assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and T118A-expressing cells showed increased tract length, and FEN1i treatment did not further accelerate DNA fiber length, indicating that the T118A mutation alone provokes the longer DNA tract length phenotype due to the formation of unligated OFs, similar to FEN1 inhibition.

WT PNKP expression rescued this effect, suggesting that PNKP function and T118 phosphorylation are required for ssDNA gap-less DNA replication. Of note, <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells and PNKP T118A cells also showed higher ADP-ribose intensity outside the S phase (1.47-fold increase vs. WT-expressing cells), indicating that PNKP and T118 may play a role in preventing SSBs formation outside the S phase. Since FEN1 has been reported to function in R-loop processing, PNKP could also be involved in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cristini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laverde et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies of a role of PNKP in different cell cycle will be able to address this question.</p><p>To investigate whether ssDNA gaps in T118A cells originate from unligated OFs, we used FEN1i to examine an epistatic effect between T118A and deficient canonical OFs maturation by FEN1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>). We assessed the ADP-ribose intensity of WT PNKP or T118A-expressing <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells treated with either DMSO or FEN1i only during the S phase. FEN1i-treated U2OS WT cells showed increased ADP-ribose intensity, indicating that FEN1i treatment leads to ssDNA gap formation. The increased ADP-ribose intensity phenotype in T118A-expressing cells was not observed in FEN1i-treated T118A-expressing cells. Additionally, T118D-expressing cells behaved similarly to PNKP WT-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that T118 phosphorylation of PNKP plays a critical role in suppressing ssDNA gap formation derived from unligated OFs in an epistatic pathway with FEN1. In conclusion, phosphorylation of PNKP at T118 is required to prevent unligated OF-mediated post-replicative ssDNA gap formation during DNA replication.</p><p>Incidentally, as similar to <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, PNKP T118A-expressing cells exhibited reduced repair abilities against exogenous SSB and DSB induced by IR and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Furthermore, T118A-expressing cells showed an increased frequency of micronuclei and chromosome bridges compared to WT PNKP-complemented cells even without any treatment as well as with IR or HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). Altogether, our results suggest that endogenously increased ssDNA gap formation due to impaired OFs maturation in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and T118A-expressing cells may cause genomic instability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Enzymatic activities of PNKP are important for the end-processing of OFs</title><p>The main function of PNKP is to catalyze 5′-phosphorylation and 3′-dephosphorylation of the DNA ends. To clarify the role of these enzymatic abilities in OFs maturation, we constructed phosphatase-dead (D171A) and kinase-dead (K378A) PNKP mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jilani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reynolds et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalasova et al., 2019</xref>). Initially, we attempted to establish stable clones expressing both mutants; however, we could not obtain stable phosphatase-dead (D171A) clones. This is consistent with previous observations, where PNKP-mutated MCSZ patient cells, exhibiting mutations in the phosphatase domain, showed unstable expression of PNKP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2010</xref>), and recombinant phosphatase-dead PNKP was unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalasova et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, these mutants were transiently expressed in <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, and protein expression was assessed through western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We first assessed the phosphatase and kinase enzymatic activities of the PNKP T118A mutant and performed biochemical assays using cell extracts expressing PNKP mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Fluorescence-labeled SSB gap oligo DNA was mixed with cell lysates extracted from U2OS WT or <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells expressing various PNKP mutants. The D171A and K378A mutants were used as phosphatase- and kinase-dead controls, respectively. Although the phosphatase-dead mutant showed slightly lower kinase activity and the kinase-dead mutant showed lower phosphatase activity than WT PNKP, it is possible that each mutant is structurally unstable, affecting enzyme activity. Intriguingly, T118A PNKP was still capable of dephosphorylating and phosphorylating gapped DNA ends in vitro, albeit to a lesser extent than WT PNKP. These results suggest that phosphorylation of PNKP at T118 is required for its recruitment to the gapped DNA structure but not directly for its enzymatic activity. To confirm this hypothesis, we assessed a binding ability to an ssDNA gap structure using cell lysates from WT PNKP, T118A, and T118D mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The T118A mutant showed impaired gapped DNA-binding ability, whereas the WT PNKP and the T118D mutant exhibited relatively higher binding ability than the PNKP T118A mutant.</p><p>Next, we analyzed the increased tract length phenotype in cells expressing these enzymatic mutants using a DNA fiber assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Interestingly, D171A-expressing cells showed a spontaneously increased tract length, and FEN1i treatment did not further increase the tract length. K378A-expressing cells showed longer, yet statistically non-significant, tract length than WT PNKP-expressing cells (p = 0.6293), suggesting that PNKP enzymatic activities, especially those of phosphatase, are required for accurate fork progression. Subsequently, we elucidated whether the end-processing activities of PNKP are important for OF-mediated ssDNA gap formation. These PNKP mutant-expressing <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells were treated with FEN1i, followed by measurement of ADP-ribose intensity in the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). D171A-expressing cells showed a high ADP-ribose intensity (p &lt; 0.0001), while K378A-expressing cells exhibited relatively high ADP-ribose intensity without FEN1i treatment (p = 0.001). Moreover, FEN1i-treated cells showed high levels of ADP-ribose intensity in all conditions. Taken together, these results suggest that PNKP phosphatase and kinase activities, especially those of phosphatase, play an important role in the end-processing of OFs, resulting in the suppression of OF-mediated post-replicative ssDNA gap formation and ensuring accurate DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Enzymatic activities of PNKP is important for the end-processing of Okazaki fragments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Measurement of the speed of DNA synthesis in U2OS WT and <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> C1 cells expressing GFP, PNKP WT, D171A, and K378A mutants under 10 μM FEN1 inhibitor treatment analyzed by DNA fiber assay.

This phosphorylation is crucial for the recruitment of PNKP to gapped DNA structures, including nicks between OFs and OF-mediated post-replicative ssDNA gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Defects in PNKP phosphorylation at T118 lead to the accumulation of ssDNA gaps during DNA replication due to a deficiency in canonical OFs ligation and the subsequent gap-filling pathway.</p><p>PNKP consists of four regions: the FHA, linker, phosphatase, and kinase domains. Compared to other domains, the role of the linker region remains poorly understood, although it includes several residues that may be post-translationally modified. DNA damage signaling and DNA replication progression are often regulated by protein modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kolas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blackford and Jackson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cortez et al., 1999</xref>). Lysine is the main target of E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laney and Hochstrasser, 1999</xref>), and there is a clustered lysine region (137–142) in the PNKP linker region. However, this region also includes a nuclear localization signal, and alanine substitution prevents its transport to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tsukada et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we focused on regions other than amino acids 137–142. In the present study, we identified five predicted phosphorylation sites (S114, T118, T122, S126, and S143) in the linker region. The T118A mutant exhibited significantly reduced cell proliferation, while the T122A, S126A, and S143A mutants showed slightly reduced cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting that these residues may also be involved in proper cell proliferation. In contrast, the S114A mutant-expressing cells showed effective SSB repair and normal cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the phosphorylation of PNKP at S114 is likely important for DSB repair. The T118A mutant demonstrated reduced repair abilities of both exogenous SSBs and DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, T118A-expressing cells show a slight increase of ADP-ribosylation compared to WT-complemented cells, which might suggest a possible partial preferential role of this modification in the S phase. Future studies will be able to elucidate the function of T118 phosphorylation in response to exogenous DNA damage.</p><p>Regulating the speed of DNA synthesis is important for accurate DNA replication and fork integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kunkel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genois et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and T118A-expressing cells showed high-speed DNA synthesis, resulting in slower cell proliferation and genome instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). These observations are consistent with those in PCNA KR mutant cells and PARPi-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thakar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maya-Mendoza et al., 2018</xref>). We also found that enzymatic activity, especially the phosphatase activity of PNKP, is required for the end-processing of OFs during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and mutant-expressing cells exhibited a significant increase in ADP-ribose intensity in the S phase, even without FEN1i treatment. However, FEN1i treatment in these cells led to an attenuated increase in ADP-ribose intensity compared to WT PNKP-expressing cells, suggesting that PNKP acts in an epistatic pathway with FEN1 for the canonical OFs ligation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). FEN1 catalyzes the removal of RNA/DNA fragments from OFs on the lagging strand. Our data suggested that both the end-processing activity of PNKP and the exonuclease activity of FEN1 are required for canonical OFs ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, the PARP-mediated ssDNA gap-filling pathway is also involved in OFs maturation as an alternative/backup pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaitsiankova et al., 2022</xref>). Our data suggest that the loss of these two pathways results in extensively increased ssDNA gap formation during DNA replication, and the loss of PNKP can recapitulate this combinative phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This observation is consistent with the decreased ADP-ribose intensity observed in HU- and EME-treated <italic>PNKP <sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Since EME inhibits single-strand gap formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burhans et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lukac et al., 2022</xref>) and HU treatment increases the amount of the OF-like DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laipis and Levine, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magnusson, 1973b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Magnusson, 1973a</xref>), these reagents inhibit mature OF structures as PNKP-appropriate substrates.</p><p>Moreover, we found that the phosphorylation of PNKP at T118 is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent and CDK-associated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Since the activities of CDK1/Cyclin A2 and CDK2/Cyclin A2 complexes peak in the late S/G2 and S phases, respectively, we speculated that PNKP T118 is phosphorylated from the S phase to the G2 phase in CDK1/Cyclin A2- and CDK2/Cyclin A2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>). We concluded that phosphorylation of PNKP at T118 allows it to be recruited to the ends of OFs, including ssDNA nicks and/or gaps between OFs, and processes the ends for subsequent ligation. Furthermore, PNKP is required for the PARP1-dependent ssDNA gap-filling pathway when unligated OFs are transformed into post-replicative ssDNA gap structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>In summary, maintaining genome stability is central to life, and the function of PNKP in DNA repair and OFs maturation is important for biological development. Although PNKP mutations cause several inherited diseases (MCSZ, AOA4, and CMT2B2) with neural developmental failure and neurodegeneration, almost all mutations are found in the FHA, phosphatase, or kinase domains and not in the linker region. This observation may indicate that mutations in the phosphorylated residue (T118) in the linker region are potentially embryonic lethal due to the importance of T118 in DNA replication, which is revealed in the present study. Since the inhibiting PNKP activity is an important target for anticancer drugs, in addition to the inhibition of phosphatase and kinase enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Freschauf et al., 2009</xref>), inhibiting phosphorylation at T118 of PNKP might be a potent target for cancer therapy. Ultimately, this study reveals a novel role for PNKP in processing the ends of OFs and the PARP-dependent single-strand gap-filling pathway during DNA replication. This may contribute to the elucidation of the biological basis of DNA replication and enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the onset of inherited diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, the human colon cancer cell line HCT116, and the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and U2OS <italic>PNKP<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell lines were established in this study.

We believe that the planned revisions, based on the comments by the reviewers, will substantially enhance the quality of our manuscript. In summary, we are mainly planning to perform four experiments: iPOND assay using XRCC1-depleted cells, iPOND assay using PNKP-T118A expressing cells, DNA repair assay in PNKP-T118A expressing cells throughout cell cycle, and an alternative method of SSB repair assay using BrdU incorporation, as well as several control/follow-up experiments suggested by the reviewers.</p><p>Our detailed responses to all their comments are given in following sections.</p><p>Description of the revisions</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1</p><p>PNKP is one of critical end-processing enzymes for DNA damage repair, mainly base excision &amp; single strand break repair, and double strand break repair to a certain extent. This protein has dual enzyme function: 3' phosphatase and 5' kinase to make DNA ends proper for ligation. It has been demonstrated that PTM of PNKP (e.g., S114, S126), particularly phosphorylation by either ATM or DNAPK, is important for PNKP function in DNA damage repair. The authors found a new phosphorylation site, T118, of PNKP which might be modified by CDK1 or 2 during S phase. This modification of phosphorylation is involved in maintenance and stability of the lagging strand, particularly Okazaki fragments. Loss of this phosphorylation could result in increased single strand gaps, accelerated speed of fork progression, and eventually genomic instability. And for this process, PNKP enzyme activity is not that important. And the authors concluded that PNKP T118 phosphorylation is important for lagging strand stability and DNA damage repair.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1. In general, enzymes have protein interactions with its/their substrates. If PNKP is phosphorylated by either/both CDK1/2, the protein interaction between these would be expected. However, the authors did not provide any protein interactions in PNKP and CDKs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed GFP-pulldown assays using cell extracts from HEK293 cells expressing GFP-WT-PNKP or GFP-T118A-PNKP and 3XFLAG-CDK1 or 3XFLAG-CDK2. We confirmed the interactions of PNKP and CDK1/2 by western blotting with FLAG antibody (Figure 4—figure supplement E). T118A mutation on PNKP affects its interaction with CDK1/2. Further, the result may suggest that PNKP preferentially interacts with CDK2 over CDK1, although the baseline expression level of CDK2 were slightly higher than that of CDK1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is not clear how T118 phosphorylation is involved in DNA damage repair itself as the authors suggested. The data presenting the involvement of T118 phosphorylation in this mechanism are limited. This claim opens more questions than answers. CDK1/2 still phosphorylates T118 in this DNA damage repair process? What would happen to DNA damage repair in which PNKP involves outside of S phase in terms of T118 phosphorylation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We agree with your point. To prevent for dispersion of the focus of this manuscript, we re-considered and re-structured the total layout of the revised manuscript (as suggested by reviewer 3). You can find that we now mainly focused on the role of PNKP in DNA replication, which is an unexplored role of PNKP. We believe that the revised version of the manuscript is more straightforward for explaining an important role of PNKP in processing of Okazaki fragments during DNA replication.</p><p>Briefly, the phosphorylation of PNKP of T118 is CDK1/2-dependent process, meaning that the phosphorylation peaks at S phase, which is mainly shown in new figure 4 and figure 4—figure supplement. Therefore, it does not seem a DNA damage responsive phosphorylation. Along with general DNA repair and genomic instability assays in T118A expressing PNKP KO cells (figure 5—figure supplement C-F), we have performed H2OS-induced SSB assay using EdU (S phase) pulse labelling in PNKP KO cells expressing PNKP T118A mutant, then we measured the ADP-ribose intensity in EdU negative cells (outside of S phase as suggested by the reviewer) in new figure 5—figure supplement E (also below). Interestingly, we see that T118A cells behave like PNKP KO cells in S phase population, but not outside the S phase, indicating that T118 phosphorylation mainly involves in DNA repair process against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced exogenous DNA damage in S phase. Future study will be needed to test this regulation of DNA repair processes via the PNKP phosphorylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Along the same line with #1/2 comments, the recruitment of PNKP to the damage sites is XRCC1 dependent. Is not clear whether PNKP recruitment to gaps on the lagging strand is XRCC1 independent or dependent. It might be interesting to examine (OPTIONAL)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for an important suggestion. XRCC1 acts as a scaffold of PNKP and is required for recruitment of PNKP for canonical SSB repair, although we propose that PNKP is involved in two pathways in DNA replication: PARP1-XRCC1-dependent ssDNA gap filling pathway and canonical Okazaki fragment maturation pathway working with FEN1. It is still important to address how XRCC1 is required for PNKP recruitment to the single-strand gaps on nascent DNA. Therefore, we have added iPOND analysis in XRCC1 knock down + GFP-WT-PNKP expressed HEK293 cells in Figure 4F. The result shows that XRCC1-depletion reduces an amount of PNKP on nascent DNA, although this reduction seems lesser extent than XRCC1 reduction by siRNA. This may indicate that PNKP has a XRCC1-independent alternative recruitment pathway during DNA replication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1. In results: 'Generation of PNKP knock out U2OS cell line'</p><p>- In figure S2A; There are no data regarding diminishing the phosphorylation of g-H2AX.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have added pH2AX blot data in figure 1—figure supplement 2A (all reviewers requested).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- By showing data in figure S2B/C/D/E, the authors describe 'PNKP KO cells impaired the SSBs repair activity'. However, as the authors mentioned in this manuscript, PNKP could bind to either XRCC1 or XRCC4. Also for this experiment, IR had been applied, which induces DNA double strand breaks. Therefore, it is not certain that the authors' description is fully supported by these data presented. Perhaps, SSB inducing reagents should be used instead of IR.</p></disp-quote><p>In the figure S2B/C/D/E, we used γ-ray as IR source, which classified as low energy transfer irradiation, which mainly act as indirect effect to the DNA. It is estimated γ-ray induce DNA damage as 60-80% SSBs and 20-40 % DSBs. We believe that our results are reasonable. In addition to these mentioned above, we have performed native BrdU incorporation assay with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment to more specifically assess SSBs repair activity. In line with our data used IR, PNKP KO cells showed a markedly higher BrdU incorporation level upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment compared to that in PNKP WT cells (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-E). Therefore, we suppose that our updated description, “We then assessed~~~, indicating that the loss of PNKP leads to reduced ability of SSB repair in cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-F)”, is now strongly supported by this result. As a result of re-structuring/cutting down of figures (as suggested by the reviewer 2 and 3), previous figure S2D/E were removed from the panel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is there any FACS analysis data to support the description of the last sentence 'especially the phosphorylation of PNKP T118, is required for S phase progression and proper cell proliferation'?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have performed the FACS analysis data of cell cycle profiles in PNKP KO cells expressing GFP, GFP-PNKP WT or T118A. Unfortunately, transient transfection of the plasmids affects their cell cycle. We were not able to get further supporting evidence of the sentence you mentioned. Therefore, we have modified the sentence to “especially the phosphorylation of PNKP T118, is required for proper cell proliferation” to make our point clearer.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99217-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Is there any difference (except for PARGi exposure time?!) between figure S2B/C and S2D/E? Both data show increased ADP ribose after IR. It seems redundancy. Also it is hard to imagine that there is absolutely no sign of ADP ribose after IR w/o PARGi treatment (figure S2D).</p></disp-quote><p>The previous figure S2B/C show spontaneous single strand DNA breaks (SSBs) in PNKP KO cells, on the other hand, the previous figure S2D/E show ectopic SSBs induced by IR exposure in PNKP KO cells. Poly-ADP ribosylations are immediately removed from SSB sites after repair as demonstrated previously (Tsukada, et al., PLoS One 2019, Kalasova et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2020), although not zero (low level), it is very difficult to detect without PARGi treatment. However, during this revision, we have investigated this by an alternative experimental method, a BrdU incorporation assay (in new figure 1—figure supplement 2D-E), which is a more direct method to detect single-stranded DNA. In line with the previous figure 2D/E, new figures show that PNKP KO cells exhibit impaired DNA repair ability against exogenous DNA damage induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a SSB inducer. Therefore, we replaced the previous figure S2D/E to new figure S2D-E due to redundancies between those results. We believe these new data help for readers to understand the effect of endogenous or exogenous damage in PNKP KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Legend for figure S3 – typo!</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion about typo. The legend for figure 3—figure supplement is corrected as “Protein expression of PNKP mutants in U2OS cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In figure S3A/B, it is quite interesting that the PNKP antibody used for this analysis can detect all truncated and alanine substituted PNKP proteins. It might be helpful to indicate for other researchers which antibody used (Novus; epitope – 57aa to 189 aa or Abcam; epitope not revealed).</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 3—figure supplement A/B, Novus PNKP antibody was used for all blots. We indicated this in the figure legend as “PNKP antibody (Novus: NBP1-87257) was used for comparing expression levels of endogenous and exogenous PNKP”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In results: 'PNKP phosphorylation, especially of T118 ~~~ proliferation'</p><p>- In the fork progression experiment (figure 2C), is there any statistical difference between D2 and D3/4 expressing cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The corresponding figure (previous figure 2C) is now figure 3C. In the new figure 3C. We performed statistical analysis as the reviewer suggested. Statistical analysis shows that there are no significant differences between D2 and D3/D4. Meanwhile, there are significant differences between WT and D3(P&lt;0.01), D4 (P&lt;0.001), indicating that D3 and D4 mutants are not able to rescue this phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What is the basis of the description 'Since the linker region of PNKP is considered to be involved in fork progression'? Any reference?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. This sentence was considered based on the results in figure 3A-C. However, we suppose this description may be overstated, we therefore modified the description to “D2 mutant-expressing cells showed slower proliferation than cells expressing WT PNKP and other mutants, although D3 and D4 exhibited mildly slower cell proliferation (WT vs D3: P=0.1737; WT vs D4: P=0.4523). Furthermore, D3, D4 as well as D2 mutant-expressing cells showed increased tract lengths compared to WT and D1 mutant-expressing cells, indicating that in addition to the enzymatic activity of PNKP, the linker region also plays a crucial role in proper fork progression.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In figure 3B: pS114-PNKP (also pS15-p53) is DNA damage inducible. In this experiment, was DNA damage introduced? Roscovitine could hinder DNA repair process, but not inducing DNA damage itself.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. DNA damage induction was not applied in this experiment. We agree that this panel makes confusing. We think that endogenously S114-PNKP (also S15-p53) might be phosphorylated slightly but not significant, although this is not the scope of this manuscript. This result showing that phosphorylated-T118 is reduced by Roscovitine treatment maybe redundant as we also have a result of in vitro phosphorylation assay using several combinations of CDKs and Cyclin proteins, which is a cleaner experiment to prove which CDK/Cyclin complex is directly controlling the T118 phosphorylation (in new figure 4B). Furthermore, we performed a GFP-PNKP pulldown assay to investigate the interaction between PNKP and CDK1/2 in cells (in new figure S4E). In order to answer reviewer 3’s comment suggesting us to remove redundant figures from the panel, we removed this WB blot result from the panel due to the redundancy of these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In results: 'CDKs phosphorylate T118 of PNKP ~~~ replication forks'</p><p>- In figure 3A, Is there any change in total PNKP (both GFP-tagged &amp; endogenous) level?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We agree with your comment. We have added the both GFP-PNKP and endogenous PNKP expression analysis in different cell cycle population in asynchronized and synchronized cells (G1, S, G2/M samples). As you can see in the new figure 4A, GFP-PNKP expression levels are consistent throughout cell cycle. Therefore, we believe that T118 phosphorylation is peaked in S phase. However, endogenous PNKP expression levels were slightly changed through cell cycle, peaking at S phase, which indicate that endogenous PNKP expression level or its stability may be regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This is an interesting observation, but it is out of scope in this study, so follow-up study will be required for investigating the regulatory mechanism of PNKP protein stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In results: ‘Phosphorylation of PNKP at T118 ~~~ between Okazaki fragments’</p><p>- In figure 4D, What happens in the ADP-ribose level, when T118D PNKP is expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. This is an interesting question. We performed ADP-ribosylation assay in PNKP KO cells expressing PNKP WT and T118D (new figure 5—figure supplement A/B). The phospho-mimetic mutant T118D-expressing PNKP KO cells behave like the PNKP KO cells expressing PNKP WT, which indicates the importance of the phosphorylation of PNKP on T118 in dealing with endogenous and FEN1i-induced single-strand DNA gaps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In results: 'Phosphatase activity of PNKP is ~~~ of Okazaki fragments'</p><p>- In figure 5C, any statistical analysis between WT-PNKP KO vs D171A-PNKP KO or K378A-PNKP KO has been done?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Statistical analysis shows P&lt;0.1 between WT PNKP vs D171A and no statistical significance between WT PNKP vs K378A PNKP in IdU tract length of these samples, although p-value between PNKP KO vs WT PNKP, D171A, or K378A are P&lt;0.0001, ns, and P&lt;0.1, respectively. Those data indicates that D171A and K378A mutants are not fully capable to compliment ability of fork progression comparing to PNKP WT cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In results: 'PNKP is involved in post replicative single-strand DNA gap-filling pathway'</p><p>- The description regarding data presented in figure 6 is not clear enough. These data might suggest that wildtype U2OS does not have SSB which is a substrate for S1 nuclease (except under FEN1i and PARPi treatment), whereas PNKP KO has SSB during both IdU and CIdU incorporation, so that S1 nuclease treatment dramatically reduces the speed of fork formation in PNKP KO cells. Also In figure 6B/C/D, adding an experimental group of PNKP KO with S1 nuclease + PARPi might help to understand the role of PNKP during replication better.

We agree with reviewer’s comment and suggestion. Since this point is also raised by reviewer 3, we added the rationale of the experiment (new figure 2C) and more detailed description about the results. We have also revised our representation in text followed by the comment. In addition to revising the text, we have added experiment groups of PNKP KO with S1 nuclease with/without PARPi treatment as the reviewer suggested (new figure 2D). PNKP KO cells showed significantly smaller IdU/CldU ratio upon S1 nuclease treatment regardless of the presence of PARP1 inhibitor (the sixth and eighth lane from the left). Although PARP1 inhibitor treatment in U2OS cells creates substrates for S1 nuclease (the third and fourth lane from the left), the extent of post-replicative single-strand DNA gaps in PNKP KO cells were further increased (the fourth and eighth lane from the left). This result indicates that PNKP is involved in the single-strand DNA gap filling pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

It is very important to analyze whether T118A mutant shows delayed or total loss of DSB repair ability. We added the measurement of pH2AX foci at 24 hrs after IR in PNKP KO cells expressing GFP, WT-PNKP, T118A-PNKP. Although the analysis of pS114 PNKP is previously reported (Segal-Raz et al., EMBO reports, 2011 and Zolner et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 2011), we also performed pH2AX assay in PNKP KO cells expressing S114A-PNKP as a control (figure 5—figure supplement F). The result shows that cells expressing S114A or T118A mutant still have increased gH2AX foci levels at 24 hrs after IR exposure, indicating that these mutants are delayed in repair of IR-induced DNA damage at least up to 24 hrs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

As you mentioned, there are several other end processing enzymes that seem to be involved in canonical Okazaki fragment maturation pathway, however, none of those enzymes is reported as a protein involved in the gap-filling pathway as well. Therefore, the role(s) of PNKP in DNA replication are very outstanding as PNKP could be involved in two separate pathways, the canonical Okazaki fragment maturation and a back-up gap-filling repair process. As you suggested, we have added several experiments such as iPOND experiments using XRCC1-depleted cells, analysis of DNA repair ability of PNKP T118A mutant throughout cell cycle and S1 nuclease DNA fiber assays in PNKP KO cells with/without PARP inhibitor treatment, to reveal how much PNKP is critical in the Okazaki fragment maturation.

Based on the model proposed, the prediction would be that it would not be associated with the forks, or at least, associated at reduced levels compared to the wt.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We agree with your comment. We have added the iPOND analysis in PNKP T118A expressing PNKP KO cells to confirm that pT118 is important for recruitment of PNKP at nascent DNA.

The quality of the gels showing the phosphatase and kinase assays in Figure 5 could be improved to facilitate quantification of the results. The gel showing the phosphatase activity has a deformed band corresponding to K378A mutant. The gel showing the kinase activity seems to be hitting the detection limits, and the overall high background might influence the quantification of D171A mutant in the area of interest. The authors should provide a better quality of these gels, focusing on better separation (running them longer, eventually with a slightly increased electric current) and higher signal of the analyzed bands (longer incubation phosphatase/kinase prior to quenching or loading higher amount of DNA).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

Based on the data in Figure 3A the authors suggest that pT118-PNKP follows Cyclin A2 levels, but this does not appear very clearly in the gel, especially for the last point.

We agree that this phrase is overwriting. We revised the conclusion to “pT118-PNKP was detected in asynchronized cells but increased particularly in the S phase, similar to Cyclin A2 expression levels. However, the reduction of pT118, possibly due to dephosphorylation of T118, was not as robust as the reduction in Cyclin A2 expression levels at the 12-hour time point. This effect was very weak during mitosis, suggesting that T118 phosphorylation plays a specific role in the S phase.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Why the S1 nuclease data on DNA fibers do not show the same level of epistasis with the Fen1i, as do those on ADP-ribosylation?</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, because FEN1 dependent canocical Okazaki fragment maturation and PARP1-XRCC1 dependent gap-filling pathway are different pathways (Vatsiankova et al., 2022), FEN1i and PARPi treatment resulted in an additive effect in S1 nuclease data in PNKP WT cells in figure 2C. Our results suggest that PNKP is involved in both pathways mentioned above. Secondly, this could be due to the nature of these experimental methods. In new figure 2C, we used S1 nuclease to digest post-replicative single-strand DNA gaps to investigate length of single-strand DNA gaps at the single DNA fiber level, whereas the ADP-ribosylation assay is a method to detect general ADP-ribosylation levels in each cell. Therefore, those results may show length of single-strand DNA gaps and numbers of single-strand DNA gaps, respectively, which are not fully same phenomenon. To facilitate better understanding, we added graphical scheme in new figure 2E (a similar problem was raised by Reviewer 3 below) and revised the description of the result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.

The authors try to understand by mutant complementation which of the two functions (Phosphatase vs Kinase) is important in processing OF, and they propose a primary role for the phosphatase activity of PNKP. They also show that T118 is important in controlling genome stability following different genotoxic stress. Finally, by coupling the measurement of fork progression with PARP/FEN1 inhibitors and S1 treatment, they propose a role of PNKP in the post-replicative repair of single-strand gaps due to unligated OF.</p><p>Here are my major points:</p><p>– The authors use a poly ADP ribose deposition measurement to estimate SSB nick/gap formation. Even if PARP activity is strictly linked to SSB repair, ADP ribosylation does not directly estimate SSB/nick gap formation. In addition, in FiguresS2A, B, and C, the authors use IR and PARG inhibition to measure poly-ADP ribosylation in WT and PNKP KO cells. IR produces both SSB and DSB. A better and cleaner experiment would be to directly measure SSB formation (with alkaline comet assay, for example) in combination with treatments that are known to mainly cause SSB (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or low doses of bleomycin).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Previous our report published in EMBO Journal (Shimada et al., 2015), we showed SSBs and DSBs repair defect in PNKP KO MEF with comet assay (both alkaline and neutral) after IR and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. In addition to those observations, to measure SSB formation more directly, we performed BrdU incorporation assay in PNKP WT and KO cells treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (figure 1—figure supplement 2D-E), showing that PNKP KO cells exhibits significantly higher BrdU incorporation upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment compared to that in PNKP WT cells. BrdU staining under an undenatured condition has now been commonly used and is a more direct method to detect ssDNA nick/gap formation. We believe that the importance of PNKP in SSB repair is sufficiently supported by all data such as previous comet assays in PNKP KO MEF cells and the SSB repair assay in human cells using BrdU incorporation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The manuscript would benefit from substantially restructuring the figures' order and panels. Before starting the T118 part, the authors could create several figures to explain the main consequences of the loss of PNKP. A figure could be focused on DSB-driven genome instability (Figure 1 + Figure S8 and S9). Then, a figure for the single-strand break and link to the S-phase. For example, by using data from Figure 6 and showing only WT vs PNKP KO +\- Nuclease S1 (without FEN1 or PARP inhibitors), the authors could easily convince the readers that loss of PNKP leads to the accumulation of single-strand gaps. Only in the second part of the manuscript could they introduce all the T118 parts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. The layout of the manuscript makes reviewers feeling confusing. As you can find in our revised manuscript, we reconsidered the total layout of the manuscript carefully. Briefly, as you suggested, we made a figure explaining general consequences of the loss of PNKP (figure 1—figure supplement 2), then a figure (new figure 1) showing that PNKP-deficient cells exhibit an accumulation of single-strand DNA gaps in S-phase, followed by a figure (new figure 2) showing that the single-strand DNA gaps in PNKP-deficient cells are caused by problems during Okazaki-fragment maturation process. Then, finally we introduce all the T118 parts (new figure 3-5) and the PNKP’s enzymatic activity part (new figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I understand the use of a FEN1 inhibitor to link the PNKP KO phenotype to OF processing, but this drug does not either rescue or exacerbate any of the phenotypes described by the authors. It seems to have just an epistatic effect everywhere. So, what other conclusion can we have if not that PNKO has a similar effect to FEN1? I think that the presence of this inhibitor in many plots complicates the digestion of several figures a little bit. Maybe clustering the data in a different way (DMSO on one side FEN1i on the other) would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We agree that this data set is complicated. To facilitate better understanding, we changed organization of the data (new figure 5A, 5B, 5D/E, 6A and 6B/C) according to your suggestion and added graphical schemes in new figure 1, 2 and 6.</p><p>In terms of the other conclusion we can have from those experiments, the other conclusion is that PNKP may play two important roles in DNA replication: canonical Okazaki fragment maturation, which seems an epistatic effect with FEN1, and PARP1-XRCC1 dependent single-strand DNA gap filling pathway, which is required for repairing single-strand gaps between Okazaki fragments when canonical Okazaki fragment maturation pathway does not work properly (e.g., loss of FEN1 or PNKP). In new figure 2C, we show that a double treatment of FEN1i and PARPi in PNKP WT cells with S1 nuclease treatment shows extensive amount of digested DNA fibers, although a single treatment of either FEN1i or PARPi in PNKP WT cells with S1 nuclease treatment leads to only limited amount of digested DNA fibers, which indicates that two pathways regulated by FEN1 or PARP are coordinately required for preventing eruption of ssDNA gaps in DNA replication, consistent with previous study (Vaitsiankova et al. NSMB. 2022). On the other hand, PNKP KO cells with S1 nuclease treatment cause extensive amount of digested DNA fibers even without FEN1i and PARP1i treatments, also it is not further increased by FEN1i and PARPi treatment. Those results indicate that PNKP itself is involved in two pathways mentioned above. Therefore, loss of PNKP has a similar phenotype with loss of FEN1 in terms of canonical Okazaki fragment maturation, but also there is an additional effect in repairing those ssDNA gaps, which is created in FEN1 loss condition, but FEN1 seems not dealing with it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure S9 should be removed from the discussion.

In Figure 4C, while it is clear that poly ADP ribosylation is higher in S-phase, the effects of PNKP KO and complementation by WT or T118A are equally present. This would be more immediate if comparison, fold change, and statistical significance calculation were done within the same cell cycle phase instead of between cell stages. This is also clear by IF in Figure 4B. How do the authors explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We agree with reviewer’s suggestion. We compared intensities of ADP-ribose between cell lines in same cell cycle rather than between different cell cycles in a same cell line and added the respective fold-changes in the statement of figure 5C. Also, we agree with that poly ADP-ribose intensity is also changed outside of S phase between WT and T118A PNKP expressing PNKP KO cells. These results might reflect of PNKP function outside of S phase. Therefore, we have added the sentence “Of note, PNKP<sup>−/−</sup> cells and PNKP T118A cells also showed higher ADP-ribose intensity outside the S phase (1.47-fold increase vs. WT-expressing cells), indicating that PNKP and T118 may play a role in preventing SSBs formation outside the S phase. Since FEN1 has been reported to function in R-loop processing, PNKP could also be involved in this process. Future studies of a role of PNKP in different cell cycle will be able to address this question.” to discuss about the function of PNKP outside the S phase. We have added the ref (Cristini et al., Cell Reports, 2019, and Laverde et al., Genes, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In connection with the previous point, can the author provide the same quantification in Figure 4E also for G2/M and not only the S phase? This should give an estimate of the activity of FEN1 outside the S-phase. This is important because FEN1 has other functions apart from OF maturation, such as R loop processing (Cristini 2019; Laverde 2023)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Here attached is the data of ADP-ribose intensity in cells outside the S phase as you suggested. Although the difference between with/without FEN1i treatment is much smaller than that in S phase, FEN1i treatment still induces increased ADP-ribose intensity in outside the S phase in PNKP WT-expressing PNKP<sup>−/−</sup> cells as well, indicating that FEN1 has other functions outside the S phase. This finding is very interesting. However, the function of FEN1 in outside the S phase is outside the scope of this manuscript. Therefore, we would like to not put this data in the manuscript to avoid complicating the conclusion (as reviewer 3 also suggested).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99217-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Why does FEN1 inhibition induce a faster fork progression in Figure 4 but not in Figure 5 and Fig6?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it does in previous figure 4 and figure 5 (new figure 2B, 5A and 6A). In PNKP WT cells, FEN1i-treated fibers (CldU) show an increased speed of forks compared to non-treated fibers (IdU). However, loss of PNKP and T118 phosphorylation themselves cause a faster fork progression even without FEN1i treatment, therefore the difference of speeds of forks before/after FEN1i treatment in PNKP KO and T118A cells disappears as both fibers grow faster than intact fibers in normal cells. In regard to figure 6 (new figure 2C), as you mentioned in a latter comment about this figure, those DNA fibers are potentially digested by S1 nuclease. Therefore, this is an experiment measuring the presence of single-strand DNA gaps on forks, but not directly measuring speeds of forks. Even so, DNA fibers from FEN1i-treated cells (CldU) with S1 nuclease shows similar length with fibers from untreated cells with S1 nuclease, whereas FEN1 inhibitor treatment accelerates a speed of forks in general (figure 4 and figure 5, assays without S1 nuclease), indicating that FEN1i treatment induces remaining of some ssDNA nicks/gaps which are substrates of S1 nuclease.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How do the authors explain the impaired DNA gap binding activity of the phospho-mimetic T118D?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion.

We agree with that a manner and a structure of the manuscript could be improved by reordering figures, cutting down some redundant experiments, adding better explanation of the rationale behind experiments, and toning-down some claims. With rewriting the manuscript as stated above and performing several additional experiments suggested by the reviewers, we believe that the revised manuscript became more convincing and fascinating.</p></body></sub-article></article>
