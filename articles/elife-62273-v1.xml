Here we address a remaining gap in our knowledge regarding how the CNS and immune systems interact during viral infection. By examining the regulation of the immune and nervous system processes in a nonhuman primate model of West Nile virus neurological disease, we show that virus infection disrupts the homeostasis of the immune-neural-synaptic axis via induction of pleiotropic genes with distinct functions in each component of the axis. This pleiotropic gene regulation suggests an unintended off-target negative impact of virus-induced host immune responses on the neurotransmission, which may be a common feature of various viral infections of the CNS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>functional genomics</kwd><kwd>immune system</kwd><kwd>neuronal system</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>pleiotropic genes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maximova</surname><given-names>Olga A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sturdevant</surname><given-names>Daniel E</given-names></name><name><surname>Kash</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanakabandi</surname><given-names>Kishore</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Yongli</given-names></name><name><surname>Minai</surname><given-names>Mahnaz</given-names></name><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Ian N</given-names></name><name><surname>Taubenberger</surname><given-names>Jeff</given-names></name><name><surname>Martens</surname><given-names>Craig</given-names></name><name><surname>Cohen</surname><given-names>Jeffrey I</given-names></name><name><surname>Pletnev</surname><given-names>Alexander G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Virus infection of the central nervous system disrupts the homeostasis of the immune-neural-synaptic axis via induction of pleiotropic genes with an unintended off-target negative impact on the neurotransmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many viruses can invade the central nervous system (CNS), infect the neurons, propagate by exploiting cellular machinery, hijack axonal transport, and cross the synapses to disseminate within neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taylor and Enquist, 2015</xref>). This is also true for the West Nile virus (WNV), which can infect the CNS, use bi-directional axonal transport, and spread trans-synaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>). WNV infection has affected an estimated 7 million people in the continental United States since the first outbreak in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ronca et al., 2019</xref>). In humans, WNV infection can result in WNV neurological disease (WNV-ND) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davis et al., 2006</xref>) with a high in-hospital mortality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeung et al., 2017</xref>), motor and cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Beckham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patel et al., 2015</xref>), and increased risk of death during the convalescent phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Philpott et al., 2019</xref>). WNV-ND can present as meningoencephalomyelitis with any combination of clinico-pathological features such as aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and acute flaccid myelitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sejvar, 2016</xref>). The estimated ratio of the incidence of WNV-ND relative to the number of WNV-RNA-positive blood donors is ≤1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Betsem et al., 2017</xref>), but the current burden of WNV-ND may be underestimated due to underutilization or inaccurate choice of diagnostic tests when viral encephalitis is clinically diagnosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vanichanan et al., 2016</xref>). The lessons from the past two decades of extensive research using mouse models have provided a better understanding of immune control of WNV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diamond and Gale, 2012</xref>). However, current knowledge is yet to be translated into effective treatment or better clinical management of WNV-ND, which remains only supportive. A major question of how virus replication in neurons and ensuing immune responses alter neural functions and result in neuropathological sequelae remains unanswered.</p><p>Postulated mechanisms of the neuropathogenic impact of WNV infection center around the loss of neurons due to either direct cytopathic effect of virus replication or damaging effects of the inflammatory environment developing in response to infection. Yet, in order to develop potential neuroprotective therapies, we need to better understand the mechanisms of neuronal dysfunction during acute infection, before neuronal loss has occurred, as well as the characteristics of neurological deficits after recovery. Loss of synapses in the hippocampus has been suggested as one of the potential mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment in patients recovering from WNV encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vasek et al., 2016</xref>). The impact of WNV infection on neurophysiology is expected to be CNS-region-specific, which would result in the impairment of a function specific to an affected neural network. This necessitates a study of the pathogenic mechanisms of the impairment of motor functions in movement disorders, typically observed in WNV-ND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lenka et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>One unbiased approach to obtain a broad insight into complex pathophysiological changes occurring in the virus-infected CNS is to examine alterations in global gene expression. Although several studies have provided insights into changes in gene expression in the CNS after an experimental WNV infection, they mainly focused on the immune responses and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kosch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourgeois et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venter et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vig et al., 2018</xref>). Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying changes in the regulation of the CNS during WNV-ND is incomplete. Here, we studied how the CNS is regulated when faced with a challenge to fight virus infection of neurons in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model, using combined analysis of the transcriptome, protein expression, and cell morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Tissue samples for this study were selected from the CNS of NHPs inoculated intracerebrally with wild type WNV (NY99) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>). The rationale for the selection of CNS structures for examination was as follows: (i) high viral burden at the site; (ii) severe histopathological changes at the site; and (iii) presence of neurological signs consistent with the function of the respective structure. Based on these criteria from the intracerebral NHP model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>), which are consistent with a body of data on the virology, histopathology, and clinical presentations of WNV-ND in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Beckham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sejvar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lenka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omalu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cushing et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guarner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hart et al., 2014</xref>), the cerebellum and spinal cord samples were selected for analysis. The samples were from the following predetermined time points after WNV infection: (i) 3 days post-infection (dpi; presymptomatic stage; n = 3); (ii) 7 dpi (early-symptomatic stage; moderate incoordination, tremor, and limb weakness; n = 3); and (iii) 9 dpi (advanced-symptomatic stage; severe incoordination, tremor, and limb weakness that required humane euthanasia; n = 3). The mock control cerebellum or spinal cord samples were from NHPs (n = 4) that were inoculated intracerebrally in an identical manner to the virus-inoculated animals, except that the inoculum contained only diluent and not virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>) (detailed procedure is described by us previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maximova et al., 2008</xref>]). These four mock-inoculated control animals were used for normalization of gene expression and one animal (euthanized at 10 dpi) was used as a normal control for immunohistochemistry that examined the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND (9 dpi).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>WNV infection of the CNS alters the homeostasis in transcriptional regulation of the immune and neural system domains</title><p>We examined gene expression changes in the cerebellar and spinal samples from the CNS of intracerebrally infected NHPs using Affymetrix microarray analysis and validated microarray results by qPCR.

In the spinal cord, however, six genes were significantly upregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05; fold change ≥2 over mock) and none were significantly downregulated. The upregulated genes were: <italic>MX1</italic> (12.2-fold change), <italic>IFIT3</italic> (7.9-fold change), <italic>IFI44L</italic> (7.6-fold change), <italic>PARP9</italic> (4.0-fold change), <italic>STAT1</italic> (3.2-fold change), and <italic>TRIM22</italic> (2.1-fold change). Annotation of these genes to gene ontology (GO) terms revealed a functional dichotomy for some of these genes in regulating both the immune and nervous system. While all six genes were annotated to GO biological process (BP) terms such as defense response to virus (GO:0051607) and immune system process (GO:0002376), two of these genes (<italic>MX1</italic> and <italic>STAT1</italic>) were also annotated to the nervous system related terms such as the dendrite (GO:0030425), axon (GO:0030424), synapse (GO:0054202), and regulation of synapse structure or activity (GO: 0050803). These data suggest a dual immune-neural functionality of some early upregulated genes and offer a hint to a transcriptional activation of immune responses and concurrent modulation of neurotransmission, likely associated with sensing the spread of WNV within the CNS, which can occur trans-synaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>). Since the small number of the differentially regulated genes precluded the use of statistical analyses for this presymptomatic stage, all functional genomic analyses hereafter will be focused on the early-symptomatic (7 dpi) and/or advanced-symptomatic (9 dpi) stages of WNV-ND.</p><p>At the early-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND (7 dpi), there were many more upregulated than downregulated genes in both the cerebellum and spinal cord, with much stronger transcriptional changes in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). At the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND (9 dpi), compared to early-symptomatic stage, the number of upregulated and downregulated genes increased in both the cerebellum and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>), with about twice as many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the spinal cord, compared to the cerebellum. Notably, the spinal cord also consistently displayed a higher percentage of the downregulated genes, which doubled at the advanced symptomatic stage compared to the early-symptomatic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). Similarity between the genes that were differentially expressed in the WNV-infected cerebellum and spinal cord was higher for the upregulated genes (40–42%), compared to overlaps in the downregulated genes (9–12%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and h</xref>).</p><p>The overrepresentation test (ORT; BP complete; FDR &lt; 0.05), using the lists of genes that were upregulated or downregulated in the spinal cord at the advanced-symptomatic stage, identified the immune and nervous systems as the top biological systems significantly enriched for the upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>) and downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), respectively.</p><p>Since the top largest enriched GO BP term for downregulated genes was 'nervous system development', we further dissected transcriptional regulation of the developmental and repair processes in the CNS that may be altered by WNV infection using the gProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raudvere et al., 2019</xref>). Analysis of the upregulated genes in the cerebellum and spinal cord revealed upregulation of the developmental processes with major ‘spikes’ (i.e., most significant enrichment) related to the immune system development, response to wounding, and wound healing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>). Both the cerebellum and spinal cord also displayed upregulation of the gliogenesis/astrocyte development and extracellular matrix/tissue remodeling. In contrast, developmental and/or repair processes related to neurons, their cellular components, and respective anatomical structure/network development were significantly enriched for the downregulated genes, with major ‘spikes’ related to neuron/neuron projection development and axon development/guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and d</xref>). This suggested that there was a downregulation rather than activation of the developmental processes related to neurons. However, given the detected spikes in regulation of axon development/guidance, we asked whether the molecular environment for axonal regeneration was inhibitory or permissive based on the up- or downregulation of expression of established axon growth inhibitory or permissive molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). Of 59 axon-growth-modulating molecules analyzed, we found changes in gene expression for 6 inhibitory and 16 permissive molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Taking into account the fold changes for these 22 axon growth genes, when (i) downregulation of permissive or upregulation of inhibitory molecules would indicate the inhibitory molecular environment for axonal regeneration, while (ii) downregulation of inhibitory or upregulation of permissive molecules would indicate the permissive environment, we found a progressive trend which was skewed to the axon growth permissive environment.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>West Nile virus (WNV) infection alters transcriptional regulation of the developmental and repair processes in the central nervous system (CNS).</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) Enrichment of the developmental process and/or repair in WNV-infected cerebellum (<bold>a and b</bold>) and spinal cord (<bold>c and d</bold>) based on the ratios between GO term size (number of genes in term) and intersection size (number of differentially expressed genes annotated to term) at the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV neurological disease (WNV-ND; 9 dpi).

The neuronal system domain was most affected at the advanced-symptomatic stage in both the cerebellum and spinal cord (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e, f, i, and j</xref>), coinciding with the progression to severe neurological signs at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>). We noted that the Reactome’s neuronal system domain is limited only to pathways associated with the neurotransmission and does not cover the complexity of the nervous system. Nonetheless, it enabled identification of transmission across chemical synapses as a common significantly affected pathway in the cerebellum and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f, and j</xref>; pathway node #2). The only difference between the cerebellum and spinal cord in terms of affected neuronal pathways was that the protein–protein interactions at synapses reached the statistical significance only in the spinal cord at the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f and j</xref>; pathway node #8).</p><p>Together, these results show that WNV infection induces progressive and CNS-structure-dependent gene expression changes that manifest in transcriptional upregulation of biological pathways ascribed to the immune system gene ontologies and downregulation of functions related to the neuronal system biological domain. Therefore, a larger overlap in the upregulated genes compared to downregulated genes between the cerebellum and spinal cord may be explained by a higher similarity in the immune responses, but a site-specific impairment of distinct neural functions carried by these two CNS structures. In addition, we show that WNV infection alters transcriptional regulation of developmental and repair processes in the CNS, which are associated with upregulation of the immune system development/wound healing and downregulation of the neuronal/axonal regenerative processes. However, further dissection of the molecular environment associated with axonal regeneration also indicated a trend that was more skewed to the axon growth permissive rather than inhibitory environment, suggesting initiation of the neuronal network repair programs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Altered CNS homeostasis in WNV-ND is defined by the large and subtle coordinated transcriptional shifts regulating the immune and nervous system, respectively</title><p>To further analyze the magnitude of transcriptional dysregulation within the CNS caused by WNV infection, we employed a statistical functional enrichment method that takes into account the fold changes associated with DEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mi et al., 2019</xref>). This method has an advantage of detecting the coordinated changes in expression of groups of genes that are shifted from the overall distribution. Such coordinated transcriptional shifts can be subtle and elude other functional annotation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>). We reasoned that this method could provide a better understanding of the magnitude of transcriptional dysregulation of the nervous system that appeared relatively subtle at the level of pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Since the pathway level analysis showed that the immune and neuronal domains were affected the most at the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND, we analyzed genes that were significantly differentially expressed in WNV-infected cerebellum or spinal cord at this time point, together with their expression values (FC over mock). The results of this test, as expected, revealed coordinated large and subtle transcriptional shifts regulating the immune and nervous system, respectively. The large coordinated shifts (i.e., shifts to the greater fold change values from the overall distribution) were associated with the host defense response to viral infection and innate/adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–d</xref>). In contrast, the subtle coordinated shifts (i.e., shifts to the smaller fold change values from the overall distribution) were associated with the cellular compartments of neurons (i.e., neuronal cell body, dendrite, axon, and glutamatergic and GABA-ergic synapses) and functions related to neurons (i.e., chemical synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter secretion, action potential, ensheathment of neurons, microtubule cytoskeleton organization, and synapse organization) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e–h</xref>).

WNV-induced pleiotropic immune-neural DEGs suggested that the synapse is one of their major targets in the neuron, we next determined the overlap between these pleiotropic DEGs and WNV-induced synaptic DEGs identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, ‘Synaptic genes differentially expressed during WNV-ND’). To compare these genes, we focused on the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND in the spinal cord since it had the highest number of genes in both groups. A Venn diagram comparison identified an overlap containing 36 immune-neural-synaptic pleiotropic DEGs, of which 19 were upregulated and 17 were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>, ‘Immune-neural-synaptic pleiotropic genes’). Functional GO enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes in this overlap indicated that they had multiple roles in the positive regulation of the following functions: (i) immune/defense response to virus; (ii) nervous system development (neurogenesis/gliogenesis); and (iii) neuronal cell body/projections/synapses-specific processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c and d</xref>). These processes were also significantly enriched for the downregulated pleiotropic genes, with a trend of less significant (compared to upregulated genes) enrichment of immune processes and more significant enrichment of processes related to the organization, structure, and/or activity of the neuronal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10e and f</xref>). Full results of functional GO enrichment analysis for the upregulated and downregulated pleiotropic immune-neural-synaptic genes are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref> (‘gProfiler: Immune-neural-synaptic pleiotropic DEGs’).</p><p>Interestingly, interrogation of specific pleiotropic genes showed that the gene <italic>C1QA</italic> that encodes a major constituent of the complement system subcomponent C1, was upregulated and mapped to significantly enriched GO terms associated with (i) immune/defense response to virus infection, (ii) glial cell response, (iii) neuron differentiation, and (iv) synapse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>, gProfiler: Immune-neural-synaptic pleiotropic DEGs’), as well as synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>Since the synapse emerged as the neuronal cell compartment most significantly enriched for pleiotropic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c–f</xref>), we applied synaptic GO enrichment analysis (SynGO) and found that both up- and downregulated genes had functionality in synapse organization and topology (i.e., localization of the gene product functions) at the presynapse and postsynapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10g</xref>). Specifically, the GO term of chemical synaptic transmission was significantly enriched for upregulated pleiotropic genes, while the GO term of protein catabolic process at the postsynapse was significantly enriched for downregulated pleiotropic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10g</xref>).

Pathogenesis and outcome of CNS diseases caused by flaviviruses are complex and involve an interplay of at least three components: (i) virus properties (i.e., virulence, ability to establish productive replication in neurons, and spread by axonal transport); (ii) host defense responses and/or viral evasion of these responses; and (iii) changes in neural function with ensuing specific neurological impairments. Although we now possess a substantial body of knowledge about flavivirus biology and host immune responses to infection (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pierson and Diamond, 2020</xref>), including immune responses that develop specifically within the CNS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maximova and Pletnev, 2018</xref>), our understanding of how they directly or indirectly influence neural function is incomplete. Here, we aimed to deconvolute the complex changes in CNS physiology that occur during flavivirus infection by examining differential regulation of BPs related to the immune and nervous systems in the NHP model of WNV-ND. We chose to focus on the cerebellum and spinal cord since these CNS structures appear to be among the most affected in both humans with WNV neuroinvasive disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Beckham, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sejvar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lenka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omalu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cushing et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guarner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armah et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hart et al., 2014</xref>) and NHP model of WNV-ND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>), causing ataxia and flaccid paralysis, respectively.</p><p>CNS neurons are terminally differentiated cells and cannot be replenished, thus virus infection of neurons present a challenge for both the nervous and immune system to coordinate virus clearance while protecting neurons and preserving neural function. While innate immune responses in the CNS are common during virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maximova and Pletnev, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffin, 2003</xref>), despite the concept of immune privilege status of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ransohoff and Brown, 2012</xref>), these responses need to be tightly controlled, since excessive or chronic inflammation can be harmful and detrimental to neural function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ransohoff and Brown, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ransohoff and Cardona, 2010</xref>). Here we introduce the concept that virus infection of CNS neurons disrupts the immune-neural axis homeostasis due to activation of pleiotropic genes that can regulate both innate immunity and neural function. Pleiotropy describes a concept where one gene and its encoded protein can control disparate, apparently unrelated BPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Radisky et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulanger, 2009</xref>). This concept is especially intriguing in the context of regulation of critically important neural functions. Many proteins with established functions in the immune system are also expressed in the developing and adult nervous system. Remarkably, some pleiotropic proteins such as proinflammatory cytokines and proteins in the complement system and major histocompatibility complex are essential for the establishment, organization, function, and removal of synapses between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulanger, 2009</xref>). We found that WNV infection of neurons in the cerebellar and spinal neural networks induces differential regulation (i.e., both up- and downregulation) of close to 200 pleiotropic genes that possess dual immunological and neurological topology and functionality. Strikingly, among the affected neuronal cell compartments, the synapses, both excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABA-ergic), emerged in this study as the most significantly transcriptionally dysregulated compartments. This was supported by the evidence of reduction in expression of the pan-presynaptic protein marker synaptophysin in the cerebellar and spinal motor circuitries. In addition, we identified a set of the pleiotropic genes with a triple topology and functionality in the immune system, nervous system in general (including functions of neuronal cell components and glial cells), and specifically, in neuron-to-neuron synapses (i.e., immune-neural-synaptic pleiotropic genes; n = 36). Focused spatial and functional interrogation of these pleiotropic genes that became possible with a recent release of a comprehensive synaptic biology knowledgebase SynGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>), suggested their involvement in the regulation of synapse (including pre- and post-synapses) organization, chemical synaptic transmission, and protein catabolic processes. This builds upon our conclusion that transcriptional responses to WNV infection result in altered regulation of the organization and function of synapses. Many immune molecules in the neuron-microglia-astrocyte-T-cell axes have been implicated in synaptic pruning during development or pathological elimination/loss of synapses during disease, depending on the neuronal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perry and O'Connor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verkhratsky and Nedergaard, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tröscher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kreutzfeldt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Di Liberto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stephan et al., 2012</xref>). Synaptic elimination in the hippocampus by a complement-microglial axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vasek et al., 2016</xref>) with assistance of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garber et al., 2019</xref>) has also been proposed as an underlying mechanism of flavivirus-associated cognitive dysfunction in a murine model. Our data in NHPs also support a significant role of the neuron-microglia-astrocyte-T-cell axes in the pathogenesis of WNV-ND at the gene and protein expression levels. Furthermore, the identification of the complement system <italic>C1QA</italic> gene (which was upregulated) as the immune-neural-synaptic pleiotropic gene in this study supports a growing evidence of the multiple roles of its protein product in the immune system and in elimination of synapses during development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perry and O'Connor, 2008</xref>). We propose a scenario in which changes in expression of pleiotropic genes that are intended to activate and maintain immune responses to virus infection would have unintended and potentially devastating off-target effects on neuron-to-neuron synapses and chemical neurotransmission.</p><p>Our findings were facilitated by a functional enrichment approach that allows detection of modest but coordinated changes in expression of groups of functionally related genes that may elude other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mi et al., 2019</xref>). A similar approach has been used to detecting subtle but important coordinated changes in gene expression associated with complex human disorders that otherwise may be overlooked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>). By using this approach, we were able to detect subtle coordinated shifts in regulation of the nervous system that were accompanied by disruption of the integrity and function of cellular compartments in infected neurons, especially their synapses. While these shifts are subtle, they may have an enormous impact, especially on the regulation of such crucial function as neural function. Consistent with this, we found that WNV infection disrupts transcriptional homeostasis of the cerebellar and spinal synapses, affecting the regulation of synapse organization, chemical synaptic transmission, metabolism, and transport. WNV-infection-induced upregulated and downregulated synaptic genes shared their topology and functionality, suggesting a bidirectional transcriptional dysregulation of synapse biology. These changes offer a mechanistic explanation for WNV-induced impairment of motor functions such as ataxia, tremor, and limb weakness/paralysis in our NHP model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>) and in humans with WNV-ND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lenka et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In support of the important role of the dysregulation of synapse biology with ensuing impairment of neurotransmission as the leading mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and neurological presentations of WNV-ND in primate hosts (NHPs and humans), we also provide evidence of strict transcriptional regulation of the cell death processes in neurons. In fact, it appears that at the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND, the magnitude of regulation of cell death processes in neurons does not exceed that in lymphocytes, suggesting that neurons are not a major cell type targeted by increased transcriptional regulation of cell death processes. Instead, it appears that the major cell types with increased regulation of cell death processes were lymphocytes (T and B cells that are expected to infiltrate the CNS parenchyma as a part of the adaptive immune response to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maximova and Pletnev, 2018</xref>]). Thus, a closer examination of transcriptional regulation of cell death appears to support the lack of extensive activation of cell death pathways in neurons, especially when compared to other cell types in WNV-infected CNS (i.e., infiltrating T and B cells). In addition, a CNS-region-specific activation of the programmed cell death in infiltrated lymphocytes suggests the initiation of the resolution phase of the acute cellular inflammatory responses in WNV-infected CNS. This is consistent with our previously published results with the NHP model for other flavivirus infections of the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maximova et al., 2009</xref>), where we showed that the perivascular infiltrated lymphocytes rather than neurons were undergoing apoptosis.</p><p>Since WNV can spread trans-synaptically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>), changes in synaptic homeostasis identified in this study may indicate either a direct damaging impact of infection on neurotransmission or an attempt by the host to arrest virus dissemination and compensate for changes in function. More studies will be required to understand to what extent these synaptic changes represent pathological, protective, and/or compensatory mechanisms, as well as whether they are reversible. This may guide a selection of potential therapeutic targets. For instance, our data implicate a disturbance in transcriptional regulation of glutamatergic (excitatory) and GABA-ergic (inhibitory) synapses, suggesting an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the pathogenesis of WNV-ND. If confirmed, this excitatory-inhibitory imbalance could potentially be pharmacologically targeted with existing drugs as a symptomatic treatment (e.g., with medications increasing GABA-ergic neurotransmission, which are effective in symptomatic treatment of essential tremor, a disease affecting the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Louis, 2016</xref>], and in this respect, similar to WNV-ND).</p><p>Intriguingly, in our intracerebral NHP model of WNV-ND, transcriptional changes were detected earlier in the lumbar spinal cord, the CNS region most remote from the site of virus inoculation (thalamus), compared to the cerebellum. The changes in gene expression also became much stronger in the spinal cord, compared to the cerebellum, as infection progressed. At least three pathophysiological components should be considered to explain this phenomenon: (i) mode of the virus spread to the target neurons in the cerebellum (i.e., Purkinje cells) and spinal cord (i.e., spinal motor neurons) from the site of intracerebral inoculation (i.e., motor thalamus) by axonal transport (i.e., anterograde and/or retrograde); (ii) ability of the virus to establish productive replication in specific neuronal cell types (i.e., PCs and SMNs), and (iii) CNS-region specificity of host responses to infection. Our previous reconstruction of the directionality of trans-synaptic virus spread based on the neuroanatomical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>) suggested that the virus may have reached the Purkinje cells by 7 dpi only by using the retrograde axonal transport (i.e., motor thalamus → deep cerebellar nuclei → Purkinje cells), while to reach the spinal motor neurons, the virus may have used the anterograde axonal transport (i.e., motor thalamus → corticospinal motor neurons → spinal motor neurons). Therefore, one possibility is that the differences in the mode and speed of axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Black, 2016</xref>) used by the virus to spread to target structures played a role. However, the kinetics of viral replication in the cerebellum and lumbar spinal cord were very similar (1.8 ± 0.2 and &lt;1.7 log<sub>10</sub>PFU/g [at or below the limit of detection] at 3 dpi; 6.4 ± 0.3 and 5.6 ± 0.4 log<sub>10</sub>PFU/g at 7 dpi; and 6.9 ± 0.1 and 5.8 ± 0.2 log<sub>10</sub>PFU/g at 9 dpi, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that the virus had an equal opportunity to infect respective target neurons and to use their cellular machinery to establish productive replication. Indeed, by another measure of virus production, the amount of WNV-antigens was increasing in the Purkinje cells and spinal motor neurons at similar rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maximova et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the possibility that these neuronal types have a different ability to support virus replication seems unlikely. Therefore, a more likely explanation of the differences in magnitude and timing of transcriptional regulation of the immune-neural-synaptic axis in WNV-infected cerebellum and spinal cord is that the host responses to infection in these CNS structures are site-specific. CNS-site-specificity in immune responses to viral infections and in mechanisms of the non-cytolytic clearance of the virus from non-renewable neurons by T and B cells has long been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griffin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Binder and Griffin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2013</xref>). Further supporting this concept, we show different patterns of T and B cell infiltration in the cerebellum versus spinal cord, as well as a differential transcriptional regulation of apoptosis of these cells.</p><p>This study may have important translational implications associated with the use of NHPs that have a high level of genetic homology to humans, parallels in functioning of the immune system, similar to humans organization of neuroanatomical pathways and skilled motor behavior and hand dexterity, all of which are coupled with their outbred nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Messaoudi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lemon and Griffiths, 2005</xref>). However, as with any animal model of disease, some limitations need to be considered before translating the findings to humans. Our NHP model of WNV-ND, in which virus is introduced directly into the neural parenchyma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>), may seem artificial since in humans WNV invades the CNS and causes neurological disease following peripheral infection either through mosquito bites or after transfusion/transplantation of infected blood/organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sejvar, 2016</xref>). However, since viremia is a major neuropathogenic determinant of the flavivirus entry into the CNS (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maximova and Pletnev, 2018</xref>), virus invasion of the CNS most likely occurs when immune checkpoints controlling peripheral infection and ensuing viremia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Montgomery and Murray, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tobler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qian et al., 2015</xref>) have failed. Therefore, our intracerebral NHP model may recapitulate the pathogenesis of WNV infection in humans that takes place after virus invasion of the CNS had occurred, by bypassing the peripheral immune control mechanisms that would otherwise limit virus neuroinvasion in the vast majority of infected individuals. Indeed, less than 1% of infected people develop neuroinvasive disease after natural mosquito-borne or iatrogenic blood-borne exposure to WNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sejvar, 2016</xref>). Clearly, it is not feasible to recapitulate such exposure settings in the NHPs when 100 animals would be needed to potentially induce WNV-ND in only one animal. Nonetheless, we previously showed that the intracerebral NHP model of WNV-ND closely mimics WNV neuroinvasive disease in humans in respect to the (i) gradient in severity of affected CNS structures, (ii) neuropathology, and (iii) ensuing signs of neurological impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maximova et al., 2014</xref>), making this model indispensable for studies of disease neuropathogenesis and testing therapeutics and vaccine safety.</p><p>Besides an immunocompromised state, age-related alterations in immune responses are the most well-defined risk factors for increased susceptibility to severe WNV-ND (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Montgomery, 2017</xref>), but how changes associated with aging may influence regulation of the immune-neural-synaptic axis in elderly with WNV-ND warrants further investigation. Peripheral inoculation of immunodeficient or aged NHPs does not result in WNV-ND even with very high doses of WNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wertheimer et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, future studies may address the impact of WNV infection on the immune-neural-synaptic axis in older animals using the intracerebral route of infection.</p><p>The course of WNV-ND in our animals was abruptly interrupted at the height of neurological signs (9 dpi) due to humane animal care requirements. Therefore, there is no way to know if the disease would lead to a death or recovery, and how the phenotypic features uncovered in this study would change with time. The rapid course of WNV-ND in our NHP model is consistent with limited data showing that acute WNV encephalitis in NHPs leads to death or a moribund state that requires euthanasia 9–15 days after infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pogodina et al., 1983</xref>). However, a non-fatal encephalitis in NHPs, possibly associated with immunosuppression, can take a subacute course followed by virus persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pogodina et al., 1983</xref>). It is important to underscore that even during the acute course of WNV-ND in this study, several developmental processes such as response to wounding, gliogenesis, and extracellular matrix/tissue remodeling became transcriptionally upregulated. However, at the height of neurological signs (i.e., advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND) there was a downregulation rather than activation of neuronal developmental processes such as neuron development and axon guidance. Nevertheless, deeper analysis of the transcriptional regulation of established axon growth inhibitory or permissive molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) revealed a progressive trend which was more skewed to the axon growth permissive rather than inhibitory environment, suggesting that neuronal network repair programs may have been already initiated at the acute stage of neurological disease. Future studies should investigate correlates of recovery versus persistent neurological impairment as outcomes of WNV-ND. This may provide valuable insights and inform on how to harness potentially beneficial processes that lead to resolution of infection and neural repair.</p><p>In summary, our findings add a new dimension to understanding of regulation of the immune-neural-synaptic axis and how its homeostasis is altered during virus infection in primates. Induction of pleiotropic genes with distinct functions in each component of the immune-neural-synaptic axis suggests an unintended off-target negative impact of virus-induced immune responses on neurotransmission in the CNS. Since activation of expression of the pleiotropic genes reported here may be a part of conserved host immune responses to many viral infections, our data may serve as a resource in the search for new therapeutic approaches to restore homeostasis in interactions between the nervous and immune system at the time when virus has been cleared from the CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

disease in particular and perhaps that of other viral infections more broadly. The detailed analysis of gene expression changes at multiple time points after infection reveals a complex network of responses and will provide valuable information for other researchers pursuing additional modes of analysis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Virus infection disrupts the immune-neural-synaptic axis via induction of pleiotropic gene regulation of host responses&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alan Barrett (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.

WNV is the leading cause of arboviral neuroinvasive disease in the US with post-infectious neurologic sequelae including movement disorders and memory impairments. The authors performed intracerebral inoculation of a virulent strain of WNV and performed extensive analyses of WNV-induced alterations in gene expression on cerebellar and spinal cord tissues at 3, 7, and 9 days post-infection (dpi) compared with mock-infected animals. They also performed immunohistochemical studies examining astrocytes, microglia and T cells and neuronal infection, loss and synapse elimination.</p><p>The paper is very well-written, supports findings in murine models and human disease, which have shown that presynaptic termini are eliminated in the WNV-infected hippocampus. That these processes may occur in multiple CNS regions is clinically relevant and supports the need for translation of these findings into new targets that might address multiple neurologic symptoms and sequelae.</p><p>This is a largely descriptive study on the transcriptional response of two brain regions, the cerebellum and spinal cord, to i.c.v. infusion of West Nile virus. The strength of the study is the use of non-human primates, analysis at two time-points post infection and the importance of the topic in light of the current global viral pandemic. Analytics that focus on particular cellular components, thereby identifying genes associated with pre- and post-synaptic compartments as particularly strongly regulated targets, is another strength. The use of IHC to confirm predicted changes in protein levels under girding astrocytosis, microglia and T-cell reactivity and cell death is a further strength.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is important to remember that WNV only causes disease in NHPs when the virus is directly inoculated into the brain (as pointed out by the authors). This raises important questions about the contribution of putting a needle directly in the brain and how this affects gene regulation. Unfortunately, the authors do not tell us if the control animals also received a needle injection into the brain too (nor does Maximova et al., 2014, the original study). This is an important point to consider in terms of the validity of the data. It is interesting that changes were detected in the spinal cord before the cerebellum in virus infected animals plus no gene changes in the cerebellum at day 3pi supporting the possibility that the needle injection does not contribute to the data obtained. However, this needs to be formally addressed in the revision.</p><p>2) Related to the above, there is limited information as to how well the i.c.v. infusion of virus replicates WNV-ND in humans and this too should be more formally addressed. The Discussion provides a justification for the system being used. The reviewers note this is an artificial system. Humans get WN disease following a mosquito bite and the virus crosses the periphery into the brain. Humans do not get the virus infection by direct injection into the brain. I think this paragraph needs some revisions.</p><p>3) The manuscript would benefit from more cellular analyses to localize synaptic proteins within microglia or astrocytes within the CB and SC, and their relationship with clinical findings. Presumably the authors have existing tissue which could be further analyzed to address, at least in part, some of the following issues:</p><p>a) Figure 4. The authors show extensive astrocyte and microglial activation in both CNS regions of infected NHPs. Given the microglial nodules observed, can they also determine whether there was any observed neuronophagia in these tissues?</p><p>b) Figure 5. The loss of synaptophysin is very striking. Can the authors also look at post-synaptic markers to determine whether both sides of the synapse are affected? It would also be important to determine whether synaptic elements can be detected within microglia, as has been observed in murine models of WNV CNS infection.</p><p>c) Figure 6. The data demonstrating differential regulation of pre- and post-synaptic genes is very striking. As mRNAs for synaptic genes are localized in neurites, it would be important to determine whether the pre-synaptic termini are eliminated more efficiently and the post-synaptic termini spared.</p><p>d) Figure 7. As a follow-up, it would be important to examine locations of synapse elimination within both CNS regions and relate this to motor findings in the animals.</p><p>Also, given the role of IL-1 in neurotoxicity (shown in both in vitro and WNV models; 10.1038/nature21029 and 10.1038/s41590-017-0021-y), it would be interesting to determine cellular sources of this cytokine in the NHP model.</p><p>4) Figure 1. The authors mention that animals are euthanized when they develop severe neurologic symptoms. Please comment on whether the model would lead to universal death in NHPs if this were not performed. This is important because it is unclear whether patient survivors exhibit the same loss of neurons observed in those who succumb during acute CNS infection. Can the authors report on whether expression of the same genes is altered in both CNS regions during symptomatic stages of disease? Also, as many genes designated as “immune systems” function in the CNS during development and repair, it would be important to categorize them as “ׅneuroimmune systems”, which is consistent with increasing evidence of ancestral functions of neural genes as immune genes. It would also be helpful to highlight those known to function during development as they may be involved in repair.</p><p>5) Figure 2. This figure shows upregulated immune system genes and down-regulated nervous system genes. It would be important to look at both up and down in both systems for the two regions. It is interesting that the CB seems to lag behind the spinal cord with regard to innate immune responses such as activation of TLRs. Can the authors comment on the time-frame of appearance of symptoms in the animals? That is, do spinal cord deficits precede cerebellar deficits? It also appears that cytokine signaling is quite different between the two regions. Studies in mice suggest that the CB is far less targeted by WNV and has constitutive expression of many PRRs. Is this the case in NHPs?</p><p>6) Figure 3. The results of these analyses are consistent with published studies showing persistent activation of innate and adaptive immune responses after viral clearance. The more subtle changes in nervous system genes are also consistent with results suggesting that survivors of WNV may not have extensive neural cell damage but instead exhibit alterations in neuronal networks. Can the authors provide any additional analyses to evaluate this such as examining cell death pathways in neurons?</p><p>7) That the genes which are being regulated have multiple functions, i.e. are pleiotropic, does not seem particularly surprising. The authors argue this leads to unintended deleterious effects but the logical connection there is not clear, why could it not be the opposite? Actually providing a benefit?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62273.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is important to remember that WNV only causes disease in NHPs when the virus is directly inoculated into the brain (as pointed out by the authors).

However, we believe that the suggestion to address the outstanding issues listed below would require extensive analyses which should encompass methodologies that are more comprehensive that suggested by reviewers in order to get meaningful insights. Main focus of our current study was to reveal the transcriptional dysregulation of the CNS homeostasis and alterations in regulation of neural functions when the viral infection of neurons is introduced into the equation. Clearly, as we believe could be seen below from our responses, the investigation of the mechanisms of synaptic loss/elimination and identification of major cell players involved would be not a trivial task and is well beyond the scope of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) Figure 4. The authors show extensive astrocyte and microglial activation in both CNS regions of infected NHPs. Given the microglial nodules observed, can they also determine whether there was any observed neuronophagia in these tissues?</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, neuronophagia is an old and not very meaningful term since it can only describe the dying neurons surrounded by other cells, presumably phagocytic, in the routinely histologically stained (i.e., H&amp;E or Nissl) sections. We do not describe the microglial nodules (another somewhat outdated and misleading term, in our opinion) but went further in analyzing the topographical relation of the activated and phagocytic microglial cells to infected neurons and presented a detailed results in Figure 6B and Table 1, showing that at the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND, activated microglia migrated toward infected Purkinje and spinal motor neurons (neuron-centripetal migration) and assumed the perineuronal topology. However, a close apposition of the activated microglia to neurons does not necessarily mean that the sole action of these cells is to phagocytose the neurons and/or their synapses. In fact, ascribing such roles to microglia can be a case of guilt by association (5) until proven otherwise. We acknowledge that more studies are needed to decipher the roles of microglia in various viral infections of the CNS, but stress that the goal of current study was to find out whether the microglia were activated at the protein level (CD68 immunostaining) and whether their cell morphology, migration pattern, and topology corresponded to the functional states revealed by changes in gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 5. The loss of synaptophysin is very striking. Can the authors also look at post-synaptic markers to determine whether both sides of the synapse are affected?

The data demonstrating differential regulation of pre- and post-synaptic genes is very striking. As mRNAs for synaptic genes are localized in neurites, it would be important to determine whether the pre-synaptic termini are eliminated more efficiently and the post-synaptic termini spared.</p></disp-quote><p>We also found the pattern of loss of synaptophysin immunoreactivity in relation to the topography of WNV-infected neurons very striking. We elected to probe for the synaptophysin in order to validate our most striking finding showing that the synapse was the most transcriptionally dysregulated cellular compartment in neurons during acute symptomatic WNV infection (which may include either presynaptic axonal terminals originating from virus infected neurons or such terminals from uninflected neurons that innervate infected neurons, or both). Advantages of using this protein marker to confirm synaptic dysfunction at the gene expression level in this study were twofold: (i) synaptophysin is an integral component of synaptic vesicles and the most established protein marker used to assess the synaptic integrity; and (ii) synaptophysin is a pan-synaptic protein which is present in virtually all types of synapses (thus providing a full coverage of synaptic types present in two distinct neural networks studied (i.e., cerebellar circuitry which provides the control of movement and spinal motor neuron circuitry which constitutes a final path in the execution of movement). In addition, during the revision, we added the results of immunostaining for the choline acetyltransferase which, in addition to being an established protein marker for the spinal motor neurons, also provided a means to assess the integrity of one of the largest and numerous synaptic terminals innervating these neurons – cholinergic C-boutons. Together, the dramatic decrease of immunoreactivity for these proteins provide a strong support to the extensive transcriptional dysregulation of synaptic compartments revealed in this study.</p><p>However, given the enormous number of currently known synaptic proteins (1,112 according to the most comprehensive synaptic gene ontology database that we used in this study (6)), straining for any single presynaptic molecule (number of currently known presynaptic genes: 482) or postsynaptic molecule (number of currently known presynaptic genes: 592) would neither give a full picture of synaptic dysregulation, nor it would answer the question whether the pre- or postsynaptic compartments are preferentially eliminated or spared and by which mechanisms.</p><p>In our opinion, addressing the issue of presynaptic terminals and/or their postsynaptic partners loss or retention, as well as synaptic elimination by microglia (and/or astrocytes) by immunostaining for a single pre- or postsynaptic protein (e.g., in the hippocampus of mice infected with a modified WNV (7)) and conventional fluorescent microscopy does not provide a sufficient resolution to draw definitive conclusions. Not only the loss of a single protein expression from each synaptic compartment should not be judged as a loss of entire compartment (see our argument above for the enormous numbers of currently established proteins in each compartment), presence of microglia in close proximity to the synapses should not be judged as evidence of active stripping of synapses by microglial cells (5). Indeed, a high-resolution correlative light and electron microscopy have already challenged such conclusions (8)). Therefore, we believe the above issues should be better addressed by the highest resolution methods such as electron microscopy at the morphological level and a high throughput proteomics at a functional level. Notably, previously published attempts with using the electron microscopy (7) does not, in our opinion, provide a convincing evidence of synapse elimination by microglia, but rather show microglial cells and their processes only “adjacent” or “surrounding” the synapse, again, consistent with a case of a guilt by association (5).</p><p>On the other hand, presence of synaptic proteins within the microglia may reflect a secondary effort by these cells that acquired an activated phagocytosis phenotype (confirmed in this study by detecting upregulation of phagocytosis at gene expression level and high expression of phagocytosis protein CD68) to clean up already dysfunctional and detached synapses and thus should be more appropriately viewed as a consequence rather than a cause. In line with this, we identified a dysregulation of protein-protein interactions at synapse and downregulation of synapse adhesion molecules (neurexins and neuroligins) between pre- and post-synapse in this study (Figure 3 (nodes #8 and #10 in the “Neuronal system domain”); Tables 2 and 3), suggesting the detachment of the presynaptic terminals from their postsynaptic partners as possible mechanism of synaptic dysfunction and disruption of the neurotransmission. Whether the neurons orchestrate their own synapse elimination (9) by glial cells (i.e., microglia and astrocytes), infiltrated cytotoxic lymphocytes, or any combination of these cells in specific developmental or pathological conditions (7, 9-17), or such elimination represents a secondary clean up events after the presynaptic terminal were already detached from their postsynaptic partners, is an open question.</p><p>Clearly, addressing all these outstanding questions is beyond of the scope of our current manuscript, but we enthusiastically agree with reviewers’ comments that such insights are highly desired and should be a focus of the dedicated follow up studies. Adding to a complexity of such future research, the virus infection induced changes must be studied in the context of each specific neural circuitry since their synaptic type composition and respective functions will be unique.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Figure 7. As a follow-up, it would be important to examine locations of synapse elimination within both CNS regions and relate this to motor findings in the animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this will have to be deciphered in the future follow-up studies, but current staining patterns for the synaptophysin and choline acetyltransferase suggest the loss of synaptic connections that innervate specific neuronal types infected by WNV – Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex and spinal motor neurons in the gray matter of ventral horns of the spinal cord. We added the lists of putatively affected synapses innervating the Purkinje cells and spinal motor neurons in Table 1 and following text:</p><p>“Topography of the observed loss of the presynaptic compartments (Figure 7D; Figure 8A and C) and postsynaptic cellular targets (Figure 8B and D) in WNV-ND suggests that (i) putatively affected synapses in the cerebellar cortex may include synapses innervating Purkinje cells (e.g., climbing fiber-PC and parallel fiber-PC [glutamatergic, asymmetric, axo-dendritic, and excitatory] in the molecular layer, Basket cell-PC [GABA-ergic and inhibitory] in the molecular and PC layer, and stellate cell-PC [GABA-ergic and inhibitory] in the molecular layer; and (ii) putatively affected synapses in the spinal cord may include synapses innervating the spinal motor neurons (e.g., cholinergic C-boutons, glutamatergic synapses from descending tracts, and inhibitory synapses from local inhibitory neuron networks) (Table 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, given the role of IL-1 in neurotoxicity (shown in both in vitro and WNV models; 10.1038/nature21029 and 10.1038/s41590-017-0021-y), it would be interesting to determine cellular sources of this cytokine in the NHP model.</p></disp-quote><p>In this work, we did not cherry-pick the molecules to analyze.

To this end, we relied on the categorization of differentially expressed genes established by their respective immune or neural gene ontologies. To further clarify this, we added the following to conclusions in the Results section:</p><p>“Together, these results show that WNV infection induces progressive and CNS-structure-dependent gene expression changes that manifest in transcriptional upregulation of biological pathways ascribed to the immune system gene ontologies and downregulation of functions related to the neuronal system biological domain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be helpful to highlight those known to function during development as they may be involved in repair.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this suggestion, we performed additional study and added new results and discussion:</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Since the top largest enriched GO BP term for downregulated genes was “nervous system development“, we further dissected transcriptional regulation of the developmental and repair processes in the CNS that may be altered by WNV infection using the gProfiler (19). […] Taking into account the fold changes for these 22 axon growth genes, when (i) downregulation of permissive or upregulation of inhibitory molecules would indicate the inhibitory molecular environment for axonal regeneration, while (ii) downregulation of inhibitory or upregulation of permissive molecules would indicate the permissive environment, we found a progressive trend which was skewed to the axon growth permissive environment.”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“In addition, we show that WNV infection alters transcriptional regulation of developmental and repair processes in the CNS, which are associated with upregulation of the immune system development/wound healing and downregulation of the neuronal/axonal regenerative processes.

This figure shows upregulated immune system genes and down-regulated nervous system genes. It would be important to look at both up and down in both systems for the two regions.</p></disp-quote><p>Both upregulated and downregulated genes for the two CNS regions (i.e., cerebellum and spinal cord) at both the early- and advanced-symptomatic stages of WNV-ND were analyzed for enrichment using the Reactome Knowledgebase. Original Figure 2 presented only statistically significant enrichment for both the immune and neuronal systems. We clarified this by adding two sentences:</p><p>Sentence #1: “As expected based on the identification of the immune system as the top biological system significantly enriched for the upregulated genes (Figure 1G), Reactome pathways associated with this system showed significant enrichment only for upregulated genes (Figure 3C, D, G and H), but not for the downregulated genes (at both early-symptomatic and advanced-symptomatic stages of WNV-ND, and in both the cerebellum and spinal cord).”</p><p>Sentence #2: “As expected based on the identification of the neuronal system as the top biological system significantly enriched for the downregulated genes (Figure 1H), Reactome pathways associated with this system showed significant enrichment only for downregulated genes (Figure 3E, F, I and J), but not for upregulated genes (at both early-symptomatic and advanced-symptomatic stages of WNV-ND, and in both the cerebellum and spinal cord).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is interesting that the CB seems to lag behind the spinal cord with regard to innate immune responses such as activation of TLRs. Can the authors comment on the time-frame of appearance of symptoms in the animals? That is, do spinal cord deficits precede cerebellar deficits?</p></disp-quote><p>The clinical time course in rhesus monkeys after bilateral intrathalamic inoculation of 5 log PFU of the wild type WNV was very rapid, with (i) onset of the clumsiness and lethargy on day 4 postinoculation, (ii) shaky movements, incoordination, and limb weakness on day 6 postinoculation; and (iii) worsening of the above neurological signs leading to a moribund state by day 9-10 postinoculation (1). Given such a rapid development of neurological deficits, constrains of the level-3 biological containment, and the fact that it is unpractical to administer a comprehensive neurological exam to rhesus monkeys to test for specific cerebellar and spinal cord deficits, we cannot judge whether the deficits associated with the cerebellar or spinal neural networks preceded one another. The observed neurological signs such clumsiness, shaky movements, incoordination, and limb weakness can be attributed to the deficits in the cerebellar and/or spinal functions. Interestingly, we previously showed that WNV spread from the thalamus (site of inoculation) occurs most probably transsynaptically by both anterograde and retrograde axonal transport (20). Both the cerebellar neurons (specifically, Purkinje cells) and spinal motor neurons represent the second order of neurons reached by WNV (can be seen in Figure 8A in reference (20)). However, virus spread to the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum could occur only by the retrograde axonal transport, while virus most likely used the anterograde axonal transport to spread to the spinal cord motor neurons. Adding to a complexity, the speed of these modes of axonal transport and the length of neuroanatomical pathways used by the virus to reach the cerebellum and spinal cord (especially the lumbar region studied here) should be considered. Nevertheless, the kinetics of viral replication in the cerebellum and lumbar spinal cord was similar and virus titers reached were among the highest compared to all other CNS regions studied (can be seen in Figure 2 in reference (1)). Thus, the cerebellar lagging behind the spinal cord cannot be simply explained and awaits further elucidation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It also appears that cytokine signaling is quite different between the two regions. Studies in mice suggest that the CB is far less targeted by WNV and has constitutive expression of many PRRs. Is this the case in NHPs?</p></disp-quote><p>The “Cytokine signaling in Immune System” node (node #3 in Figure 3) became progressively significantly enriched (that is, more specific pathway levels became significantly enriched) over time course of symptomatic WNV-ND in both the cerebellum and spinal cord. This was also the true for the ”child” nodes including the “Interferon Signaling” (node #4 in Figure 3) and “Signaling by Interleukins” (node #5 in Figure 3). Pathways in the “Interferon Signaling” nodes (including the “Antiviral mechanism by IFN-stimulated genes”, “Interferon alpha/beta signaling”, and “Interferon gamma signaling”) were also enriched in both cerebellum and spinal cord during symptomatic WNV-ND. Slightly less enrichment in specific interleukin family pathways in the cerebellum most likely does not constitute a crucial difference in the cytokine signaling between these two CNS regions.</p><p>Since no specifics provided in referring to the studies in mice that suggest that the cerebellum is less targeted by WNV in mouse models, it is difficult to comment on that. However, we aware that the granule cell neurons in the cerebellum (not the Purkinje cells, which are targeted by WNV and efficiently support its replication) have been studied ex vivo and in vivo in mice and shown to have unique innate immune signatures (high expression and epigenetic regulation of the interferon-stimulated genes), that correlated with enhanced antiviral response in this type of the cerebellar neurons and rendered them less permissive to infection (21). This underscores the fact that the cerebellum is not “far less targeted by WNV”, and that the Purkinje cells but not granule cell neurons are major targets of WNV in the cerebellum in NHPs (20) and humans (22) and that Purkinje cells but not granule cell neurons are responsible for very high virus loads in the cerebellum of NHPs (1, 20).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3. The results of these analyses are consistent with published studies showing persistent activation of innate and adaptive immune responses after viral clearance. The more subtle changes in nervous system genes are also consistent with results suggesting that survivors of WNV may not have extensive neural cell damage but instead exhibit alterations in neuronal networks. Can the authors provide any additional analyses to evaluate this such as examining cell death pathways in neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional analyses to examine transcriptional regulation of the cell death in the cerebellum and spinal cord during the advanced-symptomatic stage of WNV-ND with a particular focus on neurons.</p><p>The results are described in the new section: “Cell death processes in WNV-ND are regulated bi-directionally and magnitude of neuron cell death regulation does not exceed that of lymphocytes”.</p><p>In summary, these results demonstrated that “activation of transcriptional regulation of the cell death in WNV-ND is (i) bi-directional (i.e., concurrently positive and negative), (ii) region-specific (i.e., skewed to a positive regulation in the cerebellum but negative regulation in the spinal cord), (iii) cell-type-specific (i.e., major cell types with increased regulation of the cell death processes were neurons and lymphocytes). […] Strikingly, regulation of the apoptotic processes in lymphocytes was a region-specific, with increased regulation of T-cell apoptosis in the cerebellum but not in the spinal cord and vice versa – increased regulation of B-cell apoptosis in the spinal cord but not in the cerebellum, suggesting differential lymphocytic responses to WNV infection in these two CNS regions.”</p><p>Thus, a closer examination of transcriptional regulation of the cell death appear to support the reviewers’ view in regards to a lack of extensive activation of cell death pathways in neurons, especially when compared to other cell types in WNV-infected CNS (i.e., infiltrating T and B cells). In addition, a CNS-region-specific activation of the programmed cell death in infiltrated lymphocytes would suggest the initiation of the resolution phase of the acute cellular inflammatory responses in WNV-infected CNS. This is consistent with our previously published results with NHP model of other flavivirus infections of the CNS (23), where we showed that the perivascular infiltrated lymphocytes rather than neurons were undergoing apoptosis.</p><p>Discussions of the above findings were added to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) That the genes which are being regulated have multiple functions, i.e. are pleiotropic, does not seem particularly surprising.

Actually providing a benefit?</p></disp-quote><p>If the concept of pleiotropy does not seem particularly surprising, the concept of an unintended detrimental effect of induction of the pleiotropic genes that regulate immune/defense responses to virus infection but also have distinct functions in neurons, their synapses, and neurotransmission, should be clear. We argue that WNV infection of the CNS disrupts normal homeostasis of the immune-neural-synaptic axis via induction of pleiotropic gene regulation of host responses with possible off-target effects of virus-induced host immune responses on neural functions and neurotransmission. We believe that our Discussion provides a sufficient logical explanation of these concepts.</p><p>“CNS neurons are terminally differentiated cells and cannot be replenished, thus virus infection of neurons present a challenge for both the nervous and immune system to coordinate virus clearance while protecting neurons and preserving neural function. […] Remarkably, some pleiotropic proteins, such as proinflammatory cytokines and proteins in the complement system and major histocompatibility complex are essential for the establishment, organization, function, and removal of synapses between neurons (24).”</p><p>“We propose a scenario in which changes in expression of pleiotropic genes that are intended to activate and maintain immune responses to virus infection would have unintended and potentially devastating off-target effects on neuron-to-neuron synapses and chemical neurotransmission”.</p><p>“Since WNV can spread transsynaptically (20), changes in synaptic homeostasis identified in this study may indicate either a direct damaging impact of infection on neurotransmission or an attempt by the host to arrest virus dissemination and compensate for changes in function. More studies will be required to understand to what extent these synaptic changes represent pathological, protective, and/or compensatory mechanisms, as well as whether they are reversible”.</p><p>“In summary, our findings add a new dimension to understanding of regulation of the immune-neural-synaptic axis and how its homeostasis is altered during virus infection in primates. […] Since activation of expression of the pleiotropic genes reported here may be a part of conserved host immune responses to many viral infections, our data may serve as a resource in the search for new therapeutic approaches to restore homeostasis in interactions between the nervous and immune system at the time when virus has been cleared from the CNS”.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Maximova OA, et al.
