Yet the CST has also been shown to modulate sensory signals at their entry point in the spinal cord through primary afferent depolarization (PAD). By sequentially investigating different routes of corticofugal pathways through electrophysiological recordings and an intersectional viral strategy, we here demonstrate that motor and sensory modulation commands in mice belong to segregated paths within the CST. Sensory modulation is executed exclusively by the CST via a population of lumbar interneurons located in the deep dorsal horn. In contrast, the cortex conveys the motor command via a relay in the upper spinal cord or supraspinal motor centers. At lumbar level, the main role of the CST is thus the modulation of sensory inputs, which is an essential component of the selective tuning of sensory feedback used to ensure well-coordinated and skilled movement.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>corticospinal</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor</kwd><kwd>primary afferent depolarization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Strasbourg Institute for Advance Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>USIAS fellow</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cordero-Erausquin</surname><given-names>Matilde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR- 13-JSV4-0003-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cordero-Erausquin</surname><given-names>Matilde</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR - 19-CE37-0007-03 MultiMod</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR - 19-CE16-0019-01 NetOnTime</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moreno-Lopez</surname><given-names>Yunuen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100012948</institution-id><institution>Ministère de l'Enseignement supérieur, de la Recherche et de l'Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bichara</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006510</institution-id><institution>Association pour la Recherche sur la Sclérose Latérale Amyotrophique et autres Maladies du Motoneurone</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bichara</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EURIDOL graduate school</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-EURE-0022</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bichara</surname><given-names>Charlotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While the corticospinal tract is often considered exclusively as a motor path, a combination of intersectional viral strategy and in vivo electrophysiology reveals that, in the mouse lumbar cord, its main role is the modulation of sensory inputs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Several brain and spinal structures have been involved in the generation and control of movement in a task-dependent manner. The primary motor cortex is classically associated to forelimb skilled movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Starkey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Galiñanes et al., 2018</xref>) and to complex locomotor tasks (obstacles crossing, leaning scale or beam, etc.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beloozerova and Sirota, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiGiovanna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bieler et al., 2018</xref>) while its role in rythmic locomotion appears, if anything, minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beloozerova and Sirota, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiGiovanna et al., 2016</xref>). A coordinated movement relies not only on a proper motor command, but also on the online analysis of an ongoing multisensory feedback indicating whether the movement has reached the planned objective or requires correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fink et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Azim and Seki, 2019</xref>). To optimize the analysis of the overwhelming quantity of reafferent information, specific tuning of peripheral feedback is possible through inhibition of sensory information at different stages of the sensory pathway, a phenomenon known as ‘sensory gating’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seki and Fetz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McComas, 2016</xref>).</p><p>At the spinal cord level, sensory gating can be mediated by presynaptic inhibition of sensory inputs through primary afferent depolarization (PAD), a powerful mechanism controlled both by supraspinal centers and by adjacent primary afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eccles et al., 1962</xref>). While multiple mechanisms have been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shreckengost et al., 2021</xref>), the most studied cause of PAD is presynaptic GABA-A-mediated depolarization. Primary afferents have indeed a high chloride content and respond to GABA by a depolarization that has been shown to reduce the amplitude of incoming action potentials and thus inhibit synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prescott and De Koninck, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doyon et al., 2011</xref>). PAD has been involved in the adjustment of reflex excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</xref>), and its absence results in a pathological context associated with spasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caron et al., 2020</xref>). Proprioceptive feedback is required for skilled locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akay et al., 2014</xref>), and presynaptic inhibition of sensory feedback is essential for performing smooth forelimb skilled movements in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fink et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, PAD can also be evoked by stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex in primates, cat, and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Andersen et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carpenter et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Andersen et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelmoumène et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eguibar et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wall and Lidierth, 1997</xref>). This cortically evoked PAD may underlie cortical sensory gating at the spinal level and contribute to the cortical involvement in voluntary movements, in addition to the classical drive of motoneurons. In this study, we aimed at elucidating the neuronal pathways conveying the cortical motor command and sensory control to the hindlimb in mice. This cortical control of the spinal cord, either to trigger motoneurons or to modulate sensory information, can rely on multiple pathways, the corticospinal tract (CST) being the most direct one. Its involvement in motor control is long acknowledged, although its precise contribution might vary depending on the motor task (locomotion vs. skilled movement) or targeted limb (forelimb vs. hindlimb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karadimas et al., 2020</xref>). The CST has also been involved in cortically evoked PAD in cats as a pyramidotomy abolishes it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rudomin et al., 1986</xref>). However, discriminating sensory vs. motor contribution has been hampered by the lack of proper tools to segregate functionally or anatomically overlapping paths.</p><p>Importantly, none of the CST functions can rely exclusively on direct CST contacts onto motoneurons (MN) as these represent the exception rather than the rule. Indeed, monosynaptic CST-MN contacts are present only in some higher primates, while CST-interneuronal connections are preponderant (in adults) across species (rodents and primates) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alstermark et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ebbesen and Brecht, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>). In the recent years, specific genetic factors have enabled the identification of several interneuronal populations, and of their inputs, including those from the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hantman and Jessell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bourane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abraira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>). But neurons with identical genetic markers do not necessary share identical function: in these genetically distinct populations, up to 65% of the neurons receive CST inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ueno et al., 2018</xref>), while there is a significant fraction of neurons that is not targeted by the CST. Although manipulating these populations has been extremely informative to better understand their role, it remains unclear whether the changes observed upon these manipulations can be specifically attributed to the neuronal subset that receives inputs from the CST or to the subset that does not. Therefore, it is still difficult to assess the specific role of the targets of the CST in movements.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the corticofugal paths conveying motor command and modulation of sensory inputs through PAD. We have in particular interrogated the contribution of the CST and its direct lumbar targets through the development of an innovative intersectional viral strategy. We show that cortically evoked PAD in lumbar primary afferents is conveyed exclusively by the CST through a population of lumbar interneurons. In contrast, our results suggest that motor command to the hindlimbs is relayed either through supraspinal motor centers, or through the CST with a propriospinal relay in the upper cord. The role of the lumbar CST thus appears to be mainly the modulation of sensory inputs, which may in turn selectively regulate sensory gain involved in the refinement of motor control during movement.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PAD and muscular contractions originate in the same cortical area</title><p>The rodent sensorimotor cortex has a highly somatotopic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ayling et al., 2009</xref>). Mainly studied in a motor perspective, it has been repeatedly mapped for its ability to provoke motor contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li and Waters, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ayling et al., 2009</xref>), but rarely for its ability to induce PAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wall and Lidierth, 1997</xref>). Cortically evoked PAD may inhibit the transmission of sensory information from primary afferents to the central nervous system and can be experimentally assessed by recording dorsal root potentials (DRPs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We thus recorded DRPs in vivo in lumbar roots L4–L6 (conveying hindlimb sensory inputs) of Thy1-ChR2 mice, expressing channelrhodopsin2 in most neuronal cells including layer V cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arenkiel et al., 2007</xref>). DRP recordings were performed in isoflurane-anesthetized mice, and trains of photostimulations (5 × 8 ms pulses, 1 ms apart) were applied to activate ChR2 at different positions of the surface of the sensorimotor cortex according to a 500-µm-spaced grid. The area inducing the DRPs was centered at AP = −0.75 mm, L = 1.5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, n = 7 mice). Similar photostimulation of this area in mice expressing only the fluorescent reporter EGFP in corticospinal (CS) neurons leads to no DRP signal (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). On a different group of animals, electromyographic (EMG) recordings were performed in the tibialis anterior (TA) under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia because EMGs cannot be evoked from cortical stimulation under isoflurane anesthesia (see Materials and methods). The sensorimotor cortex was similarly mapped with trains of photostimulations (6 × 1 ms pulses, 2 ms apart) and the area inducing EMG was centered at AP = −0.75 mm, L = 1.75 mm (n = 5 mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Again, similar photostimulation of this area in mice expressing only EGFP in CS neurons leads to no EMG signal (see below and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

DRPs can be segmentally evoked by the activation of a neighboring root, dampening sensory inputs predominantly through GABA-dependent primary-afferent depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</xref>). GABAergic terminals presynaptic to proprioceptive fibers arise from GAD65 interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Betley et al., 2009</xref>) and their activation produces DRPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fink et al., 2014</xref>). We investigated whether the CST directly targets GAD65-expressing spinal lumbar neurons that could in turn lead to inhibition of primary afferents. In TdTomato-flex mice crossed with GAD65-GFP mice, we injected a monosynaptic anterograde transynaptic virus (AAV2/1-CBA-WGA-Cre) encoding the Cre-recombinase fused to the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Libbrecht et al., 2017</xref>) in the area inducing hindlimb DRPs and EMG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast to its retrograde and anterograde transport when directly injected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">LeVay and Voigt, 1990</xref>), WGA is reported to provide an exclusively anterograde transneuronal tracing when expressed in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Braz et al., 2002</xref>) or virally, including in the form of a WGA-Cre fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gradinaru et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Libbrecht et al., 2017</xref>), but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu and Südhof, 2013</xref>. We indeed observed that the fusion with WGA provided transynaptic properties to the Cre recombinase, which was transferred to the cortex’s monosynaptic targets where it triggered the expression of TdTomato (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). While a retrograde transynaptic labeling is difficult to exclude in the brain due to the reciprocal connections of the cortex with its targets, the absence of direct spino-cortical projection (and absence of labeling in the ascending tracts, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>) ensures that spinal Td-Tomato-expressing neurons are direct targets of the CST. We evaluated the proportion of GAD65+ neurons among these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>): 16.4% ± 3.2% of spinal Td-Tomato-positive neurons were GAD65-GFP+ (69 neurons out of 427, n = 3 mice), suggesting that the cortically evoked DRP may be mediated directly by the activation of a GAD65+ spinal target of the CST. In the spinal dorsal horn, cholinergic neurons are a subpopulation of GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Todd, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mesnage et al., 2011</xref>), and cholinergic terminals are known to be presynaptic to primary afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ribeiro-da-Silva and Cuello, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pawlowski et al., 2013</xref>) and have recently been shown to modulate primary afferent inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hochman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shreckengost et al., 2021</xref>). By performing a similar experiment in ChAT-EGFP mice, we showed that only 2.2% ± 1.8% of CST targets were ChAT-EGFP positive (1 out of 45 neurons, n = 4 mice), limiting the likelihood of a direct major involvement of a cholinergic mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Segregation of pathways for cortically evoked DRPs and EMGs</title><p>Although lumbar DRPs and tibialis-EMGs are elicited by the same area in the mouse sensorimotor cortex, whether they share the same corticofugal pathway and spinal circuits remains unknown. We first interrogated the contribution of indirect cortical-to-spinal pathways to these two functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Since photostimulation of the sensorimotor cortex in Thy1-ChR2 activates a heterogeneous population of layer V cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arenkiel et al., 2007</xref>), we selectively lesioned the direct CST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) using an acute electrolytic lesion at the level of the pyramidal decussation (pyramidotomy) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). In this study, we have consistently performed a caudal pyramidotomy, sparing CST collaterals targeting brainstem motor nuclei that branch more rostrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akintunde and Buxton, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Alstermark and Pettersson, 2014</xref>) as well as rubrospinal or reticulospinal tracts that can be activated by corticorubral or corticoreticular neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Cortically evoked DRPs were completely abolished by this pyramidotomy (DRP amplitude before: 3.8 µV ± 0.32 µV; after: 0.30 µV ± 0.12 µV, n = 3 mice, p=0.006), whereas cortically evoked EMGs were hardly affected (S/N ratio 3.3 ± 0.61 before, 2.2 ± 0.1 after, n = 4 mice, p=0.517, all Z-scores above significance after lesion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). This demonstrates that indirect cortical-to-spinal pathways (involving supraspinal motor centers) do not encode cortically evoked DRPs but have a major role for cortically evoked motor contraction of the hindlimb.

This could have been underrated by simultaneous stimulation of the indirect cortical-to-spinal pathways in Thy1-ChR2 mice. We thus interrogated the specific contribution of the CST to motor contraction by targeting exclusively these neurons through injection of a ChR2-encoding retrograde virus (AAVrg-CAG-hChR2-H134R-tdTomato) in the lumbar spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As expected, the infected CS neurons were located in the area delimited by the previous functional mapping of hindlimb muscle contraction and DRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Photostimulation of CS neurons (at the cortical level) induced a robust EMG signal (S/N ratio 2.4 ± 0.52, n = 5 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, upper), demonstrating that CS neurons evoke motor contraction. In agreement with the pyramidotomy results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), the photostimulation of CS neurons also induced DRPs (mean amplitude = 14.5 ± 4.0µV, n = 5), while photostimulation in control mice expressing GFP in CS neurons induced neither an EMG (all Z-scores below significance) nor a DRP signal (mean amplitude = 0.3 ± 0.0 µV, n = 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because some CS neurons send collaterals to supraspinal regions involved in motor command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akintunde and Buxton, 1992</xref>), we next addressed whether the motor command traveled through the direct cortical-to-spinal branch of CS neurons or via supraspinal relays.

Indeed, many experiments demonstrated that these neurons are involved in segmental coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miller et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nathan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reed et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reed et al., 2009</xref>). In order to test the contribution of the lumbar branch of CS neurons and rule out antidromic stimulation of rostral collaterals, we combined the transynaptic tool used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> with an intersectional approach at the lumbar level. We first identified the lumbar segments containing CST targets by using cortical injection of AAV2/1-CBA-WGA-Cre in TdTomato-flex mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): CST targets were concentrated in spinal lumbar segments L2–L3, rostral to the large pools of motoneurons. They were largely located in the dorsal horn (85.4% were dorsal to the central canal), in particular in the contralateral deep dorsal horn (laminae IV to VII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistently with the monosynaptic nature of the transynaptic labeling, their number was not correlated with the delay between the infection and the histological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). CST targets were mostly located in the medial zone, lateral to the dorsal funiculus, where CST fibers penetrate the gray matter. We thus combined the cortical injection of AAV2/1-CBA-WGA-Cre with the spinal (L4) injection of an AAV (AAV9-Ef1a-DIO-ChETA-EYFP) encoding for a Cre-dependent form of ChETA (a ChR2 variant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gunaydin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). ChETA-EYFP expression was therefore restricted to the lumbar targets of the CST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Our transectional approach induced ChETA-EYFP expression even in the deepest targets of the CST in the ventral horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). There was no ChETA-EYFP labeling in the dorsal funiculus, demonstrating that the intraspinal AAV injection did not lead to retrograde infection of CS neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Intraspinal injections did not affect the general behavior of mice (e.g., no visible motor deficits nor pain-like behaviors) nor induced long-lasting weight loss. As surface photostimulation of the spinal cord in Thy1-ChR2 animals produced an EMG signal and directly activated neurons even in the deep dorsal horn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), we performed an identical photostimulation in the animals expressing ChETA in the targets of the CST. This stimulation induced a spinal LFP observable as deep as 1150 µm from the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although the number of ChETA-expressing neurons was highly variable (due to the variability inherent to the WGA-Cre transynaptic tool, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and to the intersectional strategy), spinal photostimulation induced DRPs in the ipsilateral lumbar root of eight out of nine mice (2.93 ± 0.48 µV, n = 8 mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>), demonstrating that DRPs can be directly controlled by the CST projecting to the lumbar cord through local interneurons. Interestingly, the amplitude of the DRPs was not related to the number of ChETA-expressing spinal neurons, suggesting that probably only a fraction of those are involved in primary afferent control. However, photostimulation of these same lumbar targets of the CST (same animals) failed to elicit hindlimb movements or muscle contraction as attested by EMG recordings (S/N ratio 1.0 ± 0.02; n = 7 mice, Z-scores below significance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>). Together with the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we can conclude that CS neurons are able to evoke motor contraction by activation of their spinal targets, but that these targets are not located in the lumbar cord but rather at another spinal level.

We found that the modulation of sensory inputs from the hindlimb (DRP in lumbar sensory roots) is exclusively carried out by the CST via a population of lumbar interneurons located in the deep dorsal horn. In contrast, the cortex induces muscle contraction of the hindlimb (TA) through a relay in the upper spinal cord or supraspinal motor centers. The two mechanisms are therefore segregated, and the main role of the lumbar CST appears to be the modulation of sensory inputs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Reliability of circuit investigations</title><p>We have identified the cortical area involved in these two mechanisms through functional means: cortically evoked DRPs and EMGs. For ethical and technical reasons, most of these recordings were performed on different animals and conditions. First, EMG recordings after cortical stimulation required a light anesthesia level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tennant et al., 2011</xref>), only possible using ketamine/xylazine. Such a light anesthesia is not ethically compatible with the large and invasive surgery required for recording cortically evoked DRPs. DRPs were thus recorded under isoflurane anesthesia under which no cortically evoked EMG could be recorded. We therefore acknowledged that the cortical zone responsible for DRPs, smaller than the one responsible for EMGs, might have been underestimated by the deeper anesthesia. We thus did not attempt to quantitatively compare EMG vs. DRP map extents, but concluded that they partially overlap allowing us to stimulate at the center of two maps. Although the different experimental approaches might also have differentially affected the recruitment threshold for EMG vs. DRP, we do not compare these thresholds in between stimulation/recording configurations. Rather, we analyze the amplitude of a given signal (EMG or DRP) with a given experimental approach in different animal models (THY1, ChR2-retro, pyramidotomy, transynaptically labeled CS targets).</p><p>Circuit investigation also relies on the efficiency of pyramidotomies that affect the spinal branch of CS tract while sparing CST collaterals targeting brainstem motor nuclei that are branching more rostrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akintunde and Buxton, 1992</xref>). We performed similar pyramidotomies in two different group of mice, either Thy1-ChR2 or ChR2-retro group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the latter group, in which the CST expressed ChR2, we observed a complete loss of cortically evoked EMGs after pyramidotomy. These results confirm that the pyramidotomy was efficient to block CST-induced EMG. Therefore, the remaining EMG signal after pyramidotomy in Thy1-ChR2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is likely the result of a non-CST pathway.</p><p>Finally, an intriguing result we report is the absence of EMG signal after photostimulating the targets of the CST at the lumbar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). The reliability of this result relies on multiple technical controls. First, the lack of muscle contraction cannot be attributed to damages of spinal microcircuits due to intraspinal AAV injection. None of the mice presented obvious alteration in the behavior nor a long-lasting weight loss. In addition, similar intraspinal injections were performed for the ChR2-retrograde group, and in these animals, EMG was systematically observed after cortical stimulation, demonstrating the integrity of required spinal circuits. Second, the intraspinal AAV injection efficiently infected neurons in the dorsal horn, and even in the dorsal part of the ventral horn, that is, in an area comprising 97% of the lumbar targets of the CST. Third, the optic fiber positioned at the surface of the cord evoked an intraspinal LFP as deep as 1150 µm in the double-infected mice, but also evoked EGMs in Thy1-ChR2 mice, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caggiano et al., 2016</xref>). We also demonstrate direct photoactivation of neurons located up to 700 µm from the surface with the short 1 ms stimulus used for EMG recordings. As 73% of the targets of the CST are located within 700 µm from the surface, this demonstrates that the large majority of this population can be directly activated by this procedure. Finally, using a similar surface photostimulation with powers equal to or lower than in the present study, Caggiano and colleagues were able to induce motor contraction in ChAT-ChR2 animals and interpreted this as direct activation of motoneurons located in the deep ventral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Caggiano et al., 2016</xref>). We thus consider very likely that the surface illumination we used could reach most of the lumbar CS-postsynaptic neurons, and that the absence of EMG in this situation is biologically relevant.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Anatomical definition of the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex</title><p>In our study, the cortical area inducing hindlimb contraction is similar to that previously reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li and Waters, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ayling et al., 2009</xref>). This cortical area (centered around 1 mm caudal and 1.5 mm lateral to Bregma) spans over the motor cortex and also partly over the primary somatosensory cortex according to some atlases and studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kirkcaldie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karadimas et al., 2020</xref>). We thus use the conservative term ‘hindlimb sensorimotor cortex.’ Interestingly, we found that stimulation of this area also induced PAD at the lumbar level. This overlap might be a specificity of the ‘hindlimb area’ of the cortex (HLA) and may not generalize to the ‘forelimb areas’ (RFA and CFA). Indeed, the CS neurons from the forelimb areas are spatially segregated (forming clusters projecting either to the dorsal or to the intermediate-ventral cervical cord), while those from the HLA are largely intermingled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Olivares-Moreno et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, our results demonstrate that the same cortical area is labeled after retrograde tracing from the lumbar cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) excluding the existence of a different pool of cortico-lumbar neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Pathways conveying the cortical motor command</title><p>Our study concludes that a large fraction of the cortical motor command to the hindlimb is conveyed through non-CST pathways. These could involve the reticular formation or the red nucleus that receive cortical innervation, project directly or indirectly onto spinal motoneurons, and control different parameters of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lavoie and Drew, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zelenin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Esposito et al., 2014</xref>). Our recordings also suggest that the cortex conveys a motor command to the hindlimb through the CST projecting to a non-lumbar spinal segment as direct stimulation of the CS lumbar targets failed to produce muscle contraction. We have discussed above possible technical caveats and concluded that our approach most likely induced activation of the vast majority of the lumbar CS targets labeled by the transynaptic tracing. We cannot rule out that some of these lumbar targets contribute to convey the cortical motor command to the hindlimb but were not labeled in large enough quantities through our transynaptic approach. The efficiency of WGA-Cre transynaptic tracing might be target specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Libbrecht et al., 2017</xref>), and the number of labeled neurons in the spinal cord suggests that not all targets were labeled. However, this would still implicate that these neurons are distinct from the ones involved in the generation of a DRP, and that these two functions use segregated lumbar pathways. While this hypothesis cannot be excluded, the recent report by Karadimas and collaborators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karadimas et al., 2020</xref>) strongly supports the hypothesis that the motor cortical command conveyed by the CST relays in rostral spinal segments. Indeed, they demonstrate that the cortical motor command to the hindlimb can be mediated by CS neurons projecting to the cervical cord, and then relayed by cervical-to-lumbar propriospinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karadimas et al., 2020</xref>). Although we selectively study CS projecting at least to the lumbar cord (through lumbar retrograde infection), many CS neurons have collaterals at different spinal segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kamiyama et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, their photostimulation at the sensorimotor cortex level would activate cervical pathways in addition to lumbar ones.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Pathways conveying the cortical sensory control</title><p>Beyond inducing hindlimb muscle contraction, we have characterized the ability of the cortex to induce DRPs, which is a measure of PAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wall and Lidierth, 1997</xref>). We demonstrate that it is exclusively relayed through the CST and provide some information on spinal interneurons potentially mediating this effect. The most studied mechanism of segmental PAD involves a presynaptic GABAergic last order neuron (mostly expressing GAD65; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Betley et al., 2009</xref>), located in laminae V–VI, under the control of a first-order excitatory interneuron that receives peripheral and descending (including cortical) inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eccles et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Betley et al., 2009</xref>). The targets of the CST identified by our transynaptic labeling are indeed predominantly located in laminae IV–VI and include a small population of GAD65-expressing neurons. They represent a potential substrate for cortically evoked DRP that would thus not require a spinal first-order excitatory interneuron.</p><p>In addition to the sensorimotor cortex, stimulation of other supraspinal nuclei is known to induce PAD. This is the case of the red nucleus and the reticular formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jiménez et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sirois et al., 2013</xref>), both of which also receive inputs from the sensorimotor cortex. The corticorubral and corticoreticular tracts were preserved by the pyramidotomy, yet the cortically induced PAD was completely lost. This strongly suggests that the ability of the red nucleus and reticular formation to induce PAD does not rely on a sensorimotor cortical command.</p><p>The control of incoming sensory information through PAD plays an important role in the generation of coordinated movements and processing of sensory information, including touch and nociceptive information {<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2018</xref>, #2735; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McComas, 2016</xref>, #2869}. GAD65-expressing neurons are essential for smoothed forelimb movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fink et al., 2014</xref>), but whether they require peripheral or cortical information to do so is yet unknown. Similarly, recordings in primates demonstrated that sensory information is inhibited in a modality- and phase-dependent manner during forelimb voluntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Seki and Fetz, 2012</xref>), suggesting that this inhibition is somehow related to the motor command, but the exact underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated. Importantly, the change in afferent fiber excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wall, 1958</xref>) accompanying the sensory presynaptic inhibition in primates was even smaller (&lt;2 µV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seki et al., 2003</xref>) than the DRPs we report as a consequence of cortical stimulation, suggesting that cortically evoked DRPs might be sufficient to significantly impact the transmission of sensory information. Here, we demonstrate that CS neurons from the same sensorimotor cortex area (but not necessarily a single population) are able to relay both motor command and sensory modulation to hindlimb, but through segregated pathways. Future studies on awake animals and/or focusing on specific sensory modalities are needed to further elucidate the timing and specificity of the sensory control we have described.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Significance of the results</title><p>In contrast with the present results on hindlimbs, specific stimulation of the CST at the cervical level induces forelimb contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a direct relay of the cortical motor command at this level (although antidromic activation of a collateral pathway cannot be excluded). Relative to the forelimb, mice do not display an extensive repertoire of skilled hindlimb movements and a difference in the level of cortical control is expected. The functional segregation we report here suggests that, while the sensory control is selectively targeted at the lumbar level, the hindlimb motor command is relayed in the upper cord. The fact that the upper cord (possibly the cervical cord according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karadimas et al., 2020</xref>), receiving the motor command from the forelimb sensorimotor cortex, also receives the information of hindlimb motor command offers a substrate for the coordinated control of fore- and hindlimb, which is essential for most, if not all, skilled movements.</p><p>The organization of the CST greatly differs between species. From an anatomical point of view, this tract travels mainly in the dorsal funiculus in rodents, while it is located in the dorsolateral funiculus in primates, and its projection area within the spinal cord accordingly differs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemon, 2008</xref>). The evolution of the CST has been linked to the development of the most dexterous movements that can be performed by primates, with the appearance of direct cortico-motoneuronal (CMN) contacts that are absent in rodents. From an evolutionary perspective, it is interesting to note that the lumbar branch of the CST, which will later acquire a direct motor command role (including with direct CMN contacts in primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Porter, 1985</xref>), instead has predominant projections in the rodent dorsal horn for preferential modulation of afferent pathways. Importantly, primate CS neurons do not only form CMN contacts but also abundantly project onto spinal interneurons, and the sensory control function of the CST we report has also been proposed in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lemon, 2019</xref>). While extrapolation of our results to primates is difficult in view of the large species differences, mice are the main and foremost animal model, including for pathologies affecting the CST such as spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A better understanding of the differential roles of the mouse CST in the cervical and lumbar cord is thus an essential endeavor to properly interpret data from these models.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, our results support a segregation of pathways involved in cortically evoked sensory modulation vs. motor control. The direct CST is able to induce motor contraction, independently of its supraspinal collaterals, through spinal targets possibly located at the cervico-thoracic level. However, we show that motor command is largely mediated by non-CST pathways, most likely cortico-rubral, or -reticular ones. On the other hand, the major and essential role of the lumbar rodent CST appears to be hindlimb sensory modulation at the primary afferent level through a population of lumbar target neurons whose activation is sufficient to produce DRPs. This forces reinterpretation of previous studies aiming at promoting CST function in a therapeutic perspective, in mouse injury or neurodegenerative models. While most of these studies have exclusively considered motor command aspects, our results provide a new perspective to analyze these efforts by considering the primary role of rodent lumbar CST, that is, sensory modulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal models</title><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the national and international laws for laboratory animal welfare and experimentation and was approved in advance by the Ethics Committee of Strasbourg (CREMEAS; CEEA35; agreement number/reference protocol: APAFIS#12982-2017122217349941v3).

The intensity of fluorescence was analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lorenzo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mesnage et al., 2011</xref>) on evenly spaced (250 µm apart) transverse brain sections imaged with a microscope (Axio Imager 2, Zeiss). Briefly, the ‘Plot Profile’ function of ImageJ software (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health) was used to measure the intensity of fluorescence along the horizontal axis of a 6000 × 250 µm rectangle containing the layer V of the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These values were normalized to the highest intensity for each animal and used to plot a density map of each injection site. The contour of the injection area was defined as 30% of the maximal intensity, corresponding to the approximate intensity of individual neurons.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Spatial distribution of CS postsynaptic neurons</title><p>Spinal lumbar sections (50 µm) were mounted serially and imaged using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope or a Leica SP5 II confocal microscope. Images were aligned manually with Photoshop using the central canal and the dorsal funiculus as landmarks. Each labeled neuron was assigned coordinates corresponding to its distance to the center of the central canal (X and Y) and the index of the slice containing it (Z). This was used to calculate the number of labeled neurons every 100 µm × 100 µm bins (X × Y) (or 200 µm × 200 µm X × Z) in order to build density plots. The neuronal distribution was plotted using the ‘spline 16’ interpolation method of the matplotlib library in a homemade Python script.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>No prior sample size calculation was performed. The mean and standard deviation of the noise were measured from the three noise values obtained from each EMG recording and used to calculate the Z-scores. The Z-score of each EMG response to the stimulation was calculated using the following equation:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Z</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mtext>Signal- mean Noise</mml:mtext><mml:mtext>standard deviation of Noise</mml:mtext></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>A Z-score of 1.96 or 3 corresponding to a significance level of 0.05 or 0.001 was chosen to discriminate significant responses from nonsignificant ones. The conservative choice of threshold was chosen in agreement with visual inspection of the traces to ensure that any EMG responses was not simply due to noise. For each tests, the normality and variance equality were verified by SigmaPlot (version 13, 2014 Systat Software, Inc) using Shapiro–Wilk and Brown–Forsythe’s methods, before we applied the parametric tests. All the data were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA and a post-hoc test was performed only if an effect showed statistical significance. The p-values for multiple comparison were measured using Holm–Sidak’s method. Error bars in all figures represent mean ± SEM, *p&lt;0.05, NS indicates no statistical significance (p≥0.05). The power of the tests was systematically attested to be above the desired power of 0.80.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>None</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>none</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was carried out in strict accordance with the national and international laws for laboratory animal welfare and experimentation and was approved in advance by the Ethics Committee of Strasbourg (CREMEAS; CEEA35; agreement number/reference protocol: APAFIS# 12982 - 2017122217349941 v3).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-65304-transrepform1-v1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All raw data for each figure have been made available on Zenodo.</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation id="dataset1" publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moreno-Lopez</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Bichara</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Delbecq</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Isope</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cordero-Erausquin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2021">2021</year><data-title>The corticospinal tract primarily modulates sensory inputs in the mouse lumbar cord (Raw data)</data-title><source>Zenodo</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5281/zenodo.5484040</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the support from the CNRS and Strasbourg University; University of Strasbourg Institute for Advanced Study (USIAS) and ANR-13-JSV4-0003-01 grants to MCE; ANR-15-CE37-0001-01 CeMod, ANR-19-CE37-0007-03 MultiMod, and ANR-19-CE16-0019-01 NetOnTime to PI.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Bennett (Reviewer #1); Klas Kullander (Reviewer #2); Shawn Hochman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Cordero-Erausquin investigates pathways for actions of the corticospinal tract involved in differentially regulating motor outputs and sensory inputs. It combines optogenetic stimulation within the sensorimotor cortex of specific corticospinal neurons based on the development of particular intersectional viral strategies with in vivo electrophysiology/ electromyography. They demonstrate that the modulation of sensory inputs from the limb and that of muscle contraction (motor output) are involving different corticospinal pathways. Thus, this paper argues in favor of reconsidering the functions of the corticospinal tract towards a possible additional prominent role in the modulation of sensory inputs. This study is of potential interest to scientists within the field of motor control interested in the organization of corticospinal modulation of sensory inputs.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Three reviewers and I have carefully read the manuscript and came together to the conclusion that while this paper addresses important questions regarding the potential role of the corticospinal tract in regulating motor outputs and sensory inputs through modulation of sensory transmission via primary afferent depolarization (PAD), it contains major flows that must be corrected before being able to judge the suitability for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The three following major concerns must be addressed:</p><p>1 – The size of PAD evoked by the opto-stimulation of cortical tract is abnormally small. This could be due to the extracellular recording approach (bad seal of the extracellular electrode), to only a few neurons being transynaptically labelled or to the fact that the CST has negligible effects on PAD (that would be problematic for the interpretations and conclusions reached). Thus the authors must provide data allowing to discriminate between these different hypotheses to also support the conclusion made by the authors. In addition, a positive control measurement of PAD evoked by dorsal root stimulation is lacking. Indeed it would be important to calibrate the PAD size to a known afferent input like dorsal root stimulation.</p><p>2 – Anatomical and functional controls must be provided for the different viral infections and CRE-lines used in the study, to make sure that the proper populations are targeted and that this offers the possibility of having a very selective stimulation. The authors must provide rigorous controls of the tracing and optogenetics experiments.</p><p>3 – Some experimental series are done using a different anesthesia protocol (ketamine vs isoflurane). It remains possible that this might change the results of the experiments and explain the lack of EMG stimulation. Therefore experiments should be replicated using the same anesthetical agent.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) The size of the PAD evoked by corticospinal (CS) activation is exceedingly small, 0.5 to 1 uV (not mV), and required 30 – 60 trace averages to see PAD above the noise. This could be because the CST has negligible effects on PAD (which I doubt), or it could be that the recording suction electrodes do not provide a good seal on the dorsal roots and thus much of the signal is lost to extracellular leak currents in the root. This seal can be improved with grease or sucrose, though this is not necessary here (Stys et al. 1993; Huxley and Stampfli, 1951). Instead, at a minimum, it is imperative to compare the authors' CS evoked PAD to classical dorsal root evoked PAD. If they are similar in size then the authors enthusiasm about the CST controlling PAD holds.</p><p>2) The Thy-cre animal labels many cell in addition to lamina V CST neurons, and the authors should state this limitation when they introduce the model. This limitation is overcome by the very nice duel virus labelling ChETA insertion model (line 164), since in this case only the CST is labelled. However, the authors only test whether in this model light evokes EMG. It is critical that the authors also show us the light evoked PAD in this ChETA CST model. This will provide direct evidence for CST evoked PAD.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Moreno-Lopez et al., investigated the contribution of the corticospinal tract in motor control and the spinal cord sensory gating. Using tracing tools and in vivo electrophysiology recordings, they mapped the cortical regions responsible for hindlimb muscle contractions and lumbar dorsal root potentials and showed that they are overlapping. They found that the branch of corticospinal tract targeting lumbar interneurons in the spinal cord is involved in mediating dorsal root potentials and by consequence plays a role in the regulation of sensory inputs. On the other hand, the corticospinal tract performs its function in hindlimb motor control via a relay in neurons of the upper spinal cord which then project to the lumbar spinal cord. The data of this manuscript are of great interest to go further in the understanding of the roles that play the corticospinal tract however the lack of rigorous controls of the tracing and optogenetics experiments impede the data to fully support the claims of the authors.</p><p>1 – The external stimulation of layer V pyramidal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex in Thy::ChR2 mice seems to elicit both DRPs and EMGs (Figure 1A and B). However, this experiment lacks essential controls to show that the DRP and muscle contraction are not just triggered by the photostimulation of the brain but is really due to the activation of the layer V pyramidal neurons.</p><p>The exact same recordings while illuminating the cortex in mice that are not expressing Chr2 is recommended.</p><p>It should also be stated on line 80, results, that these mice express ChR2 in other ares of the cortex and brain as well according to Arenkiel et al.</p><p>2 – Several statements in this publication rely on the use of the AAV-WGA-CRE tracing from the cortex to the spinal cord. The authors claim that this tracing is anterograde and monosynaptic. However, several publications report that WGA can be bidirectionally transported and can be transmitted polysynaptically (e.g. Levy et al. 2015 Neural Tracing Methods: Tracing Neurons and Their Connections). It seems that the direction of transportation of WGA and its ability to be transsynaptically transmitted depends on the neuronal network. Moreover, they use an AAV2/1 virus and the AAV1 serotype can also be transported in the neurons both anterogradely or retrogradely. Thus, it would be essential to show that the spinal cord traced cells result from the anterograde monosynaptic transmission of the WGA-Cre virus. This is also true for the experiments with ChAT::GFP, in what direction (anterograde, retrograde) do the authors envisage the tracing to take place? An inset in figure supplement 3 would be good to explain this better.</p><p>Recommendation: This could be performed using an IHC with an antibody targeting WGA in the spinal cord to prove that the Tomato cells express WGA. If there is any retrograde transport of the WGA-Cre, it might be possible to observe some staining in the afferent tracts in the spinal cord. I would suggest to add a representative picture of the whole spinal cord at the level of the traced neurons in addition to the crop picture in Fig1E. Perhaps a picture of a transverse or sagittal section from the midbrain and/or the brainstem where motor and sensory tracts are well distinct could also confirm that there is no staining in the sensory ascending tracts.</p><p>3 – There is a large disparity in the number of td-tom cells that were counted in GAD65::GFP and ChaT::GFP (427 neurons in GAD65::GFP from 3 mice and 45 in ChaT::gfp from 4 mice). Why such a disparity? Were there less cells in the ChaT::GFP tracing or did the authors just count less spinal cord sections?</p><p>It would be interesting to know the average number of Tomato neurons traced in the spinal cord and if this number is consistent between animals.</p><p>4 – The conclusion from Figure1 is that most of the spinal cord neurons targeted by CST are excitatory. Direct evidence that most of these neurons are really glutamatergic would reinforce the data. One possibility would be to perform in situ hybridization with a Vglut2 probe.</p><p>5 – There is a large difference in the intensity of the DRPs between Figure 1 (between 20 and 30uV) and Figure 2 (3.8uV). Why?</p><p>6 – The optogenetic stimulation performed in Figure 3 lacks a similar control as the one performed in Figure 1.</p><p>7 – In Figure 4. the spinal cord optogenetic experiments lack controls to check that the light by itself does not affect the recordings.</p><p>The neurons targeted by the optogenetic stimulation are located deep in the dorsal horn. Few in vivo spinal cord optogenetic stimulation experiments have been published so far. Thus, little evidence of the reliability of such experiments is available and a control showing that these neurons are indeed activated by the light stimulation would strengthen the data.</p><p>WGA-Cre was injected in the brain and is by consequence expressed as well in the corticospinal tract. Is there any ChETA-eYFP expression in the CST?</p><p>How many spinal cord neurons were ChETA-eYFP positive?</p><p>For this particular experiment, the authors had to switch between ketamine and isoflurane anesthesia. Could the lack of EMG stimulation be a consequence of this different anesthesia protocol?</p><p>Recommendation: To reproduce the spinal cord optogenetic stimulation experiment in animals that do not express Chr2 (ideally with a control virus injected). To check for the activation of the spinal cord neurons, for example, an immunohistochemistry against c-fos could be performed after light stimulation. Add a representative picture of the whole spinal cord to show that there is no expression of CHETA-eYFP in the corticospinal tract.</p><p>Further, to demonstrate that the particular anesthesia protocol used for this experiment is not the cause of the absence of muscle contraction, the same anesthesia protocol while performing the same optogenetic stimulation experiment shown in Figure 3 should be done (retro AAV-ChR2-mcherry in the spinal cord and light stimulation of the cortex).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study combines optogenetic recruitment of corticospinal tract neurons within mouse sensorimotor cortex, differentiated from other indirect corticofugal pathways via pyramidotomy, with various AAV-based transgene delivery approaches to compare and contrast corticospinal presumed GABAergic presynaptic inhibitory actions on unidentified hindlimb primary afferents in lumbar cord (measured as dorsal root potentials as an index of primary afferent depolarization) versus recruitment of tibialis anterior ankle flexor motor neurons (measured electromyographically).</p><p>The use of AAV cortical delivery of genetic construct generating WGA-Cre fusion protein in double transgenic Cre-dependent tdTomato/GAD65-GFP mice or in Cre-dependent tdTomato mice with additional intraspinal AAV Cre-dependent CHR2 variant (CHETA) delivery provided powerful molecular tools to demonstrate; (i) that corticospinal neurons projected to a small but significant fraction of GAD65 last-order inhibitory interneurons as well as many interposed putative excitatory interneurons involved in generating primary afferent depolarization (PAD), and (ii) that a distributed albeit small population of predominantly corticospinal tract (CST)-based transsynaptic optogenetically-labeled/recruited deep dorsal horn interneurons are capable of generating PAD.

It seems like experiments that record DRPs also recording EMG would be helpful to discriminate differences.</p><p>It may be helpful to undertake some simple experiments in Thy1::ChR2 mice to explore use of an anesthetic that permit simultaneous study of effects of cortical optogenetic stimulation on both sensory and motor systems in the same animal using identical photostimulation parameters, as well as for back-comparison to the different parameters used in the presently presented separate studies on corticospinal control of motor and sensory transmission. An anesthetic to consider is injectable long-lasting urethane anesthesia (Maggi and Meli 1986: 10.1007/bf01952426) which is only allowed for non-survival surgery that has been used in many studies on PAD (e.g. Lidierth 2006 – J Physiology) and likely has robust EMG activity (e.g. Zhang, C., et al., (2018) DOI: 10.5213/inj.1835052.52). While veterinary approval of urethane use is discouraged due to carcinogenic potential, use of protective clothing should easily justify its use to vetrinary staff given it is a very reliable and effective anesthetic with strong scientific rationale.</p><p>Although I fully appreciate the difficulty of the experiments, more insight on organization could have been provided using limited additional electrophysiological approaches for characterization of (i) motor and (ii) sensory pathways. (i) EMG recordings are rather easy in terminal experimentation, so it would have been helpful to know whether the cortical stimulation site chosen to recruit distal limb musculature (the foot flexor tibialis anterior) had somatotopic selectivity by also recording from a knee and hip flexor muscle. This could be incorporated into the additional urethane experiments suggested above. (ii) Use of an additional dorsal root or peripheral nerve for electrical stimulation in condition-test paradigms with CST photostimulation could have verified the expectation that corticospinal modulation of PAD was on interneurons interposed in low threshold afferent pathways (as characterized in the cat by Rudomin and colleagues) or when C-fibers as shown by this group in rat in one of their earlier studies (Moreno-López, Y., et al., (2013).

The three following major concerns must be addressed:</p><p>1 – The size of PAD evoked by the opto-stimulation of cortical tract is abnormally small. This could be due to the extracellular recording approach (bad seal of the extracellular electrode), to only a few neurons being transynaptically labelled or to the fact that the CST has negligible effects on PAD (that would be problematic for the interpretations and conclusions reached). Thus the authors must provide data allowing to discriminate between these different hypotheses to also support the conclusion made by the authors. In addition, a positive control measurement of PAD evoked by dorsal root stimulation is lacking. Indeed it would be important to calibrate the PAD size to a known afferent input like dorsal root stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewers concerns about the size of the cortically-evoked dorsal root potentials (DRPs). We did some additional experiments presented below but we would like here to stress two important points. First, we are recording dorsal root potentials, not directly PAD. While PAD yields to deflections in the (low) mV range (recorded intra-axonally), DRPs are classically in the μV range, as observed originally in the Cat by Gossard and collaborators performing both these approaches (Wall, 1994). DRP recordings have rarely been performed in mice, and one of the few articles presenting them illustrate signals in the 100-150 μV range (Grunewald and Geis, 2014).</p><p>Second, as well noted by the reviewing editor above, the size of the DRP depends on the source eliciting it. The mouse study by Grunewald and Geis only presents segmentally-evoked DRPs. A seminal article by Wall and Lidierth (Wall and Lidierth, 1997) demonstrates that, in Rats, Cx-evoked DRPs are approximatively of 25μV amplitude, while segmental DRP are much larger, several hundreds of μV. Large segmental DRPs are also observed in the original publication by the same author (Wall, 1994).</p><p>We have now provided a direct measure of the size of the DRP evoked by the opto-stimulation of the cortical tract, independent of the transynaptic experiment. We have performed DRP recordings in mice where CS neurons are retrogradelly infected by a ChR2-encoding virus (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). We also present in this figure the individual DRP amplitudes for all the recordings performed in the study, i.e. in three different mouse models, means presented in Author response table 1.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse model</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Stimulation site</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">N</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Mean DRP ampl.</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Range DRP ampl.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thy1 mice</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">7.0 μV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.3 μV – 20.4 μV</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChR2 in CS targets</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Spinal Cord</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.9 μV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.9 μV – 5.0μV</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">ChR2 in CS neurons</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cortex</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">14.5 μV</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8.4 μV – 26.8 μV</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The DRPs amplitude recorded when the CS is exclusively stimulated is in the same range as the one recorded when the sensorimotor cortex is stimulated, and to similar study performed in Rats (Wall and Lidierth, 1997). It is indeed smaller when only the targets of the CS are stimulated in the spinal cord, as this approach is not expected to stimulate all of the targets of the CST. We did however try to perform segmental PAD recordings, but we were limited by our equipment that prevented the proper placement of the required electrodes in such a small available space in mice (in addition to the spinal clamps).</p><p>A last point we would like to mention is that a small deflection in the μV range does not mean that the physiological effect is negligible. Indeed, recordings in the monkey by Seki and collaborators has shown effective sensory presynaptic inhibition correlated with a modest (&lt;2μV) change in the amplitude of the antidromic response recorded in the afferent nerve (Seki et al., 2003). This is now included in the discussion (l. 345-349).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – Anatomical and functional controls must be provided for the different viral infections and CRE-lines used in the study, to make sure that the proper populations are targeted and that this offers the possibility of having a very selective stimulation. The authors must provide rigorous controls of the tracing and optogenetics experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the anatomical and functional controls presented in the original version of the manuscript were incomplete and we now provide additional ones in supplementary figures. These include :</p><p>– Lack of labelling in the spinal cord ascending tract or in the cerebellum deep nuclei after AAV WGA-Cre injection in the cortex, demonstrating that spinal TdTomato neurons have been labeled through transynaptic anterograde tracing (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>– Appropriate dorsal horn view to show that the CST does not target dorsal horn cholinergic interneurons (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3).</p><p>– DRP recordings after selective stimulation of CS neurons (after their retrograde infection by spinal injection of rAAV ChR2) (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Absence of EMG and DRP signal after cortical stimulation of GFP-expressing CS neurons (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Absence of correlation between the number of CS targets transynaptically labeled and the survival time or the cortical area infected (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>– Absence of labelling of the CST after the intersectional approach to induce ChETA expression in the lumbar CS targets (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>– Labeling of ventral horn neurons (corresponding to the deepest targets of the CS) with the intraspinal AAV ChETA-floxed injection (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>– Analysis of the light penetration after surface illumination of the dorsal horn: this photostimulation induced muscle contraction in Thy1::ChR2 animals, and directly activates neurons located as deep as 600 μm (single unit recordings) (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – Some experimental series are done using a different anesthesia protocol (ketamine vs isoflurane). It remains possible that this might change the results of the experiments and explain the lack of EMG stimulation. Therefore experiments should be replicated using the same anesthetical agent.</p></disp-quote><p>We aimed at performing the two types of recordings (EMG and DRP) with the same anesthetical agent, unfortunately we do not believe it is possible (see below) and, most importantly, we do not believe it biases the result of the present study nor explains the lack of EMG signal after spinal photostimulation.</p><p>We are thankful to the reviewers for their suggestions to try and identify unifying recording conditions. Unfortunately recording cortically-evoked EMGs requires even more stringent conditions than spinally evoked-ones. For example, we now show (Figure 4 —figure supplement 3) that surface stimulation of the spinal cord induces EMG signal in Thy1::ChR2 animals under isoflurane anesthesia, but this was never the case after cortical stimulation. Similarly, we were not able to obtain Cx-EMG under urethane anesthesia in preliminary experiments. Ketamine, anesthesia that was the only condition where we obtained Cx-EMG; but this anesthesia was too light to be compatible with the large laminectomy required for DRP recordings (procedure refused by our ethical committee).</p><p>Importantly, we do not compare responses thresholds nor the extent of the cortical area producing a response in between types of recordings (EMG vs. DRP). Throughout the manuscript, we base our conclusions on comparisons of a given signal (EMG or DRP), with a given experimental approach, in different animal models (THY1, ChR2-retro, pyramidotomy, transynaptically labeled CS targets). These conclusions are therefore not impacted by the differences in recording conditions between EMGs and DRPs.</p><p>However, we have now expanded the “reliability of circuit investigations” section to further discuss the consequences of obtaining results with different anesthesia (and stimulation conditions in general).</p><p>Lastly, concerning the lack of EMG signal after local stimulation of the CST targets, we now provide additional arguments to rule out experimental biases. As explained below in the individual responses, we have previously perform a similar switch of anesthesia without impact on EMG responses. We also provide anatomical and functional controls demonstrating that our intraspinal AAV injections can reach the deepest CS targets and that surface illumination of the cord also penetrates enough to activate them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) The size of the PAD evoked by corticospinal (CS) activation is exceedingly small, 0.5 to 1 uV (not mV), and required 30 – 60 trace averages to see PAD above the noise. This could be because the CST has negligible effects on PAD (which I doubt), or it could be that the recording suction electrodes do not provide a good seal on the dorsal roots and thus much of the signal is lost to extracellular leak currents in the root. This seal can be improved with grease or sucrose, though this is not necessary here (Stys et al. 1993; Huxley and Stampfli, 1951). Instead, at a minimum, it is imperative to compare the authors' CS evoked PAD to classical dorsal root evoked PAD. If they are similar in size then the authors enthusiasm about the CST controlling PAD holds.</p></disp-quote><p>This point was raised by the reviewing editor and our response is to be found in the first page of this document.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Thy-cre animal labels many cell in addition to lamina V CST neurons, and the authors should state this limitation when they introduce the model. This limitation is overcome by the very nice duel virus labelling ChETA insertion model (line 164), since in this case only the CST is labelled.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression in other cells is now stated when presenting this mouse line (l. 99-100). The limitations are indeed presented when introducing the retrograde virus model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the authors only test whether in this model light evokes EMG. It is critical that the authors also show us the light evoked PAD in this ChETA CST model. This will provide direct evidence for CST evoked PAD.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included DRP measurements after exclusive stimulation of CS neurons (from retrograde viral infection of a ChR2 encoding virus in the spinal cord). Stimulation of CS neurons indeed induced DRPs and this is now presented in supplementary Figure 3 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1 – The external stimulation of layer V pyramidal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex in Thy::ChR2 mice seems to elicit both DRPs and EMGs (Figure 1A and B). However, this experiment lacks essential controls to show that the DRP and muscle contraction are not just triggered by the photostimulation of the brain but is really due to the activation of the layer V pyramidal neurons.</p><p>The exact same recordings while illuminating the cortex in mice that are not expressing Chr2 is recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include in supplementary Figure 3—figure supplement 1 the recordings obtained from animals injected with an EGFP-encoding retro-AAV in the spinal cord, where photostimulation of the cortex leads to no DRP or EMG signal. This control is now mentioned in l. 104-105 and 171-173.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It should also be stated on line 80, results, that these mice express ChR2 in other ares of the cortex and brain as well according to Arenkiel et al.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – Several statements in this publication rely on the use of the AAV-WGA-CRE tracing from the cortex to the spinal cord. The authors claim that this tracing is anterograde and monosynaptic. However, several publications report that WGA can be bidirectionally transported and can be transmitted polysynaptically (e.g. Levy et al., 2015 Neural Tracing Methods: Tracing Neurons and Their Connections). It seems that the direction of transportation of WGA and its ability to be transsynaptically transmitted depends on the neuronal network.</p></disp-quote><p>The tracing properties of WGA seem to depend on the mode of injection/expression. When the lectin itself is injected, it can indeed travel in the retrograde direction (LeVay and Voigt, 1990). However the seminal studies using WGA-expressing transgenic mice already mention an exclusive anterograde transneuronal tracing (Braz et al., 2002). This was later confirmed by several other groups, including for the specific WGA-Cre fusion AAV construct (Gradinaru et al., 2010; Libbrecht et al., 2017). One puzzling exception is the study by Xu and Südhof (Xu and Sudhof, 2013) where WGA-Cre (encoded in AAV) is presented as a transynaptic retrograde tracer. In many cases, regions are reciprocally connected and it is difficult to conclude unequivocally on the direction of the transfer. In Suppl. Figure 4 of the Xu and Südhof paper, for example, they show axons of primarily infected neurons (N. Reuniens neurons) in the cortex, next to transynaptically labelled cortical neurons. One could interpret that the cortical neurons have been labelled through transynaptic anterograde passage of the WGA-Cre from the WGA-Cre expressing axons in their very close vicinity; yet the authors conclude that the cortical neurons received WGA-Cre by retrograde tracing of cortico-reuniens neurons.</p><p>Concerning our study, the important point is to be sure that spinal labeled neurons are indeed direct targets of the cortex. As suggested by the reviewer below, we can exclude a retrograde tracing because spinal ascending tracts are devoid of labelling (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2). In the same figure, we also illustrate deep cerebellar nuclei, that are, like the spinal cord, two synapses away in the retrograde direction, and that show no labelling.</p><p>More generally, in contrast with a transynaptic virus that can be amplified in the target neuron (and then cross another synapse), it is the WGA-Cre fusion protein that is transported transneuronally and thus is highly diluted. For another study, we have used an AAV encoding for the WGA-EGFP fusion protein: even with long survival times, the EGFP was never visible in the target neurons without immunohistochemical amplification, suggesting low concentration after transynaptic transfer. Using the WGA-Cre constructs (in TdTomato-floxed mice) ensures that the synaptic targets can be identified without further amplification. However we, and the above cited studies, see no evidence of multiple synapse crossing. Some elements of this response are now included in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, they use an AAV2/1 virus and the AAV1 serotype can also be transported in the neurons both anterogradely or retrogradely. Thus, it would be essential to show that the spinal cord traced cells result from the anterograde monosynaptic transmission of the WGA-Cre virus.</p></disp-quote><p>The WGA-Cre AAV1 virus is injected in the cortex. To explain the presence of Cre-expressing neurons in the spinal cord as the consequence of retrograde transport, we should hypothesize a retrograde transynaptic labeling, as there is no direct spino-cortical tract. As stated in the above response, we now include in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 several elements demonstrating that the spinal labeling does not result from transynaptic retrograde transport.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is also true for the experiments with ChAT::GFP, in what direction (anterograde, retrograde) do the authors envisage the tracing to take place? An inset in figure supplement 3 would be good to explain this better.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have now included an inset in the figure to illustrate the anterograde transynaptic labeling in ChAT::EGFP mice. The demonstration of anterograde transport is the same as above as it is the same tool.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation: This could be performed using an IHC with an antibody targeting WGA in the spinal cord to prove that the Tomato cells express WGA. If there is any retrograde transport of the WGA-Cre, it might be possible to observe some staining in the afferent tracts in the spinal cord. I would suggest to add a representative picture of the whole spinal cord at the level of the traced neurons in addition to the crop picture in Fig1E. Perhaps a picture of a transverse or sagittal section from the midbrain and/or the brainstem where motor and sensory tracts are well distinct could also confirm that there is no staining in the sensory ascending tracts.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for this suggestion that elegantly rules out retrograde labeling at the level of the spinal cord (which, again, does not project directly to the somatosensory cortex). We have now included a larger view of the spinal cord in Figure 1 —figure supplement 2, showing that labeling is restricted to the ventral part of the dorsal funiculus (where the dorsal corticospinal tract resides) and in the grey matter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – There is a large disparity in the number of td-tom cells that were counted in GAD65::GFP and ChaT::GFP (427 neurons in GAD65::GFP from 3 mice and 45 in ChaT::gfp from 4 mice).

Were there less cells in the ChaT::GFP tracing or did the authors just count less spinal cord sections?</p><p>It would be interesting to know the average number of Tomato neurons traced in the spinal cord and if this number is consistent between animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We did a systematic counting in all animals and numbers are now included in Figure 4 – Supplementary Figure 1. There was a large variation in the numbers of transynaptic labeled neurons that was not correlated to survival time post-injection, nor to the size of the infected cortical area (this is now detailed in the suppl. Figure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – The conclusion from Figure1 is that most of the spinal cord neurons targeted by CST are excitatory. Direct evidence that most of these neurons are really glutamatergic would reinforce the data. One possibility would be to perform in situ hybridization with a Vglut2 probe.</p></disp-quote><p>This conclusion required more literature support, as also pointed out by reviewer 1. Although we agree that a better characterization of the neurochemical nature of CS targets would be very interesting, the proposed in situ hybridization (on top of the transynaptic tracing) was beyond our present expertise. We thus took out this sentence as the important conclusion of this experiment is that some GAD65 neurons are directly targeted by the CST.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5 – There is a large difference in the intensity of the DRPs between Figure 1 (between 20 and 30uV) and Figure 2 (3.8uV).

We do not believe that this will bias our results as we do not compare thresholds in between stimulation/recording configurations, but rather analyze the amplitude of a given signal (EMG or DRP), with a given experimental approach, in different animal models (THY1, ChR2-retro, pyramidotomy, transynaptically labeled CS targets).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While use of different anesthetics may have been justifiably argued on ethical grounds, it unfortunately does not detract from the possibility that such differences may differentially alter neuronal recruitment, pathways and circuit excitability.</p><p>It may be helpful to undertake some simple experiments in Thy1::ChR2 mice to explore use of an anesthetic that permit simultaneous study of effects of cortical optogenetic stimulation on both sensory and motor systems in the same animal using identical photostimulation parameters, as well as for back-comparison to the different parameters used in the presently presented separate studies on corticospinal control of motor and sensory transmission. An anesthetic to consider is injectable long-lasting urethane anesthesia (Maggi and Meli 1986: 10.1007/bf01952426) which is only allowed for non-survival surgery that has been used in many studies on PAD (e.g. Lidierth 2006 – J Physiology) and likely has robust EMG activity (e.g. Zhang, C., et al., (2018) DOI: 10.5213/inj.1835052.52). While veterinary approval of urethane use is discouraged due to carcinogenic potential, use of protective clothing should easily justify its use to vetrinary staff given it is a very reliable and effective anesthetic with strong scientific rationale.</p></disp-quote><p>Obtaining an EMG response after cortical stimulation requires a specific and very light anesthesia. In the Zhang et al., paper, the EMGs obtained in urethane-anesthetized mice were not evoked by supraspinal stimulations. We have similarly obtained EMG signals after spinal stimulation (in THY1 animals) under light isoflurane stimulation (now illustrated in Figure 4 —figure supplement 3). However, we have unsuccessfully attempted to evoke EMG from cortical stimulation under urethane anesthesia in initial exploratory experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although I fully appreciate the difficulty of the experiments, more insight on organization could have been provided using limited additional electrophysiological approaches for characterization of (i) motor and (ii) sensory pathways. (i) EMG recordings are rather easy in terminal experimentation, so it would have been helpful to know whether the cortical stimulation site chosen to recruit distal limb musculature (the foot flexor tibialis anterior) had somatotopic selectivity by also recording from a knee and hip flexor muscle. This could be incorporated into the additional urethane experiments suggested above.</p></disp-quote><p>Although EMG recordings per se are not a difficult experimentation, obtaining a somatotopic map is very demanding because there is only a small window of time during which stimulations/recordings can be performed: the ketamine/xylazine anesthesia has to be light enough to enable movements, but without risking awakening of the animal. In practice, the experimenter had only a few seconds before an additional anesthesia dose was required, that just allowed to obtain the 3-4 replicates needed for a specific coordinate. Building the cortical map thus required multiple re-injection of anesthetics and we observed some tolerance that limited the duration of the experiment.</p><p>Our results perfectly coincided with studies published earlier by (Tennant et al., 2011). As they describe the full somatotopy of the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex, and because of the aforementioned difficulty in obtaining a map, we did not attempt to further reproduce these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Use of an additional dorsal root or peripheral nerve for electrical stimulation in condition-test paradigms with CST photostimulation could have verified the expectation that corticospinal modulation of PAD was on interneurons interposed in low threshold afferent pathways (as characterized in the cat by Rudomin and colleagues) or when C-fibers as shown by this group in rat in one of their earlier studies (Moreno-López, Y., et al., (2013). PLoS One 8(7): e69063).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that elucidating the type of sensory modality modulated by the CS tract would be an important advance in the field, however at this stage we consider this as an interesting follow-up project requiring the development of specific expertise and technical approaches for it to be addressed in mice. It is mentioned in the perspectives of our discussion (l. 353-355).</p><p>References</p><p>Braz JM, Rico B, Basbaum AI (2002) Transneuronal tracing of diverse CNS circuits by Cre-mediated induction of wheat germ agglutinin in transgenic mice.
