conditions. However, whether Treg cells hamper pain at steady state and by which mechanism is still unclear. From a meta-analysis of the transcriptomes of murine Treg and conventional T cells (Tconv), we observe that the proenkephalin gene (<italic>Penk</italic>), encoding the precursor of analgesic opioid peptides, ranks among the top 25 genes most enriched in Treg cells. We then present various evidence suggesting that <italic>Penk</italic> is regulated in part by members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor (TNFR) family and the transcription factor Basic leucine zipper transcription faatf-like (BATF). Using mice in which the promoter activity of <italic>Penk</italic> can be tracked with a fluorescent reporter, we also show that <italic>Penk</italic> expression is mostly detected in Treg and activated Tconv in non-inflammatory conditions in the colon and skin. Functionally, Treg cells proficient or deficient for <italic>Penk</italic> suppress equally well the proliferation of effector T cells in vitro and autoimmune colitis in vivo. In contrast, inducible ablation of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg leads to heat hyperalgesia in both male and female mice. Overall, our results indicate that Treg might play a key role at modulating basal somatic sensitivity in mice through the production of analgesic opioid peptides.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pain</kwd><kwd>enkephalins</kwd><kwd>skin</kwd><kwd>immunoregulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ligue nationale contre le cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marodon</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100019125</institution-id><institution>Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emergence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marodon</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>INSERM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marodon</surname><given-names>Gilles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulatory T cells produce analgesic opioid peptides that limit heat sensitivity in mice, revealing a novel pain regulation mechanism independent of inflammation control.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulatory T cells (Treg), characterized by the expression of the alpha chain of the interleukin-2 receptor CD25 and the transcription factor Foxp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hatzioannou et al., 2021</xref>), are known to be key players in immunoregulation in both humans and mice; too few may lead to autoimmune diseases whereas too many may prevent an efficient immune response to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nishikawa and Sakaguchi, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Over the last few years, several new functions of Treg beyond immunoregulation have been identified in tissue regeneration or local regulation of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xiao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meng et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shime et al., 2020</xref>) for instance.

As controls, we used mice expressing the Cre recombinase and WT at the locus of LoxP sequences insertion. Mice were treated with TMX and evaluated for heat sensitivity at 10 different time points (four before and six after administration of TMX, 2–3 days apart). Under these conditions, a significant trend toward lower latency periods (indicative of heat hyperalgesia) is observed in the LOX group compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the effect is not apparent until 7 days after TMX administration. Before TMX administration, WT and LOX mice do not differ in their response to heat. However, after TMX administration, LOX mice develop hyperalgesia compared to WT mice, with a 20% reduction in their median latency period from day 7 onwards (8.1 vs 6.6 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Because sensory neurons expressing CGRP are essential for noxious thermal heat, but not mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCoy et al., 2013</xref>), this result suggests that Treg producing enkephalins could act locally on nociception.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The proenkephalin gene <italic>Penk</italic> encodes the precursor of opioid peptides with analgesic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McLaughlin, 2013</xref>). Enriched expression of <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg has been previously reported in several specific contexts, including TCR-transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zelenika et al., 2002</xref>), UVB exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shime et al., 2020</xref>) or in the brains of mice recovering from stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ito et al., 2019</xref>). We first explore the possible molecular mechanisms that may explain the preferential expression of <italic>Penk</italic> observed in tissue Treg. Using data mining and gene correlation analysis, we observed that TNFR and Batf might be involved in <italic>Penk</italic> regulation. Batf is known to regulate several genes through partnering with AP-1 and Irf-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murphy et al., 2013</xref>), and we noted that several ChIP-Seq studies have reported the binding of these transcription factors in regulatory regions of <italic>Penk</italic>. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that TNFR signaling may regulate <italic>Penk</italic> expression in murine T cells through cooperation between Batf, AP-1 and/or Irf-4. Supporting this hypothesis, the AP-1 members Fos and Jun are crucial in <italic>Penk</italic> regulation in the murine hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sonnenberg et al., 1989</xref>). Additionally, analysis of Penk-Cre reporter mice led us to conclude that <italic>Penk</italic> mRNA is predominantly found in tissue Treg, further supporting the hypothesis that Batf might be a chief regulator of <italic>Penk</italic>. Although <italic>Penk</italic> might be preferentially expressed by activated T cells at steady state (Treg and Tconv), its distribution may be broader in an inflammatory context. Consistent with this, it has been reported that IL-4-treated macrophages are able to reduce neuropathic pain through their ability to produce opioid peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Celik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pannell et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A prior study attributed a function to UVB-exposed Treg-derived <italic>Penk</italic> in promoting the growth of epidermal keratinocytes in vitro and facilitating wound-healing in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shime et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, heightened heat sensitivity in the absence of Treg-derived <italic>Penk</italic> may result from altered keratinocyte homeostasis in vivo. However<italic>,</italic> the impact of Treg-derived <italic>Penk</italic> on keratinocyte homeostasis in vivo under normal conditions has yet to be conclusively demonstrated.</p><p>Additionally, a similar hypersensitivity to heat has been recently reported in mice lacking <italic>Penk</italic> in Treg following TMX treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mendoza et al., 2024</xref>) but not in another model of bone marrow chimeras, which allows the depletion of <italic>Penk</italic>-expressing Treg only in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), a crucial relay of nociception. Instead, an increased mechanical allodynia was observed in that model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Midavaine et al., 2024</xref>), a result that we did not observe. This discrepancy might be explained by the relatively low number of animals that we tested for mechanical allodynia. It is also possible that the deletion of Penk with TMX by oral gavage might have been less efficient in the DRG than in lymphoid organs.</p><p>Nevertheless, Treg-derived enkephalins might regulate pain at multiple sites, including the DRG and peripheral tissues, such as the skin or the colon. Related to the colon, Penk expression by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has been linked to analgesia in murine models of visceral pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basso et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boué et al., 2014</xref>). However, the specific involvement of Treg in this process has yet to be investigated.</p><p>Furthermore, the hypothesis that skin Treg directly modulates pain is supported by our observations that skin Treg (1) expressed the highest level of <italic>Penk</italic> and (2) are observed in contact with CGRP-expressing sensory neurons. Notably, <italic>Penk</italic>-expressing Tregs are closer to neurons in the skin than non-expressing Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mendoza et al., 2024</xref>).

Interestingly, IL-10 also possesses analgesic properties in murine models of cisplatin-induced neuropathic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Laumet et al., 2020</xref>). The observation that mice with IL-10-KO Tregs experienced similar pain levels to controls further indicates that IL-10 produced by Treg cannot compensate for the absence of <italic>Penk</italic>, highlighting the unique role of Treg-derived enkephalins on nociception.</p><p>Finally, our in vitro and in vivo experiments, along with results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Midavaine et al., 2024</xref>, show that Tregs maintains their suppressive capacities in the absence of <italic>Penk</italic>, ruling out the possibility that hyperalgesia stems from increased inflammation due to a defect in the immunosuppressive function of Treg.

Inguinal, brachial, and mesenteric LNs and spleens were directly mashed through a 70-µm filter and suspended in PBS 3% FCS. Lungs, colons, livers, visceral adipose tissue, and skin were dissected, minced then incubated in appropriate digestion buffers (Miltenyi Biotec, Paris, France) at 37°C for various duration according to manufacturer protocols. Cell suspensions were then passed through a 70-µm cell strainer and suspended in PBS 3% FCS. To eliminate dead cells and debris, liver cell suspensions were isolated on a 70:30 Percoll gradient. Rings were collected, washed, and cell pellets were suspended in PBS 3% FCS. ACK Lysing Buffer was used to eliminate red blood cells in the lungs, livers, and spleens (lysis performed for 1 min at room temperature [RT], followed by two washes with PBS), prior to staining for flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Antibodies and flow cytometry analysis</title><p>The mAb and fluorescent reagents used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Flow-FISH staining was performed using the PrimeFlow RNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher #88-18005-210) and the subsequent anti-mouse Penk probes set (Thermo Fisher #PF-204) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For flow cytometry staining, after Fc receptor saturation (anti-mouse CD16/32, clone 93, 1:50, Biolegend) and dead cells detection (Fixable Viability Dye, 1:1000, Thermo Fisher), cells were surface labeled for 30 min on ice with the following antibodies: CD8a-BV421 (Clone 53-6.7, 1:200, BD Biosciences #563898), CD44-BV605 (Clone IM7, 1:200, BD Biosciences #563058), CD3e-BV711 (Clone 145-2C11, 1:50, Biolegend #100349), CD4-PE-CF594 (Clone RM4-5, 1:800, BD Biosciences #562285), and CD62L-PE-Cy7 (Clone MEL-14, 1:300, BD Biosciences #560516). Intracellular staining with Foxp3-PE antibody (Clone NRRF-30, 1:100, Thermo Fisher #12-4771-82) was performed after fixation and permeabilization with the reagents provided in the kit. A second fixation was performed with the reagents provided in the kit before proceeding to the FISH staining. For FISH staining, cells were incubated with the anti-mouse Penk probes set (1:20) for 2 hr at 40°C. After washes, cells were kept overnight at 4°C in a wash buffer containing RNase inhibitors. The day after, amplification steps were performed to increase the signal: cells were first incubated with pre-amplification mix during 1.5 hr at 40°C, washed and then incubated with amplification mix for an additional 1.5 hr at 40°C. Cells were then incubated with the label probes (Alexa Fluor 647, 1:100) for 1 hr at 40°C.

Afterward, enriched T cells were stained with anti-CD4 PE (Clone RM4-5, 1:400, BD Biosciences #553048) and anti-CD62L AF700 (Clone MEL-14, 1:100, BD Biosciences #560517) and sorted as CD62L<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>GFP<sup>+</sup> (Treg) or GFP<sup>−</sup> (Tconv) fractions on a FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences, France). Then, Tconv and Treg were labeled with CellTrace Violet and CFSE (Thermo Fisher #C34557 and C34554), respectively, before the culture. For T-cell activation, either CD3/CD28 DynaBeads (Thermo Fisher #11452D) or soluble anti-CD3 (1 µg/ml) + splenocytes from Rag2<sup>−/−</sup> mice were used. When specified, Naloxone hydrochloride (Tocris, #0599/100) was added to the media at the indicated concentration at the beginning of the culture. At the end of the culture, cells were stained with eF780 Fixable Viability Dye (Thermo Fisher #65-0865-14) before acquisition on a LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences). To induce colitis, C57Bl/6 Rag2<sup>−/−</sup> mice were intraperitoneally injected with CD4<sup>+</sup>CD62L<sup>hi</sup>GFP<sup>−</sup> naive T cells (4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per mouse) isolated from spleens and LNs of WT C57Bl/6 Foxp3-GFP mice (kind gift of Dr B.

The skin was then fixed with paraformaldehyde 4% for 2 hr at RT. Fixed tissue was cryoprotected in 30% sucrose containing 0.05% sodium azide diluted in PBS at 4°C for 48 hr, and cut with a cryostat (Microm HM550) into 25 µm sections placed directly onto gelatine coated slides. For fluorescent immunostaining, slides were washed with PBS and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS + 0.2% Triton-X (PBS-T) for 1 hr at RT, then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in PBS-T overnight at 4°C. Sections were then washed in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies diluted 1:1000 in PBS-T, for 2 hr at RT. Slices were finally washed in PBS and cover-slipped with Fluoromount-G containing DAPI (Invitrogen 00-4959-52). The following primary antibodies were used for immunofluorescence staining at the following dilutions: anti-GFP raised in rabbit (1:1000, Chromotek # PABG-1), anti-CGRP raised in goat (1:500, Bio-Rad #1720-9007). We also used the following secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit conjugated with Cy3 raised in donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #711-165-152), anti-rabbit conjugated with Alexa-488 raised in donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #711-545-152), and anti-goat conjugated with Cy5 raised in donkey (Jackson ImmunoResearch, #705-175-147). Images were obtained by epifluorescent microscopy with a motorized fluorescence microscope Axio Imager M2 equipped with a camera Axiocam 705 (Zeiss). Skin slices were imaged using a Colibri 7 light source, ×10/0.30 and ×63/1.25 objectives and the following filters from Zeiss: 02 DAPI, 38 HE eGFP, 43 HE DsRed, and 50 Cy5 BP640/30.

Mice were placed on a metal plate maintained at 55°C. The response latency, which is the time taken to observe a nocifensive behavior such as jumping, licking, or flicking of the hind paws, was recorded. The mice were then immediately removed from the plate upon the recording of a reaction, or within 25 s if no response was observed to prevent tissue damage. The test was repeated every 2 days for a total of four measures before the administration of TMX and four measures starting from D3 post-TMX. Mice remained in their home cage except when being tested on the hot plate. The experimenter was blind to the genotype of the mice until the end of the experiment. Noxious heat sensitivity was independently assessed in the Neurodol laboratory with an Hargreaves test. Animals were placed in an acrylic chamber on a heated (30°C) glass plate and acclimated to the test chamber for 30 min during 2 days and then for 30 min on the third day prior to testing. Using a plantar analgesia meter (IITC, 40% intensity), a radiant heat source of constant intensity was focused on the plantar surface of the hind paw and the latency of paw withdrawal measured. The heat source was stopped upon paw withdrawal with a cutoff of 20 s to avoid injury. Heat sensitivity test was repeated three times on each hind paw with a 5-min interval between tests and the results for each paw were averaged together.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Static mechanical sensitivity</title><p>Static mechanical sensitivity was assessed with a Von Frey test. Briefly, mice were habituated to transparent Plexiglas chambers on an elevated wire mesh table for at least 30 min for 2 days, and prior to testing. Assessments were performed using a set of calibrated Von Frey monofilaments using the Up-Down method, starting with the 0.4 g filament. Each filament was gently applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw for 3 s or until a response such as a sharp withdrawal, shaking, or licking of the limb was observed. Rearing or normal ambulation during filament application were not counted. Filaments were applied at 5-min intervals until the threshold was determined. The 50% paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) was determined for each mouse on both hind paws.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Dynamic mechanical sensitivity</title><p>Dynamic mechanical sensitivity was assessed with the cotton swab test. Briefly, animals were habituated to transparent Plexiglas chambers on an elevated wire mesh table as described above. The head of a cotton swab was teased and puffed out with forceps until it reached approximately three times its original size. Tests were performed by lightly moving the cotton swab across the surface of the hind paw from heel to toe. If the animal reacted (lifting, shaking, licking of the paw) a positive response was recorded. A negative response was recorded if the animal showed no such behavior. The application was repeated six times with a 5-min interval between applications, and a percentage of positive responses was determined. Paw withdrawal frequency (PWF) was determined for both hind paws of each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Noxious mechanical sensitivity</title><p>Noxious mechanical sensitivity was assessed with the pinprick test. Animals were acclimated to transparent Plexiglas chambers placed on a wire mesh table as described above. A small insect pin (tip diameter = 0.03 mm) was applied 10 times with a 5-min interval between applications on the plantar side of each hind paw. Care was taken to apply a minimal pressure without penetrating the skin. If the animal showed aversive behavior (lifting, shaking, licking of the paw) a positive response was recorded. A negative response was recorded if the animal showed none of these reactions within 1 s of application and a percentage of positive responses were determined. PWF was calculated by averaging the positive responses for each mouse for each hind paw.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>Proprioception test</title><p>Animals were placed in an empty plastic cage and allowed to acclimate for 15–20 min. A 8-mm diameter adhesive paper circle was then applied to the plantar surface of the hind paw covering the footpads, and the animals were immediately placed back in the chamber. The animals were observed until they demonstrated a behavioral response to the adhesive tape, and the latency in seconds to respond was recorded. Inspection of the paw, shaking of the paw or attempting to remove the tape were all considered valid responses. Each animal was habituated one time the day prior testing, and then tested three times with a 5-min interval between tests, and the three values averaged for each animal for each hind paw.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical tests are reported in the figure legends and were performed with Prism v9.4.1 (GraphPad Inc, La Jolla, CA, USA).

The authors used a combination of transcriptomic databases available online to characterize the molecular signature of Treg. The proenkephalin gene Penk is among the most enriched transcripts, suggesting that Treg plays an analgesic role through the release of endogenous opioids. In addition, in silico analysis suggests that Penk is regulated by the TNFR superfamily; this being experimentally confirmed. Using flow cytometry analysis, the authors then show that Penk is mostly expressed in Treg of the skin and colon, compared to other immune cells. Finally, genetic conditional excision of Penk, selectively in Treg, results in heat hypersensitivity, as assessed by behavior analysis.</p><p>Editors' note: The authors accepted most if not all the

Nevertheless, it appears that heat-sensitivity in controls WT (blue dots) is slightly diminished after TMX administration (Figure 5A), suggesting that heat-sensitive receptors are moderately altered by TMX per se. This reduction is much more pronounced for LOX mice. Thus, although it is possible that TMX play a marginal role on heat sensitivity by itself, the results show a much more pronounced effect of TMX in LOX than in WT, in favor of a role for Penk Treg in heat sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There are no controls demonstrating that recombination actually occurred. How do the authors know a single dose of TAM is sufficient?</p></disp-quote><p>these results are now presented in figure S4. A 70% reduction in Penk mRNA is observed in Treg after a single administration of TMX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Why was only heat sensitivity assessed? The behavioral tests are inadequate to derive any meaningful conclusions. Further, why wasn't the behavioral data plotted longitudinally</p></disp-quote><p>The longitudinal data are presented in figure S5A. New behavioral tests have been performed and the results are now shown in figure S5E-H. Importantly, heat sensitivity was observed in two independent laboratory with two different tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present study addresses the role of enkephalins, which are specifically expressed by regulatory T cells (Treg), in sensory perception in mice. The authors used a combination of transcriptomic databases available online to characterize the molecular signature of Treg. The proenkephalin gene Penk is among the most enriched transcripts, suggesting that Treg plays an analgesic role through the release of endogenous opioids. In addition, in silico analysis suggests that Penk is regulated by the TNFR superfamily; this being experimentally confirmed. Using flow cytometry analysis, the authors then show that Penk is mostly expressed in Treg of the skin and colon, compared to other immune cells. Finally, genetic conditional excision of Penk, selectively in Treg, results in heat hypersensitivity, as assessed by behavior analysis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is clear and reveals a previously unappreciated role of enkephalins, as released by immune cells, in sensory perception. The rationale in this manuscript is easy to follow, and conclusions are well supported by data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The sensory deficit of Penk cKO appears to be quite limited compared to control littermates.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Aubert et al investigated the role of PENK in regulatory T cells. Through the mining of publicly available transcriptome data, the authors confirmed that PENK expression is selectively enriched in regulatory but not conventional T cells. Further data mining suggested that OX40, 4-1BB as well as BATF, can regulate PENK expression in Tregs. The authors generated fate-mapping mice to confirm selective PENK expression in Tregs and activated effector T cells in the colon and spleen. Interestingly, transgenic mice with conditional deletion of PENK in Tregs resulted in hypersensitivity to heat, which the authors attributed to heat hyperalgesia.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The generation of transgenic mice with conditional deletion of PENK in foxp3 and PENK fate-mapping is novel and can potentially yield significant findings. The identification of upstream signals that regulate PENK is interesting but unlikely to be the main reason why PENK is predominantly expressed in Tregs as both BATF and TNFR are expressed in effector T cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There is a lack of direct evidence and detailed analysis of Tregs in the control and transgenic mice to support the authors' hypothesis. PENK was previously reported to be expressed in skin Tregs and play a significant role in regulating skin homeostasis: this should be considered as an alternative mechanism that may explain the changed sensitivity to heat observed in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a detailed analysis of Treg with or without Penk, from their immunosuppressive functions to their colocalization with sensory neurons in the skin, supporting their function as natural analgesics. The alternate hypothesis relative to skin homeostasis is now clearly presented and discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Most of my comments should be addressable in a revised manuscript but will require additional analysis.</p><p>Major:</p><p>- According to flow cytometry analysis, Penk is expressed mostly in Treg of the skin and colon. What may account for such restricted expression? Where could Treg-released enkephalins act?</p></disp-quote><p>We now rephrased the paper to emphasize the known role of Batf in tissue Treg differentiation. We believe the Batf dependency of Penk expression is the reason why tissue Treg are more enriched in Penk than Treg from lymphoid organs. This is now clearly discussed.</p><p>We also provide a new figure (Figure S1) that shows that binding of Batf and co factors AP1 and IRF4 were reported to bind to Penk regulatory regions. Altogether, the role of Batf in tissue Treg differentiation would explain why tissue Treg such as colon and skin are particularly enriched in Penk. This is now clearly stated in the revised manuscript.</p><p>As to know where Treg-released enkephalins act, we performed immunostainings in the skin and observed that Treg could colocalize with sensory neurons (shown in a new figure 5, panel D). This observation raise the hypothesis that Treg-released enkephalins could act on sensory neurons locally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Which mechanism can underlie heat hypersensitivity in Penk cKO mice? Which sensory neurons are involved? Are other sensory modalities affected, such as mechanical sensitivity?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we show that Treg can be in close contact with thermal sensors neurons producing CGRP. These data are shown in figure 5D. We have also tested may other nociceptive stimulus (innocuous and noxious) and did not detect significant differences. These data are presented as a supplementary figure S5. Whether enkephalins produced by Treg can change the stimulation threshold of various nervous fibers is currently performed by electrophysiology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- No control is provided to ensure that Penk is selectively excised in Treg cells in cKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments with fluorescent probes to document Penk mRNA expression in cKO mice. The results on the specific expression of Penk mRNA in various subsets post-TMX are shown in a supplementary figure S4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors acknowledge that Penk from Treg was previously studied in an animal model of inflammatory pain. However, which role these endogenous opioids play is unclear, especially since authors discovered that enkephalins are likely continuously released at steady states. This is not enough discussed in the narrative, which surprisingly does not separate the results from the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The results and discussion are now separated in two sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minors:</p><p>- Replace &quot;Fox3 1&quot; with &quot;Fox31&quot; (line 31), &quot;functions 15&quot; with &quot;functions15&quot; (line 43), &quot;BATF 19&quot; with &quot;BATF19&quot; (line 85).</p><p>- Text mentions Figure S4 (line 125), which is most likely S3.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Given the most significant finding of this paper is based on the heat-induced pain model, there is surprisingly little analysis of Tregs in this context. The authors analyzed spleen and colon Tregs at steady state, it is unclear whether any of these Tregs are involved in pain sensitivity directly. Skin Tregs or other relevant Tregs to this model should be analyzed in control and Lox mice. This is particularly relevant as PENK expression was previously reported in skin Tregs and plays a significant role in skin homeostasis (Yamazaki et al 2020 PNAS). Does PENK conditional deletion alter Treg frequencies, numbers, and immune suppressive function? Not even spleen or colon Treg were analyzed comparing control and lox mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide evidences showing unaltered immunosuppressive functions of Treg in the absence of Penk (Figure 4), and more importantly unaffected proportions of skin Treg in mice lacking Penk in Treg, at the very site of heat stimulation (Figure 5B-C). We also observed unaffected representation of Treg in the spleen and lymph nodes, but we do not feel that these data are necessary to interpret the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the role of PENK in skin Tregs, could the observed effect in Figure 4 be due to altered skin homeostasis rather than sensitivity to pain?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is referring to a paper where Penk in skin Treg play a role on UV-damaged keratinocytes in vivo (Shime et al., 2020, PNAS). To our knowledge, a role for Penk produced by skin Treg on keratinocytes homeostasis at the steady state is currently unknown. Nevertheless, this hypothesis is now clearly stated and discussed in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors stated that only after 7 days post tamoxifen treatment was heat hyperalgesia observed: deletion of PENK in Treg but not Tconv should be confirmed: is deletion only complete after 7 days or is the effect observed due to indirect effects of altered &quot;normal&quot; Treg function?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed a kinetics to document Penk deletion at D3, D7 and 30 post-TMX. Results show a specific deletion of Penk in Treg at all time points so we combined all the time points for the representation of the results (Figure S4). As for the indirect effects of “altered” normal function, we now provide the reader with a new figure (Figure 4), showing that Penk deficient Treg are not impaired in their suppressive function in vitro and in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Actual protein/peptide production of enkephalins by Tregs should be confirmed. It is also unclear which peptide(s) can be secreted and presumably responsible for the changes in heat sensitivity.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question that we addressed with a MENK ELISA but without success at reproducing the results. An ongoing project will use mass spectrometry to fully characterize the peptides produced by Treg and activated Tconv.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The analysis of PENK regulation by Tregs is interesting despite them being entirely based on data mining. BATF is a pioneering factor expressed by all activated effector T cells. While the connection between BATF and PENK may explain why the authors observed PENK expression chiefly in activated effectors and Tregs, BATF cannot be the reason why PENK is &quot;predominantly&quot; expressed by Tregs. Similarly, 4-1BB and OX40 can be induced on effector T cells. Is PENK under the control of Foxp3? There are lots of publically available datasets on Foxp3/IL-2 dependent Treg signatures through which this can be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide a supplementary figure (Figure S1), showing a compilation of ChIP Seq studies for various transcription factors in various T cell subsets. We provide the reader with a list of all the TF that have been reported to bind in the regulatory regions of Penk. In agreement with our hypothesis, BATF, FOXP3, IRF4 and several others are present in that list. Further work is needed to decipher the exact contribution of each of those TF to the regulation of Penk in Treg vs activated Tconv that is beyond the scope of this report.</p></body></sub-article></article>
