on host cells. Glycosylation of both proteins is critical for this interaction. Recombinant soluble human ACE2 can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and is currently undergoing clinical tests for the treatment of COVID-19. We used 3D structural models and molecular dynamics simulations to define the ACE2 N-glycans that critically influence Spike-ACE2 complex formation. Engineering of ACE2 N-glycosylation by site-directed mutagenesis or glycosidase treatment resulted in enhanced binding affinities and improved virus neutralization without notable deleterious effects on the structural stability and catalytic activity of the protein. Importantly, simultaneous removal of all accessible N-glycans from recombinant soluble human ACE2 yields a superior SARS-CoV-2 decoy receptor with promise as effective treatment for COVID-19 patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>angiotensin converting enzyme 2</kwd><kwd>ACE2</kwd><kwd>glycosylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative pathogen of human coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has resulted in an unprecedented pandemic and worldwide health crisis. Similar to the beta-coronaviruses SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible and can lead to lethal pneumonia and multi-organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). For infection and viral entry, the Spike surface protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Recombinant soluble human ACE2 (rshACE2) has been shown to bind Spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), can effectively neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monteil et al., 2021</xref>), and the corresponding drug candidate APN01 has undergone a phase II clinical trial for the treatment of hospitalized cases of COVID-19 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT04335136). A first case study of its use in a patient has been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zoufaly et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, an aerosol formulation of APN01 has been developed and is currently undergoing Phase I clinical studies.</p><p>Multiple other therapeutic strategies attempt to target the Spike-ACE2 interaction, for example by development of neutralizing antibodies blocking the ACE2-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2020</xref>) or lectins that bind to glycans on the Spike surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chan et al., 2021</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2021</xref>). Using soluble ACE2 as a decoy receptor for Spike is particularly attractive, as it minimizes the risk that variants of concern may evade the treatment through mutations as has been observed for antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weisblum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yuan et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, protein engineering has yielded ACE2 variants with substantially improved affinities for Spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glasgow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, soluble ACE2-based therapeutics offer considerable advantages over other therapeutic formats that aim to hamper the Spike-ACE2 interaction sterically.</p><p>Modern structural biology has been amazingly fast to respond to this pandemic. A mere 3 months after identification of SARS-CoV-2 as the etiologic agent of COVID-19, structures of the complex between ACE2 and the receptor binding domain (RBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2020</xref>) and of the ectodomain of trimeric Spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>) were already solved by X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy. While this provided unprecedented insight into the protein-protein interactions between Spike and ACE2, the structural impact of protein-bound glycans on the Spike-ACE2 interface could not be assessed experimentally so far due to their compositional diversity and conformational flexibility. Here, in silico modeling of the glycans offers a powerful alternative to study the effects of individual Spike and ACE2 glycans on the molecular interactions between these two proteins.</p><p>The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein is heavily glycosylated with both complex and oligo-mannosidic type N-glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), thereby shielding a large portion of the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sikora et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zimmerman et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, ACE2 is a glycoprotein with up to seven highly utilized sites of N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Recent computational studies started to investigate protein glycosylation in the context of the interaction between Spike and ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mehdipour and Hummer, 2021</xref>). Extensive all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicated that Spike N-glycans attached to N165 and N234 could be important stabilizers of the ligand-accessible conformation of the receptor binding domain (RBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, it has been proposed that the N-glycan at position N343 acts as a gate facilitating RBD opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>). Other MD studies concluded that the glycans attached to N90 and N322 of ACE2 could be major determinants of Spike binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mehdipour and Hummer, 2021</xref>), while yet other simulation works postulate that glycosylation does not affect the RBD-ACE2 interaction significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Delgado et al., 2021</xref>). Genetic or pharmacological blockade of N-glycan biosynthesis at the oligomannose stage in ACE2-expressing target cells was found to dramatically reduce viral entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2020</xref>), even though several glycoforms of ACE2 were found to display comparatively moderate variation with respect to Spike binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>). Hence, a detailed understanding on how individual glycans on both Spike and ACE2 influence their interaction and a comprehensive experimental validation of the MD findings is crucial for the rational design of novel therapeutic soluble ACE2 variants with enhanced Spike binding affinity and the capacity to block viral entry more efficiently than the native enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). The identification of the Spike glycans essential for efficient association with ACE2 will be also critical to guide rational design of improved SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We started our research by creating 3D models of the trimeric Spike in complex with human ACE2 (hACE2). The RBD of Spike exists in two distinct conformations, referred to as ‘up’ and ‘down’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walls et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). The ‘up’ conformation corresponds to the receptor-accessible state with the RBD of one monomer exposed. By superimposing the RBD from the RBD-hACE2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2020</xref>) with the single RBD in the ‘up’ conformation (monomer 3) of the trimeric Spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walls et al., 2020</xref>), an initial model was obtained. Of note, although cryo-EM structures with more than one RBD in the ‘up’ conformation were shown to bind to two separate hACE2 molecules (rather than one single hACE2 dimer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benton et al., 2020</xref>), we decided to study the effect of the glycans on the Spike hACE2 interaction using the model with a single RBD in the ‘up’ conformation. To assess the impact of all seven individual N-glycosylation sites of hACE2 on its interaction with Spike, we first elucidated the entire glycome of rshACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This also provided information on the glycans attached to N690, a glycosylation site not covered in previous glycoproteomic studies of soluble hACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>). For recombinant trimeric Spike, the glyco-analysis has been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). Based on the site-specific glycosylation profiles, we added complex or oligo-mannosidic glycan trees to the respective sites of Spike and ACE2 (Supplementray File 1). We hence constructed fully glycosylated atomistic models of the trimeric Spike glycoprotein, free dimeric ACE2 and of the Spike glycoprotein in complex with dimeric hACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As glycans are known to be particularly flexible, and these were modeled in a single low-energy conformation, we subsequently performed molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike-ACE2 complex (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), and of free hACE2. This allowed us to study the conformational distribution of the glycans on the surface of the proteins and their dynamic effects on the interaction between Spike and hACE2. Inspection of the most important interacting residues on Spike and ACE2, their average distances and the electrostatic potential of the interface area identified critical contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-73641-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Molecular dynamics simulation of trimeric Spike bound to ACE2.</title><p>The movie highlights a three nano-second time segment of the molecular dynamics simulation (from 25 to 28 ns).

It has been reported that Spike mutants lacking the glycans at N331 and N343 display reduced infectivity, while elimination of the glycosylation motif at N234 results in increased resistance to neutralizing antibodies, without reducing infectivity of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2020</xref>). The equilibrium between the ‘up’ and ‘down’ conformations of Spike involves various stabilizing and destabilizing effects, with possible roles for the glycans at N165, N234, N331, and N343 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mori et al., 2021</xref>). Removing the glycans at N165, N234 and N343 was experimentally seen to reduce binding to ACE2 by 10%, 40%, and 56%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sztain et al., 2021</xref>). In our MD simulations, the glycan at position N343 interacts directly with ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), while the glycan at N331 interacts with a neighboring Spike monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the N331 glycosylation site only indirectly affects the interaction of Spike with ACE2. In our model, the glycan at N234 also does not interact directly with ACE2, but seems to stabilize the ‘up’ conformation. Its removal could favor the ‘down’ conformation of the RBD, possibly explaining the observed more effective shielding against neutralizing antibodies. In agreement with previous simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalino et al., 2020</xref>) the Man9 glycan at N234 of Spike partially inserts itself into the vacant space in the core of the trimer that is created when the RBD of monomer three is in the ‘up’ conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). In our simulations, the free space created by the ‘up’ conformation seems slightly smaller for Spike in complex with ACE2, suggesting that binding to ACE2 has a stabilizing effect on the Spike monomer.</p><p>The N165Q mutant was experimentally found to be more sensitive to neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In our models, the glycan at N165 is positioned directly next to the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and thus could shield important antigenic sites. These data highlight the complex impact of Spike glycosylation on the intramolecular interactions of the Spike monomers and, critically, the interaction with ACE2, posing a challenge to design SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing moieties.</p><p>Since our modeling clearly confirmed that ACE2 glycosylation plays a significant role in its binding to Spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>), we also determined the area of the Spike-ACE2 interface region, by subtracting the SASA of the complex from the SASA of the individual proteins and dividing by two. The total interface area was 24.6 nm², with glycans accounting for up to 51% of the interface area, that is 12.6 nm², contributed by the four most relevant glycans at positions N53, N90, N322, and N546 of ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, we scored the number of atoms of each ACE2 glycan in contact with Spike. A contact was defined as a distance of less than 0.4 nm between two atoms. This allowed us to identify the glycans at N53, N90, N322, and N546 as interacting with Spike, with the glycan at position N53 having the weakest interaction. Notably, N546 interacted with Spike for a significant amount of time only in one of the two independent simulations. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for an analysis of the individual MD simulations and for separate analysis of the first and second half of the simulations. Remarkably, the interactions of the glycan at N90 seem to be more pronounced in the second, as compared to the first simulation. The degree of interaction correlated with the spatial proximity between the glycans and the RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). Assessing the number of hydrogen bonds that formed during the simulations, the glycans at N90 and N322 appear most prominent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) with a maximum occurrence of 10 hydrogen bonds existing concurrently. Interestingly, the glycans at N90 and N322 interact directly with Spike protein atoms, while the glycan at N546 (red sticks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>) interacts with the glycans at N122 and N165 of Spike (dark green and orange sticks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The glycans are highly dynamic, as can be seen in the breadth of the distributions of hydrogen bond occurrences and the multimodal character of the distributions for the interface area between the glycans and Spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). A single glycan at N90 is observed to form up to 30 hydrogen bonds to Spike and to be responsible for an interface area of up to 10 nm<sup>2</sup>, representing almost 40% of the average total interface area between Spike and ACE2. These findings are in agreement with previously reported simulations of the complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mehdipour and Hummer, 2021</xref>) but raise the question if the glycans contribute favorably to the binding of the two proteins by mediating relevant interactions or unfavorably because of steric restraints and a loss of conformational freedom upon binding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The role of hACE2 glycosylation in the interaction with Spike.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Normalized distribution of the number of atoms of glycans at N53, N90, N322, and N546 of ACE2 that are in contact with Spike (distance &lt;0.4 nm).

The density map of the unbound ACE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) shows a continuous density of glycans, largely covering the interface area. Formation of the ACE2-Spike complex significantly reduces the conformational freedom of the glycans, in particular the ones at N90 and N322 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). We predict that the glycans at N90 and N322 hamper binding to Spike, either sterically or through an entropic penalty upon binding due to a loss of conformational freedom.

First, we ablated N-glycosylation at N90 and N322 individually using the ACE2-Fc fusion constructs ACE2-T92Q-Fc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2020</xref>) and ACE2-N322Q-Fc. Note that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2020</xref>) indeed suggests that removal of the glycan at N90 through a mutation of T92 leads to enhanced interaction with Spike. The same data set, however, suggests that removal of the glycan at N322 through a mutation of T324 most likely leads to reduced affinity to Spike. However, T324 is itself part of the interface with Spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), and any mutation of this residue could easily disrupt ACE2 – Spike binding directly, rather than through its effect on the N322 glycosite.

The BLI data are in good agreement with our computational models, confirming that the removal of protein N-glycosylation at either N90 or N322 results in up to twofold higher binding affinities, when compared to ACE2-wt-Fc (ACE2-wt-Fc: <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 16.2 ± 0.7 nM; ACE2-T92Q-Fc: <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 8.0 ± 0.7 nM; ACE2-N322Q-Fc: <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> = 11.4 ± 0.3 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Importantly, co-incubation of cells with SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2-T92Q-Fc resulted in significant further reduction of the viral load when compared to ACE2-wt-Fc. Enhanced SARS-CoV-2 neutralization was also observed for ACE2-N322Q-Fc.

Quantitative release of sialic acids and complete removal of N-glycans from all ACE2-wt-Fc N-glycosylation sites with the exception of N546 was also confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">5</xref>).

Combined introduction of the mutations T92Q and N322Q as well as enzymatic desialylation did not reduce the thermal stability of ACE2-Fc as assessed by DSC, while close-to-complete removal of N-glycans by PNGase F led to a slightly decreased midpoint transition temperature of the ACE2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

The increased affinities of these ACE2-Fc variants for Spike correlate with their potencies to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, with deglyco-ACE2-wt-Fc followed by ACE2-T92Q-N322Q-Fc displaying the highest neutralization potencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Taken together, these data identify critical glycans at position N90 and N322 of ACE2 that structurally and functionally interfere with Spike-ACE2 binding; ablation of these glycans via site-directed mutagenesis or enzymatic deglycosylation generated ACE2 variants with improved Spike-binding properties and increased neutralization strength.</p><p>The results presented above uncover the critical importance of N-glycans located at the ACE2-Spike interface for the infection of host cells by SARS-CoV-2.

Our in silico models of the Spike-ACE2 complex combined with simulations of its spatial and temporal dynamics rationalized previously published data and led to predictions that were confirmed by in vitro binding studies and cell-based SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays. However, it requires further explanation how the moderately enhanced affinity of ACE2 glycovariants for monomeric RBD observed in biolayer interferometry experiments can relate to a far more pronounced increase of their virus-neutralization potency in Vero E6 cells. First, while the binding affinity is represented by an equilibrium constant, which is the ACE2 concentration at which 50% is in a bound state, the inhibitory strength in cell-based assays is measured at three distinct concentrations, at which one protein may show little inhibition (the relative concentration in the assay is below the K<sub>d</sub>) while another variant shows strong inhibition (the relative concentration in the assay is above the K<sub>d</sub>). Second, a cooperative effect may be expected for the association of trimeric Spike molecules present in the viral envelope with ACE2 dimers. In this supramolecular setting, a subtle increase in the affinity of ACE2 for RBD can lead to a dynamic equilibrium of binding and unbinding events with up to six potential interactions, leading to an overall much stronger avidity effect. The dynamic equilibrium of the RBDs between ‘down’ and ‘up’ conformations can further steepen the dose-response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Monod et al., 1965</xref>). Third, a slight advantage of the soluble ACE2 decoy receptor over endogenous native ACE2 may be sufficient to tip the balance between SARS-CoV-2 attachment and shedding of viral particles from the host cell surface. The inhibitory strength is not a function of the number of Spike proteins that are bound, but of the probability that a high enough fraction of Spike proteins is bound, potentiating a small increase in affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magnus, 2013</xref>). Fourth, the SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> were performed at a low multiplicity of infection. This can lead to complete neutralization of all virus particles in the inoculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>) as becomes evident from the individual data points of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, the data are presented as medians and not as arithmetic means, which potentially accentuates the numeric differences between individual samples. Finally, it is possible that the N-glycan moiety of ACE2 also modulates other aspects of viral entry besides promoting the docking of Spike to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>It has been reported that the sialylation status of ACE2 affects its interactions with SARS-CoV-2 Spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2021</xref>). We have found that enzymatic desialylation of ACE2 results in a reproducible increase of its affinity to RBD without detectable structural penalties. Importantly, desialylated ACE2 is more efficient in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 than its native counterpart. Molecular simulations suggest that the terminal sialic acids of the N-glycans attached to ACE2 residues N90 and N322 mask parts of the Spike-ACE2 interface and thus could interfere with Spike binding through steric clashes and/or electrostatic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This provides a structural rationale how sialic acids present on ACE2 might dampen interactions with Spike during SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We want to point out that all virus-neutralization experiments presented in this paper were performed using Vero E6 cells. Although this cell line is very popular for SARS-CoV-2 propagation and infectivity studies, it will be important to repeat our neutralization assays with a cell line derived from human lung (e.g. Calu-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, treatment with deglycosylated ACE2 could have per se a negative impact on cell viability and thus affect virus replication in the treated cultures. We will assess the potential cellular toxicity of deglycosylated ACE2 in future studies. However, we have shown previously that native ACE2 does not display any cytotoxic effects even when used at very high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In line with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2021</xref>), our results indicate that the elimination of the N-glycans attached to N90 is largely responsible for the improved Spike-binding properties of enzymatically deglycosylated ACE2. As proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glasgow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2020</xref>) and corroborated by our mutational analysis, substitution of ACE2 residues N90 or T92 could indeed provide an alternative approach for the development of ACE2 variants with improved SARS-CoV-2 sequestering properties. Our data indicate that ablation of N90 glycosylation could be combined with mutations of N322 and possibly other ACE2 N-glycosylation sites to achieve an even higher SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing potency. However, expression of an ACE2 variant lacking all potential N-glycosylation sites in ACE2-negative host cells led to reduced rather than enhanced susceptibility of the cells to SARS-CoV-2 as compared to transduction with wild-type ACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2021</xref>). This was attributed to the much lower cellular content of the mutant protein relative to the native enzyme, thus demonstrating that the importance of N-glycosylation for proper folding of glycoproteins during their biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu and Ng, 2015</xref>) also applies to ACE2. Given the inferior expression yields of glycan-free ACE2 and the potential of unwanted immunological side effects when non-natural mutations are introduced into a therapeutic glycoprotein, we believe that the clinical potential of enzymatically deglycosylated rshACE2 is superior to that of any of our ACE2 glycomutants. In our opinion, treatment of clinical-grade rshACE2 with deglycosylation enzymes such as PNGase F followed by a final polishing step represents a straightforward, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant and industrially feasible alternative to generate a potent therapeutic drug for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected persons and patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

protein model was created using partial experimental structures deposited in the protein databank (PDB). The Spike RBD domain in complex with hACE2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan et al., 2020</xref>) (PDB: 6M17) was superimposed with the opened RBD domain in a Spike structure with one open RBD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Walls et al., 2020</xref>) (PDB: 6VYB). Alternative Spike structures have been published, which show very similar conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, further structures of the Spike RBD-hACE2 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lan et al., 2020</xref> have been reported which show very similar conformations to the templates used. Missing residues in Spike were modeled using SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) and the superimposed structure as template based on the complete SARS-CoV-2 S sequence (GenBank QHD43416.1).</p><p>Different types of glycans were added to Spike and hACE2. For Spike, the assignments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watanabe et al., 2020</xref> were followed, selecting oligomannosidic (Man5 or Man9) or complex (bi-antennary di-sialylated core fucosylated; NaNaF) glycans according to the majority of the glycans detected at the respective site. This was largely confirmed by our own analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2021</xref>). For hACE2, complex (i.e. bi-antennary di-sialylated core fucosylated) N-glycans were added. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the exact assignments. Initial conformations of the glycans were selected following previously derived procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turupcu and Oostenbrink, 2017</xref>). In brief, molecular dynamics simulations were performed of mini-peptides with the glycans attached. Local Elevation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 1994</xref>) was used to enhance the sampling of all glycosidic linkages, during simulations of 100 ns. The entire glycan trees were clustered based on the conformations of the individual glycosidic linkages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Perić-Hassler et al., 2010</xref>). This resulted in conformational bundles containing 1301, 1340, and 2413 distinct conformations of Man5, Man9, and NaNaF, respectively. These conformations were fitted onto the respective glycosylation site in the Spike-hACE2 complex using a superposition of the backbone of the asparagine residues and the non-bonded interaction energy between the glycan and protein atoms or previously added glycans was computed. The lowest energy conformation was retained. Topologies and initial conformations were generated using the gromos ++ suite of pre- and post-MD tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichenberger et al., 2011</xref>). Glycans were added to the complex sequentially, to avoid collisions between individual glycans. A few modeled glycans were incompatible with loops of the Spike protein not resolved in the experimental structures. Loops involved in these structural incompatibilities (residues 141–165 and 471–490) were partially re-modeled in the fully glycosylated model using the RCD+ loop modeling server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chys and Chacón, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">López-Blanco et al., 2016</xref>). The final model was energy-minimized with the GROMOS 54A8 protein force-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reif et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reif et al., 2013</xref>), the GROMOS 53A6glyc glycan force-field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turupcu and Oostenbrink, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pol-Fachin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pol-Fachin et al., 2014</xref>) and the GROMOS simulation software using the steepest decent algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmid et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Molecular dynamics simulations</title><p>Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the simulation package Gromacs (Version 2019.5) and the indicated force field parameters. hACE2 was reduced to residues 21–730 in the models, to reduce its overall size prior to simulation. The models were placed in rhombic dodecahedron simulation boxes and solvated by explicit SPC water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berendsen et al., 1981</xref>). This resulted in simulation systems of 5.9 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 2.2 × 10<sup>6</sup> atoms for hACE2 and the Spike-hACE2 complex, respectively. Two independent 100-ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed for hACE2 and for the Spike-hACE2 complex each. The equations of motion were integrated using a leapfrog integration scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hockney, 1970</xref>) with a time-step of 2 fs. Non-bonded interactions were calculated within a cutoff sphere of 1.4 nm and electrostatic interactions were computed using a particle-particle particle-mesh (P3M) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hockney and Eastwood, 1988</xref>). Bond-lengths were constrained to their optimal values using the Lincs algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hess et al., 1997</xref>). Temperature was maintained at a constant value using a velocity-rescaling algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berendsen et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bussi et al., 2007</xref>) with a relaxation time of 0.1 ps. Pressure was maintained constant using a Parrinello-Rahman barostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parrinello and Rahman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nosé and Klein, 2006</xref>) with a relaxation time of 2.0 ps and an estimated isothermal compressibility of 4.5 × 10<sup>–5</sup> bar<sup>–1</sup>. Configurations were stored every 10 ps for subsequent analyses. Hydrogen bonds were identified using a geometric criterion. A hydrogen bond was logged if the donor-acceptor distance is within 0.25 nm and the donor-hydrogen-acceptor angle was larger than 135 degrees. The solvent-accessible surface area was determined by rolling a probe with diameter 0.14 nm over the surface of the protein, using slices of 0.005 nm width. An atom contact was assigned if the distance between two atoms were within 0.4 nm. The distributions of atom contacts, hydrogen bonds and solvent-accessible surface area were estimated using a kernel density estimator with gaussian kernels. Distributions obtained from the first and second half of the simulations were compared to ensure convergence. Glycan densities were calculated using the program GROmaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briones et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Recombinant expression of proteins</title><p>Soluble recombinant human ACE2 (rshACE2) was provided by Apeiron Biologicals (Vienna, Austria). Recombinant expression of all other proteins was performed by transient transfection of HEK293-6E cells, licensed from National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durocher et al., 2002</xref>).

Plasmid constructs pcDNA3-sACE2(WT)-Fc(IgG1) and pcDNA3-sACE2-T92Q-Fc(IgG1) were obtained from Addgene (United States). The N322Q mutation was introduced into ACE2-wt-Fc and ACE2-T92Q-Fc using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed-Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and the respective parental vector as template. High-quality plasmid preparations for expression of ACE2-Fc variants were prepared using the PureYield Plasmid Midiprep System (Promega, United States). Transient transfection of the cells was performed at a cell density of approximately 1.7 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells mL<sup>–1</sup> culture volume using a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 2 μg of linear 40 kDa polyethylenimine (Polysciences Inc, Germany) per mL culture volume. Forty-eight hr and 96 hr after transfection, cells were supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) tryptone N1 (Organotechnie, France) and 0.25% (w/v) D(+)-glucose (Carl Roth, Germany).

The His-tagged proteins were captured using a 5 mL HisTrap FF crude column connected to an ÄKTA pure chromatography system (both from Cytiva, United States). Bound proteins were eluted by applying a linear gradient of 20–500 mM imidazole over 20 column volumes. ACE2-Fc variants were purified by affinity chromatography using a 5 mL HiTrap Protein A column (Cytiva) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and 0.1 M glycine-HCl (pH 3.5) for elution. Eluate fractions were immediately neutralized using 2 M Tris (pH 12.0). Fractions containing the protein of interest were pooled, concentrated using Vivaspin 20 Ultrafiltration Units (Sartorius, Germany) and dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight using SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The RBD was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column (Cytiva) eluted with PBS.

Excess sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin was quenched by adding Tris-HCl buffer (800 mM, pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 3 mM. Biotinylated proteins were further purified using PD-10 desalting columns (Cytiva) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. All assays were conducted in PBS supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20% and 0.1% (w/v) BSA (PBST-BSA) at 25 °C with the plate shaking at 1000 rpm. The SAX biosensors were first equilibrated in PBST-BSA and then dipped into a 34 nM solution of the respective biotinylated capture molecule until a signal threshold of 0.8 nm was reached. Subsequently, the biosensors were dipped into PBST-BSA for 90 s to record a baseline, before they were submerged into different concentrations of RBD or the Spike protein to record association rates. For binding analysis of trimeric Spike, all biosensors were dipped into twofold serial dilutions of the protein (1.6–50 nM). To determine <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> values, titration of RBD was performed at different concentrations to cover a broad concentration range around the respective <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hulme and Trevethick, 2010</xref>). Biosensors loaded with ACE2 variants were submerged into twofold (6.25–200 nM) or threefold (0.8–200 nM) serial dilutions of RBD as appropriate for 600 s. For dissociation, the biosensors were dipped into PBST-BSA for 300 s (for analysis of Spike) or 100 s (for analysis of RBD). Each experiment included a baseline measurement using PBST-BSA (negative control) as well as a positive control (RBD).

To maximize sequence coverage, proteins were digested for 18 hr at 37 °C with chymotrypsin (Roche, Germany), followed by 3 hr at 37 °C using trypsin (Promega). All proteolytic digests were acidified to pH two by addition of 10% formic acid and directly analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS, using a capillary BioBasic C18 reversed-phase column (BioBasic-18, 150 × 0.32 mm, 5 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific), installed in a Dionex Ultimate U3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific), developing a linear gradient from 95% eluent A (80 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.0, in HPLC-grade water) to 65% eluent B (80% acetonitrile in 80 mM ammonium formate, pH 3.0) over 50 min, followed by a linear gradient from 65% to 99% eluent B over 15 min, at a constant flow rate of 6 μL/min, coupled to a maXis 4 G Q-TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Germany; equipped with the standard ESI source). For (glyco)peptide detection and identification, the mass spectrometer was operated in positive-ion DDA mode (i.e. switching to MS/MS mode for eluting peaks), recording MS scans in the m/z range from 150 to 2200 Th, with the six highest signals selected for MS/MS fragmentation. Instrument calibration was performed using a commercial ESI calibration mixture (Agilent Technologies). Site-specific profiling of protein glycosylation was performed using the dedicated Q-TOF data-analysis software packages Data Analyst (Bruker Daltonics) and Protein Scape (Bruker Daltonics), in conjunction with the MS/MS search engine MASCOT (Matrix Sciences Inc, United States) for automated peptide identification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>ACE2 activity assays</title><p>Enzymatic activity of ACE2 was determined and quantified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vickers et al., 2002</xref>), using 100 µM 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl-acetyl-Ala-Pro-Lys-2,4-dinitrophenyl (Bachem, Switzerland) as substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays</title><p>All work with infectious SARS-CoV-2 was performed under BSL-3 conditions. Vero E6 cells (ATCC, United States) were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) containing Earle’s Salts, 1% penicillin/streptomycin stock solution and 2 mM L-glutamine (all from Thermo Fisher Scientific), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and regularly tested for mycoplasma contaminations. A German 2019-nCoV isolate (Ref-SKU: 026 V-03883, Charité, Berlin, Germany) was propagated in Vero E6 cells. The TCID50 titer of virus stocks was determined by the Reed-Munch method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramakrishnan, 2016</xref>) and converted to plaque-forming units (pfu) using the conversion factor 0.7 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.atcc.org/support/technical-support/faqs/converting-tcid-50-to-plaque-forming-units-pfu">https://www.atcc.org/support/technical-support/faqs/converting-tcid-50-to-plaque-forming-units-pfu</ext-link>). Vero E6 cells were seeded in 48-well cell culture plates (3 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well) in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS overnight to reach approximately 80% confluence on the day of infection. ACE2 variants (final concentrations: 10–100 µg/mL) were preincubated with 60 pfu SARS-CoV-2 for 30 min at 37 °C under constant shaking (300 rpm). After preincubation, Vero E6 cells were infected for 1 h at 37 °C with samples containing either SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 variants or solely SARS-CoV-2 (untreated controls) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.002. Subsequently, cells were washed two times with MEM to remove unadsorbed virus. After incubation for 24 hr at 37 °C in MEM supplemented with 2% FBS, viral RNA was extracted from the culture supernatant using the QiaAmp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. SARS-CoV-2 replication was quantified via RT-qPCR using the QuantiTect Multiplex RT-qPCR Kit (Qiagen) with a Rotor Gene Q cycler (Qiagen). The reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µL at 50 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 15 min and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 55 °C for 30 s.

For these assays, Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acid stock solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. SARS-CoV-2 isolated from a nasopharyngeal sample of a Swedish COVID-19 patient (GenBank accession number MT093571) was propagated in Vero E6 cells. Virus was titered using a plaque assay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2008</xref>) with fixation of cells 72 hr post infection. Vero E6 cells were treated and infected as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, Vero E6 cells were seeded in 48-well plates (5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells per well) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Twenty-four hr post-seeding, ACE2 variants (final concentrations: 50–200 µg/mL) were mixed with 10<sup>6</sup> pfu SARS-CoV-2 (MOI: 20) in a final volume of 100 µl DMEM containing 5% FBS, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then added to the cells. Fifteen hr post-infection, cells were washed three times with PBS and then lysed using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before analysis by RT-qPCR to quantify the content of SARS-CoV-2 RNA as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monteil et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>employee of Apeiron Biologics.

As pointed out by reviewer 2, deglycosylation of hACE2 improves SARS-CoV-2 neutralization more potently than anticipated from its effect on the affinity of hACE2 for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Spike as measured by BLI in vitro. We agree that this observation requires further explanation. As also stated in the revised manuscript, several of the following factors contribute to this apparent discrepancy between virus neutralization and RBD binding: (1) While the binding affinity is represented by an equilibrium constant (K<sub>d</sub>), which is defined as the hACE2 concentration at which 50% is in a bound state, the inhibitory activity is measured at a single concentration, at which one protein may still show hardly any inhibition (K<sub>d</sub> is larger than the concentration in the assay) while another variant may show already strong inhibition (K<sub>d</sub> is smaller than the concentration in the assay); (2) The BLI measurements were performed in a setting of a 1:1 interaction between hACE2 and monomeric RBD. in vitro, dimeric hACE2 binds to trimeric Spike, in which the RBDs are in a dynamic equilibrium of ‘down’ and ‘up’ states, leading to cooperative effects [Monod et al., J. Mol. Biol. (1965) 12, 88-118]; (3) A much higher degree of valency is relevant on the viral surface when hACE2 molecules need to block multiple Spike trimers, potentiating small differences in affinity. The inhibitory strength is not a function of the number of Spike proteins that are bound, but of the probability that a high enough fraction of Spike proteins is bound [Magnus, PLoS Comput. Biol. (2013) 9, e1002900]; (4) The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays shown in Figure 7 were performed at a low multiplicity of infection. This can lead to complete neutralization of all virus particles in the inoculum as shown in a previous study [Monteil et al., Cell (2020) 181, 905-913] and also evident from the individual data points of our experiments (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). Hence, the data are presented as medians and not as arithmetic means, which potentially accentuates the numeric differences between individual samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Is there any toxicity in the cells due to deglycosylated ACE2 treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this interesting question. Since native hACE2 did not show any cytotoxic effects even at a concentration as high as 200 µg/mL [Monteil et al., Cell (2020) 181, 905-913], we assume that treatment with 10-50 µg/mL deglycosylated hACE2 (as used in the experiments shown in Figure 7) will not lead to any notable cell death. In compliance with the current <italic>eLife</italic> revision policy, we now explicitly state in the revised manuscript that the lack of cellular toxicity by deglycosylated ACE2 still has to be experimentally verified and that these additional experiments will be carried out as soon as possible. The results will be linked to the original paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 – Confirmation of RNA levels with infectious virus measurements would strengthen the conclusions. In addition, a range of 2 to 3 experiments were used. It would be preferable if 3 experiments were used.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that we were not precise in our wording. With the exception of one single mutant (ACE2-T92Q-Fc), the data presented in Figure 7 are derived from 3 independent experiments. With ACE2-T92Q-Fc, only 2 experiments could be performed due to the limited availability of this protein. This is now clearly stated in the legend of Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The SARS-CoV-2 stock used in these studies was propagated in Vero E6 cells, which means that the virus stock may contain a deletion in the spike cleavage site. The authors should confirm the results using Calu3 human lung cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. It is indeed known that loss of the furin cleavage site improves the fitness of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells, whereas it reduces replication in Calu-3 cells [Johnson et al., Nature (2021) 591, 293-299]. Hence, we will verify the sequence of the furin cleavage site in our SARS-CoV-2 stock. Furthermore, we will repeat our Vero E6 results with Calu-3 cells and the SARS-CoV-2 Δ variant, the increased infectivity of which has been linked to its enhanced furin susceptibility [Planas et al., Nature (2021), 596, 276-280]. This will be done in additional experiments of highest priority. The results will be linked to the original paper as soon as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are two major issues with the molecular dynamics: (1) Why was this particular conformation of the Spike-ACE2 complex chosen for the analysis and not other possibilities (e.g., two &quot;up&quot;)? This was not adequately explained.</p></disp-quote><p>In this work, we have focused on a single interface between the Spike trimer and the hACE2 dimer. The reviewer is correct that there are also configurations of the Spike trimer, with two (or three) receptor binding domains (RBDs) in the “up” conformation. Using this model would be of interest if it is expected that both RDBs would be able to simultaneously interact with both monomers of the hACE2 dimer. As this is sterically very unlikely, we chose to use the Spike with a single RBD in the “up” conformation. Cryo-EM structures with two RBDs in the up conformation were seen to bind to two separate molecules of hACE2, rather than to a single ACE2 dimer [Benton et al., Nature (2020) 588, 327–330]. Using such complexes would unnecessarily complicate our analysis of the effect of glycans on the Spike / hACE2 interactions. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The goal of the simulation was not explicitly stated, and this reviewer gets the impression that what was achieved was nothing more than what would be obtained from standard minimization procedures. These are important weakness of the paper, because all further analysis proceeds from the structural model after the simulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the overall protein structures did not change much beyond what could be obtained with energy minimizations from the experimentally determined structures. However, for the glycans, this is not the case. The glycan conformations were not observed experimentally and were initially modelled in a low-energy conformation. As can be seen from Figure 4, the molecular dynamics simulations subsequently allow for substantial sampling of the conformational space of the glycans. A single configuration, as obtained from an energy minimization, would not have yielded such diverse distributions of interactions. Furthermore, we would not have been able to make the comparison in Figure 4, where, in the absence of Spike, the glycans are shown to cover the Spike binding site. We emphasize this point in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With regards to the post-simulation analysis, the authors do not go into sufficient detail on the data supporting the purported interactions between glycans and proteins. Proximity is obviously an insufficient argument, and even though data are presented in Figure 3 and Figure S5, these are not described in a way that facilitates assessment of the rigor and significance of the analysis. This also relates back to the molecular dynamics step: how are we to assess whether a 100 ns simulation sufficiently captures the range of conformations of these glycans?</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that proximity is a poor representation of the strength of the interactions, we think it offers a simple characterization of the interactions between the glycans and the Spike protein. Our analysis in Figure 4 suggests that the glycans cover the interface area of hACE2 in the absence of Spike, while they contribute to about 50% of the overall interface area upon binding of Spike. We have extended our analysis of the data in Figure 3 of the revised manuscript. To address the question if the 100 ns of simulations are sufficient, we have split our analyses of the two independent 100-ns simulations into four parts of 50 ns each, and report the data from Figure 3 for the individual time-segments in a new Figure 3 —figure supplement 1. As discussed in the original manuscript, the glycan at N546 interacted with Spike for a significant amount of time only in the first of the two independent simulations. In contrast, the glycan at N90 seems to be showing more interactions with Spike in the second simulation than in the first simulation. For the rest, the trends seem to be quite similar for the individual simulations, as well as when analyzing only their first or second halves. We comment on this additional analysis in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the functional data: while all of these experiments seem to support the conclusion that glycans are important, there are important discrepancies that remain unexplained.
