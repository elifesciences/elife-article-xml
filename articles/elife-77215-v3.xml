function. The quantified contralateral homologous difference, that is asymmetry, is a key feature of the human brain left-right axis supporting functional processes, such as language. Here, we assessed whether the asymmetry of cortical functional organization is heritable and phylogenetically conserved between humans and macaques. Our findings indicate asymmetric organization along an axis describing a functional trajectory from perceptual/action to abstract cognition. Whereas language network showed leftward asymmetric organization, frontoparietal network showed rightward asymmetric organization in humans. These asymmetries were heritable in humans and showed a similar spatial distribution with macaques, in the case of intra-hemispheric asymmetry of functional hierarchy. This suggests (phylo)genetic conservation. However, both language and frontoparietal networks showed a qualitatively larger asymmetry in humans relative to macaques. Overall, our findings suggest a genetic basis for asymmetry in intrinsic functional organization, linked to higher order cognitive functions uniquely developed in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>asymmetry</kwd><kwd>functional gradients</kwd><kwd>heritability</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>large-scale organization</kwd><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valk</surname><given-names>Sofie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000165</institution-id><institution>Sick Kids Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NI17-039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Boris C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery-1304413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Boris C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN154298</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Boris C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Azrieli Center for Autism Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Boris C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010785</institution-id><institution>Canada First Research Excellence Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Boris C</given-names></name><name><surname>Valk</surname><given-names>Sofie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>International Max Planck Research School on Neuroscience of Communication: Function, Structure, and Plasticity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wan</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human brain suggests an asymmetric organization along a functional cortical axis describing a hierarchical functional trajectory from perceptual/action to abstract cognition, which is heritable and comparable with macaque brain, suggesting (phylo)genetic conservation and adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human cerebral cortex consists of two hemispheres that are not exactly alike and show marked differences in structure and function along a left-to-right axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Geschwind and Levitsky, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Güntürkün et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raemaekers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>). It has been suggested that the brain favors asymmetry to avoid duplication of neural circuitry having equivalent functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Levy, 1977</xref>). For example, bilateral cortical regions showing asymmetry in task-evoked activity have reduced (long-range) connections with the opposite homologous regions, favoring more local connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Asymmetry, that is quantitative hemispheric differences between contralateral homologous regions, supports partly differentiable functional processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galaburda et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Call et al., 2017</xref>). Previous work has suggested that functions related to leftward dominance include language processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Piervincenzi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), letter search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pollack and Price, 2019</xref>), and analogical reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Urbanski et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, rightward dominance of functional activation has been related to holistic word processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ventura et al., 2019</xref>), visuospatial abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), emotional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moeck et al., 2020</xref>), as well as with psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floris et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to task-related asymmetries, resting state functional connectivity (FC) studies have also reported hemispheric differences. For example, language areas of the middle and superior temporal cortex showed increased connectivity with regions in the left hemisphere relative to their right hemispheric counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raemaekers et al., 2018</xref>), and the right amygdala showed higher connectivity with the entire cortex than the left amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tetereva et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, previous work has indicated that there are inter- and intra-hemispheric differences in functional connectivity between healthy adults and patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agcaoglu et al., 2018</xref>), and between neurotypical individuals and those diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hahamy et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that such functional processing asymmetries may be driven by subtle differences in functional organization between the hemispheres.</p><p>One appealing approach to studying functional organization is by evaluating the low-dimensional axes, or gradients, present within the connectome. These approaches embed brain regions on a continuous data-driven space based on their functional connectome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coifman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). Gradients capture how connectivity profiles from distinct cortical regions are integrated (i.e. similar functional connectivity profiles) and segregated (i.e. dissimilar functional connectivity profiles) across the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethlehem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haak and Beckmann, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Paquola et al., 2019</xref>). Regions that have similar connectivity profiles are at similar positions along these gradients, whereas regions with dissimilar connectivity profiles are placed further apart. The principal functional gradient, partly reflected in the intrinsic geometry of the cortex, shows that regions of the transmodal systems occupy locations equidistant from unimodal systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>). Gradients provide a synoptic framework to capture smooth variations of connectivity patterns across the cortical mantle. They describe variations in genetic patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Vainik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Valk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Valk et al., 2022</xref>, functional processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Turnbull et al., 2020</xref>), and are observed across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Valk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coletta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). Gradients have been linked to graph-theoretical markers such as degree centrality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hong et al., 2019</xref>) and microcircuit dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2021</xref>) as well as connectivity distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the principal gradient describes the geodesic distance between primary and default regions, and relates to cortical microstructure and associated processing hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>). In doing so, and in contrast to clustering or network-based approaches, the gradient framework provides a spatial ordering of functional brain networks, placing them along a gradual axis of connectivity variation reaching from sensory to transmodal areas. In the context of asymmetry of gradient loadings this would mean that a given region with a significant left-ward asymmetry along the first gradient (sensory-to-transmodal) has a connectivity profile more similar to the transmodal anchor in the left hemisphere relative to the right. Consequently, these regions are placed at different positions along the cortical hierarchy, providing novel insights concerning the system-level variations in the asymmetric brain. Indeed, recent research suggests that the principal gradient is asymmetric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022</xref>) and that the degree of asymmetry relates to individual differences in semantic performance and visual reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>As inter-hemispheric asymmetry has been observed consistently in human brain structure and function, there may be important (phylo)genetic factors supporting lateralized human cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Güntürkün et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corballis, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corballis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Güntürkün and Ocklenburg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vilain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vallortigara et al., 1999</xref>). Previous work has reported that brain structure asymmetry is heritable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>), especially in the language areas, and differentiates between humans and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eichert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neubauer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spocter et al., 2020</xref>). At the same time, it has been shown that both humans and apes show asymmetry of brain shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neubauer et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that asymmetry is not a uniquely human brain feature. However, asymmetry was observed to be more local and variable in humans, potentially suggesting that individual variation in asymmetry in humans varies as a function of localized networks rather than global features. It is of note that the full FC matrix contains both intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric connections. Intra-hemispheric connections, compared to the inter-hemispheric connections, have been suggested to reflect inhibition of the corpus callosum and may underlie hemispheric specializations involving language, reasoning, and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gazzaniga, 2000</xref>). Conversely, inter-hemispheric connectivity may reflect information transfer between hemispheres, for example, of motoric information, or crude information concerning spatial locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gazzaniga, 2000</xref>). Previous studies have mainly employed intra-hemispheric FC to study gradient asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022</xref>). However, inter-hemispheric differences in functional connectivity may also have functional relevance. For example, inter-hemispheric connectivity has been reported to be abnormal in patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agcaoglu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2019</xref>) and autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hahamy et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed differences not only of functional organization within each hemisphere but also between hemispheres, enabled by the corpus callosum, are relevant for integration and segregation of cognitive function and support hemispheric coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gazzaniga, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Toga and Thompson, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the genetic basis of asymmetry of functional organization. We first examined whether inter-individual differences in asymmetry of functional organization are under genetic control, that is heritable. Second, we investigated whether asymmetry of functional organization is phylogenetically conserved in macaques. To probe individual variation in asymmetry of functional organization, we utilized a data-driven nonlinear dimension reduction technique, as this approach can provide reliable and robust indices of individual variation of cortical organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hong et al., 2020</xref>). We first obtained connectomic gradients for each hemisphere separately (left and right intra-hemispheric) as well as those describing functional connectivity from left to right and right to left hemispheres (left and right inter-hemispheric). We then computed the difference between individual gradient scores to study the asymmetry, consistent with prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022</xref>). Subsequently, to evaluate the heritability of possible differences between left and right intra- and inter-hemispheric FC gradients, we used the twin pedigree set-up of the Human Connectome Project S1200 release young adults dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>). To assess whether asymmetry is conserved in other primates, we compared the asymmetry of functional gradients of humans with those observed in macaque monkeys using the prime-DE dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Milham et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, we conducted a confirmatory meta-analysis to explore the relationship between the patterns of gradient asymmetry and task-based functional MRI activations.

For the network level analyses, we employed the Cole-Anticevic atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ji et al., 2019</xref>) based on the MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). For each individual, FC was summarized in two different patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>): FC within the left hemisphere (LL mode, intra-hemispheric pattern), within the right hemisphere (RR mode, intra-hemispheric pattern), from left to right hemisphere (LR mode, inter-hemispheric pattern), and from right to left hemisphere (RL mode, inter-hemispheric pattern). We selected the LL mode as the reference template for the gradients approach, and therefore assessed the mean FC that was determined by averaging LL FC across subjects (lower panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Here, the reference matches the order and direction of the gradient but does not rescale the gradients. The template gradients were computed by implementing diffusion map embedding, a non-linear dimension reduction technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coifman et al., 2005</xref>), on the mean LL FC using BrainSpace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). The current study analyzed asymmetry and its heritability using the first three gradients that explained the most variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Each gradient has reasonably well-described functional associations (G1: unimodal-transmodal gradient with 24.1%, G2: somatosensory-visual gradient with 18.4%, G3: multi-demand gradient with 15.1%). However, given that we extracted 10 gradients to maximize the degree of fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>).

It was applied without a scaling factor so that the reference template only matters for matching the order and direction of the gradients. The procedure rotates a matrix to maximum similarity with a target matrix minimizing the sum of squared differences. As noted, Procrustes matching was applied without a scaling factor so that only the reference template matters for matching the order and direction of the gradients. Therefore, it allows comparison between individuals and hemispheres. The individual mean gradients showed high correlation with the group gradients LL (all Spearman <italic>r</italic>&gt;0.97, <italic>P</italic> <sub>spin</sub> &lt;0.001). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref> shows the correlation between LL and RR, LR, and RL modes.

Similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coifman et al., 2005</xref>) we observed that the principal gradient (G1) traversed between unimodal regions and transmodal regions (e.g. default-mode network: DMN) whereas a visual to somatosensory gradient was found for G2.

This is a symmetric atlas containing 34 parcels per hemisphere. Overall, for the intra-hemispheric pattern G1 showed similar hemispheric patterns as observed in our main results when using the Desikan-Killiany atlas. In particular, the posterior cluster between middle and superior temporal gyrus and Broca’s area showed leftward asymmetry, whereas dorsolateral prefrontal regions showed rightward asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, we observed more details are shown in multi-modal parcellation. Similar patterns were observed in inter-hemispheric asymmetry of functional organization when using the Desikan-Killiany atlas.</p><p>We also used an additional sample (UK Biobank, UKB) to verify whether asymmetry of functional organization is present in other samples. We included 34,830 subjects’ imaging data in UKB with good quality. After computing Cohen’s d of asymmetric effects in UKB, to account for differences in sample size, we performed a group level correlation between HCP with UKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). We observed a high correlation between the LL functional gradient between HCP and UKB (Spearman <italic>r</italic> <sub>G1</sub> = -0.588, <italic>P</italic> <sub>uncorrected</sub> &lt;0.001; Spearman <italic>r</italic> <sub>G2</sub> = 0.309, <italic>P</italic> <sub>uncorrected</sub> &lt;0.001; Spearman <italic>r</italic> <sub>G3</sub> = 0.773, <italic>P</italic> <sub>uncorrected</sub> &lt;0.001). Thus, we flipped UKB LL G1 direction to make it more consistent with HCP (now <italic>r</italic> <sub>G1</sub> = 0.588, <italic>P</italic> <sub>uncorrected</sub> &lt;0.001). For the G1 of the intra-hemispheric FC pattern, we observed a correlation with our findings in the HCP sample (Pearson <italic>r</italic> <sub>intra-hemisphere</sub> = 0.592, <italic>P</italic> <sub>spin</sub> &lt;0.001; Pearson <italic>r</italic> <sub>inter-hemisphere</sub> = 0.384, <italic>P</italic> <sub>spin</sub> &lt;0.001). All the networks showed significant asymmetry in UKB. However, we found that language and default mode networks showed leftward asymmetry (as in HCP), but the frontoparietal network did not show rightward asymmetry.</p><p>Evaluating possible effects due to the parcellation scheme used, we studied differences of the mean rsfMRI connectome along the first gradient at the vertex level. We used 100 random subjects, as we had the data mapped to a symmetric template (fs_LR_32 k), which indicated that each vertex has a symmetric counterpart in the right hemisphere. Our results show left-right asymmetry being language/default mode-visual-frontoparietal vertices, which is consistent with the main results of the parcel-based approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate potential downstream effects of alignment to our results, we compared the gradient asymmetry with Procrustes alignment to the gradient without alignment. This resulted in virtually identical results for the HCP sample (<italic>r</italic> <sub>intra-hemisphere</sub> = 0.956, <italic>r</italic> <sub>inter-hemisphere</sub> = 0.843, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). At the same time, comparing unaligned and aligned gradients in the UKB sample, we found that the alignment improved the similarity to the pattern observed in HCP (aligned <italic>r</italic> <sub>intra-hemisphere</sub> = 0.592, non-aligned <italic>r</italic> <sub>intra-hemisphere</sub> = 0.487, aligned <italic>r</italic> <sub>inter-hemisphere</sub> = 0.384, non-aligned <italic>r</italic> <sub>inter-hemisphere</sub> = 0.162, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, to overcome potential normalization biases associated with creating one gradient for each hemisphere, we performed an alternative analysis to create a gradient of the left and right hemisphere together. This assumes that regions with similar connectivity profiles have comparable loading in the gradient framework. Indeed, along the principal gradient, the observed normalized asymmetric map was highly similar to the non-normalized map used in the main analyses for the intra-hemispheric (Pearson <italic>r</italic>=0.956) and inter-hemispheric (Pearson <italic>r</italic>=0.531) asymmetry patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s9">Figure 2—figure supplement 9</xref>). It is possible the difference between intra- and inter-hemispheric correspondence relates to more global differences in strength of connectivity comparing LR to RL FC, as reported also in the article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raemaekers et al., 2018</xref>) resulting in more widespread differences between inter-hemispheric patterns of both embedding procedures.</p><p>Finally, we also set the RR FC gradients as reference for our analyses, the first three of which explained 22.8, 18.8, and 15.9% of the total variance.

We assessed whether genetic factors shape such asymmetry and evaluated whether patterns of asymmetry are phylogenetically conserved between humans and non-human primates (macaques). We found that the principal gradient revealed hemispheric differences in most cortical regions, excluding the visual cortex. The language network and default-mode network showed the most leftward asymmetry while the frontoparietal network showed the most rightward asymmetry. The observed asymmetry of functional organization along the principal gradient was heritable. At the same time, regions with high asymmetry showed variable heritability. This may suggest that asymmetry in functional organization reflects both heritable and experience-dependent factors. Although the difference in left and right hemispheric functional organization was not significant along the principal functional gradient in a sample of macaques, the inter-hemispheric asymmetric pattern was comparable to the asymmetry pattern observed in humans indicating phylogenetic conservation. Notably, both the language and frontoparietal networks showed a higher leftward asymmetry in humans relative to macaques, indicating cross-species differences in asymmetry of specific transmodal functional networks. Decoding task-based functional activations along the asymmetry axis of the principal gradient, we observed that regions with a leftward preference were associated with language, autobiographical memory, and social cognition domains, whereas those with a rightward preference included cognitive control, working memory, and inhibition. In sum, our study shows the asymmetry of functional organization is, in part, heritable in humans and phylogenetically conserved in humans and macaques. At the same time, we observed that asymmetry of regions linked to higher-order cognitive functions such as language and cognitive control showed marked differences between humans and macaques and variable heritability in humans, possibly reflecting an evolutionary adaptation allowing for experience-dependent specialization.</p><p>By studying asymmetry in functional organization using a gradient approach, we have extended previous studies reporting asymmetric functional connectivity. Indeed, although the functional organization of the cerebral cortex has a largely symmetric pattern, it also shows subtle differences between hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Iturria-Medina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). For the intra-hemispheric asymmetry gradients, we found that regions belonging to the language network showed the strongest leftward preference along the principal gradient axis. This indicates that their functional connectivity profiles were more similar to the default mode, relative to their right-hemispheric counterparts. Conversely, ventral multimodal networks were closer to the transmodal apex of the principal gradient in the right hemisphere, relative to their homologues in the left hemisphere. As such, our observations suggest that key transmodal regions, part of the language and control networks, show organizational preference to either the left or right hemisphere. Anterior lateral default mode subnetworks have been shown to uniquely exhibit positive connectivity to the language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gordon et al., 2020</xref>), possibly leading to increased gradient loadings of the language network in the left hemisphere, placing them closer to the default regions along the principal gradient in the left hemisphere relative to the right. Conversely, the transmodal frontoparietal network was located at the apex of rightward preference, possibly suggesting a rightward lateralization of cortical regions associated with attention and control and ‘default’ internal cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). The observed dissociation between language and control networks is also in line with previous work suggesting an inverse pattern of language and attention between hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zago et al., 2016</xref>). Such patterns may be linked to inhibition of corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook, 1984</xref>), promoting hemispheric specialization. It has been suggested that such inter-hemispheric connections set the stage for intra-hemispheric patterns related to association fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gazzaniga, 2000</xref>). Future research may relate functional asymmetry directly to asymmetry in underlying structure to uncover how different white-matter tracts contribute to asymmetry of functional organization.</p><p>We furthermore investigated whether such individual variations in asymmetry of functional organization could be attributed to genetic factors. To do so, we performed heritability analysis enabled by the twin design of the Human Connectome Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work indicated that brain structure including cortical thickness, surface area, and white matter connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>), as well as functional connectome organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colclough et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ge et al., 2017</xref>) are heritable. Our twin-based heritability analyses revealed heritable asymmetry of the principal functional gradient in the entire cortex, excluding visual cortex. At the same time, studying the association between heritability and asymmetry patterns we observed mixed results. Although we observed that the language-related area PSL showed the highest heritability, the highly asymmetric area 44 (Broca’s area) showed the lowest heritability. This may reflect a differential (dorsal and ventral) pathway of language development in the frontal and temporal lobe, where the dorsal pathway to the inferior frontal gyrus matures at later stages in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brauer et al., 2013</xref>). For example, previous work found that temporal language areas showed high heritability of cortical thickness asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sha et al., 2021</xref>) and white matter connection asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2021</xref>) but frontal language areas did not. Such posterior-anterior differences may be due to developmental factors or axes of stability versus plasticity in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Cabezas et al., 2017</xref>). A case study of an individual born without a left temporal lobe found that frontal language areas in the left hemisphere did not emerge in the absence of temporal language areas in the left hemisphere, and that language functions instead relied on the right hemispheric functional network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tuckute et al., 2022</xref>). It is thus possible that Broca’s area may mature after more posterior language regions in hierarchical fashion, which may be related to decreasing heritability in frontal language areas (i.e. more influenced by developmental and/or environmental factors). Recent work suggests that asymmetric patterning of brain structure and function are largely determined prenatally and unaffected by preterm birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Williams et al., 2021</xref>). In neonates, asymmetric patterns were largely observed in primary and unimodal areas, whereas association regions were largely symmetric. Thus, asymmetry in association regions may be more experience-dependent. One focus of future work could thus be to evaluate the development of asymmetry in functional organization. Moreover, by means of GWAS approaches, it may also be possible to get more insight in specific genes and associated processes involved in functional asymmetry.</p><p>Evaluating the correspondence of asymmetry of functional organization between humans and macaques, by aligning the human gradients to the macaque gradient space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2020</xref>), we observed a similarity between asymmetry of the principal gradient in both species in case of intra-hemispheric connectivity. This indicates functional asymmetry of within-hemispheric connectivity may be conserved across primates. At the same time, we found that language, default mode, and frontoparietal networks showed qualitatively more asymmetry in humans (human &gt;macaque). These findings may support the notion that though asymmetry is a phenomenon existent across different primates, regions involved in higher order cognitive functions in humans are particularly asymmetric. Previous work studying asymmetry in white matter structure in primates found that humans showed more leftward arcuate fasciculus volume and surface relative to macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eichert et al., 2019</xref>). The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract implicated in language functions by connecting Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geschwind, 1970</xref>). Moreover, by comparing humans, macaques, and chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eichert et al., 2020</xref>), evolutionary modifications to this tract in humans relative to other primates have been reported, possibly derived from auditory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balezeau et al., 2020</xref>). At the same time, other structural studies have also observed leftward asymmetry of language areas in chimpanzees, indicating that asymmetry of language-regions per se may not be a human-specific feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spocter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>). Fittingly, there are no significant differences of thickness and area asymmetry between humans and chimpanzees in superior temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>). Studying the endocranial shape of humans and non-human primates, temporal and occipital cortices showed local differences in asymmetry across species, and much more variability in humans relative to non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neubauer et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests that whereas brain asymmetry is a phenomenon observed throughout mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assaf et al., 2020</xref>), specific nuances may relate to species-specific behavioral and cognitive differences. Future research could assess asymmetry of brain organization in other primates, and relate observed differences in functional organization to those in white matter structure.</p><p>Although overall intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity showed a strong spatial overlap in humans, we also observed various differences between the metrics across our analysis. For example, although we found both intra- and inter-hemispheric differences in gradient organization to be heritable, only for the former was a correspondence between the degree of asymmetry and heritability found. Similarly, comparing human and macaques, we only observed conservation of spatial patterning of asymmetry was conserved for intra-hemispheric connections. Whereas intra-hemispheric asymmetry relates to association fibers, commissural fibers underlie inter-hemispheric connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2016</xref>). It has been suggested that there is a trade-off within and across mammals of inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity patterns to conserve the balance between gray and white-matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assaf et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, differences in asymmetry of both ipsi- and contralateral functional connections may be reflective of adjustments in this balance within and across species. Secondly, previous research studying intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity and associated asymmetry, has indicated a developmental trajectory from inter- to intra-hemispheric organization of functional brain connectivity, varying from unimodal to transmodal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friederici et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szaflarski et al., 2006</xref>). It is thus possible that a reduced correspondence of asymmetry and heritability in humans, as well as lack of spatial similarities between humans and macaques for inter-hemispheric connectivity may be due to the age of both samples (young adults in humans, adolescents in macaques). Further research could study inter- and intra-hemispheric asymmetry in functional organization as a function of development in both species, to further disentangle heritability and cross-species conservation and adaptation.</p><p>The functional relevance of asymmetry along the sensory-transmodal axis was evaluated in the human brain by projecting meta-analytical task-based coactivations along asymmetric effects of the functional principal gradient. In line with our expectations based on the distribution of asymmetry within functional networks, we found that task-based activations associated with language processing leaned leftward while task-based activations associated with executive functions leaned rightward, specifically in the intra-hemispheric pattern. This suggests that lateralized functions supported by the brain’s asymmetry have functional relevance (especially higher order cognitive functions such as language and executive control). Indeed, related work has shown a direct link between asymmetry and semantic and visual recognition skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that asymmetry of individuals relates to variation in behavioral performance in these domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gonzalez Alam et al., 2019</xref>). Our observation of asymmetry of language versus executive functions may also be in line with notions of differential axes of asymmetry, dissociating symbolic/language, emotion, perception/action, and decision functional axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Karolis et al., 2019</xref>). The asymmetry of principal functional gradient in humans and macaques showed a divergence along these axes, possibly indicating cross-species variability within the lateralization archetypes in primates. Notably, left hemispheric language lateralization is enabled throughout language development while right hemispheric language activation declines systematically with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Olulade et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, future research may focus on studying how the lateralization of human behavior is shaped by development and aging and how this may impact function and behavior.</p><p>Although we showed asymmetry in functional organization, there are various technical and methodological aspects to be considered. In the current work, we used the MMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) for surface-based human fMRI data. A previous study used the atlas of intrinsic connectivity of homotopic areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>) (AICHA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/aicha">https://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/aicha</ext-link>) for voxel-based fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). In line with the results of that study, we found similar intra-hemispheric differences in functional gradients. Extending that work we additionally used the DK atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>), which is often used in structural asymmetry studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Postema et al., 2019</xref>). We again found asymmetric patterns, with a rightward dorsal frontal lobe and leftward posterior superior temporal lobe. The other temporal regions, having leftward or rightward asymmetry using MMP, showed no or less asymmetry using the DK atlas. Possibly, such subtle differences are not captured by the DK atlas, with only 34 cortical parcels per hemisphere. Evaluating the consistency of functional asymmetry across different datasets, we found that HCP (n=1014) and UKB (n=34,604) showed consistent leftward asymmetric functional organization in the language and default mode networks but no consistent rightward asymmetry of the frontoparietal network. Such differences may be due to technical differences between the datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xifra-Porxas et al., 2021</xref>). However, it may also reflect sample specific differences in asymmetry. Indeed, whereas the HCP sample consists of young-adults with an age-range of 22–37 years, the UKB has a comparatively older and wider age range (from 40 to more than 70 years). Thus, it is possible the observed differences in the frontoparietal network are directly related to age-related asymmetry effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Olulade et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the small sample size of macaques, it is important to be careful when interpreting our observations regarding the associated asymmetry, and its relation to patterns observed in humans. Therefore, further study is needed to evaluate the asymmetry patterns in macaques using large datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Milham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Messinger et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, we investigated the genetic and phylogenetic basis of asymmetry of large-scale functional organization. We observed that the principal (unimodal-transmodal) gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>) is asymmetric, with regions involved in language showing leftward organization and regions associated with executive function showing rightward organization. This asymmetry was heritable and, in the case of organization of intra-hemispheric connectivity, showed spatial correspondence between humans and macaques. At the same time, functional asymmetry was more pronounced in language networks in humans relative to macaques, suggesting adaptation. The current framework may be expanded by future research investigating the development and phylogeny of functional asymmetry as well as its neuroanatomical basis in healthy and clinical samples. This may provide important insights in individual-level brain asymmetry and its relation to human cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The current research complies with all relevant ethical regulations as set by The Independent Research Ethics Committee at the Medical Faculty of the Heinrich-Heine-University of Duesseldorf (study number 2018–317).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Humans</title><p>For the analyses in humans, we used the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 data release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>).

Cortical time series were averaged within a previously established multi-modal parcellation schemes: for humans the 360-parcel Glasser atlas (180 per hemisphere) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>) and the 182-parcel Markov atlas (91 per hemisphere) for macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Markov et al., 2014</xref>). To compute the functional connectivity (FC), time-series of cortical parcels were correlated pairwise using the Pearson product moment and then Fisher’s z-transformed in human and macaque data, separately. Individual FC maps were also averaged across four different rs-fMRI sessions for humans ([LR1], [LR2], [RL1], and [RL2]). We computed the FC in four different patterns, both for human and macaque data: FC within the left and right hemispheres (LL intra-hemisphere, RR intra-hemisphere), from the left to right hemisphere (LR inter-hemisphere) and from the right to left hemisphere (RL, inter-hemisphere).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Connectivity gradients</title><p>Next we employed the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>) to generate the group level gradients of the mean LL FC across individuals. We then set the group-level gradients as the template and aligned each individual gradient with Procrustes rotation to the template. Finally, the comparative individual functional gradients of each FC pattern were assessed. All steps were accomplished in the Python package Brainspace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). In brief, the algorithm estimates a low-dimensional embedding from a high-dimensional affinity matrix. Along these low-dimensional axes, or gradients, cortical nodes that are strongly interconnected, by either many suprathreshold edges or few very strong edges, are closer together. Nodes with little connectivity similarly are farther apart. Regions having similar connectivity profiles are embedded together along the gradient axis. The name of this approach, which belongs to the family of graph Laplacians, is derived from the equivalence of the Euclidean distance between points in the diffusion embedded mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coifman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). It is controlled by a single parameter α, which controls the influence of the density of sampling points on the manifold (<italic>α</italic>=0, maximal influence; <italic>α</italic>=1, no influence). On the basis of the previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>), we followed recommendations and set <italic>α</italic>=0.5, a choice that retains the global relations between data points in the embedded space and has been suggested to be relatively robust to noise in the covariance matrix.</p><p>The input of the analysis was the FC matrix, which was cut off at 90% similar to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). The current study selected the first three FC LL gradients (G1, G2, and G3) that explained 24.1, 18.4, and 15.1% of total variance in humans, as well as 18.9, 15.2, and 12.8% of total variance in macaques.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Asymmetry index</title><p>To quantify the left and right hemisphere differences, we chose left-right as the asymmetry index (AI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Raemaekers et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we also calculated the normalized AI with the following formula, (left-right)/(left +right), which is usually used in structural studies to verify whether there is a difference between unnormalized AI and normalized AI. For the intra-hemispheric pattern, the AI was calculated using LL-RR. A positive AI-score meant that the hemispheric feature dominated leftwards, while a negative AI-score dominated rightwards. For the inter-hemispheric pattern we used LR-RL to calculate the AI. Notably, we added ‘minus’ to the AI scores or Cohen’s d scores in the figures in order to conveniently view the lateralization direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Heritability analysis</title><p>To map the heritability of functional gradient asymmetry in humans, we used the Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR, v8.5.1b) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almasy and Blangero, 1998</xref>). In brief, heritability indicates the impact of genetic relatedness on a phenotype of interest. SOLAR uses maximum likelihood variance decomposition methods to determine the relative importance of familial and environmental influences on a phenotype by modeling the covariance among family members as a function of genetic proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Valk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almasy and Blangero, 1998</xref>). Heritability (i.e. narrow-sense heritability <italic>h<sup>2</sup></italic>) represents the proportion of the phenotypic variance (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>) accounted for by the total additive genetic variance (σ<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub>), that is <italic>h<sup>2</sup></italic> = σ<sup>2</sup><sub>g</sub> / σ<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub>. Phenotypes exhibiting stronger covariances between genetically more similar individuals than between genetically less similar individuals have higher heritability. In this study, we quantified the heritability of asymmetry of functional gradients. We added covariates to our models including age, sex, age<sup>2</sup>, and age ×sex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Alignment of humans to macaques</title><p>To phylogenetically map the asymmetry of functional gradients across macaques and humans, we transformed the human gradients to macaque cortex surface based on a functional joint alignment technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). This method leverages advances in representing functional organization in high-dimensional common space and provides a transformation between human and macaque cortices, also previously used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Valk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Valk et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we aligned Cohen’s d of the human asymmetry index to the macaque surface. Cohens’ d explains the effect size of the asymmetry index. Following the joint alignment, we further computed the Spearman correlation between macaques and humans to evaluate the similarity in asymmetric patterns of the functional gradients. Finally, we compared Cohen’s d between macaques and humans and summarized the results with Markov parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Markov et al., 2014</xref>). To illustrate our findings at the functional network level, we projected human networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ji et al., 2019</xref>) on the macaque surface.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>NeuroSynth meta-analysis</title><p>To evaluate the association of function decoding and asymmetry of the principal gradient, we projected the meta-analytical task-based activation along the normalized asymmetry (Cohen’s d) of G1. Our choice for the 24 cognitive domain terms were consistent with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). The activation database we used for meta-analyses was the Neurosynth V3 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yarkoni et al., 2011</xref>). The surface-based V3 database is available in the github depository (data availability). In the present study, to look at how the right hemisphere and left hemisphere decode functions separately, the leftward normalized asymmetry was put on and the rightward normalized asymmetry was put on the right hemisphere. Other regions became zero. We generated 20 bins along the normalized asymmetry averagely (5% per bin). Thus, each function term had a mean activation z-score per bin. To assess how much the function term was leftward or rightward lateralized, we calculated a weighted score by mean activation (where activation z-score greater than 0.5) multiplied by normalized asymmetry. We roughly regarded this score as the lateralization level. The order of the function terms generated by this calculation reflected the left-right lateralization dominance axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data availability</title><p>All human data analyzed in this manuscript were obtained from the open-access HCP young adult sample (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/">https://www.humanconnectome.org/</ext-link>), UK Biobank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/">https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Saad Jbabdi as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>There are two important points to address in your revisions:</p><p>1) The theoretical point raised by reviewer 1 regarding interpretation of localised changes in the embedding space. This seems to be a fundamental limitation of the method.</p><p>2) The point raised by reviewer 2 about insight gained by this study.<italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is very well written, the question is interesting, and the analyses are innovative. However, I do have concerns about the overall approach. My main concern is about looking at asymmetries in the low dimensional representation of connectivity. A secondary concern has to do with looking at the parcellated connectome. I explain these concerns in succession below.</p><p>The first concern is to me quite a fundamental issue: looking at connectivity in a low dimensional space, that of the laplacian eigenvectors. There are two issues with this. The first one, which is less important than the second, is that the authors have a reference embedding to which they align other embeddings using a procrustes method with no scaling. While the 3D embedding is still optimally representing the connectivity (because distances don't change under rotations), we can no longer look at one axis at a time, which is what the authors do when they look at G1. In this case, G1 is representative of the connectivity of the reference matrix (LL), but not the others.</p><p>But even if the authors only projected their matrices onto a single G1 dimension with no procrustes (and only sign flipping if necessary), there is still a major issue. One implicit assumption of this whole approach is that if there is a change in connectivity somewhere in the original matrix, the same &quot;nodes&quot; of the matrix will change in the embedding. This is not the case. Any change in the original matrix, even if it is a single edge, will affect the positions of all the nodes in the embedding. That is because the embedding optimises a global loss function, not a local one.</p><p>To make this point clear, consider the following toy example. Say we have 4 brain regions A,B,C,D. Let us say that we have the following connectivity:</p><p>In the Left Hemisphere: A-B-C-D</p><p>In the Right Hemisphere: A-B=C-D</p><p>So the connection between B and C is twice as strong in the right hemi, and everything else remains the same.</p><p>The low dimensional embedding of both will look like this:</p><p>Left:</p><p>… A … B ……. C … D …</p><p>Right</p><p>A… … … B … C … … … D</p><p>Note how B,C are closer to each other in the RIGHT, but also that A,D have moved away from each other because the eigenvector has to have norm 1.</p><p>So if we were to calculate an asymmetry index, we would say that:</p><p>A is higher on the LEFT</p><p>B is higher on the RIGHT</p><p>C is higher on the LEFT</p><p>D is higher on the RIGHT</p><p>So we have found asymmetry in all of our regions. But in fact the only thing that has changed is the connection between B and C.</p><p>This illustrates the danger of using a global optimisation procedure (like low-dim embedding) to analyse and interpret local changes. One has to be very careful.</p><p>My second concern is about interpreting the brain asymmetry as differences in connectivity, as opposed to differences in other things like regional size. The authors use a parcellated approach, where presumably the parcels are left-right symmetric. If one area is actually larger in one hemisphere than in the other, the will manifest itself in the connectivity values. To mitigate this, it may be necessary to align the two hemispheres to each other (maybe using spherical registration) using connectivity prior to applying the parcellation.</p><p>Figure 1. Please explain what &quot;explained variance&quot; means. The gradients represent a low dimensional version of the connectivity matrix. they are not explaining variance?<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Using recently-developed functional gradient techniques, this study explored human brain hemispheric asymmetry. The functional gradient is a hot technique in recent years and has been applied to study brain asymmetries in two papers of 2021. Compared to previous studies, the current study further evaluated the degree of genetic control (heritability) and evolutionary conservation for such gradient asymmetries by using human twin data and monkey's fMRI data. These investigations are of value and do provide interesting data. However, it suffers from a lack of specific hypotheses/questions/motivations underlying all kinds of analyses, and the rich observational or correlational results seem not to offer significant improvement of theoretical understanding about brain asymmetries or functional gradient. In addition, given the limited number of twins in HCP project (for a heritability estimation), the limited number of monkeys (20 monkeys), and the relatively poor quality of monkeys' resting functional MRI data, the results and conclusion should be taken cautiously. Below are the concerns and suggestions.</p><p>The gradient from resting-state functional connectome has been frequently used but mainly at the group level. The current study essentially applied the gradient comparison (i.e., gradient score) at the individual level. Biological interpretation for individual gradient score at the parcel level as well as its comparability between individuals and between hemispheres should be resolved. This is the fundamental rationale underlying the whole analyses.</p><p>Only the first three gradients are used but why? What about the fourth gradient? Specific theoretical interpretation is needed. At the individual level, is it ensured that the first gradients of all individuals correspond to each other? In this study, it is unclear whether we should or should not care about the G2 and G3. The results of G2 and G3 showed up randomly to some degree.</p><p>The intra-hemispheric gradient is institutive. However, it is hard to understand what the inter-hemispheric gradient means. From the data perspective, yes you can do such gradient comparison between the LR and RL connectome but what does this mean? Why should we care about such asymmetry? From the introduction to the discussion, the authors simply showed the data of inter-hemispheric gradients without useful explanation. This issue should be solved.</p><p>When aligning intra-hemispheric gradient, choosing averaged LL mode as the reference may introduce systematic bias towards left hemisphere. Such an issue also applies to LR-RL gradient alignment as well as cross-species gradient alignment. This methodological issue should be solved.</p><p>The sample size of monkey (i.e., 20) is far less than human subjects (&gt; 1000). Such limitation raises severe concern on the validity of the currently observed gradient asymmetry pattern in the monkey group, as well as the similarity results with human gradient asymmetry pattern. Despite the marginal significance of G1 inter-hemisphere gradient between humans and monkeys, I feel overall there is no convincingly meaningful similarity between these two species. However, the authors' discussion and conclusion are largely based on strong inter-species similarity in such asymmetry. The conclusion of evolutionary conservation for gradient asymmetry, therefore, is not well supported by the results.</p><p>For human gradient asymmetry, only t values were provided; For monkey gradient asymmetry, only Cohen-d values were provided. These two should be provided for both species.</p><p>Figure 3b, it is hard to believe that such a scatter plot can reach a significant correlation of R&gt;0.3. In addition, such a scatter plot does not match the text (i.e., correlation between the &quot;absolute&quot; AI and heritability)</p><p>Figure S3, why should we care about these cross-gradient correlations?</p><p>More detailed description for fMRI post-processing for functional connectome and gradient analyses could be added in the supplementary information.</p><p>DK atlas is not a good validation parcellation for a functional MRI study like this.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Heritability and cross-species comparisons of asymmetry of human cortical functional organization&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Thanks for your replies to my comments, and sorry for the delay in getting this response to you.</p><p>Regarding my first comment, i.e. interpretation of a change in position along the gradients: I am not sure I understand your reply. You agreed that it is difficult to interpret these changes, given that they can represent changes occurring outside the region where the change is reported, but then the analysis you have done does not address this concern. Instead, you calculated some other measure (which I am not sure what it is as it is not well described) and reported the asymmetry index using this new measure. If this new measure is more interpretable, then why do you need to use gradients? What information from the gradients is useful for the study of asymmetries? And how can we interpret changes in positions along the gradients? Simply saying that &quot;interpretation for asymmetry of areas is under a global context&quot; seems to me like sweeping the issue under the rug.</p><p>Regarding the issue of using the Procrustes to the template and how that makes the gradients a worse representation of connectivity for the non-template matrices: I don't understand the reply here either. What is meant by joint alignment and how exactly does this address my concern?</p><p>If I may add a couple of additional points:</p><p>– I said in my original review that this was a well-written paper, but it looks like the writing has gotten worse in this revised paper. I am not sure why that is, but I really invite the authors to re-read the paper, particularly the new sections/paragraphs, and ensure that the arguments make sense (and I don't just mean the English).</p><p>– Some of the captions are way too short. They are often comprised of just a few words, which is ok for a caption &quot;title&quot;, but not for a caption. A caption needs to explain what is shown avoiding reference to the main text.</p><p>– The code provided is poorly organised and not documented. I encourage the authors to improve on that.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77215.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper is very well written, the question is interesting, and the analyses are innovative.

We agree that low-dimensional embeddings describe global embedding of local features, rather than local phenomena. Moreover, we indeed assume that the connectivity embedding of a given node gives us information about its position along ‘gradients’ relative to other nodes and their respective embedding. Thus, indeed, when a single node (node X) has a different connectivity profile in the right hemisphere relative to the left, this will also have some impact on the embeddings of all nodes showing a relevant (i.e., top 10%) connection to node X.</p><p>To evaluate whether asymmetry could be observed in average connectivity within functional networks, an alternative approach to measure asymmetry was taken by computing average connectivity within different functional networks. Following we compared the within-network connectivity between left and right. We have now added this conceptual analysis to our results robustness analysis section. In short, we observed that transmodal networks (DMN, FPN, and language network) showed higher connectivity in the left hemisphere but other networks showed higher connectivity in the right hemisphere. Thus, this indicates that observations made with respect to asymmetry of functional gradients are similar to those observed for within-network functional asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. We have now detailed the outcome of this analysis in our Result section and Supplementary Materials.</p><p>Results, p.14.:</p><p>“As low-dimensional embedding is a global approach to summarize functional connectivity we reiterated our analysis by evaluating asymmetry of within network functional connectivity in the current sample. Observations made with respect to asymmetry of functional gradients are similar to those observed for within-network functional asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres.”</p><p>“To further explore functional connectivity asymmetry between left and right hemispheres, we calculated the LL within network FC and RR within network FC (Figure 2—figure supplement 5). It showed that connections in the left hemisphere and right hemisphere were relatively equal in the global scale. However, for the local differences, networks showed significant subtle leftward or rightward asymmetry (vis1: t = -5.203, P &lt; 0.001; vis2: t = -22.593, P &lt; 0.001; SMN: t = -8.262, P &lt; 0.001; CON: t = -32.715, P &lt; 0.001; DAN: t = -11.272, P &lt; 0.001; Lan.: t = 33.827, P &lt; 0.001; FPN: t = 24.439, P &lt; 0.001; Aud.: t = 0.191, P = 0.849; DMN: t = 11.303, P &lt; 0.001; PMN: t = -35.719, P &lt; 0.001; VMN: t = -11.056, P &lt; 0.001; OAN: t = 0.311, P = 0.756).”</p><p>Irrespectively, we have further highlighted that such a global interpretation for asymmetry of areas is still meaningful, given that a node is always placed in a global context. We have now further explained that our metrics give insights in local embedding of global phenomena in the introduction, p. 3.</p><p>Introduction, p. 3:</p><p>“These low-dimensional gradient embeddings describe global embedding of local features, rather than local phenomena. Thus, interpretation for asymmetry of areas is under a global context.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My second concern is about interpreting the brain asymmetry as differences in connectivity, as opposed to differences in other things like regional size. The authors use a parcellated approach, where presumably the parcels are left-right symmetric. If one area is actually larger in one hemisphere than in the other, the will manifest itself in the connectivity values. To mitigate this, it may be necessary to align the two hemispheres to each other (maybe using spherical registration) using connectivity prior to applying the parcellation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this nice idea. We have now computed the differences of the mean rsfMRI connectome along the first gradient at the vertex level using 100 random subjects, as we have the data mapped to a symmetric template (fs_LR_32k), indicating that each vertex has a symmetric counterpart in the right hemisphere. Our results show left-right asymmetry as language/default mode-visual-frontoparietal vertices, which is consistent with the main results of the parcel-based approach. We have also added this response to the Supplementary materials.</p><p>Though overall findings are consistent, spherical registration may also have new issues. Total anatomical spatial symmetry may not provide functional comparability at the vertex level between left and right hemisphere. For example, during language tasks in the current sample, the activated frontal region in the left hemisphere is larger than the activated contralateral region in the right hemisphere. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate asymmetry between functionally and structurally homologous regions, as described by the Glasser atlas. In case of the resting state fMRI data, we used the region-wise symmetric multimodal parcellation (Glasser et al., 2016). This parcellation ensures the functional contralateral regions in both hemispheres. A previous study (Williams et al., 2021) investigated the structural and functional asymmetry in newborn infants. They used spherical registration (make fs_LR symmetric) for structural asymmetry but not for functional asymmetry. As such spheric registration may hide functional information, we think spherical registration may be more suitable for structural studies.</p><p>To address the concern regarding the alignment of hemispheres, we used joint alignment for LL and RR to compare the results between this and the Procrustes alignment technique (Pearson r=0.930, P_spin&lt;0.001), Figure2—figure supplement 7 is the figure of asymmetry along the principal gradient (upper: joint alignment, below: Procrustes alignment) indicating convergence between both approaches. We have reported this information in the Supplementary Materials.</p><p>Lastly, we do agree that parcel size might be an important issue influencing the asymmetry pattern. To test for such an effect, we performed the correlation between the rank of parcel size (left-right)/(left+right) and rank of asymmetry index. It suggests only a small insignificant correlation along G1 (Spearman r_intra=0.130, P_spin=0.105; Spearman r_inter=0.130, P_spin=0.084). Of note, there is a systematic difference in parcel size as a function of sensory-association hierarchy, indicating that the link between parcel-size and asymmetry may vary as a function of sensory vs associative regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1.

Though gradients from resting-state functional connectivity have been frequently used at the group level, various studies have also studied individual differences. For example, using linear mixed models to compare gradient scores between left and right across subjects (Liang et al., 2021), applying the individual gradient scores to compare disease and controls (Dong et al., 2020, 2021; Hong et al., 2019; Park et al., 2021), and link individual hippocampal gradients to memory recollection (Przeździk et al., 2019). Together, these studies show individual variations of local gradients, indicating changes in node centrality and hubness (Hong et al., 2019), and connectivity profile distance (Y. Wang et al., 2021). Of note, low-dimensional embeddings describe global embedding of local features, rather than local phenomena. Thus, interpretation for asymmetry of areas is under a global context. The biological interpretation for individual gradients would be to what degree the system segregated and integrated has changed patterns of ongoing neural activity (Mckeown et al., 2020). It reflects that individuals have different functional boundaries between anatomical regions. Whereas individual neurons are embedded under the global-local boundaries through a cortical wiring space consisting of intricate long- and short-range white matter fibers (Paquola et al., 2020).</p><p>Introduction, p. 4:</p><p>“We applied the individual gradient scores to study the asymmetry, consistent with prior studies (Gonzalez Alam et al., 2021; Liang et al., 2021).

Therefore, it allows comparison between individuals and hemispheres.

What about the fourth gradient? Specific theoretical interpretation is needed. At the individual level, is it ensured that the first gradients of all individuals correspond to each other? In this study, it is unclear whether we should or should not care about the G2 and G3. The results of G2 and G3 showed up randomly to some degree.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study we focused on the principal gradient in the main analysis, given its association with sensory-transmodal hierarchy, microstructure, and evolutionary alterations (Margulies et al., 2016; Paquola et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020).</p><p>Conversely, gradient 2 reflects the dissociation between visual and sensory-motor networks and gradient 3 is linked to task-positive, control, versus ‘default’ and sensory-motor regions. We analyzed asymmetry and its heritability of the first three gradients (explaining respectively 23.3%, 18.1%, and 15.0% of the variance of the rsFC matrix). However, we extracted the first ten gradients to maximize the degree of fit (Margulies et al., 2016; Mckeown et al., 2020). We have now also shown G4-10 mean asymmetry results as a supplementary figure. To ensure correspondence of gradients across individuals, we aligned the individual gradients to the group level template with Procrustes rotation. Procrustes rotation rotates a matrix to maximum similarity with a target matrix minimizing sum of squared differences. The approach is typically used in comparison of ordination results and is particularly useful in comparing alternative solutions in multidimensional scaling.

However, it is hard to understand what the inter-hemispheric gradient means. From the data perspective, yes you can do such gradient comparison between the LR and RL connectome but what does this mean? Why should we care about such asymmetry? From the introduction to the discussion, the authors simply showed the data of inter-hemispheric gradients without useful explanation. This issue should be solved.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to further clarify. The LR and RL connectivity reflects cross-hemispheric functional signal interaction via corpus callosum, whose structural asymmetry is usually studied (Karolis et al., 2019). Such intra-hemispheric connections, compared to the inter-hemispheric connections, have been suggested to reflect the inhibition of corpus callosum, and underlie hemispheric specialization. Different information relies on hemispheric specialization (e.g., visual, motor, and crude information) and/or inter-hemispheric information transfer (e.g., language, reasoning, and attention) (Gazzaniga, 2000). To clarify and motivate the analysis of both intra- and inter-hemispheric asymmetry in functional gradients, we have now added further detail in the introduction, p. 5.</p><p>Here is text:</p><p>Introduction, p. 4.</p><p>“The full FC matrix contains both intra-hemispheric and inter-hemispheric connections. Intra-hemispheric connections, compared to the inter-hemispheric connections, have been suggested to reflect the inhibition of corpus callosum and may underlie hemispheric specializations involving language, reasoning, and attention. Conversely, inter-hemispheric connectivity may reflect information transfer between hemispheres, for example a wide range of modal and motor information, and crude information concerning spatial locations <sup>48</sup>. Previous studies have reported intra-hemispheric FC to study gradient asymmetry <sup>6,38</sup>. By having the callosum related to association white matter fibers, one hemisphere could develop for new functions while the other hemisphere could continue to perform the previous functions for both hemispheres <sup>48</sup>. Therefore, in addition to the intra-hemispheric FC gradients, we depicted the inter-hemispheric FC, which is abnormal in patients with schizophrenia <sup>23,49</sup> and autism <sup>24</sup>.”</p><p>as well as Discussion, p. 16</p><p>“Conversely, the transmodal frontoparietal network was located at the apex of rightward preference, possibly suggesting a right-ward lateralization of cortical regions associated with attention and control and ‘default’ internal cognition <sup>62,63</sup>. The observed dissociation between language and control networks is also in line with previous work suggesting an inverse pattern of language and attention between hemispheres <sup>3,64</sup>. Such patterns may be linked to inhibition of corpus callosum <sup>65</sup>, promoting hemispheric specialization. It has been suggested that such inter-hemispheric connections set the stage for intra-hemispheric patterns related to association fibers <sup>48</sup>. Future research may relate functional asymmetry directly to asymmetry in underlying structure to uncover how different white-matter tracts contribute to asymmetry of functional organization.”</p><p>and Discussion, p.18</p><p>“Though overall intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity showed a strong spatial overlap in humans, we also observed marked differences between both metrics across our analysis. For example, although we found both intra- and inter-hemispheric differences in gradient organization to be heritable, only for intra-hemispheric asymmetry we found a correspondence between degree of asymmetry and degree of heritability. Similarly comparing asymmetry observed in human data to functional gradient asymmetry in macaques, we only observed spatial patterning of asymmetry was conserved for intra-hemispheric connections. Whereas intra-hemispheric asymmetry relates to association fibers, commissural fibers underlie inter-hemispheric connections <sup>77</sup> It has been suggested that there is a trade-off within and across mammals of inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity patterns to conserve the balance between grey and white-matter <sup>76</sup>. Consequently, differences in asymmetry of both ipsi- and contralateral functional connections may be reflective of adjustments in this balance within and across species. Secondly, previous research studying intra- and inter-hemispheric connectivity and associated asymmetry has indicated a developmental trajectory from inter- to intra-hemispheric organization of brain functional connectivity, varying from unimodal to transmodal areas <sup>78,79</sup>. It is thus possible that a reduced correspondence of asymmetry and heritability in humans, as well as lack of spatial similarities between humans and macaques for inter-hemispheric connectivity may be due to the age of both samples (young adults in humans, adolescents in macaques). Further research may study inter- and intra-hemispheric asymmetry in functional organization as a function of development in both species to further disentangle heritability and cross-species conservation and adaptation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When aligning intra-hemispheric gradient, choosing averaged LL mode as the reference may introduce systematic bias towards left hemisphere.

Such limitation raises severe concern on the validity of the currently observed gradient asymmetry pattern in the monkey group, as well as the similarity results with human gradient asymmetry pattern. Despite the marginal significance of G1 inter-hemisphere gradient between humans and monkeys, I feel overall there is no convincingly meaningful similarity between these two species. However, the authors' discussion and conclusion are largely based on strong inter-species similarity in such asymmetry. The conclusion of evolutionary conservation for gradient asymmetry, therefore, is not well supported by the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with your comments.

Cortical time series were averaged within a previously established multi-modal parcellation schemes: for humans the 360-parcel Glasser atlas (180 per hemisphere) <sup>54</sup> and the 182-parcel Markov atlas (91 per hemisphere) for macaques <sup>56</sup>. To compute the functional connectivity (FC), time-series of cortical parcels were correlated pairwise using the Pearson product moment and then Fisher’s z-transformed in human and macaque data, separately. Individual FC maps were also averaged across four different rs-fMRI sessions for humans ([LR1], [LR2], [RL1], and [RL2]). We computed the FC in four different patterns, both for human and macaque data: FC within the left and right hemispheres (LL intra-hemisphere, RR intra-hemisphere), from the left to right hemisphere (LR inter-hemisphere) and from the right to left hemisphere (RL, inter-hemisphere).”</p><p>Connectivity gradients, p.21:</p><p>“Next we employed the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique <sup>26</sup> to generate the group level gradients of the mean LL FC across individuals.

In brief, the algorithm estimates a low-dimensional embedding from a high-dimensional affinity matrix. Along these low-dimensional axes, or gradients, cortical nodes that are strongly interconnected, by either many suprathreshold edges or few very strong edges, are closer together. Nodes with little connectivity similarly are farther apart. Regions having similar connectivity profiles are embedded together along the gradient axis. The name of this approach, which belongs to the family of graph Laplacians, is derived from the equivalence of the Euclidean distance between points in the diffusion embedded mapping <sup>25–27</sup>. It is controlled by a single parameter α, which controls the influence of the density of sampling points on the manifold (α = 0, maximal influence; α = 1, no influence).

Please find our revised response to the original question below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Q1.1_Rv1: The first concern is to me quite a fundamental issue: looking at connectivity in a low dimensional space, that of the laplacian eigenvectors. There are two issues with this. The first one, which is less important than the second, is that the authors have a reference embedding to which they align other embeddings using a procrustes method with no scaling. While the 3D embedding is still optimally representing the connectivity (because distances don't change under rotations), we can no longer look at one axis at a time, which is what the authors do when they look at G1. In this case, G1 is representative of the connectivity of the reference matrix (LL), but not the others. But even if the authors only projected their matrices onto a single G1 dimension with no procrustes ( and only sign flipping if necessary) […]</p></disp-quote><p>We now project the matrices in a single G1 dimension without Procrustes alignment, and with flipped signs where needed, as suggested by the Reviewer. Comparing the gradient asymmetry with Procrustes alignment to the gradient without alignment resulted in virtually identical results for the HCP sample ( r <sub>intra-hemisphere</sub> = 0.956 , r <sub>inter-hemisphere</sub> = 0.843). At the same time, comparing unaligned and aligned gradients in the UK Biobank sample, we find that the alignment improves the similarity to the pattern observed in HCP (aligned r <sub>intra-hemisphere</sub> = 0.592 , non-aligned r <sub>intra-hemisphere</sub> = 0.487, aligned r <sub>inter-hemisphere</sub> = 0.384, non-aligned r <sub>inter-hemisphere</sub> = 0.162). We agree with the Reviewer that the Procrustes alignment procedure may create somewhat of a mixture between two vectors. However, we consider the impact of this operation minor and that in general Procrustus alignment comes with important benefits, namely to be able to make comparisons of multiple vectors across participants and samples. For example, using Procrustes alignment has been shown to have beneficial effects on the reproducibility and stability of gradients across techniques, parameters and individuals (Hong et al., 2020).</p><p>We now include an explicit comparison of Procrustes and non-aligned gradients in our supplemental materials, p. 15.</p><p>“To evaluate potential downstream effects of alignment to our results, we compared the gradient asymmetry with Procrustes alignment to the gradient without alignment.

One has to be very careful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this extensive and thorough comment. To overcome potential differences in normalization of eigenvectors that may occur when computing LL_RR and LR_RL gradients separately we computed the gradient of LL_RR and LR_RL in the same model, under the assumption that if the homologous regions in the left and right hemisphere would have the same connectivity, they would have the same gradient loading. However, if their connectivity pattern is different, they would have a different loading yet differences would be normalized equally for LL_RR and LR_RL as they are part of the same model.</p><p>We find that, along the principal gradient, the observed normalized asymmetric map is highly similar to the non-normalized map used in the main analyses for intra-hemispheric (Pearson r = 0.956). Conversely, for the inter-hemispheric (Pearson r = 0.531) asymmetry patterns are still consistent, yet we find the similarity reduced. It is possible the difference between intra- and inter-hemispheric correspondence relates to more global differences in strength of connectivity comparing LR to RL FC, as reported also in (Raemaekers et al., 2018) resulting in more widespread differences between inter-hemispheric patterns of both embedding procedures.</p><p>We have now included this analysis in the supplementary results, p. 15 and as a supplementary Figure.</p><p>“Moreover, to overcome potential normalization biases associated with creating one gradient for each hemisphere, we performed an alternative analysis to create a gradient of the left and right hemisphere together. This assumes that regions with similar connectivity profiles have comparable loading in the gradient framework. Indeed, along the principal gradient, the observed normalized asymmetric map was highly similar to the non-normalized map used in the main analyses for the intra-hemispheric (Pearson r = 0.956) and inter-hemispheric (Pearson r = 0.531) asymmetry patterns (Figure 2-figure supplement 9). It is possible the difference between intra- and inter-hemispheric correspondence relates to more global differences in strength of connectivity comparing LR to RL FC, as reported also in the article 7 resulting in more widespread differences between inter-hemispheric patterns of both embedding procedures.”</p><p>To further display the underlying differences in connectivity profiles we furthermore projected the top 10% of connectivity patterns which were the basis for dimensionality reduction techniques used in the main analyses on the cortex. Thus, any change that may alter potential gradient loadings would fall within the top 10% of a regions’ connectivity profiles. We selected the asymmetric parcel (No.25: Peri-Sylvian language area) of and displayed their left-right difference in top 10% connectivity profiles between left and right hemisphere. We have now added this example to the supplementary figures, and refer to it in the results, p.8.</p><p>&quot;The differences in gradient loadings (parcel No.25: Peri-Sylvian language area) reflect differences in connectivity profiles (top 10%) between LL versus RR, or LR versus RL respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>You agreed that it is difficult to interpret these changes, given that they can represent changes occurring outside the region where the change is reported, but then the analysis you have done does not address this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment, and hope that both our answers to previous questions (Q1.Rv1 and Q1.2_Rv1) have created further clarity.

If this new measure is more interpretable, then why do you need to use gradients? What information from the gradients is useful for the study of asymmetries? And how can we interpret changes in positions along the gradients? Simply saying that &quot;interpretation for asymmetry of areas is under a global context&quot; seems to me like sweeping the issue under the rug.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising these important points. Indeed, we have now revisited this question and provided updated analyses which provide a more fitting answer to the raised concerns. Overall we believe that using a gradient framework to study asymmetry of functional brain organization has various benefits and provides us with novel insights into the asymmetric organization of functional connectivity that can be integrated within the wider literature of cortical organization. First of all, gradients provide a synoptic framework to capture smooth variations of connectivity patterns across the cortical mantle. Such differences have been linked to graph-theoretical markers such as degree centrality (Hong et al., 2019) , and dynamics (Park et al., 2021) as well as connectivity distance (Hong et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022). Moreover, the principal gradient provides a coordinate framework spanning the cortex and reflecting the geodesic distance between primary and default regions, and relates to cortical microstructure and associated processing hierarchies (Huntenburg et al., 2018). In doing so, and in contrast to clustering or network-based approaches, the gradient framework provides a spatial ordering of functional brain networks, placing them along a gradual axis of connectivity variation reaching from sensory to transmodal areas. In the context of asymmetry of gradient loadings this would mean that a given region with a significant left-ward asymmetry along the first gradient (sensory-to-transmodal) has a connectivity profile more similar to the transmodal anchor than in the left hemisphere relative to the right. Consequently these regions are placed at different positions along the cortical hierarchy, providing novel insights in the system-level variations of the asymmetric brain. This data-driven framework enabled us to evaluate heritability, i.e. to what extent genetic factors impact variation across individuals in asymmetric organization of the cortex, and compare patterns between humans and macaques. Moreover, our framework can, in future studies, be used to evaluate overlaps between asymmetry of local cortical structure with the functional (and structural) asymmetric embedding of a given region.</p><p>To better understand the asymmetry between hemispheres, previous work has also employed the gradients framework (Gonzalez Alam et al., 2022; Liang et al., 2021) and found inter-hemispheric functional connectivity profile differences in frontoparietal and default mode networks. In the current work, we further optimized the approach by considering individual variation and using an atlas that considers contralateral homologous regions and is based on the current sample (Glasser, 2016). Indeed, contrary to a network level account of asymmetry, the gradient framework helps us to describe the asymmetry of a large-scale functional coordinate system spanning sensory to transmodal anchors using a data-driven approach. We have now further highlighted these arguments in the Introduction, p.3.</p><p>“Gradients provide a synoptic framework to capture smooth variations of connectivity patterns across the cortical mantle.

What is meant by joint alignment and how exactly does this address my concern?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. Joint alignment is implemented based on spectral embedding. Here the embedding, rather than using the affinity matrices individually, is based on the joint affinity matrix (Vos de Wael et al., 2020). However, as we now have updated our reply to the original question to provide a more fitting answer we believe this analysis is no longer relevant and have again removed its outcome from the supplementary materials.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Gonzalez Alam, T.
