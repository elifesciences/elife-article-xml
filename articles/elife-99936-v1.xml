division. The presence of mitochondrial DNA within mitochondria and its restricted replication during preimplantation development makes their inheritance particularly important. While chromosomes are precisely segregated by the mitotic spindle, the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial partitioning remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) controls the mitochondrial redistribution and partitioning during embryonic cleavage. Depletion of Drp1 in mouse zygotes causes marked mitochondrial aggregation, and the majority of embryos arrest at the 2 cell stage. Clumped mitochondria are located in the center of mitotic Drp1-depleted zygotes with less uniform distribution, thereby preventing their symmetric partitioning. Asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance is accompanied by functionally inequivalent blastomeres with biased ATP and endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. We also find that marked mitochondrial centration in Drp1-depleted zygotes prevents the assembly of parental chromosomes, resulting in chromosome segregation defects and binucleation. Thus, mitochondrial fragmentation mediated by Drp1 ensures proper organelle positioning and partitioning into functional daughters during the first embryonic cleavage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial dynamics</kwd><kwd>Dynamin-related protein 1</kwd><kwd>preimplantation development</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd><kwd>organelle inheritance</kwd><kwd>binuclear formation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17K17905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakai</surname><given-names>Takuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1165627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carroll</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Adhikari</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20K06627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakai</surname><given-names>Takuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23K0886905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wakai</surname><given-names>Takuya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Depletion of Dynamin-related protein 1, a key regulator of mitochondrial fission, in mouse zygotes impair symmetric organelle partitioning and chromosome segregation leading to early developmental arrest.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preimplantation development of mammalian embryos consists of a series of symmetric cell divisions without signiﬁcant cell growth, known as embryonic cleavage, resulting in approximately half of the cytoplasm in each resulting cell, called a blastomere. The segregation of maternal content between daughter blastomeres allows rapid division of a single-cell zygote into multicellular organisms. To ensure the correct segregation of cellular content to produce functional daughters, cells must duplicate and apportion their various organelles with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carlton et al., 2020</xref>). Chromosomes are assembled and segregated into daughter cells with the formation of mitotic spindles, whereas membrane-bound organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria, are typically generated from existing structures, and both daughters receive a share of these components during cell division. This is particularly important in the case of mitochondria because mitochondria are semi-autonomous organelles that contain their own genome, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Growing oocytes exponentially increase their mtDNA, and a fully grown oocyte contains more than 200 000 copies of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mahrous et al., 2012</xref>). After fertilization, abundant preexisting mtDNA is segregated among daughter cells without replication during preimplantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Poulton et al., 2010</xref>). As mitochondria are the primary source of ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation in oocytes and early embryos owing to low glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dumollard et al., 2007</xref>), proper inheritance must be ensured for cell energetic homogeneity among blastomeres. Mitochondria also play an important role in the regulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, which in turn controls cell metabolism and cell death pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, defects in mitochondrial inheritance are likely to have serious consequences for daughter blastomeres and manifest as the failure of pre- or post-implantation development.</p><p>Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles that move along cytoskeletal networks and undergo continuous fusion and fission; these dynamics allow cells to respond and adapt to various intracellular and extracellular changes and maintain cellular function and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mishra and Chan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westermann, 2010</xref>). Active partitioning of mitochondria is observed in budding yeast fission, which undergoes asymmetric cell division; mitochondria actively move along actin filaments into the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mishra and Chan, 2014</xref>). In mammalian cells that divide symmetrically, the partitioning of mitochondria is largely due to passive processes, as fragmented and dispersed mitochondrial distribution allows for stochastic and roughly equal partitioning into daughter cells. Mitochondrial fission is thus important for faithful inheritance and proper intracellular distribution of the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westermann, 2010</xref>). Whether active transport of mitochondria by the cytoskeleton contributes to mitochondrial inheritance in dividing animal cells remains controversial. Microtubules function as cytoskeletal platforms for the distribution and transport of mitochondria. During mitosis, mitochondria decouple from spindle microtubules and disperse in the cell periphery, allowing for passive segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have shown that actin filaments take over as the dominant mitochondrial scaffold following mitochondrial release from microtubules at the start of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2021</xref>). Myosin 19 (Myo19), a mitochondrial-localized myosin in vertebrates, acts as an actin-based motor for mitochondrial dynamics. Notably, depletion of Myo19 causes asymmetrical mitochondrial inheritance between daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rohn et al., 2014</xref>), though the molecular characteristics of Myo19 in mammalian oocytes/eggs have yet to be shown.</p><p>Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) is a key regulator of mitochondrial fission in many eukaryotic organisms. Drp1 is recruited to the mitochondrial membrane where it forms helical oligomers that induce membrane constriction and severing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Westermann, 2010</xref>). The indispensable role of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in mammalian oocytes has been documented using conditional knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Udagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Drp1 KO oocytes undergo meiotic arrest due to severe organelle aggregation, which complicates the functional analysis of Drp1 in mature oocytes and embryos. More recently, mature oocytes have been successfully isolated from juvenile Drp1 conditional KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikari et al., 2022</xref>). After parthenogenetic activation of Drp1 KO oocytes, few embryos develop to the blastocyst stage. Nevertheless, the precise role of mitochondrial fission in normal embryos remains elusive. To this end, we employed Trim-Away, a method to degrade endogenous proteins via the proteasome-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clift et al., 2017</xref>), which acutely depletes large amounts of storage proteins in the oocyte, allowing loss-of-function studies during the preimplantation development from the zygotic stage. In this study, we show that Drp1 depletion in fertilized zygotes causes marked mitochondrial aggregation and early embryonic arrest. Live imaging of mitochondria during the first cleavage division reveals that loss of Drp1 disturbs the spatiotemporal mitochondrial dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance between daughter blastomeres with functional heterogeneities. We also find that misplaced mitochondria impair the assembly of parental spindles, leading to binucleated blastomeres, which closely resemble a clinical phenotype of human embryos in in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hardy et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meriano et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seikkula et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fragmented mitochondria are redistributed during the first embryonic cleavage and equally partitioned into daughter blastomeres</title><p>We first imaged mitochondria and chromosomes in zygotes expressing mitochondrially-targeted GFP (mt-GFP) and histone H2B-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).

During the transition from anaphase to telophase (32 hr post-hCG), the cytokinetic furrow constricts the mitochondrial ring that effectively divides the mitochondria approximately equally into the two daughter blastomeres, and mitochondria were dispersed throughout the cytoplasm in the interphase 2 cell embryos (35 hr post-hCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right). Immunofluorescence staining of microtubules also showed mitochondria progressively surround the spindle and disperse back into the cytoplasm after the first cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The accumulation of mitochondria around the spindle is unique to the first cleavage division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), as live imaging of fluorescently labeled microtubules (EB3-GFP) and mitochondria (mt-DsRed) confirmed spindle-associated accumulation of mitochondria in one-cell zygotes, but no evidence of mitochondrial accumulation was observed in the spindles of 2 cell or 4 cell stage embryos. By electron microscopy (EM), we found that these accumulated mitochondria around the metaphase spindle were highly fragmented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The ERs were also abundantly distributed around the spindle and were in partial contact with the mitochondria, and enriched bundles of actin filaments were found around these organelles.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Redistribution and symmetric partitioning of mitochondria during embryonic cleavage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative time-lapse images (maximum-intensity Z projection) of mitochondria and chromosomes in zygotes expressing mitochondrially-targeted (mt-GFP) and histone H2B-mCherry during the first cleavage division.

This cytoplasmic meshwork was subsequently reorganized around the spindle at the metaphase and increased co-localization with mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In interphase 2 cell stage embryos, the F-actin meshwork was seen again, albeit with significantly reduced overlap with mitochondria. To test whether the F-actin is involved in mitochondrial distribution and partitioning, zygotes were treated with 1 μM latrunculin A for 1 hr just after NEB, sufficient for F-actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Disruption of F-actin organization resulted in asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>), but also increased cell size asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), and these two asymmetries were correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Given many cellular roles, disruption of F-actin per se was unsuitable as a strategy for manipulating mitochondrial distribution. We have, therefore, targeted Myo19 as a strategy for altering the mitochondrial distribution and asked if it is critical for the early development. Asymmetric mitochondrial inheritance has been previously reported in cells lacking Myo19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Majstrowicz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rohn et al., 2014</xref>). Myo19 was expressed in both interphase and metaphase zygotes, where its localization was consistent with the mitochondrial distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Acute depletion of Myo19 at the PN stage by Trim-Away was confirmed by Western blot analysis, which was not observed in control zygotes injected with Trim21 mRNA and control IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). Unexpectedly, no significant asymmetry was observed in the mitochondrial distribution and partitioning between the daughter blastomeres in Myo19-depleted 2 cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>).

Moreover, Myo19 depletion did not affect developmental competence of the embryos to the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>).

No FRET signal was detected in embryos expressing a mutant version of the ATP probe AT1.03RK that cannot bind ATP.</p><p>Recent studies have focused on the interactions between organelles at membrane contact sites (MCSs) and their roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">English and Voeltz, 2013</xref>). The ER is a continuous membrane-bound organelle with MCSs such as with the plasma membrane, mitochondria, Golgi, and peroxisomes. Since mitochondrial dynamics are spatially coordinated at the ER-mitochondria MCSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Friedman et al., 2011</xref>), we surmised that mitochondrial aggregation due to the loss of Drp1 would compromise the organization of ER MCSs. To visualize the distribution of mitochondria with other organelles in live embryos, fluorescently tagged ER (ER-mCherry), Golgi (Golgi-mCherry), and peroxisomes (PEX-mCherry) were co-expressed with mt-GFP. The ER was partially confined to the regions of the mitochondrial aggregation in Drp1 Trim-Away embryos, which appeared to disturb the endogenous ER network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Linscan of mt-GFP and ER-mCherry signals at each focal plane of large mitochondrial clumps showed that ER is confined to mitochondrial aggregation. In contrast, the subcellular distribution of the Golgi was not clearly altered by Drp1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Drp1 is also known to regulate peroxisomal fission, as elongated peroxisomes are seen in Drp1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koch et al., 2003</xref>) however, the subcellular distribution of peroxisomes in mammalian embryos has not been reported. The peroxisomes in normal 2 cell embryos showed a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm, whereas these puncta partially aggregated following Drp1 depletion by Trim-Away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>), although it appeared to be independent of mitochondrial aggregation in terms of spatial positioning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation is required for the symmetric mitochondrial partitioning into two functional daughter blastomeres</title><p>To decipher the spatiotemporal regulation of mitochondrial dynamics following Drp1 depletion, we imaged mitochondria and chromosomes in Drp1 Trim-Away zygotes expressing mt-GFP and histone H2B-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). No significant delay in cell cycle progression was observed following Drp1 depletion (data not shown) compared to control zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Clumped mitochondria were located in the center of the metaphase zygotes, which resulted in an increase in mitochondrial asymmetry at anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We postulated that this asymmetry was due to non-uniformity in the distribution of mitochondria around the spindle. As expected, live imaging of mitochondria (mt-DsRed) and spindle microtubules (EB3-GFP) revealed compared with the uniform angular positioning of around the spindle observed in control zygotes, mitochondria in Drp1-depleted zygotes lost their uniform distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The biased inheritance of mitochondria was further validated by the quantification of mtDNA copy number in isolated blastomeres from 2 cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The inheritance ratio of mtDNA in daughter blastomeres of control embryos was comparable, whereas Drp1 depletion led to biased mtDNA inheritance. Although Drp1 depletion did not affect intracellular ATP levels in the whole embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), we tested if the biased inheritance of mitochondria led to differences in blastomere ATP levels. Using AT1.03, ATP concentration and mitochondrial distribution were simultaneously visualized in blastomeres of 2 cell embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Notably, the bias in ATP levels between blastomeres of 2 cell embryos was greater following the Drp1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

No significant asymmetry was observed in the distribution of Golgi or peroxisomes, suggesting that these organelles are not directly confined by mitochondrial location. The ER is the main reservoir of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in non-excitable cells. ER-mitochondria MCSs create localized domains of high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the ER to the mitochondria, in which the propagation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in the mitochondria controls energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>).

Both confocal and EM images showed that large mitochondrial clumps occupied the central region in Drp1-depleted zygotes, to which two spindles were separately located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Tracking of two sets of chromosomes with mitochondria following Drp1 depletion revealed that the mitochondrial aggregation caused by Drp1 depletion sits between the pronuclei and subsequent spindles, such that the distance from chromosomes to the centre of the zygote is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>).

As mitochondria are unique organelles with their own genomes, their biased inheritance is expected to have detrimental effects on daughter cell function. We showed that Drp1 mediates mitochondrial fragmentation and dispersion, enabling symmetric partitioning between daughter blastomeres stochastically, which is indispensable for healthy embryo development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria that form a morphologically complex network and interact with microtubules at the interphase are rapidly fragmented upon mitotic entry, detached from the microtubules, and redistributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ball and Singer, 1982</xref>). Mitochondrial fission is activated via the phosphorylation of Drp1 during mitosis. Two mitotic kinases, CDK1 and Aurora A, activate Drp1, leading to enhanced mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamano and Youle, 2011</xref>). As the cell exits mitosis, Drp1 is sumoylated and targeted for degradation to prevent mitochondrial fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Figueroa-Romero et al., 2009</xref>). Although it remains to be investigated whether these cell cycle-dependent modifications of Drp1 also occur in early embryos, mitochondria appear to be constitutively fragmented throughout the cell cycle. This unique mitochondrial morphology not only facilitates symmetric partitioning in cell division without cell growth, but also appears to be well-adapted to the rapid proliferation of single-cell zygotes into multicellular organisms before cell lineage specification. In asymmetrically dividing cells, functionally distinct mitochondria are unequally apportioned to influence daughter cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Katajisto et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, symmetric cell division is intended to produce identical daughter cells with comparable fates. In this context, the highly fragmented mitochondrial morphology in early embryos may contribute to avoiding cell fate divergence, as well as fulfill metabolic homogeneity among blastomeres. Interestingly, the apparent morphological changes in mitochondria occur at the blastocyst stage, as elongated mitochondria are formed in trophectoderm (TE) cells, which is likely to be associated with altered energy metabolism in the TE lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Considering that the transformation from eggs to embryos is a fundamental process in animal development involving changes such as the transition from meiotic to mitotic spindles and maternal to zygotic gene expression, changes in mitochondrial morphology and function may also play a role in regulating cell fate and function in the early embryo.</p><p>The cytoskeleton is a critical regulator of organelle positioning. In contrast to a uniformly distributed mitochondria throughout the cytoplasm during somatic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore et al., 2021</xref>), mitochondria progressively accumulated around pronuclei and encircled the metaphase spindle of the first embryonic cleavage. Since the two pronuclei migrate from the periphery to the centre of the eggs by the F-actin-dependent mechanism to unite chromosomes on the first mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chaigne et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scheffler et al., 2021</xref>), actin filaments may drive the mitochondrial movement. In fact, mitochondrial distribution was closely associated with cytoplasmic F-actin organization in zygotes, especially at the metaphase. Although depolymerization of F-actin prior to metaphase led to asymmetric mitochondrial partitioning, the cell division itself was also asymmetric, probably due to the failure of centering of the pronuclei. Given that the depletion of Myo19 did not affect the mitochondrial inheritance between daughter blastomeres, the actin-based motor may not contribute the symmetric partitioning of mitochondria in cleavage embryos. This result is mostly consistent with previous observations in mitochondrial Rho GTPase (Miro) 1-deleted zygotes. Miro1 is localized in the mitochondrial outer membrane and the adaptor protein TRAK mediates the attachment of motor proteins to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Doménech et al., 2018</xref>). Miro also regulates Myo19, ensuring stability to actin-mediated mitochondrial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">López-Doménech et al., 2018</xref>), and thus loss of Miro leads to asymmetric segregation of mitochondria during mitosis, most likely due to reduced levels of Myo19. In Miro1-deleted zygotes, mitochondrial dynamics was partially disturbed, but this did not affect mitochondrial partitioning to daughter blastomeres, and fertility was normal as a result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, fragmented mitochondria may be primarily important for symmetric mitochondrial partitioning in cleavage embryos, as a less precise stochastic partitioning mechanism may be suitable or sufficient for equally partitioning of mitochondria, which are present in abundance and are located across the cell volume in oocytes/zygotes. Nevertheless, it is also worth considering the possibility that actin accumulated in mitochondria may be indirectly involved in mitochondrial dynamics via mitochondrial fission. For example, inverted formin 2 controls actin polymerization and has been reported to be required for efficient mitochondrial fission as an upstream function of Drp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korobova et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The physiological roles of mitochondrial fission in preimplantation embryos</title><p>Inhibition of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission causes severe embryonic arrest. Given the housekeeping cellular functions of mitochondria, dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics may exert profound effects on the developmental competence of embryos. Mitochondrial dynamics are a highly regulated process, and when disrupted, can lead to cellular and tissue pathologies. The importance of mitochondrial fission has been intensively studied in animal cells, and emerging evidence suggests that Drp1-mediated fission participates in diverse cellular processes, including ER contacts, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, autophagy, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kraus et al., 2021</xref>). Drp1-KO mice are embryonic lethal, most likely due to brain, heart, and placental defects; however, various tissues appear normal, and cultured cell lines continue to proliferate even though mitochondria are unevenly segregated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishihara et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</xref>). Cells lacking Drp1 have highly elongated mitochondria that cannot be divided into transportable units, and typically accumulate in a limited area, leaving large parts of the cell devoid of mitochondria. This imbalanced distribution of mitochondria may fail to meet local energy demands and thus would be more manifest in large or extended cells, such as neurons and oocytes/zygotes. Moreover, our data demonstrated that Drp1 depletion in cleavage embryos caused biased mitochondrial inheritance and energy heterogeneity between blastomeres. Given the low levels of de novo mtDNA replication during preimplantation development, these biases may be further magnified by cleavage division progression. It is also noteworthy that we showed that mitochondrial aggregation induced by the loss of Drp1 disturbs the spatial organization of the ER. The aggregated ER subdomains likely caused leakage of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores, which may compromise the tethering functions at the ER MCSs. The precise mechanisms of 2 cell stage arrest arising from depletion of Drp1 remain elusive. It has been reported that Drp1 depletion during meiosis leads to premature chromosome segregation due to spindle assembly checkpoint defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). Drp1-deficient cells has also been reported to cause replication stress, leading to DNA damage response and the G2/M cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qian et al., 2012</xref>), which is more consistent with our observations. The presence of a Chk1-dependent checkpoint leading to G2 arrest in 2 cell mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ladstätter and Tachibana-Konwalski, 2016</xref>) suggests that this surveillance mechanism may be involved in the 2 cell arrest process in this study.</p><p>In the present study, we found frequent binucleation in Drp1-depleted embryos. Binucleation of early embryos is relatively common in human IVF procedures, but the mechanisms of its occurrence and association with the developmental competence of the embryo are not fully understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomes Paim and FitzHarris, 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reichmann et al., 2018</xref> recently demonstrated that mouse zygotes form two functionally independent spindles before anaphase, and spatially separate parental genomes during the first cleavage. Notably, failure to align the two spindles produced errors, resulting in binuclear formation in the 2 cell embryos. The present study demonstrates that clustered mitochondria in the central space of zygotes interfere with the assembly of two spindles, implying a potential contribution of the organelle misplacement to binucleation in human embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mitochondrial dynamics and quality control</title><p>The present study revealed the response to defective mitochondrial fission at the cellular level in early embryos, but the response at the organelle level remains to be elucidated. Mitochondria in oocytes, with hundreds of thousands of mtDNA copies, are maternally inherited after fertilization. The preservation and apportionment of healthy mtDNA in oocytes and early embryos is important for the inheritance of normal mtDNA in the offspring. Recent full-length mtDNA sequencing has identified de novo mtDNA mutations in oocytes, and their frequency increases with age, implying mtDNA turnover during meiotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrisch et al., 2020</xref>). Oocytes with severe mtDNA mutations can be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2008</xref>), although the thresholds at which mtDNA mutations and the resulting mitochondrial dysfunction result in selection remain unclear. The autophagic elimination of mitochondria and mitophagy may also function as filters to segregate and eliminate pathogenic mtDNA mutations at the organelle level (Youle and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>). An attractive model has been proposed for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline, as fragmentation of the mitochondrial network facilitates mitophagy and allows selective elimination of defective mitochondria containing mutant mtDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lieber et al., 2019</xref>). Functional links between mitochondrial fission and the removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy have also been documented in mammalian cells, as Drp1 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunction owing to the failure of a Drp1-dependent mechanism of mitophagy that removes damaged mitochondria within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Twig et al., 2008</xref>). The highly fragmented mitochondrial structure in mammalian oocytes/zygotes allows mtDNA to be sequestered in small units, which may be beneficial for eliminating mutation-impaired mitochondria for mitophagy. Furthermore, symmetric segregation of fragmented mitochondria might randomize mutant mtDNA among daughter blastomeres during embryonic cleavage to maintain tissue homeostasis. Elucidating the behavior of mutant mitochondria in early embryos is clinically meaningful. Mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT) is a promising approach to prevent the transmission of mtDNA disorders from mother to child, as pathogenic mutant mtDNA in mature oocytes or zygotes is replaced with normal mtDNA by nuclear transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hyslop et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2016</xref>). A potential problem with MRT is that a small fraction of patients’ mtDNA is inevitably carried over into the reconstructed oocytes or zygotes (approximately 1 to 4%, respectively). It has been noted that these low levels of mutant mtDNA may predominantly expand during post-implantation embryogenesis, suggesting a rapid shift to one mtDNA haplotype during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is important to investigate the role of mitochondrial dynamics in the regulation of mtDNA mutations in the preimplantation embryo, and whether mitochondrial fission contributes to reducing the mutational load.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Females were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 7.5 IU of equine chorionic gonadotropin (PMSG; ASKA Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) followed by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; ASKA Pharmaceutical) 48 hr later. Female mice were euthanized 20–24 hr later and fertilized zygotes were retrieved in Hepes-buffered KSOM (H-KSOM) medium under paraffin oil, at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. All mice were housed in a pathogen-free environment in filter-top cages and fed a standard diet. Animal experiments were conducted according to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama University.</p><p>For experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, Drp1<italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wakabayashi et al., 2009</xref>) were crossed with transgenic mice that carried <italic>Gdf-9</italic> promoter–mediated Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lan et al., 2004</xref>).

For the collection of ovulated MII oocytes, mice were superovulated by sequential intraperitoneal injections of 8 IU PMSG and 8 IU hCG at an interval of 48 hr, and the mice were culled 14–16 hr after hCG injection to collect oocytes from the oviducts. Animal experimentation was approved by Monash University Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee and was performed in accordance with Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Guidelines on Ethics in Animal Experimentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Plasmids</title><p>EGFP, mCherry, and DsRed were cloned into the pcDNA6 vector between the XhoI and XbaI sites (pcDNA6/Myc-His B; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) with a poly(A)-tail of 84 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wakai et al., 2014</xref>). The gene sequence encoding the mitochondrial targeting sequence of Cox VIII was amplified by PCR and ligated to the EGFP and DsRed-bearing pcDNA6 (mt-GFP and mt-DsRed). The gene sequences encoding the ER-targeting sequence of calreticulin and the KDEL ER retention sequence were cloned into mCherry (ER-mCherry)-bearing pcDNA6. For visualization of DNA and microtubule growth, gene sequences encoding histones H2B and EB3 were ligated to the pcDNA6 vector in frame with mCherry (H2B-mCherry) and EGFP (EB3-GFP), respectively. The gene sequences encoding the amino-terminal 33 residues of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase as a Golgi targeting sequence (Addgene, 14873) and peroxisomal targeting signal 1 (Addgene, 54520) were cloned into mCherry-bearing pcDNA6 (Golgi-mCherry and PEX-mCherry). The gene sequences encoding N-terminally mCherry-tagged Drp1 (Addgene, 49152) were inserted between the EcoRI and PstI sites of the pCDNA vector (mCherry-Drp1). ATP biosensor, AT1.03 and AT1.03RK in the pcDNA3.1 vector were kindly provided by Dr H. Imamura (Kyoto University). Capped mRNA was synthesized with T7 polymerase (RiboMAX Large-Scale RNA Production, Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer instructions. mRNAs were delivered into zygotes using a piezo-driven micropipette unit (Prime Tech, Tsuchiura, Japan). For microinjection, mRNA solution was loaded into glass micropipettes at the concentration of 200 ng/µl (mt-GFP, EB3-GFP, mt-DsRed, H2B-mCherry, ER-mCherry, Golgi-mCherry, and PEX-mCherry), 500 ng/µl (mCherry-Drp1), or 1000 ng/µl (AT1.03 and AT1.03RK). The volumes injected typically ranged from 2 to 10 pl, which is 1–5% of the total volume of the zygotes. Manipulation was carried out in H-KSOM medium containing 5 mg/mL cytochalasin B (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) to increase post-microinjection survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Trim-Away</title><p>Trim-Away was performed as previously described with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clift et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, pCMV6-Entry vector harboring Trim-21 mouse ORF Clone (Origene, Rockville, MD) was linearized by FseI, and mRNA was synthesized using T7 mMessage mMachine and poly-A tailed with Poly(A) tailing kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-Drp1 antibody (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) or rabbit monoclonal anti-Myo19 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was concentrated using Amicon Ultra-0.5 100 KDa centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the buffer was replaced with PBS containing 0.03% NP40 (Nakarai, Kyoto, Japan). Pronuclear stage zygotes were injected with Trim21 mRNA (1000 ng/mL) and subsequently with anti-Drp1 or anti-Myo19 antibodies. For the control experiment, normal mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) was used instead of an anti-Drp1 antibody and anti-Myo19 antibodies, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Whole cell lysates from zygotes/embryos were prepared by adding a 2x sample buffer.

The membranes were then blocked and probed with anti-Drp1 (1:1000) or anti-Myo19 (1:1000) antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used as a secondary antibody (1:2000) for chemiluminescence detection (Clarity Western ECL Substrates, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The signal was digitally captured using a ChemiDoc XRS + imaging system (Bio-Rad). The same membranes were stripped at 50 °C for 30 min (62.5 mM Tris, 2% SDS, and 100 mM 2-beta mercaptoethanol) and re-probed with anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:2000, Cell Signaling Technology) as the internal control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>mtDNA copy number</title><p>The zona pellucida of 2 cell embryos was removed with H-KSOM medium containing 0.1% protease (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Individual blastomeres from the zona-free embryos were obtained by repeatedly pipetting in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free and Ma<sup>2+</sup>-free H-KOSM medium. After washing in PBS, each blastomere was transferred into 5 μL of lysis buffer 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, with 0.5% Tween 20 and 100 μg proteinase K, at 55 °C, followed by heat inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min. The plasmid standard was constructed by cloning a 194 bp fragment of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 1. The standard stock was serially diluted to prepare the standard curve (10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>7</sup>).

Each reaction of 20 µL consisted of 10 µL of SYBR Green I (Roche), 0.5 µM each of the forward and reverse primers, and 2 µL of DNA template. The cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 sec, annealing at 50 °C for 20 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 8 s. Standard curves were created for each run, and the sample copy number was determined from the equation relating the Ct value against copy number for the corresponding standard curve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Zygotes/embryos were fixed and permeabilized with 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 40 min at room temperature.

To estimate the relative changes in ATP levels, the emission ratio of AT1.03 and AT1.03RK (YFP/CFP) was imaged using a CFP excitation filter, dichroic beam splitter, and CFP and YFP emission filters (Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT; ET436/20 x, 89007bs, ET480/40 m, and ET535/30 m). To measure cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, embryos were incubated with 1.25  µM Fluo-4 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 0.02% pluronic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 20  min at room temperature. Fluo-4 was excited with 480 nm wavelengths every 20 s and the emitted light was collected at wavelengths greater than 510 nm. To estimate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the ER, Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise was analyzed following the addition of 10 μM thapsigargin (Sigma) in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free medium. For the monitoring of ATP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, embryos were attached to glass-bottomed dishes (Matsunami) and placed on the stage of an inverted microscope. The fluorescence images were obtained by a scientific CMOS (sCMOS) camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu), and the rotation of excitation and emission filter wheels was controlled using the MAC5000 filter wheel/shutter control box (Ludl Electronic Products Ltd, Hawthorne, NY) and HCImage software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Live cell confocal imaging</title><p>Spinning disk images of mitochondria (mt-GFP and mt-DsRed), chromosomes (H2B-mCherry), microtubules (EB3-GFP), ER (ER-mCherry), Golgi (Golgi-mCherry), and peroxisome (PEX-mCherry), were obtained using a confocal scanner unit (CellVoyager CV1000, Yokogawa, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with a C-Apochromat ×40, 1.2 NA water immersion objective. Images were typically acquired every 10–20 mins on 10 planes covering a 35–40 μm range (every 2.5–3.3 μm). Laser wavelengths of 488 and 561 nm were used for the excitation of EGFP and mCherry (DsRed), respectively (not exceeding 0.2% laser intensity to minimize light-induced phototoxic stress).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) was used for the quantification of fluorescence images.</p><p>For quantification of mitochondria at nuclear or spindle periphery in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, the fluorescence images of nucleus (H2B-mCherry) of spindle (EB3-GFP) were applied with a Gaussian filter (radius: 2 pixels) to remove noise and segmented by intensity thresholding. The masked binary images were dilated with 10 pixels width and the nucleus/spindle periphery was segmented by the subtraction of the original image from the dilated image. The fluorescence intensity ratio of mitochondrial layers at the periphery to that of outside the periphery was measured to estimate mitochondrial accumulation around the nucleus/spindle.</p><p>For quantitation of mitochondrial symmetry at the anaphase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the cleavage plane of the dividing blastomere was manually outlined with respect to the middle of the anaphase chromosomes. Total mt-GFP intensity in each blastomere was measured, and the greater value was divided by the smaller value for the symmetry index. To analyze organelle symmetry at the telophase in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, total pixel intensity in the channel corresponding to mt-GFP, ER-mCherry, Golgi-mCherry, and PEX-mCherry in each blastomere was measured. The greater value was divided by the smaller value; a ratio of 1 indicates symmetry, whereas higher values indicate asymmetry.</p><p>To measure the size and count the number of mitochondrial clusters in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>, the fluorescence images of mitochondria (mt-GFP) were analyzed using a basic measurement function (analyze particles, size) after adjusting intensity threshold (Yen algorism). Based on the average size of mitochondria in EM images, mt-GFP signals larger than 0.15 μm<sup>2</sup> were counted as mitochondrial clusters.</p><p>Uniformity analysis of mitochondrial distribution around spindles in y in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> was performed based on the angular distributions of mitochondria (mt-DsRed) and microtubules (EB3-GFP) using the ‘QuantEv Icy’ plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pécot et al., 2018</xref>). The fluorescence images were applied with a Gaussian filter (radius: 2 pixels) to reduce noise, and xy coordinates were converted to polar coordinates. The fluorescence intensity profiles for mt-DsRed relative to the centroid of the EB3-GFP signals were divided into sectors, each 60 degrees based on the long axis of the spindle. The standard deviation of averaged mitochondrial intensity per 60° sector were calculated; higher values were considered to indicate increased non-uniformity.</p><p>For quantitation of ROS enrichment in mitochondria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>, the fluorescence images of mitochondria (MitoTracker Red CMXros) were background-subtracted (rolling ball radius: 5 pixels) and applied with the Gaussian filter (radius: 2 pixels) to remove noise. The inside mitochondria was masked by intensity thresholding (Moments algorism). The outside mitochondria was segmented by subtracting the masked image from the whole embryo area. The intensity ratio of H2DCFDA fluorescence inside mitochondria to outside mitochondria was measured to estimate ROS accumulation in mitochondria.</p><p>For tracking nuclei in zygotes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>, XY coordinates of the centroid of male and female chromosomes (H2B-mcherry) relative to the center of the zygote were obtained using the ‘Manual tracking’ plugin.

They aimed to validate a role for mitochondrial dynamics in modulating chromosomal segregation, mitochondrial inheritance and embryo development and achieve this through the examination of mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum distribution, as well as actin filament involvement, using targeted plasmids, molecular probes and TEM in pronuclear stage embryos through the first cleavages divisions. Drp1 deletion perturbed mitochondrial distribution, leading to asymmetric partitioning of mitochondria to the 2-cell stage embryo, prevented appropriate chromosomal segregation and culminated in embryo arrest. Resultant 2-cell embryos displayed altered ATP, mtDNA and calcium levels. Microinjection of Drp1 mRNA partially rescued embryo development. A role for actin filaments in mitochondrial inheritance is described, however the actin-based motor Myo19 does not appear to contribute.</p><p>Overall, this study builds upon their previous work and provides further support for a role of mitochondrial dynamics in mediating chromosomal segregation and mitochondrial inheritance. In particular, Drp1 is required for the redistribution of mitochondria to support symmetric partitioning and ongoing development.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is well designed, the methods are appropriate and the results are clearly presented. The findings are nicely summarised in a schematic.</p><p>The addition of further quantification, including mitochondrial cluster size, elongation/aspect ratio and ROS, as requested by the reviewers, has provided further evidence for the impact of Drp1 depletion on mitochondrial morphology and function.</p><p>Understanding the role of mitochondria in binucleation and mitochondrial inheritance is of clinical relevance for patients undergoing infertility treatment, particularly those undergoing mitochondrial replacement therapy.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The only remaining weakness is that the authors have not undertaken additional experiments to clarify any role for mitochondrial transport following Drp1 depletion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99936.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Why mitochondria are finely maintained in the female germ cell (oocyte), zygotes, and preimplantation embryos? Mitochondrial fusion seems beneficial in somatic cells to compensate for unhealthy mitochondria, for example, mitochondria with mutated mtDNA that potentially defuel the respiratory activity if accumulated above a certain threshold. However, in the germ cells, it may rather increase the risk of transmitting mutated mtDNA to the next generation. Also, finely maintained mitochondria would also be beneficial for efficient removal when damaged, as the authors briefly discussed. Due in part to the limited suitable model, physiological role of mitochondrial fission in embryos were obscure. In this study, authors demonstrated that mitochondrial fission prevents multiple adverse outcomes, especially including the aberrant demixing of parental genome (a clinical phenotype of human embryos) in zygotic stage. Thus, this study would be also of clinical importance that could contribute by proposing a novel mechanism.</p><p>The authors have adequately indicated the limitations at each of the specific points. The revisions the authors made have consolidated their conclusion, thus still, making this study an excellent one.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99936.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gekko</surname><given-names>Haruna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okayama University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Okayama</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>Ruri</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okayama University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Okayama</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kuzuhara</surname><given-names>Daiki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Corporation Group Mio Fertility Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Yonago</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kaneyasu</surname><given-names>Masato</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okayama University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Okayama</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Koseki</surname><given-names>Genpei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okayama University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Okayama</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adhikari</surname><given-names>Deepak</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Monash University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Melbourne</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mio</surname><given-names>Yasuyuki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Corporation Group Mio Fertility Clinic</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Yonago</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Carroll</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Monash University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Melbourne</named-content></addr-line><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kono</surname><given-names>Tomohiro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Tokyo University of Agriculture</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tokyo</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Funahashi</surname><given-names>Hiroaki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okayama University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Okayama</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wakai</surname><given-names>Takuya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Okayama University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Okayama</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have taken into consideration and addressed all my previous comments.</p><p>This referee has one major concern remaining: although the authors have refined their analysis of mitochondrial morphology, my concern regarding the characterization of mitochondria in Drp1-depleted zygotes as &quot;elongated&quot; persists.</p></disp-quote><p>Taking into account this reviewers' comment, the following description has been changed.

PNAS 2024, PMID 38917013), authors would better further clarify the effect of Myo19-Trim with timelapse (e.g. EB3-GFP/Mt-DsRed) and EM analysis (detailed mitochondrial architecture).</p><p>(3) Authors would better clarify phenotypic heterogeneity/variety regarding the degree of alteration in mitochondrial morphology/ architecture dependent on the levels of Drp1 loss with detailed quantification of EM images to address why aggregation of mitochondria in Drp1-/- parthenote (possibly, more likely Drp1 protein-free) looks different/weaker than Trim-awayed one. Employment of the parthenotes of Trim-awayed MII oocytes might also complement the further discussion.</p><p>The revised preprinted have addressed all the points described above. Authors have also adequately indicated the limitations at each of the specific points. Revisions authors made have consolidated their conclusion, thus still, making this study an excellent one.The only remaining weakness is that the authors have not undertaken additional experiments to clarify any role for mitochondrial transport following Drp1 depletion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank again reviewer 3 for the insightful comments. We would like to address the comments you have raised (points that were unclear in this study) as issues for future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
