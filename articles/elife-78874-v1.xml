confers skeletal myofibers a pivotal role in glycemia regulation. Chronic myoplasmic calcium elevation (“calcium stress”), found in malignant hyperthermia-susceptible (MHS) patients and multiple myopathies, has been suggested to underlie the progression from hyperglycemia to insulin resistance. What drives such progression remains elusive. We find that muscle cells derived from MHS patients have increased content of an activated fragment of GSK3β — a specialized kinase that inhibits glycogen synthase, impairing glucose utilization and delineating a path to hyperglycemia. We also find decreased content of junctophilin1, an essential structural protein that colocalizes in the couplon with the voltage-sensing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.1, the calcium channel RyR1 and calpain1, accompanied by an increase in a 44 kDa junctophilin1 fragment (JPh44) that moves into nuclei. We trace these changes to activated proteolysis by calpain1, secondary to increased myoplasmic calcium. We demonstrate that a JPh44-like construct induces transcriptional changes predictive of increased glucose utilization in myoblasts, including less transcription and translation of GSK3β and decreased transcription of proteins that reduce utilization of glucose. These effects reveal a stress-adaptive response, mediated by the novel regulator of transcription JPh44.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>glucose transport</kwd><kwd>immunocytochemistry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR071381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riazi</surname><given-names>Sheila</given-names></name><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR072602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111254</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S1055024707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>Eduardo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Novel components in the pathway from malignant hyperthermia to diabetes include promotion of a kinase that impedes glycogen synthesis, increased lysis of junctophilin1 and gene regulatory actions by a junctophilin fragment, surprisingly predicted to oppose the effects of elevated calcium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the excitation-contraction (EC) coupling process of striated muscles, action potential depolarization of the plasma or transverse (T) tubule membranes command the transient release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the myoplasm, enabling muscle contraction.

The primary defect in MHS is an alteration of RyR1 or another couplon protein, which leads to an increase in resting or activated openness of the channel.

MHS animals also showed increased calpain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Michelucci et al., 2017</xref>).

Instead, the C-terminal FLAG (red) appeared in both nuclear and extra-nuclear regions — corresponding to the cytosol and other organelles. The intensity of the intranuclear FLAG signal was highly variable in individual nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Within the cytosol, the FLAG tag was distributed in two forms: punctate, colocalized with (N-terminal) GFP fluorescence, as well as a finely particulate disperse form, away from GFP, obviously corresponding to a fragment cleaved at a position distal to the N terminus.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Distribution of a dually tagged JPh1 and its fragments.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Confocal images of cells expressing the (N)GFP-JPh1-FLAG(C) construct.

When the plasmid was expressed in myotubes derived from human muscle, a difference greater than twofold, again in favor of GFP, was found (panels 3B and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). A clear nuclear internalization of FLAG, with exclusion of GFP, was also found in adult mouse muscle expressing the plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

This was not the case for the native JPh44 in myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which suggests that the perinuclear buildup be a consequence of the steep gradient generated by the transient increase of concentration of the fragment, combined with a diffusion barrier at the nuclear membrane. The accumulation might also reflect a sequence difference between the exogenous piece and JPh44. This explanation is refuted however, by the absence of perinuclear FLAG accumulation in myotubes expressing the construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ad</xref>, Bd), which instead suggests a slower production of the protein or a lower barrier to nuclear entry in developing cells.</p><p>In the transfected mouse myofibers we also found the N-terminal GFP strictly colocalized with endogenous RyR1 at triads, reproducing the high colocalization of endogenous JPh1 and RyR1 found in human myofibers (illustrated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations allow three conclusions: (1) in both developing and adult tissue, the full-size protein is attached to junctions between plasma or T membrane and SR. (2) The C terminus is part of the cleaved fragment that migrates into the I band and enters nuclei. (3) The N terminus of JPh1 stays with the plasma or T membrane, whether as part of the full protein or after cleavage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Elevated cytosolic calcium concentration mediates the increase in JPh1 cleavage</title><p>Resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in myofibers of MHN and MHS human subjects was reported as 112 nM and 485 nM, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lopez et al., 1992</xref>).

From this vantage point, we demonstrated consequences of cleavage of junctophilin1.

By contrast, JPh1 remained outside, largely in clusters corresponding to developing T-SR junctions, as revealed by high colocalization with RyR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Dd</xref>, Fa, b and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To define the primary sequence of JPh44, the construct (N)GFP-JPh1-FLAG(C) was expressed in myotubes and adult mouse muscle. The consistent presence of the FLAG tag inside nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) plus the persistence of the N-terminal GFP in the cytosol, forming clusters analogous to those of JPh1 and RyR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) in myotubes, and staying aligned with junctional triads in myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), unambiguously indicate that the doubly-tagged exogenous protein undergoes cleavage similar to the endogenous JPh1, and that the cleaved fraction that enters nuclei -- corresponding to JPh44 -- includes the C terminus of JPh1. The persistence of GFP outside nuclei indicates that the N-terminal fragment cleaved from JPh1 conserves at least some of the features, presumably the MORN motifs, by which JPh1 attaches to T tubule and plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>). However, the stable location of the N-terminal cleavage fragment of JPh1 at triad junctions is inconsistent with the proposal that assigns the specific triadic location of JPh1 to its ability to dimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rossi et al., 2019</xref>), as this ability is likely lost in the N-terminal fragment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> determines JPh1 fragmentation and relocation</title><p>Direct perfusion of permeabilized human myofiber bundles with elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations resulted in reciprocal changes in JPh1 and JPh44 content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>).

This process included a large increase in JPh44 content in blots of the nuclear fraction extracted from MHS patients muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>), which positively correlated with the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> measured in myotubes derived from the same patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

An algorithm predictive of calpain cleavage sites within protein sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) contributed evidence of involvement of calpain1. Among the predicted cleavage sites in JPh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), the one with the highest score, at R240-S241, is highly conserved in mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), producing in every ortholog a C-terminal fragment of approximately 46 kDa. This exercise proposes JPh44 as the C-terminal fragment of JPh1 with N terminus at S241. The cleavage site S233-S234, also of high probability score, suggests an alternative sequence, identical except for 7 additional aminoacid residues at the N terminus. The extra residues would neither cause a difference in molecular weight detectable by electrophoresis nor be likely to change other physicochemical properties, including putative gene regulatory functions suggested by the nuclear localization. Both cleavage sites predict an N-terminal fragment that contains 6 MORN motifs, a prediction consistent with the observation that the N-terminal fragment of JPh1 stays at T-SR junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Recent cryo-EM evidence of the tertiary structure of JPh isoforms 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2022</xref>) contradicts the conventional view of the helical backbone as spanning the inter-membrane gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lehnart and Wehrens, 2022</xref>), suggesting instead a detailed, presumably tight association of this region with the β sheet formed by the MORNs. If this were the case, a single cut at either site might not be sufficient to allow separation of the distal fragment, suggesting instead that both cuts might be necessary to free JPh44.</p><p>A key aspect of this process is the link between elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> and activation of calpain to directly cleave JPh1. The link was first described in skeletal muscle, starting from the notion that acutely elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> impairs EC coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blazev and Lamb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lamb et al., 1995</xref>), followed by the demonstration of calpain activation and junctophilin proteolysis at Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in a range ≥500 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murphy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Verburg et al., 2009</xref>). Activation of calpain1 requires only moderate elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (50–300 nM) and includes autolysis of its main subunit, which removes an N-terminal piece to bring the molecular weight from 80 to 76 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goll et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suzuki et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moldoveanu et al., 2002</xref>). We found that in MHS muscle, the fraction of calpain1 in 76 kDa form is about 80% higher than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and F</xref>). That this piece represents activated protease was affirmed by the high negative correlation between the drop in JPh1 content and the fraction of truncated protease in MHS muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). A negative correlation of similar significance between calpain truncation and content of the full-length GSK3β is evidence of an additional role of calpain1, namely proteolysis and activation of the GS kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the calpain1 predictive algorithm, the protease cleaved the JPh1 protein extracted from human muscle in vitro, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, to a form with the same apparent molecular weight of the native fragment we call JPh44, an action suppressed by a calpain inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Additional evidence linking calpain activation to JPh1 cleavage was obtained by its expression in human myotubes. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, heterologous expressed calpain caused a visible increase of JPh44 — distinct from the full-size protein for adopting a fine-grained appearance— which moved massively into nuclei (Cell 1 of panels 6B and D, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Concomitantly, the colocalization of JPh and RyR1 was diminished (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). Also consistent with cleavage of JPh1 by the heterologous calpain1 is the high colocalization of the two molecules, contrasting with the low colocalization of JPh44 and the protease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies reported that calpains cleave couplon proteins, including RyR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Place et al., 2015</xref>) and STAC3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashida et al., 2021</xref>). The present findings show that the protease is at the right location for those actions. Both endogenous calpain1, imaged by immunofluorescence in human muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and FLAG-tagged calpain1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) were found precisely located at triad junctions; the location was confirmed by its high colocalization scores with JPh1 and with RyR1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3 table6">Tables 3 and 6</xref>). The observations support the proposal that the protease is freely diffusible in apo form but binds to cellular structures immediately upon exposure to high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van Steensel et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, the quantitative measures of colocalization with RyR1, especially the spatial shift and Gaussian spread obtained with the Van Steensel method, show that the junctional protein JPh1 has a tighter overlap with RyR1 than calpain1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>), which suggests the coexistence of bound and diffusible forms of the protease.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>From Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation to hyperglycemia and diabetes</title><p>The results reviewed above establish with a high degree of confidence that the reduction in JPh1 content observed in MHS patients is caused by calpain1, activated by excess cytosolic calcium, and that the activated calpain also cleaves the specific kinase of glycogen synthase GSK3β, with inhibitory consequences on glycogen synthesis.

Surprisingly, however, L-S Song’s group went on to demonstrate that a large N-terminal calpain1-cleaved fragment of JPh2, named JPH2-NTP, enters nuclei, where it regulates transcription of multiple genes, with consequences that oppose the damaging effects of activated proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lahiri et al., 2020</xref> reported the presence of a ~25 kDa C-terminal product of cleavage by calpain2, which was shown to be causative of cellular hypertrophy, rather than compensatory.</p><p>The present observations establish similarities and differences between the roles of JPh44 and those of the fragments described in cardiac muscle. The distribution of exogenous doubly tagged JPh1 and its fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) establishes that JPh44 is a C-terminal fragment. The calpain predictive algorithm, together with the observed distribution of the GFP-tagged Δ(1-240) JPh1, also establish with high likelihood the site of JPh1 cleavage, at either R240-S241 or S233-S234 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to matching the apparent molecular weight of the endogenous JPh44, the C-terminal fragment resulting from cleavage at either point contains two nuclear location sequences, allowing nuclear import of the fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Like JPH2-NTP, the fragment will have an alanine-rich region (ARR), with helix-turn-helix (HTH) structure, characteristic of DNA-binding proteins. These properties establish with reasonable likelihood the primary structure of JPh44 as the C-terminal fragment of JPh1 that starts at S241 or S234. We used this identification to probe directly the possible roles of JPh44 in adult mice muscle and C2C12 myoblasts. When expressed in muscle of adult mice, the GFP-tagged Δ(1-240) JPh1 appeared located similarly as JPh44 in human muscle, largely within the I band and inside nuclei, eschewing triadic junctions and colocalization with its marker, RyR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In C2C12 myoblasts, the construct likewise distributed inside nuclei, as well as in a fine-grained cytosolic form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with a gene regulatory role of JPh44, the transcription profile (obtained by LC Sciences) of myoblasts expressing GFP-tagged Δ(1-240) JPh1 showed significant alterations in multiple pathways (8B, C). Notably, the profile included significantly reduced mRNA levels of GSK3β and at least 9 proteins that act as brakes on the PI3k-AKT pathway, among which TRAF3, Ces3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lian et al., 2012</xref>), Repin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kern et al., 2014</xref>) and Pck1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gómez-Valadés et al., 2008</xref>) stand out, given their role in muscle metabolism.

Phosphorylation by Akt also inactivates GSK3β, which in turn releases glycogen synthase from inactivation, promoting storage of glucose. Hepatic and skeletal muscle silencing of the four genes named above improved the insulin resistance by inducing phosphorylation of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gómez-Valadés et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kern et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hesselbarth et al., 2017</xref>). Other genes repressed by the exogenous JPh1 fragment JPh44, including Rbp4 (retinol-binding protein 4), Apoc3 (apolipoprotein C-III), MEG3 (maternally expressed gene 3 — a long noncoding RNA) and NGFR contribute to insulin resistance by various actions in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Botteri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baeza-Raja et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>).

Unlike JPH2-NTP, JPh44 retains a second NLS (K588-L614, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

This sensitivity to vectorial displacement is achieved here using an approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">van Steensel et al., 1996</xref>, which again produces a plot and, in this case, two numerical outputs of interest. The approach (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> Ca, c) plots the correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic> between image A and image B shifted in one direction (say, <italic>x</italic>, defined as the longitudinal direction in myofibers) by variable amounts <italic>dx</italic>. The ‘Van Steensel plot’ thus plots <italic>R</italic> (<italic>dx</italic>) vs. <italic>dx</italic>. represented by individual symbols in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ca</xref>. When the two signals are colocalized, the plot is narrow, and centered at dx = 0. If not, the plot displaces its peak (when the delocalization occurs in a preferred direction) and its width increases. Two numerical quantifiers can be derived on a Gaussian fitted to the points: the abscissa of the maximum (here the ‘VS shift’) and the FWHM. These quantifiers reveal vectorial aspects of the relationship between the two markers. The VS shift gives a rough measure of distance when the separation of the molecules has some vectorial regularity and sidedness. The FWHM is a measure of dispersion of one marker or both.

In tables, sample medians are always provided after sample averages, to afford a first idea of the distribution.</p><p>The human samples for protein quantification include 12 ‘normal’ and 13 ‘HS’ individuals selected at random from available samples that satisfy size and preservation criteria. The numbers were chosen for efficiency (as they complete a 25 lane electrophoresis chamber), for consistency with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tammineni et al., 2020</xref>), and after analysis that evinced power consistent with study goals (a power of 0.8 for detecting differences of averages of 30%, with standard deviations of 27% at <italic>α</italic>=0.05, is achieved with a sample size of 24, 12 each).</p><p>There was no blinding and no exclusion criteria other than adequate size and preservation of the sample — no discoloration or gross damage — evaluated visually upon receipt of the biopsy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Availability of raw data</title><p>All quantitative raw data, as well as statistical processing are contained in ‘JNB’ (Sigmaplot) and ‘XLSX’ (Excel) annotated worksheets, publicly available in Harvard Dataverse as ‘Study on junctophilin 1 and calcium stress’ at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/Junctophilin1_and_calcium">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/Junctophilin1_and_calcium</ext-link> included in dataset ‘Raw and processed numerical data’.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Enrique Jaimovich (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The part of the paper including muscle biopsies from the MHS and MHN individuals appears unfinished. The authors need to include more MHN biopsies to be able to make any valuable comparisons, and for being able to conclude if there are any differences between MHS and MHN (and for respect to the individual donating muscle biopsies). One possibility is to submit the data later.</p><p>2) At present in the absence of a solid validation of the ability of antibodies A and B to recognize different band in western blot and in IMF experiments it is difficult to provide a positive answer to the present draft. Also the IMF images need to be carefully revised to provide clear support to the final conclusions.</p><p>3). Tammineni and co-authors provide a new interesting role in skeletal muscle for Junctophilin (44 kD segment, JPh44), where it translocates to the nuclei and interferes/affects transcription. Also, the authors shown that Calpain 1 can digest junctophilin to generate the 44 kDa segment. In general, the muscle field know little about how E-C coupling proteins have duals role and interfere/affect gene regulation that subsequently may alter the muscle function and metabolism. This part of the manuscript is solid, informative, and novel. In this paper, the authors also aim to link elevated Jph44 levels in muscle biopsies (myotubes) of patients with malignant hyperthermia susceptible (MHS) (that also exhibit elevated cytosolic calcium with calpain1-associated increases in Jph44 levels) to hyperglycemia in these patients via enhanced GSK3b activity (which inhibits glycogen synthase etc). This part of the manuscript is more speculative and descriptive and lacks proof-of-concept. Also, the authors often compare myotubes of &quot;patients&quot; (unclear whether this always is MHS, or MHN and MHS, needs to be specified) with murine myofibers (and these are presumably healthy controls, but needs to be clarified), and C2C12 myotubes (also control setting). These three vastly different muscle cells from both control and MH individuals makes any type of comparisons problematic and difficult to interpret the results and diverts ones focus from the more direct results regarding Caplain1- Jph44 – translocation – transcriptional changes. There is also data comparisons between myofibers and myotubes from control settings and how they link to MHS/MHN is difficult to interpret. The authors appear to still have access to MHS and MHN (control) samples, and thus to make the conclusions as suggested in the paper the authors need to include both MHS and MHN in all comparisons performed in the study.</p><p>Page 2, line 30-31: &quot;On the other hand, LS Song and colleagues (27,30) provided evidence that the intra-nuclear actions of JPh2 31 fragments are &quot;stress-adaptive&quot;, partially offsetting the negative consequences of activation of proteolysis&quot;. &quot;Stress&quot; can refer to many things, please define stress in this context.</p><p>4) Figure 1F, in comparison to other blots, it is not listed in the blot which protein was blotted for.</p><p>5) The authors name the JPh antibodies A and B, and then leave it for the reader to find information later in the text about them and how they differ, with the epitope binging to different part of the protein.

In the text the authors describe results as &quot;highly significant&quot; and &quot;marginally significant&quot;, please define what p-values it refers to, respectively.</p><p>7) Page 4, line 14-16: &quot;The tentative conclusion from this observation is that the cleavage process, which may operate in multiple sites and sequentially on cleaved products, blurs any detailed correspondence between increase in content of a given fragment and disappearance of the full-size protein&quot;. Please describe possible fragments that can be generated.</p><p>8_ The authors argue that a possible mechanism for that MHS patients develop hyperglycemia and thus at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, is that GSKb3 inhibits glycogen synthase. In this patient cohort (MHS, MHN), what was the fasting glucose levels? Moreover, skeletal muscle is efficient in taking up (e.g., GLUT4) storing (e.g., GS) and utilizing glucose and carbohydrates (glycolysis, TCA) whereas other tissues are lacking this capacity. Hence, how much difference in GSKb3 activity is needed to impact blood glucose levels on a systemic level? Also, what was the activity (phosphorylation) level of GSKb3 in the human samples? On the same note, the authors have previously reported a decrease in GLUT4 content in muscle from MHS individuals. The manuscript would benefit from that the authors acknowledged this finding and thus give a broader understanding of the alterations in glucose homeostasis that is observed in these individuals.</p><p>9) his might be a misunderstanding on my side, but I read it as the author hypothesize that elevated [ca<sup>2+</sup>]cyt ◊ Caplain 1 ◊ cleveage of JpH -&gt; larger segments stays in cytosol but the Jph44 translocate to nuclei and impact transcription. Also, MHS subjects have higher Jph44 levels. At the same time, Figure 9 shows that the truncated Jph (mimicking Jph44) results in lower GSK3b expression. What was the protein and phosphorylation levels of this GSK3b? Also, would not a lower GSK3b correspond to less capacity to block GS and thus not be contributing to hyperglycemia as argued above? Please clarify.</p><p>10) Page 4, line 22-23 PhK reciprocally activates X… is followed by inhibits Y… Both describes a reduction/inhibition/antagonizing effect of PhK but by using an indirect and direct description, would be more reader friendly to use a direct description for both activities.</p><p>11) In the manuscript, the term &quot;patients&quot; are often used, but not specified if MHN or MHS, please clarify throughout the text.</p><p>12) Figure 2. Are these data from control mice? Or MHS-derived material?</p><p>13) Figure 3I, were these ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements performed recently or associated to an earlier publication of the co-authors? Also, the 240 on the x-axis is cropped and x-axis is also partly cropped in 3J?</p><p>14) Figure 1 A and B show a western blot of proteins isolated from muscles of MHN and MHS individuals decorated with two different antibodies directed against JPH1. According to the manufacturer, antibody A is directed against the JPH1 protein sequence encompassing amino acids 387 to 512 while antibody B is directed against a no better specified C-terminal region of JPH1. Surprisingly, antibody B appears not to detect the full-length protein in lysates from human muscles, but recognizes only the 44 kDa fragment of JPH1. However, to the best of the reviewer's knowledge, antibody B has been reported by other laboratories to recognize the full-length JPH1 protein.</p><p>Thus, is not obvious why here this antibody should recognize only the shorter fragment. In addition, in MHS individuals there is no direct correlation between reduction in the content of the full-length JPH1 protein and appearance of the 44 kDa JPH1fragment, since, as also reported by the authors, no significant difference between MHN and MHS can be observed concerning the amount of the 44 kDa JPH1.</p><p>15) The authors show in supplemental Figure 1 that antibody B in total lysates from patients 164 and 167 preferentially recognizes the 44 kDa fragment of JPH1, but also a band at about 100 kDa.</p><p>Did the authors consider that the 100 kDa band may correspond to full-length JPH1, as also shown by Murphy et al., 2013 ?</p><p>Actually, according to Murphy et al., 2013, the 72 kDa protein detected by antibody A in this report represents a proteolytic fragment of full-length JPH1. Showing the entire membrane decorated with antibodies A and B may help to clarify these points.</p><p>Based on the data presented, it is very difficult to accept that antibody A and B have specific selectivity for JPH1 and the 44 kDa fragment of JPH1.</p><p>A good control would be to express the full length JPH1 and the JPH44 fragment and perform western blot and immunofluorescence staining with antibodies A and B. In the absence of direct evidence of the specificity of these staining, the Western Blots are not very convincing and the immunofluorescence data even more so.</p><p>16) In Figure 2B staining of a nucleus is shown only with antibody B against the 44 kDa JPH1 fragment, while no nucleus stained with antibody A is shown in Figure 2A. Images should all be at the same level of magnification and nuclear staining of nuclei with antibody A should be reported.</p><p>In Figure 2Db labeling of JPH1 covers both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, does it mean that JPH1 also goes to the nucleus? One would rather think that background immunofluorescence may provide a confounding staining and authors should be more cautious in interpreting these data.</p><p>Images in 2D and 2E refer to primary myotubes derived from patients. The authors show that RyR1 signals co-localizes with full-length JPH1, but not with the 44 kDa fragment, recognized by antibody B. How do the authors establish myotube differentiation?</p><p>Control (MHN) myotubes and myofibers should be shown as well. Can they provide images of entire myotubes, possibly captured at different Z planes? How can they exclude they are labeling perinuclear SR membranes? Can the authors show a Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from differentiated MHN and MHS myotubes showing immunoreactivity with the two antibodies?</p><p>17) Figure 3 A-C. The authors show images of a full-length JPH1 tagged with GFP at the N-terminus and FLAG at the C-terminus. In Figure 3Ad and Cd the Flag signal is all over the cytoplasm and the nuclei: since these are normal mouse cells and fibers, it is surprising that the FLAG signal is in the nuclei with an intensity of signal higher than in patient's muscle.</p><p>Can the authors supply images of entire myotubes, possibly captured in different Z planes? How can they distinguish between the cleaved and uncleaved JPH1 signals, especially in mouse myofibers, where calpain is supposed not to be so active as in MHS muscle fibers?</p><p>18) If the 44 kDa JPH1 fragment contains a transmembrane domain, it is difficult to understand the dual sarcoplasmic reticulum and nuclear localization. To justify this the authors, in the Discussion session, mention a hypothetical vesicular transport of the 44 kDa JPH1 fragment by vesicles. Traffic of proteins to the nucleus usually occurs through the nuclear pores and does not require vesicles. Even if diffusion from the SR membrane to the nuclear envelope occurs, the protein should remain in the compartment of the membrane envelope. There is no established evidence to support such an unusual movement inside the cells.</p><p>19) In Figure 5, the authors show the effect of Calpain1 on the full-length and 44 kDa JPH1 fragment in muscles from MHS patients. Can the authors repeat the same analysis on recombinant JPH1 tagged with GFP and FLAG? Can the authors provide images from MHN muscle fibers stained with JPH1 and Calpain1.</p><p>20) In Figure 6, the authors show images of MHS derived myotubes transfected with FLAG Calpain1 and compare the distribution of endogenous JPH1 and RYR1 in two cells, one expressing FLAG Calpain1 (cell1) and one not expressing the recombinant protein. They state that cell1 shows a strong signal of JPH1 in the nucleus, while this is not observed in cell2. Nevertheless, it is not clear where the nucleus is located within cell2 since the distribution of JPH1 is homogeneous across the cell. Can the authors show a different cell?</p><p>21) In Figure 7, panels Bb and Db: nuclei appear to stain positive for JPH1. It is not clear why in panels Ac, Bc they show a RYR1 staining while in panels Cc and Dc they show N-myc staining. The differential localization to nuclei appears rather poor also in these panels.</p><p>22) The strong nuclear staining in Figure 8, panels C and D is very different from the staining observed in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Transfection should not change the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution.</p><p>23) Transcriptomic analysis was performed on a population of C2C12 transfected with the GFP-∆(1-240)JPH1 plasmid. Given that the muscles from MHS patients are available, the reviewer suggest performing transcriptomic analysis on muscle fibers from MHS patients as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78874.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The part of the paper including muscle biopsies from the MHS and MHN individuals appears unfinished.

To summarize: in agreement with criticism from Rev. 3, we acknowledge that ab A reacts to both JPh1 and the 44 kDa fragment. In fact, new comparisons of signals and analysis of their colocalization in cells expressing separately the two proteins (suggested by the referee), show that the ab reacts equally to both the full sequence JPh1 and the C-terminal fragment that starts at residue #241 (our “stand-in” for JPh44). By contrast, and confirming our original view, the experiments confirm the specificity of ab B for the fragment. Detailed results and interpretation are provided in this document with responses to items 14 and 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Tammineni and co-authors provide a new interesting role in skeletal muscle for Junctophilin (44 kD segment, JPh44), where it translocates to the nuclei and interferes/affects transcription.

In synergy with the mechanism that we previously reported (<italic>eLife</italic> 2020) it constitutes evidence for a double hit on glycogen synthesis<italic>.</italic> Also, we uncover lysis of a crucial structural protein, with at least one major fragment migrating into nuclei. In addition, the associated changes in expression of multiple genes suggest an evolving attempt for a compensatory response. We posit that the potential compensatory response may not suffice, however, to offset the net reduction in glucose storage by the muscle. On balance, this could result in a net contribution to the observed hyperglycemia in the MHS patients.</p><p>This analysis is now included in the manuscript.

Animal muscles and cultures were used to evaluate mechanistic links with manipulations not doable on human muscle biopsies. Having stated this, we agree that the multiplicity of approaches may not add clarity and have removed from the manuscript the studies using extracellular application of calpain (and removed original Figure 7 and Tables 7, 8 and 9), while strengthening other evidence with additional studies illustrated with supplemental figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also data comparisons between myofibers and myotubes from control settings and how they link to MHS/MHN is difficult to interpret.

Just those favored sites predict a large number of fragments. The cleavage probabilities in situ will be altered further as lysis progresses, eliciting conformational changes that may lead to site exposure or masking in the newly created fragments. In such scenarios, multiple fragments may form at different rates, both from full-length JPh1 and from secondary cleavage. A reasonably complete determination of fragments would require an in-depth experimental study, exemplified by that of Wang et al. (2021) on JPh2. For the reasons above we have limited our consideration to the fragments that we do find in substantial amounts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors argue that a possible mechanism for that MHS patients develop hyperglycemia and thus at a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, is that GSKb3 inhibits glycogen synthase.

The control of GS is in turn also multiple and complex. Then the control of glycogen glucose balance is controlled at various points. Add to that the many other ways in which utilization of glucose by muscle is regulated, starting with the uptake transport mechanisms and the concurrent utilization by other tissues. (We believe this multicausal genesis of hyperglycemia explains the delayed onset of it, and diabetes, relative to the Ca stress and MHS condition at the level of muscle.)

What we additionally find is a full set of gene modulatory effects, upon expression of the exogenous JPh44-mimic, including reduction of GSK3β at the transcriptional and protein levels (Figure 9, now 8 D-J), which we interpret as compensatory for the primary activation of calpain and kinases.

According to the manufacturer, antibody A is directed against the JPH1 protein sequence encompassing amino acids 387 to 512 while antibody B is directed against a no better specified C-terminal region of JPH1. Surprisingly, antibody B appears not to detect the full-length protein in lysates from human muscles, but recognizes only the 44 kDa fragment of JPH1. However, to the best of the reviewer's knowledge, antibody B has been reported by other laboratories to recognize the full-length JPH1 protein.</p><p>Thus, is not obvious why here this antibody should recognize only the shorter fragment.</p></disp-quote><p>Antibody B is polyclonal, raised against mouse C terminal immunogen, and readily reacts with mice and the rat's full JPh1. Earlier evidence of ab B detecting full-length JPh1 was demonstrated in only murine models. In fact, both full-length and JPh44 in mice extracts are detected by ab B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The failure of ab B to react with human JPh1 has already been noted by Murphy et al.(3) and confirmed by G.D. Lamb in personal communications.</p><p>Dr. Lamb attributes the failure to the murine origin of the immunogen. This fact cannot also justify the reactivity of ab B with the 44 kDa fragment in human extracts. We have performed new experiments to validate and clarify the specificity of ab B, which are included as Figure 1—figure supplement 2 in this revision, and will be discussed further in the answer to item 15.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ab B reacts with the large protein in mice but not human extracts (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 in revised version).</title><p>Note also that the large, presumably full-size JPh1 from mice migrates at higher molecular weight markings than the human protein.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78874-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, in MHS individuals there is no direct correlation between reduction in the content of the full-length JPH1 protein and appearance of the 44 kDa JPH1fragment, since, as also reported by the authors, no significant difference between MHN and MHS can be observed concerning the amount of the 44 kDa JPH1.</p><p>15) The authors show in supplemental Figure 1 that antibody B in total lysates from patients 164 and 167 preferentially recognizes the 44 kDa fragment of JPH1, but also a band at about 100 kDa.</p><p>Did the authors consider that the 100 kDa band may correspond to full-length JPH1, as also shown by Murphy et al., 2013 ?</p><p>Actually, according to Murphy et al., 2013, the 72 kDa protein detected by antibody A in this report represents a proteolytic fragment of full-length JPH1.</p></disp-quote><p>Multiple apparent molecular weights of JPh1 as calculated by electrophoretic migration have been reported, in both published literature and antibody database web pages (cf. https://www.proteinatlas. org/ENSG00000104369-JPH1/antibody#western_blot). In our gels from human extracts, the largest protein detected as JPh1 migrates at 72-75 kDa (Figure 1, 3, 5), which is consistent with the molecular weight of derived from the sequence (71.7 kDa). See also new Supplemental Figures 1 and 2 to Figure 1 in this revision, documenting that our antibodies mark only one band of molecular weight near the value predicted for the full JPh1 sequence.</p><p>Additionally, the 100 kDa band detected by ab B in the original supplemental figure (now superseded) is not more intense than several other weakly stained bands, which suggests that the staining there is non-specific.</p><p>We acknowledge in the revised article the possibility of minor degradation of the top-size protein, given the doublet band at 72 kDa in many lanes of text Figure 1A and the difference in migration size between murine and human protein in Response Figure 1. However, and referring to the same figure, in spite of the detection of a massive band at ~70 kDa in the lane with human extract, there is no detection at higher molecular weights, which argues against major degradation of the human protein. In consideration of these concerns, we added a “Limitations” section in Discussion (pages 24, bottom, and 25, top).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Showing the entire membrane decorated with antibodies A and B may help to clarify these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We designed an experiment, documented in Supplement 2 to Figure 1, to specifically address this question. The blotted membrane from an electrophoresed gel of human muscle protein was divided in halves, which were separately reacted with antibodies A and B (please note again: the abs were applied on separate halves of a common blot). The gel contained, in duplicate, increasing amounts of protein extract. Ab A detected 72 and 44 kDa bands, with signals roughly proportional to quantity of extract in each lane. Ab B detected JPh44, also commensurate with added extract, and no other protein above the 44 kDa band. (Both antibodies also detected a 30 kDa band of density that varied erratically with lane protein content, the meaning of which could not be interpreted). The experiment, which required a brief pretreatment with calpain to increase the proportion of JPh44, also confirmed that the content of the fragment is much lower than that of JPh1 in most conditions. In recognizing this fact, we are revising our previous assertion that ab A preferentially tags JPh1. An additional experiment shown later will demonstrate a similar affinity for both antigens. We are grateful to the reviewers for noting our error.</p><p>The striking and convenient specificity of ab B is also shown in our immunofluorescence images, as ab B did not stain endogenous full-length JPh1 protein at triad junctions or recombinant expression of GFP-JPh1 in <italic>in-vitro</italic> cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on the data presented, it is very difficult to accept that antibody A and B have specific selectivity for JPH1 and the 44 kDa fragment of JPH1.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in previous paragraphs, we now accept that ab A does not have specificity for JPh1 over the fragment; on the other hand, the experiments demonstrate clearly the specificity of ab B for JPh44.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A good control would be to express the full length JPH1 and the JPH44 fragment and perform western blot and immunofluorescence staining with antibodies A and B. In the absence of direct evidence of the specificity of these staining, the Western Blots are not very convincing and the immunofluorescence data even more so.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the uncropped Western blots with ab A and ab B in Supplement 2 to Figure 1, we include the imaging experiment requested. We transfected C2C12 myoblasts with the fusion constructs GFP- JPh1 and GFP-∆(1-240) JPh1 and stained the cultures with ab A and ab B. Images and analysis of colocalization of IF stains and GFP are documented in Supplement Figure 1 to Figure 8. Images and analysis are consistent with our conclusion that ab A tags the endogenous JPh1 and JPh44 (colocalization is quite precisely the same for both ab A signals –Figure 5, panels F, H). As for ab B, some staining was present on cells transfected with the GFP-JPh1 full-size construct, but it was visibly weaker than on cells expressing GFP-JPh44. The analysis correspondingly showed a reduction by ~50% of the colocalization parameters. That there was ab B signal in JPh1-expressing cells does not disprove the specificity of ab B for JPh44, as it could have other explanations (e.g., cleavage by endogenous calpain of the expressed full-size fusion protein, which would produce a 44 kDa fragment poorly localized with GFP). In all, these results establish ab B (an antibody raised against a murine antigen!), as a serendipitous tool to detect the 44 kDa fragment in human muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) In Figure 2B staining of a nucleus is shown only with antibody B against the 44 kDa JPH1 fragment, while no nucleus stained with antibody A is shown in Figure 2A. Images should all be at the same level of magnification and nuclear staining of nuclei with antibody A should be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2A was prepared precisely to show how ab A fails to stain nuclei. This is illustrated in the “window” (showing exclusively ab A signal) within the 3D rendering of panel 2Aa. Rendering 2Aa is presented at a magnification that allows visualization of some nuclei, two of which are partly included in the “window”, to show the absence of ab A signal. The other panels in row A are chosen to show details of localization of the antibody, in triads marked by RyR1.</p><p>To allay the reviewers’ concern, we now add Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which shows other regions of the same fiber bundle. As requested, ab A and other stains at low magnification are in row A, demonstrating no visible ab A inside nuclei. Rows B and C compare the same signals in two regions: one with conserved structure, the other with triads disrupted and general misalignment, consistent with fiber damage. While we have not confirmed the impression with statistics, intra-nuclear staining with ab A is clearly visible in damaged regions, in this and other biopsies. Ab A staining per se cannot tell the larger protein from its fragment; our conclusion that the intra-nuclear signal corresponds largely to the fragment is based on staining with ab B (the arguments and additional data were presented with items 14 and 15; additional ones are in our response to the next question).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2Db labeling of JPH1 covers both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, does it mean that JPH1 also goes to the nucleus? One would rather think that background immunofluorescence may provide a confounding staining and authors should be more cautious in interpreting these data.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, new WB and image assays (supplemental Figures 2 and 3 to Figure 3, supplemental figure to Figure 8) show that ab A reacts equally well with JPh1 at 72 kDa and the 44 kDa fragment.</p><p>In Figure 2Db, ab A detects the protein both outside and inside the nucleus of the primary myotubes. Cytosolic punctate that is colocalized with Ryr1 represents full-length JPh1. Protein reacting with ab A inside nuclei could be 72 kDa JPh1; however, other evidence (e.g., figures 3, 7, Supp. 2 to Figure 1) shows that the 72 kDa protein is excluded from nuclei, while Figures3G and 8 show the 44 kDa protein and its “stand-in” inside nuclei. This suggests that the nuclear staining by ab A observed in primary myotubes represents the 44 kDa fragment rather than being non-specific.</p><p>To additionally argue that the ab A signal in myotubes is largely specific, note differences in nuclear staining by ab A between MHN and MHS myotubes in the videos presented in response to Item 3. Also, in Figure 3 J, a high correlation is demonstrated between the ab A nuclear/cytosolic signal ratio and [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyto</sub> in primary myotubes of different subjects, again in favor of a specific nature of the antibody signal. Finally, a full comparison of expression of constructs in C2C!2, (new Figure 8—figure supplement 1) also demonstrates, via colocalization analysis, the specific nature of ab A signals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Images in 2D and 2E refer to primary myotubes derived from patients.

Thanks for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors show a Western blot analysis of proteins extracted from differentiated MHN and MHS myotubes showing immunoreactivity with the two antibodies?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a worthwhile goal. At this point, however, we limited our myotubes studies to IF experiments because they allow us to avoid myoblasts and fibroblasts, which complicate the interpretation of Western blots. We have found that MHN and MHH myotubes are of different size, and evolve differently. The observations, which are ongoing, are beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Figure 3 A-C. The authors show images of a full-length JPH1 tagged with GFP at the N-terminus and FLAG at the C-terminus. In Figure 3Ad and Cd the Flag signal is all over the cytoplasm and the nuclei: since these are normal mouse cells and fibers, it is surprising that the FLAG signal is in the nuclei with an intensity of signal higher than in patient's muscle.</p></disp-quote><p>The purpose of the approach illustrated in Figure 3 is to test whether the JPh fragment translocated to the nucleus is C terminal. The intensity with which the fragment is marked changes between cell types; even within the same cell, it can vary from region to region based on the state of the fiber. As shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, most nuclei have low or no FLAG signal. As shown in with Figure 2—figure supplement 1, ab A, which tags equally JPh1 and JPh44, appears within nuclei in areas of altered structure and presumably high Ca, but not visibly in regions of normal structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors supply images of entire myotubes, possibly captured in different Z planes? How can they distinguish between the cleaved and uncleaved JPH1 signals, especially in mouse myofibers, where calpain is supposed not to be so active as in MHS muscle fibers?</p></disp-quote><p>A perceptive point. For immunoimaging we use thin bundles, which may include damaged fibers. As shown in the previous response, translocation of the C-terminal fragment to the nucleus is variable. Animated “trips” through the full z-stacks from which images in panels A-C were taken are provided as Supplemental videos to Figure 3. The reviewer’s assertion that immunoimaging with ab A does not permit distinguishing between the two JPh1 forms is correct. That distinction can only be made on the basis of ab B staining.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18) If the 44 kDa JPH1 fragment contains a transmembrane domain, it is difficult to understand the dual sarcoplasmic reticulum and nuclear localization. To justify this the authors, in the Discussion session, mention a hypothetical vesicular transport of the 44 kDa JPH1 fragment by vesicles. Traffic of proteins to the nucleus usually occurs through the nuclear pores and does not require vesicles. Even if diffusion from the SR membrane to the nuclear envelope occurs, the protein should remain in the compartment of the membrane envelope. There is no established evidence to support such an unusual movement inside the cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the argument, we do not have specific evidence for a vesicular pathway, hence we have removed the speculation from the Discussion.</p><p>On the question whether the protein that enters nuclei includes the TMD: the nuclear localization signal (NLS) mapper identified two bipartite NLS sequences downstream of the preferred calpain cleavage site in JPh1, as indicated in Figure 4. Despite the presence of a similar TMD in a JPh2 C-terminal fragment, Lahiri et al. (4) showed that a homologous NLS allowed the nuclear translocation of the fragment in cardiomyocytes. Similarly, we believe that NLS sequences in JPh44 may allow its nuclear relocation in spite of the TMD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) In Figure 5, the authors show the effect of Calpain1 on the full-length and 44 kDa JPH1 fragment in muscles from MHS patients. Can the authors repeat the same analysis on recombinant JPH1 tagged with GFP and FLAG?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that confirmatory evidence of the calpain effect on dual-tagged recombinant JPh1 would be desirable. However, we think an in-depth study is required to follow up on the number of JPh1 fragments generated by calpain (or by different calpain isoforms) and their positions, similar to the detailed study of JPh2 fragmentation Wang et al. in 2021 (5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors provide images from MHN muscle fibers stained with JPH1 and Calpain1.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide the images requested as Supplement 1 to Figure 5. As in the original example, calpain partially colocalized with JPh1 at triads, without any visible difference with its distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20) In Figure 6, the authors show images of MHS derived myotubes transfected with FLAG Calpain1 and compare the distribution of endogenous JPH1 and RYR1 in two cells, one expressing FLAG Calpain1 (cell1) and one not expressing the recombinant protein. They state that cell1 shows a strong signal of JPH1 in the nucleus, while this is not observed in cell2. Nevertheless, it is not clear where the nucleus is located within cell2 since the distribution of JPH1 is homogeneous across the cell. Can the authors show a different cell?</p></disp-quote><p>The requested set of images, of cell cultures with and without transfection of the calpain construct, are provided as Supplementary Figure 1 to Figure 6. In defense of the original figure, which we would like to keep, we find major value in the visualization side-by-side, in the same images, of two cells with different content of exogenous calpain, one with full expression and the other with none. This concurrence allows a direct comparison, without the usual confounding factors associated with variable staining and other conditions. However, we agree that visibility of nuclei is not the best in the example. In the supplemental figure, nuclei are shown better in the calpain-expressing cells and are specifically stained in the control culture.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) In Figure 7, panels Bb and Db: nuclei appear to stain positive for JPH1. It is not clear why in panels Ac, Bc they show a RYR1 staining while in panels Cc and Dc they show N-myc staining. The differential localization to nuclei appears rather poor also in these panels.</p></disp-quote><p>This criticism, reinforced by commentaries to our prepublication in BioRxiv, indicates that the experiments illustrated in Figure 7 add clutter rather than clarity. In the revised version, we removed references to these experiments, the figure and 3 related tables (original figures 8-10 are now 7-9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) The strong nuclear staining in Figure 8, panels C and D is very different from the staining observed in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Transfection should not change the ratio between nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>Transfection is an intrusive procedure, which requires production and trafficking of an exogenous protein. This protein, furthermore, is an artificial construct (in this case, a “stand-in”, which adds to the native protein and therefore is akin to overexpression). For the above reasons, we believe that differences in intensity of nuclear staining may obey to multiple causes and should not be especially concerning.</p><p>A simple example of the differences is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Upon antibody exposure, all nuclei in human myofibers stained for JPh44, as shown in the top row of images.

One is to characterize the effect of the deletion protein on a preparation that is further developed than the one we used. To this end, we prioritized the effect in myotubes and in mouse muscle (where the challenge –as illustrated in the previous figure—has been to obtain transfection of a sufficient number of nuclei AND to quantify this fraction -- required for a quantitative interpretation of the results). The transcriptional comparison between MHN and MHS human subjects faces difficulties of a different nature. The differences at the cellular level that we and others have described result from post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, lysis) and have only been revealed by comparisons between groups. Together with the difficulties with recruitment (which we mentioned earlier in this response), these considerations justify a lower priority for the exploration of transcriptomics in human subjects.</p></body></sub-article></article>
