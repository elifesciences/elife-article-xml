climate-resilient crops. Despite the known negative effects of heat stress on plant reproduction, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of elevated temperature on centromere structure and chromosome segregation during meiosis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Consistent with previous studies, heat stress leads to a decline in fertility and micronuclei formation in pollen mother cells. Our results reveal that elevated temperature causes a decrease in the amount of centromeric histone and the kinetochore protein BMF1 at meiotic centromeres with increasing temperature. Furthermore, we show that heat stress increases the duration of meiotic divisions and prolongs the activity of the spindle assembly checkpoint during meiosis I, indicating an impaired efficiency of the kinetochore attachments to spindle microtubules. Our analysis of mutants with reduced levels of centromeric histone suggests that weakened centromeres sensitize plants to elevated temperature, resulting in meiotic defects and reduced fertility even at moderate temperatures. These results indicate that the structure and functionality of meiotic centromeres in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are highly sensitive to heat stress, and suggest that centromeres and kinetochores may represent a critical bottleneck in plant adaptation to increasing temperatures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>centremeres</kwd><kwd>micronuclei</kwd><kwd>spindle assembly checkpoint</kwd><kwd>centromeric histone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Czech Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21-25163J</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riha</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LE2299/5-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lermontova</surname><given-names>Inna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, Czech Republic</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM2018129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riha</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sensitivity of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> meiotic centromeres to heat stress suggests that centromere function is one of the key determinants of plant reproduction under rising temperatures.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Global warming impacts crop productivity with more frequent and extreme heatwaves being particularly damaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brás et al., 2021</xref>). The lower yields associated with heatwaves are mainly attributed to the impairment of the plant reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lippmann et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, a fundamental understanding of how heat stress affects plant reproduction can guide breeding strategies toward generating climate change-resilient crops. Heat stress impairs both male and female reproductive structures, but male gametogenesis is particularly sensitive to higher temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zinn et al., 2010</xref>). Studies in crop and non-crop species have shown that heat stress affects pollen count, morphology, viability, dehiscence, germination, and pollen tube growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Storme and Geelen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaturvedi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Acute heat stress applied at different stages of flower development has been found to have the most detrimental effect during microsporogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pécrix et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hedhly et al., 2020</xref>). Meiosis, a reductive cell division that halves number of chromosomes in two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation, is a crucial step of microsporogenesis. It is a relatively slow process, lasting approximately 1.5–2 days in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and barley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prusicki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Valuchova et al., 2020</xref>). Prophase I, the longest phase of meiosis, is characterized by pairing and recombination of homologous chromosomes to form stable bivalents. It is followed by two chromosome segregation cycles that first divide homologous chromosomes and then the sister chromatids. Heat stress affects various aspects of plant meiosis. In prophase I, elevated temperature alters the rate and distribution of meiotic recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lloyd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Modliszewski et al., 2018</xref>) and a recent study in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has shown that heat shock response pathway directly regulates the recombination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2022</xref>). More severe heat stress can impair synapsis and pairing of homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loidl, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ning et al., 2021</xref>). This is likely due to inefficient completion of homologous recombination, which is monitored by specialized pachytene checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Heat stress affects the later stages of meiosis as well. Elevated temperatures disturb spindle orientation during meiotic divisions and the formation of radial microtubule arrays, resulting in aberrant cytokinesis and diploid microspores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pécrix et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, acute heat stress leads to chromosome mis-segregation and the formation of micronuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>). The meiotic micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations may arise as a consequence of abnormal repair of meiotic DNA breaks or homologous recombination intermediates in prophase I. However, they can also be caused by defects in chromosome segregation during meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fenech et al., 2011</xref>). Proper attachment of kinetochores to the spindle microtubules before anaphase is crucial for faithful chromosome partitioning to daughter cells, and this process is controlled by spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Therefore, micronuclei typically occur in mutants with impaired centromere/kinetochore structure or SAC when treated with spindle inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalitsis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lermontova et al., 2011a</xref>).</p><p>In most eukaryotes centromeres are confined to a restricted region on each chromosome that serves as a platform for assembly of the kinetochore, a multiprotein structure that connects chromosome with the spindle. Centromeres are defined epigenetically by a specialized centromeric histone H3 variant (CENH3), which forms the foundation for the recruitment of kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McAinsh and Marston, 2022</xref>). In contrast to canonical histones, replicative dilution of CENH3 is not replenished immediately in S-phase, but in subsequent stages of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stirpe and Heun, 2023</xref>). In plants, CENH3 is loaded on centromeres in G2 and persists there throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Talbert et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lermontova et al., 2006</xref>). CENH3 is a very stable component of centromeric chromatin, although its amount at centromeres gradually declines in terminally differentiated cells in plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lermontova et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swartz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we have discovered that heat stress significantly reduces the amount of CENH3 on meiotic chromosomes in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. This loss of CENH3 leads to the formation of micronuclei, which in turn contributes to the decrease in pollen formation and fertility in plants exposed to heat stress. Additionally, we have found that plants with a genetic mutation that reduces the amount of centromeric histone are more sensitive to moderately elevated temperature. These results suggest that meiotic centromeres may represent a crucial point of vulnerability for plants in adaptation to raising temperatures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pollen production and fertility decline with increasing temperature</title><p>In our previous work, we identified the <italic>cenh3-4</italic> allele of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> centromeric histone <italic>CENH3</italic> that carries a mutation in the splicing donor site of the third exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>). This leads to a 10-fold reduction in fully spliced <italic>CENH3</italic> mRNA and a decreased amount of centromeric histone. Consequently, <italic>cenh3-4</italic> plants have smaller centromeres and are sensitive to oryzalin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>). Under standard conditions, <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants are barely distinguishable from wild type, but we noticed their reduced fertility when grown at an elevated temperature. To systematically assess this phenotype, we grew plants under standard conditions (21°C) until they formed four true leaves, and then continued their cultivation in growth chambers tempered to 16°C, 21°C, 26°C, and 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). At 16°C, plants exhibited the slowest growth, but also the highest fertility, as assessed by pollen count and silique length, which is indicative of seed yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Fertility slightly decreased at 21°C and further declined at 26°C. In <italic>cenh3-4</italic> mutants, we noticed a sharp decline in pollen production and fertility at 26°C (86±48 pollen per anther), whereas the fertility of the wild type was still relatively high (213±58 pollen per anther) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Both <italic>cenh3-4</italic> and wild type plants became infertile at 30°C.

We observed that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (ecotype Col-0) exhibited the highest fertility when grown at 16°C, which closely resembles the average temperature during flowering in its natural habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brachi et al., 2010</xref>). At this temperature, meiotic divisions took more than twice as long as at 21°C. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> grown at 17°C was reported to exhibit slower microsporogenesis, with the entire meiosis process lasting 48 hr as opposed to 32 hr at 24°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, the slower progression was found to be less detrimental for several mutations that affect microsporogenesis, indicating that a slower pace provides greater robustness. Overall, these observations suggest that the pace of meiosis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> is well optimized for its natural growth conditions, enabling the plants to achieve maximum fitness.</p><p>The process of meiosis is progressively accelerated with increasing temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the speed of meiotic divisions reaches its maximum at 26°C and slows down at 30°C under the conditions used in this study. At 30°C, fertility is lost and high incidence of micronuclei is observed, implying that the temperature around 30°C impairs some molecular processes involved in chromosome segregation and genome integrity. The micronuclei can represent acentric fragments derived from aberrant processing of recombination intermediates. Indeed, the impact of temperature on recombination machinery is well documented. A moderate increase in temperature leads to shift in chiasma distribution and cross-over frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higgins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lloyd et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Modliszewski et al., 2018</xref>). Heat stress above 30°C severely impairs recombination and synapsis, leading to univalents and chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Storme and Geelen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ning et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fu et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, we observed an increased incidence of micronuclei also in SPO11-deficient plants that do not form meiotic DNA double-strand breaks indicating that only a portion of micronuclei is derived from aberrant recombination.</p><p>Micronuclei can also be formed by aberrant chromosome segregation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fenech et al., 2011</xref>). The accurate partitioning of chromosomes depends on the correct attachment of centromeres to the spindle microtubules. Recent reports have indicated that the stability of microtubules in plant meiocytes is compromised by heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Jaeger-Braet et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we have demonstrated that high temperature also affects the structure and function of meiotic centromeres. Our findings suggest that elevated temperature reduces the amount of CENH3 and BMF1 on meiotic centromeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These weakened centromeres may be less effective in establishing productive interactions with spindle microtubules. This is consistent with the prolonged SAC we observed through the longer residency of BMF3 on prometaphase I centromeres at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that heat stress impairs centromere function, which in turn decreases the efficiency of proper attachment of chromosomes to the meiotic spindle. As a result, these chromosomes may not be transported to their intended destination in a timely manner and, therefore, not incorporated into the newly formed nuclei. This scenario also explains the increased temperature sensitivity of <italic>cenh3-4</italic> plants, which already have smaller centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>); even moderately elevated temperature may further enhance this defect.</p><p>How elevated temperature affects the amount of CENH3 on centromeres? Studies in human cells have revealed that CENH3 nucleosomes are less stable than previously thought. The amount of CENH3 at centromeres declines over time and must be actively replenished to preserve centromere identity and proliferative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swartz et al., 2019</xref>). Transcription has been shown to cause the eviction of pre-existing CENH3 from the centromeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Swartz et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, depletion of CENH3 from centromeres has been observed in leaf cells with increasing age, indicating that this phenomenon also occurs in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lermontova et al., 2011b</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> centromeric satellite repeat CEN180 undergoes pervasive transcription, which is largely repressed by epigenetic silencing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">May et al., 2005</xref>). However, heat stress can alleviate the repression and induce transcription of CEN180 from silent loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tittel-Elmer et al., 2010</xref>). This temperature-induced transcription can increase the eviction of CENH3 nucleosomes, potentially compromising centromere structure if not replenished. Interestingly, in contrast to PMCs, tapetum cells do not exhibit CENH3 loss at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This may be due to the different efficiency of CENH3 deposition to replenish the heat-induced loss of CENH3 in these cell types. Accordingly, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> meiotic cells possess a specialized CENH3 loading mechanism that seems more stringent than the loading mechanism operating in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lermontova et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ravi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schubert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Crosses between wild type and plants with altered CENH3 can result in postzygotic loss of one set of parental chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ravi and Chan, 2010</xref>). This is attributed to inefficient re-loading of CENH3 on the set of parental chromosomes with the altered centromeres in hybrid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marimuthu et al., 2021</xref>). Recent studies showed that heat stress applied during early embryogenesis could enhance the centromere-mediated genome elimination in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jin et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). This indicates that similarly to meiocytes, elevated temperature can also destabilize centromeres in embryonic cells.</p><p>In conclusion, our study highlights the significant impact of temperature on the centromere structure and reproduction in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We found that already moderate increase in temperature has a discernable effect on pollen production and silique length, and exposure to 30°C impairs the structure of centromeres and leads to plant sterility. These findings are particularly relevant in the context of climate change, where rising temperatures and more frequent weather extreme periods pose a threat to global food security by disrupting plant reproductive processes. As such, our study provides important insights into the mechanisms that contribute to the reduction of plant fertility in response to elevated temperature. Further research on molecular aspects underlying these effects may help to develop strategies to generate plants more resilient to extreme weather during their reproductive phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia (Col-0), <italic>cenh3-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capitao et al., 2021</xref>), and <italic>spo11-2-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hartung et al., 2007</xref>) seeds were grown on soil in growth chambers at 21°C, 16 hr/8 hr light/dark cycles and 50% of humidity until the 1.04 growth stage.

In contrast to CENH3 and BMF1, the SAC protein BMF3 persists for longer periods than the WT control, based on which authors conclude that the heat stress prolongs the duration of SAC at metaphase I, which in turn extends the time of chromosome biorientation during meiosis I.

Micronuclei form when chromosomes are not correctly collected to the cellular poles in dividing cells. This happens when whole chromosomes or fragments are not properly attached to the kinetochore microtubules. The incidence of micronuclei formation is shown to increase at elevated temperature in wild type and more so in the weak centromere histone mutant cenH3-4. The number micronuclei formation at high temperature in the recombination mutant spo11 is like that in wild type, indicating that the increased sensitivity of cenh3-4 is not related to the putative role of cenh3 in recombination. The abundance of CENH3-GFP at the centromere declines with higher temperature and correlates with a decline in spindle assembly checkpoint factor BMF1-GFP at the centromeres. The reduction in CENH3-GFP under heat is observed in meiocytes whereas CENH3-GFP abundance increases in the tapetum, suggesting there is a differential regulation of centromere loading in these two cell types. These observations are in line with previous reports on haploidization mutants and their hypersensitivity to heat stress.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The paper shows that the kinetochore function during meiosis is sensitive to high temperature and this leads to inequivalent chromosome segregation during meiosis and reduced fertility.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>The increased sensitivity to high temperature stress of the hypomorphic mutant cenh3-4 mutant not only reduces fertility but also growth, which is not accompanied with the formation of micronuclei as in meiosis. The impact on mitosis therefore seems to be different from that in meiosis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90253.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Crhak Khaitova</surname><given-names>Lucie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>CEITEC Masaryk University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brno</named-content></addr-line><country>Czech Republic</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mikulkova</surname><given-names>Pavlina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Masaryk University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brno</named-content></addr-line><country>Czech Republic</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pecinkova</surname><given-names>Jana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Masaryk University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brno</named-content></addr-line><country>Czech Republic</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kalidass</surname><given-names>Manikandan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gatersleben</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Heckmann</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gatersleben</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lermontova</surname><given-names>Inna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gatersleben</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Riha</surname><given-names>Karel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>CEITEC Masaryk University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Brno</named-content></addr-line><country>Czech Republic</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Response to reviewers:</p><p>We would like to thank all the reviewers and the editors for their thorough and helpful feedback on our work. Before addressing specific questions and points, we would like to make a general comment on a mechanistic aspect of this study. The reviewers correctly pointed out that our study does not reveal the molecular mechanism that leads to centromeric histone depletion specifically from meiotic chromosomes. Identifying this mechanism requires a deep and thorough understanding of how centromeric histones are loaded and centromeres are established each cell cycle, and how they are maintained over time in different cell types. To our knowledge, these mechanisms have not been described in plants. To add a further layer of complexity, it appears that the mechanisms governing CENH3 maintenance may be (partially) different in plant mitotic and meiotic cells, and the mechanistic basis of this difference is unknown. Obviously, these are interesting but also complex questions and their resolution will require considerable resources and effort, which we believe is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Nevertheless, our finding that CENH3 maintenance and centromere function in meiotic cells are sensitive to heat stress is an unexpected discovery with profound implications for plant adaptation, which provides a strong incentive for further exploration of centromere maintenance mechanisms in plants.</p><p>Furthermore, we would like to apologize to reviewers for poor quality of pictures in the original submission. It was decreased by conversion to a pdf format during submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This important study reports how heat stress affects centromere integrity by compromising the loading of the centromere protein CENH3 and by prolonging the spindle assembly checkpoint during male meiosis in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. The evidence supporting the claims by live cell imaging is convincing, although deeper mechanistic insight is lacking, making the study overall somewhat preliminary in nature. This work will be of interest to a broad audience of biologists working on how chromatin states are affected by stress conditions.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Khaitova and co-workers present here an analysis of centromere composition and function during elevated temperatures in the plant Arabidopsis. The work relates to the ongoing climate change during which spikes in high temperatures will be found. Hence, the paper addresses a timely subject.</p><p>The authors start by confirming earlier studies that high temperatures reduce the fertility of Arabidopsis plants. Interestingly, a hypomorphic mutant of the centromeric histone variant CENH3 (CENP-A), which was previously described by the authors, sensitizes plants to heat and results in a drop in viable pollen and silique length. The drop in fertility coincides with the formation of micronuclei in meiosis and an extension of meiotic progression as revealed by live cell imaging. Based on this finding, the authors then show that at high temperatures, the fluorescence intensity of a YFP:CENH3 declines in meiosis but remarkably not in the surrounding cells (tapetum cells). In addition, the amount of BMF1 (a Bub1 homolog and part of the spindle assembly checkpoint) also appears to decline on the kinetochores of meiocytes as judged by BMF1 reporter line. However, whether this is dependent on a decline of CENH3 or represents a separate pathway is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide new data in Figure S6 showing that BMF1 loading on centromeres is substantially reduced in cenh3-4 mutants. Thus, efficient tethering of BMF1 to centromeres depends on CENH3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors measure the duration of the spindle checkpoint and find that it is extended under high temperatures from which they conclude that the attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochores is compromised under heat.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an interesting and important paper as it links centromere organization/function to heat stress in plants. A major conclusion of the authors is that weakened centromeres, presumably by heat, may be less effective in establishing productive interactions with spindle microtubules.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The paper does not explain the molecular reason why CENH3 levels in meiocyctes are reduced or why the attachment of spindle fibers to kinetochore is less efficient at high versus low temperatures.</p></disp-quote><p>While we cannot explain the molecular mechanism underlying temperature-dependent depletion of CENH3 in meiocytes, the less efficient attachment of microtubules to the kinetochores at higher temperatures is likely caused by reduced levels of CENH3, which result in smaller centromeres that are less effective in establishing productive microtubule-kinetochore attachments. Here (new Figure S6) and in our previous study (Capitao et al. 2021), we have shown that amount of centromere/kinetochore proteins is reduced at centromeres in cenh3-4 mutants, and that these plants exhibit prolonged SAC and slower chromosome biorientation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work investigates how increased temperature affects pollen production and fertility of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants grown at selected temperature conditions ranging from 16C to 30C.

In continuation, they also monitor the loading dynamics and resident time of fluorescently tagged centromere/kinetochore proteins and spindle assembly checkpoint proteins to precisely measure the time duration of respective proteins to study their precise dynamics and function in male meiosis.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Here the authors use only one representative centromere protein CENH3, one kinetochore-associated SAC protein BMF1, and the SAC protein BMF3 to conclude that heat stress impairs centromere function and prolongs SAC with increased temperatures. Centromere and its associated protein complex the kinetochores and the SAC contain a multitude of proteins, some of which are well characterized in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Hence the authors could have used additional such tagged proteins to further strengthen their claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, several other proteins have recently been characterized as centromere/kinetochore components and could have been included in the study to further validate the results presented. To strengthen our argument, we have added new experimental data (Figure S4) showing temperature-induced depletion of CENH3 in wild-type plants by immunocytology. Thus, we convincingly show that temperature stress reduces the amount of CENH3. This is likely to affect the loading of most kinetochore and centromeric proteins. Here (new Figure S6) and in our previous study (Capitao et al., 2021), we have shown that genetic depletion of CENH3 in cenh3-4 mutants results in reduced loading of CENPC, MIS12 and BMF1 at mitotic centromeres and reduced loading of BMF3 and BMF1 at meiotic centromeres. We also attempted to assess the levels of CENPC and MIS12 on meiotic chromosomes by immunocytology, but our antibodies, which work on mitotic spreads, did not stain meiotic chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Though the results presented here are interesting and solid, the study lacks a deeper mechanistic understanding of what causes the defective loading of CenH3 to the centromeres, and why the SAC protein BMF3 persists only at meiotic centromeres to prolong the spindle assembly checkpoint. Also, this observation should be interpreted in light of the fact that SAC is not that robust in plants as several null mutants of plant SAC components are known to grow as healthy as wild-type plants at normal growth conditions without any vegetative and reproductive defects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We are of the opinion that SAC operates and it is important in plants - we have added a citation to a preprint from the Schnittger lab (Lampou et al., 2023, BioRxiv) that was published while this manuscript was under review. We think this is the most comprehensive analysis of plant SAC to date, clearly showing that SAC delays progression to anaphase in the presence of spindle inhibitors, although adaptation eventually occurs and the cell cycle progresses. This is very similar to the situation in animals, which also undergo spindle adaptation in similar situations. The difference between plants and animals may be due to subsequent events, where plants are better able to tolerate genome instability and resume cell division in the presence of abnormal chromosome numbers. Robustness and redundancy may be another reason why plant mutants deficient in SAC do not show obvious growth retardation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One of the immediate responses to heat stress is the production of heat shock proteins(Hsps), which act as molecular chaperones to safeguard the proteome. It will be interesting to see if the expression levels of known HsPs can be correlated with their role in stabilizing the structure of SAC proteins like BMF1 to prolong its presence at the meiotic kinetochores.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the heat stress response is likely to be involved in this process. We sought to investigate the role of this pathway by analyzing Arabidopsis mutants deficient in HEAT-SHOCK FACTOR BINDING PROTEIN (HSBP), which acts as a negative regulator of the heat shock response. This experiment was prompted by the observation that hsbp mutants have reduced fertility. We expected that an unrestricted heat stress response might affect meiosis and pollen formation. However, our initial experiments did not show altered pollen viability in response to heat stress in hsbp plants and we did not pursue this line of research further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Khaitova et al. report the formation of micronuclei during Arabidopsis meiosis under elevated temperatures. Micronuclei form when chromosomes are not correctly collected to the cellular poles in dividing cells. This happens when whole chromosomes or fragments are not properly attached to the kinetochore microtubules. The incidence of micronuclei formation is shown to increase at elevated temperatures in wild-type and more so in the weak centromere histone mutant cenH3-4. The number of micronuclei formed at high temperatures in the recombination mutant spo11 is like that in wild-type, indicating that the increased sensitivity of cenh3-4 is not related to the putative role of cenh3 in recombination. The abundance of CENH3-GFP at the centromere declines with higher temperature and correlates with a decline in spindle assembly checkpoint factor BMF1-GFP at the centromeres. The reduction in CENH3-GFP under heat is observed in meiocytes whereas CENH3-GFP abundance increases in the tapetum, suggesting there is a differential regulation of centromere loading in these two cell types. These observations are in line with previous reports on haploidization mutants and their hypersensitivity to heat stress.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This paper is an important contribution to our insights into the impact of heat stress on sexual reproduction in plants.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While it is highly significant, I struggled to interpret the results because of the poor quality of the figures and the videos.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor quality of the figures.

Nevertheless, analysis of our movies taken under the same microscope settings indicates that the amount of BMF3 decreases with increasing temperature. This is illustrated in the new Figure S6C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Conversely, how is the BMF1 and BMF3 signal strength in cenh3-4 mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed an analysis of BMF1 and BMF3 signal in cenh3-4 mutants and observed a reduced level of signal from both proteins (Figure S6).

Is the BMF3 signal also reduced at high temps (see question above)?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. While we see reduced levels of both proteins under heat stress or in cenh3-4 plants, the effect on BMF1 is much more pronounced and becomes undetectable under these conditions. This contrasts with BMF3, which appears to be reduced but is still clearly visible. These data suggest that BMF1 is more sensitive to reduced levels of CENH3 and it further corroborates the findings from the Schnittger lab that BMF1 is not the core component of SAC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 18-20: The observation that heat stress reduces fertility has been made by several research teams before this study.

No analysis of mitotic divisions is provided in the manuscript. As they have generated marker lines, it is reasonable to examine the mitotic time course as well by live monitoring of root tissues exposed to similar temperature conditions as done for meiotic analysis. This will help to address the effect of heat stress on mitotic centromeres and its comparison with meiosis will provide a better picture. There are two likely outcomes during mitosis:</p><p>(a) It is possible that the heat stress also slows down mitotic progression as well as is the case in meiosis as shown in this paper and hence it is important to examine those as well to compare and contrast the CENH3/BMF1 dynamics in mitosis and meiosis.</p><p>(b) The second scenario is that there is no effect of heat stress on the centromere integrity of mitotic chromosomes. In fact, the authors show indirect evidence in support of this wherein the eYFP: CENH3 showed a strong signal in the tapetal cells (somatic origin) surrounding the male meiocytes (generative origin). It is interesting that somatic cells of the tapetum show a strong signal whereas the meiocytes lack this. The authors should elaborate on this contrasting result.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect we observed seems to be specific to meiosis. We analyzed the progression of mitosis in root cells and we see a negligible effect of temperature on mitotic progression and no micronuclei formation. Interestingly, in terms of CENH3 loading, root cells show a slight decrease in CENH3 at 30°C, in contrast to the situation in tapetum cells. These and other data suggest a tissue/cell specific behavior of centromere maintenance and deserve further analysis. We plan to publish data on mitosis and tissue-specific aspects of CENH3 loading in a separate manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) comprises several core proteins that are recruited to the kinetochores to correct the errors during the defective cell cycle. Here the authors demonstrate the prolonged presence of BMF3 as the only proof to claim that heat stress prolongs the spindle assembly checkpoint during metaphase I. Have the authors observed the dynamics of any other SAC core components such as MAD1, MAD2, MPS1, BUB3, and the like during heat stress?</p></disp-quote><p>No, we did not. We provide several independent lines of evidence that centromere structure and functionality are affected, and spindle checkpoint analysis is only one of them. At the time we designed these experiments, the only experimentally validated and well-characterized component of the SAC was BMF3, and we used only this protein as SAC reporter because a general analysis of the SAC was not the primary goal of our study. While this paper was under review, a preprint from the Schnittger lab focusing on plant SAC was published that comprehensively analyzed these SAC components in Arabidopsis and provided a solid foundation and resources for further research in this direction. This study also uses BMF3 as a reporter for SAC in meiotic cells. It is noteworthy that despite using different microscopic methods and different plant reporter lines, our labs independently arrived at exactly the same duration of BMF3 association with the kinetochore (i.e. 22 min).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Is BMF1 a component of SAC or the kinetochore? I understand that BMF1 is a part of the core SAC ( Komaki and Schnittger, 2017) although it localizes to the kinetochore. There are well-characterized kinetochore proteins in Arabidopsis such as Mis12, NUF2, NNF1, and SPC24(MUN1) which the authors could have used as a kinetochore marker. Regardless, here the authors used it as a kinetochore marker. Being a part of SAC, one would expect the prolonged presence of BMF1 similar to BMF3 in the meiotic kinetochores but it is the other way. How to explain these contrasting results?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the public section of the review, BMF1 does not seem to be the core component of SAC. Furthermore, this protein localizes to centromeres/kinetochore throughout the cell cycle and therefore, it cannot be used as SAC reporter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Micronuclei can form as a result of chromosome missegregation as shown for spo11-1 and also due to segregation error caused by DNA repair defects. Here it is not clear what is the origin of micronuclei. It is very hard to decipher from live cell imaging. A simple meiotic spread of anthers of different treatments would address the origin of micronuclei.</p></disp-quote><p>Cytology cannot easily determine the origin of micronuclei in meiotic cells. Acentric fragments produced from aberrant DNA repair will still be cytologically detectable only after metaphase I as they are tethered to the remaining chromatin via cohesion. Therefore, we took advantage of spo11 mutants that do not form any meiotic breaks, and hence cannot generate acentric fragments by aberrant repair, to discriminate the origin of micronuclei. We reason that all micronuclei produced in spo11 plants originate from chromosome mis-segregation and their increase at elevated temperature support the notion that heat stress further impairs chromosome segregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Fig.1 B The microspores are not clearly visible in the alexander-stained anthers.

It needs to be shown that these spots are not observed in non-GFP lines. Better image quality may help too.</p></disp-quote><p>The micronuclei in Figure 2 are visualized by DAPI staining, not with GFP. The nuclei are now indicated by arrowheads.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It was not possible to see the centromeres in Figure 3 hence I could not verify the fluorescence intensities of CENH3 and BMF1. There is also something wrong with the color codes blue and red in fig3B, C, and D.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, we apologize for poor quality of pictures due to manuscript conversion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Also in the videos it would help to point out where the micronuclei are seen. At what stage were these nuclei quantified? Given that meiosis progression in the cenh3-4 mutant is slower, it may be necessary to wait long enough to see established micronuclei. This information is supposed to be presented in Figure 2C. However, the X-axis shows time, not number. So I presume Fig 2C shows the duration of meiosis stages in the mutant. In Fig 2B, it shows the number of micronuclei per lobe. However, to correlate the incidence of micronuclei formation and the frequency of polyad formation (inviable microspores), one needs the quantification of the numbers of meiocytes carrying micronuclei. Then one can correlate the number of pollen per anther (shown in Fig 1c) with the incidence of micronuclei formation. The question of whether the degree of fertility reduction is due to micronuclei formation is a major issue that should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Then micronuclei were not quantified from the movies, but from DAPI stained whole anthers at the tetrad stage as indicated in the main text. We also apologize for confusion with the Figure 2 as we mixed up the panels in the original submission. This has been corrected in the new submission.</p></body></sub-article></article>
