Under laboratory conditions, the virophage mavirus integrates into the nuclear genome of the marine flagellate <italic>Cafeteria burkhardae</italic> and reactivates upon superinfection with the giant virus CroV. In natural systems, however, the prevalence and diversity of host-virophage associations has not been systematically explored. Here, we report dozens of integrated virophages in four globally sampled <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> strains that constitute up to 2% of their host genomes. These <underline>e</underline>ndogenous <underline>ma</underline>virus-<underline>l</underline>ike <underline>e</underline>lements (EMALEs) separated into eight types based on GC-content, nucleotide similarity, and coding potential and carried diverse promoter motifs implicating interactions with different giant viruses. Between host strains, some EMALE insertion loci were conserved indicating ancient integration events, whereas the majority of insertion sites were unique to a given host strain suggesting that EMALEs are active and mobile. Furthermore, we uncovered a unique association between EMALEs and a group of tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons, revealing yet another layer of parasitism in this nested microbial system. Our findings show that virophages are widespread and dynamic in wild <italic>Cafeteria</italic> populations, supporting their potential role in antiviral defense in protists.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses exist in all ecosystems in vast numbers and infect many organisms. Some of them are harmful but others can protect the organisms they infect. For example, a group of viruses called virophages protect microscopic sea creatures called plankton from deadly infections by so-called giant viruses. In fact, virophages need plankton infected with giant viruses to survive because they use enzymes from the giant viruses to turn on their own genes.</p><p>A virophage called mavirus integrates its genes into the DNA of a type of plankton called <italic>Cafeteria.</italic> It lays dormant in the DNA until a giant virus called CroV infects the plankton. This suggests that the mavirus may be a built-in defense against CroV infections and laboratory studies seem to confirm this. But whether wild <italic>Cafeteria</italic> also use these defenses is unknown.</p><p>Hackl et al. show that virophages are common in the DNA of wild <italic>Cafeteria</italic> and that the two appear to have a mutually beneficial relationship. In the experiments, the researchers sequenced the genomes of four <italic>Cafeteria</italic> populations from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and looked for virophages in their DNA. Each of the four <italic>Cafeteria</italic> genomes contained dozens of virophages, which suggests that virophages are important to these plankton. This included several relatives of the mavirus and seven new virophages. Virophage genes were often interrupted by so called jumping genes, which may take advantage of the virophages the way the virophages use giant viruses to meet their own needs.</p><p>The experiments show that virophages often co-exist with marine plankton from around the world and these relationships are likely beneficial. In fact, the experiments suggest that the virophages may have played an important role in the evolution of these plankton. Further studies may help scientists learn more about virus ecology and how viruses have shaped the evolution of other creatures.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Cafeteria burkhardae</italic></kwd><kwd>virophage</kwd><kwd>retrotransposon</kwd><kwd>protist</kwd><kwd>endogenous viral element</kwd><kwd>antiviral defense</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000936</institution-id><institution>Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duponchel</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Matthias G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Medical Research Heidelberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hackl</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Duponchel</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name><name><surname>Barenhoff</surname><given-names>Karina</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinmann</surname><given-names>Alexa</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Matthias G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutualistic viruses called virophages are common genome inhabitants of a marine protist, where they may protect host populations from giant viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many eukaryotic genomes harbor endogenous viral elements (EVEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012</xref>). For retroviruses, integration as a provirus is an essential part of their replication cycles, but other viruses also occasionally endogenize, for instance with the help of cellular retroelements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holmes, 2011</xref>). Some green algal genomes even contain giant EVEs of several hundred kilobase pairs (kbp) in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moniruzzaman et al., 2020</xref>), but unlike prophages in bacteria and archaea, most eukaryotic EVEs are thought to be ‘genomic fossils’ and incapable of virion formation and horizontal transmission. However, some viral genes may be co-opted for various host functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank and Feschotte, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aswad and Katzourakis, 2012</xref>). In recent years, the exploration of protist-infecting giant viruses has uncovered a novel class of associated smaller DNA viruses with diverse and unprecedented genome integration capabilities.</p><p>Viruses of the family <italic>Lavidaviridae</italic>, commonly known as virophages, depend for their replication on giant DNA viruses of the family <italic>Mimiviridae</italic> and can parasitize them during coinfection of a suitable protist host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Scola et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krupovic et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duponchel and Fischer, 2019</xref>). A striking example is the virophage mavirus, which strongly inhibits virion synthesis of the lytic giant virus CroV during coinfection of the marine heterotrophic nanoflagellate <italic>Cafeteria</italic> sp. (Stramenopiles; Bicosoecida) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer and Suttle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>). Virophages possess 15–30 kbp long double-stranded (ds) DNA genomes of circular or linear topology that tend to have low GC-contents (27–51%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer, 2020</xref>). A typical virophage genome encodes 20–30 proteins, including a major capsid protein (MCP), a minor capsid or penton protein (PEN), a DNA packaging ATPase, and a maturation cysteine protease (PRO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krupovic et al., 2016a</xref>). In addition to this conserved morphogenesis module, virophages encode DNA replication and integration proteins that were likely acquired independently in different virophage lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yutin et al., 2013</xref>). Viruses in the genus <italic>Mavirus</italic> contain a <italic>rve</italic>-family integrase (rve-INT) that is also found in retrotransposons and retroviruses, with close homologs among the eukaryotic Maverick/Polinton elements (MPEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer and Suttle, 2011</xref>). MPEs were initially described as DNA transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pritham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2006</xref>), but many of them carry the morphogenesis gene module and thus qualify as endogenous viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krupovic et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis suggests that mavirus-type virophages share a common ancestry with MPEs and the related Polinton-like viruses (PLVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer and Suttle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yutin et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore tested the integration capacity of mavirus using the cultured protist <italic>Cafeteria burkhardae</italic> (formerly <italic>Cafeteria roenbergensis</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fenchel and Patterson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schoenle et al., 2020</xref>) and found that mavirus integrates efficiently into the nuclear host genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>). The resulting mavirus provirophages are transcriptionally silent unless the host cell is infected with CroV, which leads to reactivation and virion formation of mavirus. Newly produced virophage particles then inhibit CroV replication and increase host population survival during subsequent rounds of coinfection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>). The mutualistic <italic>Cafeteria</italic>-mavirus symbiosis may thus act as an adaptive defense system against lytic giant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koonin and Krupovic, 2016</xref>). The integrated state of mavirus is pivotal to the proposed defense scheme as it represents the host’s indirect antigenic memory of CroV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koonin and Krupovic, 2017</xref>). We therefore investigated endogenous virophages to assess the prevalence and potential significance of virophage-mediated defense systems in natural protist populations.</p><p>Here, we report that mavirus-like EVEs are common, diverse, and most likely active mobile genetic elements (MGEs) of <italic>C. burkhardae</italic>. Our results suggest an influential role of these viruses on the ecology and evolution of their bicosoecid hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endogenous virophages are abundant in <italic>Cafeteria</italic> genomes</title><p>In preparation of screening for endogenous virophages, we generated high-quality de novo genome assemblies of four cultured <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hackl et al., 2020</xref>). These strains, designated BVI, Cflag, E4-10P (E4-10), and RCC970-E3 (RCC970), were isolated from the Caribbean Sea in 2012, the Northwest Atlantic in 1986, the Northeast Pacific in 1989, and the Southeast Pacific in 2004, respectively. We sequenced their genomes using both short-read (Illumina MiSeq) and long-read (Pacific Biosciences RSII) technologies in order to produce assemblies that would resolve 20–30 kb long repetitive elements within the host genomic context. Each <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> genome assembly comprised of 34–36 megabase pairs with an average GC-content of 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hackl et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To identify endogenous virophages, we combined sequence similarity searches against known virophage genomes with genomic screening for GC-content anomalies.

This uniform trend across all amino acids likely indicates that selection and evolutionary processes driving GC-content variation in these viruses act on the nucleotide level, rather than on the encoded proteins.</p><p>With few exceptions, EMALEs are predicted to encode 17–21 proteins each. None of the encoding genes was found to contain introns. The virion morphogenesis module in EMALE types 1 and 3–7 consists of the canonical virophage core genes corresponding to MCP, PEN, ATPase, and PRO proteins.

EMALE02 represents an interesting case, as it shares 6–7 kb of its 5’ part (we chose the <italic>primase/helicase</italic> genes to mark the 5’ end of all EMALEs) with EMALE01, while the remaining 11 kb are not closely related to other EMALEs or virophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

It is worth noting that although EMALEs of types 5 and 6 are largely syntenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), they were clearly distinguishable in their phylogenetic signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A comparison of clade topologies revealed that even within the conserved morphogenesis module, individual proteins differed with regard to their neighboring clades, and low-GC and mid-GC EMALEs did not cluster separately from each other. These observations could suggest that the morphogenesis modules of different EMALE types diversified simultaneously and that adaptation of GC-content may occur rather quickly.</p><p>In contrast, phylogenetic analysis of rve-INT proteins revealed separate clades for low-GC and mid-GC EMALEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Each of these clades was affiliated with different cellular homologs that included MPEs and retroelements. Notably, the <italic>rve-INT</italic> genes of low-GC EMALEs were located near the 5’ end of the genomes, whereas in mid-GC EMALEs, they were located near the 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations suggest that EMALEs encode two different rve-INT versions, one specific for low-GC EMALEs that co-occurs with the pPolB and a shorter primase/helicase ORF, and one specific for mid-GC EMALEs that co-occurs with a longer primase/helicase ORF. The two integrase versions may have been acquired independently, or one version could have replaced the other during EMALE evolution. Such non-homologous gene replacement appears to have taken place among the primase/helicase genes, too, as previously noted for virophages in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yutin et al., 2013</xref>). EMALEs encode several different versions of primase/helicase genes with a degree of amino acid divergence that precluded their inclusion in a single multiple sequence alignment. The YR proteins encoded by EMALE types 5–8 formed a monophyletic clade and were part of a larger group of recombinases that included virophages from freshwater metagenomes, as well as microalgae and algal nucleocytoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>Cafeteria</italic> strains differ in their EMALE composition</title><p>The four <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> strains displayed distinct EMALE signatures: strain BVI had the highest number of virophage elements with 13 complete and 42 partial EMALEs, whereas the other three strains had 6–7 complete and 20–22 partial EMALEs each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). EMALE types 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were present in every host strain, EMALE07 was found in all strains except Cflag, and EMALE types 2 and 8 were detected in strains BVI and E4-10 only. We found no evidence for sequence-specific genome integration of EMALEs after inspecting the host DNA sequences that flanked EMALE integration sites, which confirms previous reports of mavirus integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>). EMALEs were flanked by target site duplications (TSDs) that were predominantly 3–5 bp in length, although some were as short as 1 bp or as long as 9 bp (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). By comparison, mavirus and MPEs generate 5–6 bp long TSDs upon integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pritham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kapitonov and Jurka, 2006</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether homologous EMALEs were found in identical loci in closely related host genomes, we conducted sequence similarity searches with the flanking regions of each of the 33 fully resolved EMALEs. Whenever these searches returned a homologous full or partial EMALE with at least one matching host flank, we considered the EMALE locus to be conserved in these host strains. We found varying degrees of conservation, with examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>. In 11 cases, an EMALE insertion was conserved in at least two host strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>): three EMALE loci were shared by all four strains, four were shared by three strains, and another four were shared by two strains. Based on conserved EMALE loci, strains Cflag and RCC970 were most closely related with nine shared EMALE integrations, which is in line with phylogenetic and average nucleotide identity (ANI) analyses of these strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hackl et al., 2020</xref>). The four <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> genomes have ANIs of &gt;99% and thus appear to differ mostly based on their content of EMALEs and other MGEs.</p><p>The most parsimonious scenario for the origin of EMALEs that are located in identical loci in different host strains is that they derived from a single integration event. For instance, EMALE03 BVI_101 is orthologous to Cflag_017C and RCC970_016A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>), which suggests that this element initially colonized the common ancestor of <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> strains BVI, Cflag, and RCC970. Further cases of redundant EMALEs are Cflag_017B &amp; RCC970_016B (EMALE01) and BVI_029 &amp; RCC970_095 (EMALE06). These elements may thus derive from relatively ancient integration events, whereas 18 of the 33 complete EMALEs represent integrations that were unique to a single host strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Strain BVI contained 10 of these 18 unique integrations, more than twice as many as any other strain.</p><p>The genomic landscape around EMALE integration sites ranged from repeat-free flanking regions to complex host repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Of the 29 different integration sites represented by the 33 fully resolved EMALEs, 18 were located near repetitive host DNA (within 10 kb from the insertion site). These repeats, in addition to EMALE TIRs, multiple copies of the same EMALE type, and the putative heterozygosity of EMALE insertions, occasionally caused assembly problems, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>Next, we analyzed whether EMALE insertions interrupted coding sequences of the host. Fifteen integration sites were located within a predicted host gene (13 in exons, 2 in introns), four were found in predicted 3’ untranslated regions, and three were located in intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These data show that EMALE insertions may disrupt eukaryotic genes with potential negative consequences for the host. The apparent preference for integration in coding regions could be assembly related, driven by increased accessibility of euchromatin, or linked to host factors that could direct the rve-INT via its CHROMO domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>EMALEs are predicted to be functional and mobile</title><p>Based on genomic features such as coding potential, ORF integrity, and host distribution, most EMALEs appear to be active MGEs. With the exception of EMALE08 and EMALE02, all endogenous <italic>Cafeteria</italic> virophages encode the canonical morphogenesis gene module consisting of <italic>MCP</italic>, <italic>PEN</italic>, <italic>ATPase</italic>, <italic>PRO</italic>, as well as <italic>MV14</italic>. EMALE02 likely encodes more distantly related capsid genes. Therefore, all EMALE types except EMALE08 should be autonomous for virion formation. In addition, all EMALEs contain at least one predicted enzyme for genome integration, an rve-INT in EMALE types 1–7 and a YR in EMALE types 5–8. EMALEs thus encode the enzymatic repertoire for colonizing new host genomes. Finally, the high variability of EMALE integration loci among otherwise closely related host strains strongly argues for ongoing colonization of natural <italic>Cafeteria</italic> populations by virophages.</p><p>The genomic similarity to mavirus implies that EMALEs may also depend on a giant virus for activation and horizontal transmission. Shared regulatory sequences in virophages and their respective giant viruses suggest that the molecular basis of virophage activation lies in the recognition of virophage gene promoters by giant virus encoded transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer and Suttle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claverie and Abergel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Legendre et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore analyzed the 100 nt upstream regions of EMALE ORFs for conserved sequence motifs using MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>). For all type 4 EMALEs, which include mavirus, we recovered the previously described mavirus promotor motif ‘TCTA’, flanked by AT-rich regions. This motif corresponds to the conserved late gene promoter in CroV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer and Suttle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>), thus possibly indicating that all type 4 EMALEs could be reactivated by CroV or close relatives. EMALEs of other types lacked the ‘TCTA’ motif, but contained putative promoter sequences that may be compatible with different giant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>MGEs are prone to various decay processes including pseudogenization, recombination, and truncation. Among the 33 fully resolved EMALEs are three truncated elements: Cflag_215 and RCC970_122 (both EMALE04), and BVI_005 (EMALE08) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, even these shorter elements are flanked by TIRs, which must have regenerated after the truncation event. Whereas most EMALE ORFs appeared to be intact, as judged by comparison with homologous genes on syntenic elements, several EMALEs contained fragmented ORFs (e.g. <italic>ATPase</italic> and <italic>PEN</italic> genes in EMALE04 BVI_055B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To test whether premature stop codons may be the result of assembly artifacts, we amplified selected EMALEs by PCR and analyzed the products using Sanger sequencing. When we compared the Sanger assemblies with the Illumina/PacBio assemblies, we noticed that the latter contained several substitutions and indels. For example, the MCP gene of EMALE01 RCC970_016B was split into three ORFs in the Illumina/PacBio assembly, whereas a single ORF was present in the corresponding Sanger assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). None of the Sanger assemblies confirmed fragmentation of conserved virophage genes, emphasizing the importance of independent sequence validation. However, since it was not possible to re-sequence all potential pseudogene locations, we cannot exclude that some EMALE genes may be fragmented. Overall, EMALE ORFs appeared to be intact and are thus likely to encode functional proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Tyrosine recombinase retrotransposons integrate into EMALEs</title><p>Strikingly, about one in four virophage elements was interrupted by a GC-rich sequence with a typical length of ~6 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Whereas 91% of type 1 Ngaros were inserted in an EMALE, this was the case for only 14% and 8% of type 3 and type 4 Ngaros, respectively. At first glance, type 2 Ngaros were distributed evenly among viral and eukaryotic DNA (47% inside EMALEs, 53% outside EMALEs). However, several type 2 Ngaros were truncated at their 5’ end, featuring ~2 kb long deletions that covered ORF1. All of these deletion variants, which we designate as type 2b, were located in host DNA, in contrast to 82% of the full-length type 2a Ngaros that were inserted in EMALEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Similarly, most of the type 1 Ngaros that were inserted into eukaryotic chromatin also lacked ORF1. Hence, it appears that ORF1 determines the integration site specificity of Ngaro retrotransposons. We did not observe any preference of host-genome-integrated Ngaros for regions with a GC-content lower than the host average. Out of 20 Ngaro insertion sites with analyzable EMALE flanking regions (including partial EMALEs), 9 were located in intergenic regions, 7 in EMALE genes (1× <italic>primase/helicase</italic>, 1× <italic>pPolB</italic>, 1× <italic>MV12</italic>, 4× <italic>MV19</italic>), and 4 in TIRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Considering that intergenic regions comprise only 5–10% of an EMALE genome, we notice a significant bias (p &lt; 1e<sup>–5</sup>, Fisher’s exact test) toward Ngaro integration in intergenic EMALE DNA, which may be caused either by purifying selection of deleterious Ngaro insertions or by a higher preference for Ngaro integration into EMALE intergenic regions, e.g. due to their lower GC-content.</p><p>A possible consequence of retrotransposon insertion is the loss of biological activity and subsequent pseudogenization. However, we found that Ngaro-containing EMALEs did not contain more fragmented genes than Ngaro-free EMALEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Whereas the biological properties of Ngaro retrotransposons and their influence on host-virus-virophage dynamics remain to be explored, the EMALE-Ngaro interactions appear to be convoluted. For instance, an EMALE03 genome in strain Cflag is interrupted by two adjacent Ngaro1 insertions, while the EMALE itself is located inside an Ngaro4 element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Virophages represent a recently discovered family of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses that possess interesting genome integration properties and have potentially far-reaching eco-evolutionary consequences. Our genomic survey of the marine bicosoecid <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> revealed an unexpected abundance and diversity of endogenous virophages, with dozens of elements in a single host genome. Based on DNA dot plots and phylogenetic analysis, we distinguish eight different types of mavirus-related endogenous virophages. Similar to mavirus, these EMALEs could potentially reactivate and replicate in the presence of a compatible giant virus. Mavirus is proposed to act as an adaptive defense system against CroV in <italic>Cafeteria</italic> populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koonin and Krupovic, 2016</xref>), and our findings suggest that different types of EMALEs may respond to different giant viruses infecting <italic>Cafeteria</italic>. The assortment of endogenous virophages in a given host genome may thus reflect the giant virus infection history of that population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc et al., 2015</xref>). Some EMALEs are present in orthologous genomic loci in two or more host strains and likely date back to the common ancestor of these strains. However, at least half of the EMALE insertions are specific to a given host strain and may thus have been acquired relatively recently. Combined with the overall integrity of EMALEs and the conservation of integrase and capsid genes, these findings suggest that endogenous virophages in <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> are active MGEs.</p><p>Similar to other MGEs, EMALEs are likely prone to various decay processes including pseudogenization, truncation, and recombination; however, the extent to which these mechanisms affect EMALE stability is currently unclear. Although nonsense mutations appear to be present in some EMALE genes, re-sequencing of selected genomic regions did not confirm pseudogene loci in those cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). We found three truncated EMALEs (5–15 kb long), but these are not to be confused with the 105 partial EMALEs that resulted from computational limitations during sequence assembly of these multi-copy elements. Recombination most likely created the EMALE02 variant, with no obvious signs of degradation. Based on our EMALE identification approach (see Materials and methods), we are quite confident that we have not missed more severely degraded EMALEs or more divergent virophages, except perhaps for hypothetical elements lacking any recognizable sequence similarity to annotated virophages and possessing a GC-content similar to that of the host genome. Overall, these observations raise the question of how balance between new virophage integrations and loss of existing EMALEs is achieved to prevent overload of the host genome with mobile DNA. Possible explanations include loss by homologous recombination, for example, between TIRs of the same or similar EMALEs, excision of EMALEs via host- or EMALE-encoded integrases or endonucleases, or mechanisms to limit the uptake of new elements. Given that multiple mavirus genome integrations per host cell can be observed within a period of days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>) and that virophage integration rates under natural infection conditions are likely to fall within similar timescales, we hypothesize that the majority of EMALE loss may occur before pseudogenization and degradation can take place. EMALEs would thus have relatively short residence times in the unicellular <italic>Cafeteria</italic> compared to germline EVEs of multicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barreat and Katzourakis, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Horizontal transmission of virophages in natural environments is likely limited by their requirement for two concurrent biological entities, namely a susceptible host cell infected with a permissive giant virus. Similar to temperate bacteriophages, persistence in the proviral state may thus be an essential survival strategy for virophages, as underscored by the abundance of EMALEs in <italic>C. burkhardae</italic>. Endogenous virophages may also be common in eukaryotes outside the order Bicosoecales, although a search in 2015 for provirophages in 1153 eukaryotic genomes found only one clear case in the chlorarachniophyte alga <italic>Bigelowiella natans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanc et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to rapidly increasing virophage reports from metagenomic sequence mining in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paez-Espino et al., 2019</xref>), we propose that the discovery of host-integrated virophages is still hampered not only by sampling bias, but also by technical limitations. For instance, AT-rich mavirus DNA was severely underrepresented when we sequenced the genome of <italic>C. burkhardae</italic> strain E4-10M1 with the standard Illumina MiSeq protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Hackl, 2016</xref>). Additional problems arise during binning and assembly procedures. Although our sequencing and assembly strategy was specifically tailored to endogenous virophages and resolved 33 EMALEs in their host genomic context, dozens of EMALEs were only partially assembled, some may contain assembly errors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), and others may have been missed altogether. Advances in long-read sequencing technologies and assembly algorithms will likely alleviate such problems.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that EMALEs were frequently interrupted by Ngaro retrotransposons, which revealed an additional level of nested parasitism in this microbial system. <italic>Cafeteria</italic> genomes contain four distinct Ngaro types with different affinities for EMALEs. Deletion of ORF1 in type 1 and type 2 Ngaros coincides with a decreased occurrence of these retrotransposons in EMALEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Syntenic ORFs in other Ngaros are predicted to encode a Gag-like structural protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poulter and Butler, 2015</xref>), and Gag proteins of several retroviruses have been linked to integration site specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewinski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tobaly-Tapiero et al., 2008</xref>). The putative Gag proteins of <italic>Cafeteria</italic> Ngaros may thus influence whether retrotransposon insertion occurs in an EMALE or in eukaryotic chromatin. So far, retrotransposons have not been described for giant DNA viruses or virophages; however, pandoravirus genomes contain DNA transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2015</xref>), and a class of 7 kb long DNA MGEs called transpovirons interacts with the particles and genomes of <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic>-infecting mimiviruses and their virophages, apparently without affecting viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desnues et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeudy et al., 2020</xref>). It remains to be studied whether Ngaro retrotransposons use reactivated virophages or giant viruses as vehicles for horizontal transmission, and what effect retrotransposon insertion in EMALEs has on the fitness of the virophage, the host cell, and their associated giant viruses.</p><p>In conclusion, we show that endogenous virophage genomes are abundant and diverse in the marine heterotrophic protist <italic>C. burkhardae</italic>. These mavirus-like EVEs appear to be active and dynamic MGEs with significant potential to shape the genome evolution of their hosts. We present evidence for recombination and gene exchange within EMALEs, and a previously unknown affiliation between virophages and YR retrotransposons. Our findings imply an important role for EMALEs in the ecology and evolution of bicosoecids and are in line with the hypothesis that endogenous virophages provide adaptive defense against giant viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. burkhardae</italic> cultures and genome sequencing</title><p><italic>C. burkhardae</italic> strains BVI, Cflag, E4-10P, and RCC970-E3 were cultured, and their genomes sequenced and assembled as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hackl et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Detection and annotation of EMALEs</title><p>To identify endogenous virophages, we initially took a manual approach and searched for clearly visible drops in GC-content along contigs when visualized in Artemis Release 16.0.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rutherford et al., 2000</xref>).

The latter approach is less prone to assembly biases, such as overestimation of contributions for elements only present in one allele, or underestimation of contribution due to collapsed repeated copies, or elements not assembled because of low coverage. We aligned the PacBio reads to the assemblies using minimap2 v2.16 (-x map-pb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li, 2018</xref>) and computed the coverage of the different genomic regions with samtools v1.9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2009</xref>).

Given that the activation of the integrated virophage mavirus during infection by the giant virus, CroV, has been shown to have a protective effect on the <italic>Cafeteria</italic> population, this study provides a tantalizing window into the traces of virophage-giant virus¬-protist interactions in the marine environment. Given the enormous diversity of virophages and giant viruses that have been found in metagenomes with no known hosts, this study is a step towards deciphering the biology of these viruses.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Virophages and retrotransposons colonize the genomes of a heterotrophic flagellate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Frank Aylward (Reviewer #1); Chantal Abergel (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers made several suggestions and comments that, if addressed, would significantly strengthen your manuscript and clarify its presentation, so i recommend that you consider them and revise accordingly. In particular, please address the following comment:</p><p>1) All reviewers were curious/raised questions about the evolutionary analyses used to identify EMALE and NGARO endogenization and loss and so some clarification from the authors about the specific points raised in their analytical process would be beneficial to the article.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Small note on nomenclature. In a few situations the authors use the terms EMALEs and virophage interchangeably, which can be a bit confusing because it is not clear if they are referring to the same thing or if there is some implied difference here (i.e. line 102). This is especially true in the Results section, where it would be clearer to just use EMALE for everything since that term was defined specifically.</p><p>For the 7 Ngaro elements in EMALE genes (line 326) it would be useful to have a full breakdown of the predicted function of these genes here. And is this section a discussion of all Ngaro elements or only those found within the 33 high quality EMALEs? That was unclear to me.</p><p>It would be useful to note the Pfam domain of the Ngaro elements the first time they are mentioned in the text (or if Pfam is not preferred for some reason some alternative protein family, such as an NCVOG or Interpro ID). This would help to more precisely define these elements for readers. It is also unclear in the Methods how the Ngaro elements were identified- I understand this probably involved manual curation to some extent, but it would be useful to know what features the authors looked for when performing these analyses (best BLASTp hits, Pfam domain hits, etc).</p><p>Are homologs of the Ngaro genes found in giant virus genomes? This could be advantageous to giant viruses due to their potential to inactivate virophage. It would be interesting if giant viruses promoted Ngaro gene proliferation. Proteins for a collection of NCLDV and their Pfam annotations are publicly available on the Giant Virus Database (https://faylward.github.io/GVDB/), so it may be easy enough to check what the distribution of these elements across the diversity of NCLDV looks like. If the authors chose to do a quick survey of Ngaro elements in other NCLDV it would increase the breadth and impact of the study, but this is not strictly necessary.</p><p>The authors provide an interesting discussion on why a previous study found many fewer endogenous virophage (Blanc et al., PNAS 2015). I reviewed the methods of this study and found them to be quite robust, so it is rather surprising that more endogenous virophage were not found. Hackl et al., rightfully point out that assembly issues may mask the presence of these elements. Another important point is that many fewer reference virophage were available in 2015, so homology based methods were more limited at this time.</p><p>The skew towards EMALE integration in intergenic regions is interesting. Given the accumulation of junk DNA in many eukaryotic genomes I would actually predict that many degraded EMALEs would not be removed through purifying selection, and that they would accumulate (though given the high effective population size of these marine hosts it is possible). Is it possible that this bias is due to the difficulty in identifying degraded EMALEs? Perhaps there are more degraded EMALEs in the genome but they are just harder to detect? (see comment below).</p><p>Perhaps I missed it but I could not find information on how the EMALEs were initially identified and delineated in the Methods. The results state that &quot;To identify endogenous virophages, we combined sequence similarity searches against known virophage genomes with genomic screening for GC-content anomalies. The two approaches yielded redundant results and virophage elements were clearly discernible from eukaryotic genome regions based on their low (30-50%) GC-content (Figure 1A)&quot;. To me this seems quite general and it is not clear what tools were used- for example, I am assuming that sequence similarity searches were done at the amino acid level, and if so was this done with the genes already predicted from the previous Sci Data paper? This is an important detail since gene prediction algorithms often miss NCLDV and virophage genes. In the Scientific Data publication the gene prediction was done with &quot;the BRAKER pipeline which utilizes BLAST Augustus and GeneMark-ES. Augustus and GeneMark-ES gene models were trained with publicly available transcriptomic data of C. roenbergensis E4-10P as extrinsic evidence&quot;. If EMALE genes are extensively pseudogenized or not expressed would this pipeline still predict them? More details on EMALE detection and some commentary on the possible limitations of degraded EMALE prediction would be useful.</p><p>EVEs necessarily exist on a spectrum from intact to degraded, and the reality is that the most degraded elements may consist of only a single pseudogene and may not be confidently detected using any method. I often think of this, since eukaryotic genomes are full of junk DNA with ambiguous origins- one hypothesis is that much of it derives from endogenous viruses that subsequently degrade beyond all recognition. Some additional discussion of this be useful for interpreting the consequences of retrotransposition, since one would expect that these would actually inactivate quite a few EMALEs and effectively turn them into junk DNA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I was only wondering why the authors did not perform an experiment to assess the reactivation of the type 4 EMALEs upon CroV infection as it would nicely demonstrate they are functional MGEs. This would also address the need for another giant virus for EMALEs presenting different promoters.</p><p>To me it is not mandatory but would nicely complement the present findings.</p><p>The reading of this manuscript also raised one question. Since some groups only possess rve integrase and some present an additional Tyr recombinase, I was wondering if one could be meant for integration into the host genome while the second could be for integration into the giant virus genome, as it is the case for Sputnik which only have the Tyr recombinase and only integrates into the giant virus genome.</p><p>I also have a naïve question concerning the pseudogenized EMALEs without Ngaros retrotransposon. The authors addressed this question on the role of Ngaros in EMALE pseudogenization but focused on complete versus absent and did not look for remnants of possible Ngaro. Could pseudogenization in the ones without Ngaros be the result of ancient integrations that disappeared, just leaving for instance the A, B signatures in these EMALEs?</p><p>I noticed that in Figure 1 legend B is difficult to read and legends for C and D panels are missing.</p><p>In Figure S7, I was wondering what was corresponding to the gap between c023 and c119 for E4-10which appears to be covered by GC content analysis. Same in panel B for RCC970, between c188 and c258 for which a possible explanation is provided, yet the GC content seems to cover this gap.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very thorough analysis and raises many avenues for future work.</p><p>I found myself speculating on how the biology of the system is working in terms of the gain-and-loss of EMALEs, with one idea for an analysis that could be done. I am not proposing this as additional work, but I am curious if the authors had already looked into something along this vein. Presumably complete EMALEs are relatively recent acquisitions while fragmented EMALEs have been inactivated by random processes (point mutations followed by larger insertion-deletions) and are therefore more ancient. Have you looked at making phylogenies for the core morphology module genes in the EMALE fragments to see if they represent more basal types?</p><p>Below are some points where some additional details would provide clarification.</p><p>– Were there other GC-low regions that did not correspond to EMALEs? It is curious that the genome seems so uniformly GC high.</p><p>– Do lone ngaro elements seem to be integrated in GC-low regions?</p><p>L410 &quot;either of the three fractions&quot; What are the three fractions? Do the authors mean &quot;host&quot;, &quot;EMALE&quot; and &quot;NGARO&quot;?</p><p>Why were only PacBio reads used to quantify the percentage of EMALE/NGARO and not also the Illumina data? Was it due to GC bias?</p><p>L415 &quot;samtools v1.9(47)&quot; Missing space before the citation.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>The size of (B) is a bit small so it is a bit hard to decipher with the symbols.</p><p>The description of (B) could do with a better description that states the lines represent contigs in decreasing size ordered from left to right and top to bottom.</p><p>The legend is missing descriptions for parts (C and D).</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>A description in the legend of what the terms in the plot &quot;complete&quot; &quot;FALSE&quot; and &quot;TRUE&quot; refer to is needed.</p><p>Figure 3.</p><p>Perhaps instead of the dashed line separating the region of homology between types 1 and 2, another line at the 5' end would better show it as a block of homology.</p><p>What program was used to produce the genomic maps?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72674.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers made several suggestions and comments that, if addressed, would significantly strengthen your manuscript and clarify its presentation, so i recommend that you consider them and revise accordingly.

The apparent accumulation in MV19 (predicted peptidase domain) is probably insignificant, since at least two of the affected EMALEs are redundant (found in homologous host genomic loci).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to note the Pfam domain of the Ngaro elements the first time they are mentioned in the text (or if Pfam is not preferred for some reason some alternative protein family, such as an NCVOG or Interpro ID). This would help to more precisely define these elements for readers. It is also unclear in the Methods how the Ngaro elements were identified- I understand this probably involved manual curation to some extent, but it would be useful to know what features the authors looked for when performing these analyses (best BLASTp hits, Pfam domain hits, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Pfam domains are now listed in the text. We added a paragraph to Materials and methods called “Detection of Ngaro retrotransposons” that describes our procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are homologs of the Ngaro genes found in giant virus genomes? This could be advantageous to giant viruses due to their potential to inactivate virophage. It would be interesting if giant viruses promoted Ngaro gene proliferation. Proteins for a collection of NCLDV and their Pfam annotations are publicly available on the Giant Virus Database (https://faylward.github.io/GVDB/), so it may be easy enough to check what the distribution of these elements across the diversity of NCLDV looks like. If the authors chose to do a quick survey of Ngaro elements in other NCLDV it would increase the breadth and impact of the study, but this is not strictly necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially had a similar idea, but dismissed it after blast searches against public databases containing giant viruses did not reveal any matches. We now also did a quick comparison of the five Ngaro-type species (1,2a,2b,3,4) elements against the genomes in GVDB. We found one weak hit in one genome (mmseqs translated search, 600 bp, 1.5e-4), but the surrounding regions did not contain any repeat structures that would indicate the presence of a Ngaro-type transposon. Hence, we do not have any evidence that giant viruses contribute to Ngaro proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors provide an interesting discussion on why a previous study found many fewer endogenous virophage (Blanc et al., PNAS 2015). I reviewed the methods of this study and found them to be quite robust, so it is rather surprising that more endogenous virophage were not found. Hackl et al., rightfully point out that assembly issues may mask the presence of these elements. Another important point is that many fewer reference virophage were available in 2015, so homology based methods were more limited at this time.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, reports of virophage sequences have increased in recent years, which we now point out in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The skew towards EMALE integration in intergenic regions is interesting. Given the accumulation of junk DNA in many eukaryotic genomes I would actually predict that many degraded EMALEs would not be removed through purifying selection, and that they would accumulate (though given the high effective population size of these marine hosts it is possible). Is it possible that this bias is due to the difficulty in identifying degraded EMALEs? Perhaps there are more degraded EMALEs in the genome but they are just harder to detect? (see comment below).</p></disp-quote><p>You probably meant “The skew towards Ngaro integration in EMALE intergenic regions”? This is an interesting topic, of which we currently know very little about in Cafeteria and thus can only speculate.</p><p>First, the genome size of Cafeteria is rather small (~35 Mbp) compared to many other eukaryotes, hence massive accumulation of ‘junk DNA’ is somewhat unlikely.</p><p>Second, our study predicts that virophage integration in Cafeteria genomes is an ongoing process. In order to prevent ‘parasitic DNA overload’, mechanisms must exist to either prevent further integration of virophage genomes, or to remove EMALEs from the host genome, e.g. by recombination. This may affect intact as well as degraded elements. It is possible that recombination events leading to EMALE removal increase with increasing numbers of EMALEs, thus restoring a balance faster than via pseudogenization and subsequent loss.</p><p>Third, it is not clear how many degraded EMALEs are actually present. We found a few truncated elements (e.g. EMALE type 08), and scattered signs of pseudogenization. However, the few EMALEs with apparent pseudogenes that we were able to PCR-amplify and re-sequence with the Sanger technique turned out to be fully intact, and the premature stop codons were likely an assembly artifact in these cases (Figure 3—figure supplement 6, previously Figure S10). Whereas the actual number of pseudogenes in EMALEs is probably not zero, it is likely to be lower than it may seem at first glance.</p><p>Fourth, we did not find evidence that Ngaro insertion leads to pseudogenization in EMALEs.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that Ngaros spread via EMALE propagation and that the observed Ngaro integration skew towards EMALE intergenic regions is the result of a selective process that preserves EMALE activity.</p><p>Finally, we do not think that we missed degraded EMALEs in our assemblies, please see also our answers to questions 1.1, 1.8 and 1.9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps I missed it but I could not find information on how the EMALEs were initially identified and delineated in the Methods. The results state that &quot;To identify endogenous virophages, we combined sequence similarity searches against known virophage genomes with genomic screening for GC-content anomalies. The two approaches yielded redundant results and virophage elements were clearly discernible from eukaryotic genome regions based on their low (30-50%) GC-content (Figure 1A)&quot;. To me this seems quite general and it is not clear what tools were used- for example, I am assuming that sequence similarity searches were done at the amino acid level, and if so was this done with the genes already predicted from the previous Sci Data paper? This is an important detail since gene prediction algorithms often miss NCLDV and virophage genes. In the Scientific Data publication the gene prediction was done with &quot;the BRAKER pipeline which utilizes BLAST Augustus and GeneMark-ES. Augustus and GeneMark-ES gene models were trained with publicly available transcriptomic data of C. roenbergensis E4-10P as extrinsic evidence&quot;. If EMALE genes are extensively pseudogenized or not expressed would this pipeline still predict them? More details on EMALE detection and some commentary on the possible limitations of degraded EMALE prediction would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize; this vital method section detailing these aspects should have been included in the initial manuscript. As suspected by the reviewer, EMALEs are not well annotated by eukaryotic annotation pipelines, but have to be annotated separately for good results. To do so, we initially took a manual approach, identified putative endogenous viruses based on clearly visible drops in GC-content along contigs when visualized in Artemis, supported by the presence of terminal inverted repeats in dotplots of those regions. If terminal repeats were missing, we used the GC-content to manually define EMALE boundaries.</p><p>For the 33 EMALEs with TIRs, we predicted open reading frames in Artemis and manually curated those into gene calls. For the partial EMALEs we called genes using prodigal with models pretrained on the manually annotated complete EMALEs.</p><p>Across the 4 Cafeteria strains, annotated EMALEs account for 85-93% regions with GC-content lower than 56% (measured as 2000bp sequence windows with a GC-content &lt;56%). We manually inspected all locations with deviant GC-content and found the remaining larger regions to be accounted for either by rRNA gene clusters or simple tandem repeats, possibly related to telomeric or centromeric regions.</p><p>We also performed blastx searches with the newly identified EMALEs as well as a collection of known virophages against the Cafeteria assemblies to verify that we did not miss other integrated virophages that might not be detectable by GC-content. We are also reasonably confident that our approach is able to detect pseudogenized virophages and that our set of detected EMALEs is comprehensive. However, we of course, cannot exclude that we may have missed viral elements that do not exhibit any obvious deviation in GC-content and at the same time do not share any sequence homology to other known virophages. We modified the discussion to include these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EVEs necessarily exist on a spectrum from intact to degraded, and the reality is that the most degraded elements may consist of only a single pseudogene and may not be confidently detected using any method. I often think of this, since eukaryotic genomes are full of junk DNA with ambiguous origins- one hypothesis is that much of it derives from endogenous viruses that subsequently degrade beyond all recognition. Some additional discussion of this be useful for interpreting the consequences of retrotransposition, since one would expect that these would actually inactivate quite a few EMALEs and effectively turn them into junk DNA.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to our previous answers, we think that the situation of Cafeteria EMALEs is quite different from other eukaryotic EVEs described so far. Comparison of the four Cafeteria strains revealed that only few EMALE integration loci are conserved among otherwise near-identical host strains. This suggests a fast turnover time for EMALEs, which is not the case for other EVEs that are often described as ‘genomic fossils’. Thus, it may be possible that many EMALEs are removed long before they can pseudogenize, e.g. by TIR-based recombination, homologous recombination between chromosomes, or excised by EMALE- or host-encoded enzymes (integrases, endonucleases). These processes would still apply even when the EMALE is degraded, hence pseudogenized remnants of EMALEs may be rarer than for other eukaryotic EVEs.</p><p>Such thoughts are still highly speculative at this early stage of genomic exploration of Cafeteria populations, but we have added a paragraph to the discussion summarizing these considerations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I was only wondering why the authors did not perform an experiment to assess the reactivation of the type 4 EMALEs upon CroV infection as it would nicely demonstrate they are functional MGEs. This would also address the need for another giant virus for EMALEs presenting different promoters.</p><p>To me it is not mandatory but would nicely complement the present findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive feedback! We fully agree with this comment and have already invested a considerable amount of work into testing EMALE reactivation in response to CroV infection. However, we strongly prefer to publish these findings separately, as they are quite comprehensive and would clearly exceed the limits of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reading of this manuscript also raised one question. Since some groups only possess rve integrase and some present an additional Tyr recombinase, I was wondering if one could be meant for integration into the host genome while the second could be for integration into the giant virus genome, as it is the case for Sputnik which only have the Tyr recombinase and only integrates into the giant virus genome.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely. This is certainly an interesting notion that we share (see L. 147). Given that virophages need two biological entities (host and giant virus) for successful horizontal propagation, the strategy of physically tracking one of these entities appears to be essential. So far, Sputnik integration has only been shown in mimiviruses, and mavirus integration only in its cellular host. Some EMALEs may have combined both strategies but unfortunately, at this point we lack any data that would shed more light on the biological significance of EMALE-encoded Tyr recombinases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also have a naïve question concerning the pseudogenized EMALEs without Ngaros retrotransposon. The authors addressed this question on the role of Ngaros in EMALE pseudogenization but focused on complete versus absent and did not look for remnants of possible Ngaro. Could pseudogenization in the ones without Ngaros be the result of ancient integrations that disappeared, just leaving for instance the A, B signatures in these EMALEs ?</p></disp-quote><p>A valid question. We analyzed all EMALE genomes (partial and full) by blast using Ngaro A and B repeats as input and found 5 cases of EMALEs (mostly partial elements) with solo AB repeats. One of them is already marked in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (previously Figure S2): Cflag_215, which is a truncated EMALE04, and recombination of the Ngaro repeats could have led to the truncation of that element. We now include this information in the text.</p><p>However, we found no evidence for increased pseudogenization in these cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I noticed that in Figure 1 legend B is difficult to read and legends for C and D panels are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing! We modified the layout for Figure 1 and added the accidentally deleted legends of C and D.

Same in panel B for RCC970, between c188 and c258 for which a possible explanation is provided, yet the GC content seems to cover this gap.</p></disp-quote><p>You have a keen eye! Contigs c023 and c119 actually overlap, i.e. the ends of those two contigs align to the same region on BVI-028. The appearance of GC/repeat-content covering gaps is a technical artifact from the plotting program. We now manually removed the extra GC-plot regions from Figure 3—figure supplement 3 (previously Figure S7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is a very thorough analysis and raises many avenues for future work.</p><p>I found myself speculating on how the biology of the system is working in terms of the gain-and-loss of EMALEs, with one idea for an analysis that could be done. I am not proposing this as additional work, but I am curious if the authors had already looked into something along this vein. Presumably complete EMALEs are relatively recent acquisitions while fragmented EMALEs have been inactivated by random processes (point mutations followed by larger insertion-deletions) and are therefore more ancient. Have you looked at making phylogenies for the core morphology module genes in the EMALE fragments to see if they represent more basal types?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the suggestions and the positive assessment of our work!</p><p>Yes, we included partial and full EMALEs in our phylogenetic analyses and the resulting patterns were clear: EMALE genes clustered always based on their type, but not based on whether they were found in full or partial EMALEs. That being said, partial EMALEs are not necessarily more degraded (i.e. containing more pseudogenes, insertions or deletions) than full-length EMALEs, but were rather not fully assembled by the computer algorithm (see also answer to question 1.1, reviewer 1). The same pattern was observed for the two truncated EMALEs of type 4 (Cflag_215 and BVI_002), as shown in Figure 4. We did not include the partial EMALEs in these trees for the sake of readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below are some points where some additional details would provide clarification.</p><p>– Were there other GC-low regions that did not correspond to EMALEs?

Later on we used PCR-reduced library preparation protocols which mitigated those biases somewhat, although not entirely.
