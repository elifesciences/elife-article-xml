However, details about their transcriptomic changes under neuropathic pain conditions remain unclear. Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve represents a well-established model of neuropathic pain, and we conducted single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize subtype-specific perturbations of transcriptomes in lumbar DRG neurons on day 7 post-CCI. By using <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mice that selectively express an enhanced <italic>green fluorescent protein</italic> in DRG neurons, we established a highly efficient purification process to enrich neurons for scRNA-seq. We observed the emergence of four prominent CCI-induced clusters and a loss of marker genes in injured neurons. Importantly, a portion of injured neurons from several clusters were spared from injury-induced identity loss, suggesting subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in injured neurons. Moreover, uninjured neurons, which are necessary for mediating the evoked pain, also demonstrated cell-type-specific transcriptomic perturbations in these clusters, but not in others. Notably, male and female mice showed differential transcriptomic changes in multiple neuronal clusters after CCI, suggesting transcriptomic sexual dimorphism in DRG neurons after nerve injury. Using <italic>Fgf3</italic> as a proof-of-principle, RNAscope study provided further evidence of increased <italic>Fgf3</italic> in injured neurons after CCI, supporting scRNA-seq analysis, and calcium imaging study unraveled a functional role of <italic>Fgf3</italic> in neuronal excitability. These findings may contribute to the identification of new target genes and the development of DRG neuron cell-type-specific therapies for optimizing neuropathic pain treatment and nerve regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>dorsal root ganglion</kwd><kwd>nerve injury</kwd><kwd>axon regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS070814</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS110598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS117761</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG0689997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY031742</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xue-Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG066603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007880</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA-sequencing unraveled cell subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in both injured and uninjured primary sensory neurons after nerve injury and demonstrated transcriptomic sexual dimorphism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) contains the somas of primary sensory neurons, which differ in size and axon myelination. Different gene expression profiles confer divergent neurochemical, physiologic, and functional properties on the various subtypes of DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gatto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Usoskin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). Small-diameter neurons are important for transmitting nociceptive and thermal information, whereas large-diameter neurons are mainly non-nociceptive neurons, including mechanoreceptors and proprioceptors. Nerve injury induces various responses in DRG neurons, including cell stress, regeneration, hyperexcitability, and functional maladaptation. How these changes vary in functionally distinct neuronal subtypes and possibly affect nerve regeneration and neuropathic pain remains unclear.</p><p>Recently, single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq/snRNA-seq) has begun to reveal transcriptomic perturbations in DRG neurons after transection or crush nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, there remain many important questions which are not fully addressed, especially differential transcriptional changes in functionally distinct DRG neuronal subtypes related to neuropathic pain. The crush injury model used in some of previous studies is more suitable for studying nerve regeneration than for closely capturing the etiology of clinical neuropathic pain, which often involves chronic compression, neuroinflammation, and partial injury to a major nerve. Axotomized neurons may exhibit the most profound gene expression changes that are important for regeneration. Nevertheless, neighboring uninjured DRG neurons also show significant functional changes (e.g., hyperexcitability) and contribute to dysesthesia and evoked pain hypersensitivity as a result of the remaining peripheral innervations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djouhri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalpachidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tran and Crawford, 2020</xref>). Thus, identifying and differentiating transcriptional changes in injured and uninjured neurons in a cell-type-specific manner will be important to search for new targets for nerve regeneration and pain treatment. So far, most previous scRNA-seq studies have mainly focused on changes in injured neurons, but details of possible cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in uninjured DRG neurons under neuropathic pain conditions remain partially known. Moreover, increasing clinical and preclinical evidence suggests that males and females have differences in pain sensitivity and susceptibility to chronic pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fillingim et al., 2009</xref>). To optimize clinical treatment, it will also be important to delineate sex-related gene expression changes in functionally distinct subtypes of DRG neurons after nerve injury and determine how these changes underpin sexual dimorphisms in neuropathic pain.</p><p>We established a highly efficient purification approach by using <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mice to enrich DRG neurons for scRNA-seq. <italic>Pirt</italic> is expressed in &gt;83.9% of neurons in mouse DRG, but not in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, green fluorescent protein (GFP) is selectively expressed in most DRG neurons in <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mice, driven by the <italic>Pirt</italic> promoter. GFP expression allows effective purification of DRG neurons from these mice. We then characterized perturbations of transcriptomes in DRG neurons at the single-cell level after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. The CCI model represents a well-established neuropathic pain model that encompasses compression, ischemia, inflammation, and axonal demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett and Xie, 1988</xref>). It has been suggested to mimic the etiology of clinical conditions and induces symptoms similar to those of post-traumatic neuropathic pain in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Challa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costigan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griffin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaCroix-Fralish et al., 2011</xref>). Since cell interactions may occur within the same ganglion, the excitability and transcriptional changes in uninjured neurons can be greatly affected by satellite glial cells (SGCs) and neighboring injured neurons. Because only a portion of sciatic nerve fibers are injured after CCI, each of the lumbar DRGs contains a mixture of injured and uninjured neurons. Thus, in addition to characterizing injured neurons which express high levels of the injury marker gene <italic>Sprr1a</italic>, more importantly, we also examined transcriptomic changes in uninjured neurons (<italic>Sprr1a-</italic>) and investigated transcriptomic sexual dimorphism after CCI at the single-cell level. Our findings may be useful for developing DRG neuron subtype-specific treatment and sex-specific therapies for nerve regeneration and neuropathic pain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Enrichment of DRG neurons from <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mice for scRNA-seq</title><p>Mice were randomly assigned to four groups (n=5 for each group): Male-CCI, Female-CCI, Male-Sham, and Female-Sham.

Here, we provided new insights into subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in DRG neurons under neuropathic pain conditions. First, in addition to 12 standard clusters validated by known neuronal subtype marker genes, four CCI-ind clusters devoid of subtype marker genes showed a strong presence after CCI. These findings support recent observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>. Second, we unraveled four neuronal clusters (NP1, PEP5, NF1, NF2) which contain both uninjured (<italic>Sprr1a<sup>-</sup></italic>) and injured (<italic>Sprr1a<sup>+</sup></italic>) subpopulations after CCI whereas injured neurons of other clusters were mostly segregated into CCI-ind clusters as unidentified cells after CCI. Importantly, we provided novel evidence that uninjured neurons of these clusters also exhibited subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations after CCI. Third, our gene expression program uncovered sex differences in the transcriptional changes of DRG neurons after CCI at the single-cell level. Lastly, using <italic>Fgf3</italic> as a proof-of-principle, our RNAscope in situ hybridization study showed increased expression and distribution of <italic>Fgf3</italic> in DRG neurons after CCI, supporting scRNA-seq analysis, and in vitro calcium imaging study further suggested a functional role of <italic>Fgf3</italic> in neuronal excitability.</p><p>Genome-wide screening on bulk DRG tissues has demonstrated profound transcriptional changes after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">LaCroix-Fralish et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, because bulk DRG tissue includes a mixture of different neuronal subtypes and non-neuronal cells, bulk RNA-seq cannot distinguish differential transcriptional changes that occur in specific cell subtypes. Recently, scRNA-seq and snRNA-seq studies have begun to uncover subtype-specific perturbations of gene expression in DRG after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). However, most previous studies isolated cells or nuclei without effectively enriching neurons for sequencing. Consequently, a large number of non-neuronal cells would undergo sequencing, thereby reducing sequencing depth of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). By using <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mice in which EGFP is selectively expressed in most DRG neurons, we improved the purification and successfully enriched DRG neurons for scRNA-seq, with only a few residual SGCs; most other non-neuronal clusters were excluded. The resulting increase in sequencing depth largely increased the number of genes detected in DRG neurons, particularly for genes with low read counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perkins et al., 2014</xref>). It needs to be noted that although <italic>Pirt</italic> is expressed in &gt;83.9%of DRG neurons, the remaining <italic>Pirt-negative</italic> neurons are mainly NF200<sup>+</sup> neurons and have large-diameter cell bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the NF population may be slightly underrepresented in our samples.</p><p>Our clustering analysis identified 16 distinct neuronal clusters and one SGC cluster. Of those, 12 standard neuronal clusters were categorized based on known subtype marker genes, which were present in both sham and CCI groups. These findings suggest that a subpopulation of neurons in each subtype was spared from injury and maintained its distinguishing transcriptional program at day 7 post-CCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett and Xie, 1988</xref>). Strikingly, CCI-ind1-4 clusters showed diminished expression of subtype marker genes but high expression of injury-induced genes (<italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Sprr1a</italic>). These clusters were present at high levels only after CCI. Accordingly, they are likely injured neurons that have lost their original subtype marker genes. Indeed, the top 50 DEGs in CCI-ind1-4 clusters included those important to nerve regeneration and neuronal hyperexcitability. Because these neurons are likely axotomized and disrupted from peripheral receptive fields, they may play important roles in nerve regeneration and spontaneous pain after nerve injury. These findings are consistent with previous results obtained with snRNA-seq, which showed a new transcriptional state in DRG neurons after spared nerve injury and in trigeminal ganglion neurons after infraorbital nerve transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). A similar phenomenon was noted after spinal nerve transection, sciatic nerve transection, and crush injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). The common characteristics of these new neuronal clusters are the increased expression of injury-induced genes and diminished original neuron subtype-specific marker genes such as <italic>Tac1</italic>, <italic>Nefh, Nppb</italic>, <italic>Mrgprd</italic>, <italic>Th</italic>, and <italic>Sst</italic>, which may represent a general adaptation mechanism after mechanical/traumatic nerve injuries. We focused on examining transcriptional changes at day 7 post-CCI when neuropathic pain-like behavior reaches the peak and enters the maintenance phase. Since gene expression changes vary at different neuropathic pain stages, a time course study of transcriptional changes after CCI is warranted.</p><p><italic>Atf3</italic> induction may be rapid and is frequently detected in isolated cells due to the dissociation process. Unlike <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Sprr1a</italic> showed high specificity as an injury indicator in our scRNA-seq, which is in line with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Even though <italic>Sprr1a</italic> may be a better standard than <italic>Atf3</italic> to differentiate injured and uninjured neurons, a small number of <italic>Sprr1a<sup>+</sup></italic>neurons and CCI-ind1-4 clusters also appeared in sham groups. Their presence may have been induced by the skin incision and muscle damage of sham surgery, which can produce minor nerve injury, or by the cell stress and injury that occur during tissue harvesting and processing (e.g., dissociation, enzymatic digestion). A previous study showed that even sham surgery and minor peripheral injury may increase <italic>Atf3, Sox11, Sema6a, Csf1,</italic> and <italic>Gal</italic> in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, our RNAscope in situ hybridization study also showed that <italic>Sprr1a</italic> expression was minimal in sham group, but remarkably increased after CCI in the injured DRG neurons as indicated by the loss of cell subtype markers. In contrast, uninjured neurons which express the cell subtype markers examined in current study (<italic>Tac1</italic>, <italic>Nefh</italic>, <italic>Nppb</italic>) rarely colocalize with <italic>Sprr1a</italic>. Moreover, the expression of <italic>Fgf3</italic> which is among the top upregulated genes in CCI-ind1-4 clusters also robustly increased after CCI and highly colocalized with <italic>Sprr1a</italic>. Collectively, these findings further suggest that <italic>Sprr1a</italic> may represent an injury indicator and supports our scRNA-seq results.</p><p>Another salient finding is that a portion of injured neurons (<italic>Sprr1a<sup>+</sup></italic>) in NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2 clusters maintained their original neuronal identities at day 7 after CCI, and hence can still be clustered together with uninjured neurons from the same subtype. In contrast, the other eight clusters contained only uninjured neurons after CCI. The injured neurons in these clusters may have lost their identities and were assigned to CCI-ind1-4 clusters. This notion is supported by decreased cell populations in these clusters after CCI. Due to the loss of marker genes for different clusters, the neurochemical identity of CCI-ind1-4 clusters is difficult to confirm. However, a recent snRNA-seq study employed an elegant method to trace back the originalities of ‘injured state’ neuronal clusters, by examining multiple post-injury time points to consecutively capture residual transcriptional signatures (i.e., a set of processed transcripts that are expressed in a specific cluster) during the transition from uninjured to injured states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>). Their findings also suggested that the CCI-induced clusters may arise from neurons with different neurochemical identities before injury. The correlation analysis showed that our CCI-ind1-4 clusters correlated well with clusters such as cLTMR1, cLTMR2, and NP in Renthal’s datasets (7 days after sciatic nerve crush). It remains to be determined why injured neurons in NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2 clusters can still be clustered together with uninjured neurons from the same subtype, even though they have also lost some subtype-specific marker genes. This apparent discrepancy may be due to these injured neurons losing expression of only a subset of marker genes after CCI, but maintaining the major transcriptional signatures of the naïve state.</p><p>Increasing evidence has suggested that uninjured DRG neurons also play important roles in neuropathic pain and show robust neurochemical and functional changes after nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kalpachidou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obata et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pertin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tran and Crawford, 2020</xref>). Evoked pain hypersensitivities are common and important neuropathic pain manifestations and are mediated by uninjured neurons through the remaining peripheral innervations. Thus, identifying transcriptional changes in uninjured neurons in a cell-type-specific manner will be important to search for new targets for neuropathic pain treatment. Sciatic nerves contain axons from multiple lumbar DRGs, and CCI causes partial injury to the sciatic nerve. Accordingly, each of these lumbar DRGs contains a mixture of injured and uninjured neurons in CCI model. Strikingly, our analysis showed for the first time that uninjured (<italic>Sprr1a<sup>-</sup></italic>) neurons in NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2 clusters also undergo subtype-specific changes in gene expression after CCI, as compared to those in the sham group. GO analysis showed that these clusters shared changes in pathways involved in protein biosynthesis (e.g., translation, ribosomal small subunit assembly) with injured neurons, suggesting that they may enter a ‘preparation’ state in response to nerve injury. Functional changes of uninjured neurons under neuropathic conditions may extend beyond transcriptional regulation to also involve mechanisms such as increased translational rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gebauer and Hentze, 2004</xref>) and modulations by miRNA. In line with this notion, our GO analysis showed that a pathway named ‘<italic>positive regulation of Pri-miRNA transcription from RNA polymerase promoter</italic>’ was significantly regulated in the NF2 cluster. Systematic investigations are needed to sort out the functional effects of transcriptomic changes in injured and uninjured neurons from each cluster on nerve regeneration, neuronal excitability, and pain.</p><p>Renthal et al. also examined co-mingling, uninjured neurons using a sciatic crush injury model. However, they did not find cell-type-specific changes in these neurons. The reason for this discrepancy may be partially due to differences in the techniques (e.g., tissue processing, cell sorting, sequencing depth) and animal models. Compared to CCI model induced by loose ligation of the sciatic nerve, crush injury would injure more nerve fibers and it was estimated that &gt;50% of lumbar DRG neurons are axotomized in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the remaining uninjured neurons for sequencing may be much less than that in the CCI model. In addition, we used <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mice to establish a highly efficient purification approach to enrich neurons for scRNA-seq and therefore largely increased the number of genes detected in DRG neurons. Comparatively, the neuronal selectivity and number of genes detected were lower in the previous studies, which may have resulted in decreased ability to detect these changes and fewer DEGs.</p><p>Previous studies suggested that increased <italic>Fgf3</italic> expression in DRG neurons may correlate with pain hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brifault et al., 2020</xref>). Here, by examining the functional role of <italic>Fgf3</italic> as a proof-of principle, our calcium imaging study showed that attenuating the increased <italic>Fgf3</italic> expression in DRG neurons of CCI mice with siRNA rather enhanced neuronal responses to capsaicin. This finding suggests that upregulation of <italic>Fgf3</italic> expression after CCI may be an adaptive change that counteracts the development of neuronal hyperexcitability. <italic>Fgf3</italic> was shown to drive neurogenesis of Islet1-expressing motor neurons and mediate axonogenesis in cMet-expressing motor neurons after spinal cord injury in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldshmit et al., 2018</xref>). Additional gain-of function and loss-of function studies are needed to further ascertain roles of <italic>Fgf3</italic> in DRG neuron excitability, neuropathic pain and peripheral nerve regeneration, and to explore the underlying mechanisms such as regulating TRPV1 expression or function. It is important for future studies to examine the functional roles of other top DEGs in CCI-ind1-4 clusters and in uninjured neurons, in order to identify new targets for cell-type-specific treatment to promote nerve regeneration and inhibit neuropathic pain.</p><p>There is a growing body of literatures on sex differences in neuropathic pain mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Machelska and Celik, 2016</xref>). <italic>Xist</italic> is known to be expressed exclusively by the inactive X chromosome in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borsani et al., 1991</xref>). Indeed, we also found that it was selectively expressed in female but not male datasets, suggesting that <italic>Xist</italic> is a reliable female marker gene for scRNA-seq. Pearson correlation analysis suggested a similarity of gene expression programs in the two sexes under physiologic conditions. However, we found sex differences in transcriptional changes after CCI, and the cLTMR cluster may play an important role in the sexually dimorphic pain response. Among 296 female and 303 male DEGs induced by CCI, 79 were female-specific, and 86 were male-specific. In addition, 106 genes showed more than twofold differences between the two sexes after CCI. These findings are consistent with a bulk RNA-seq study of DRG, which showed vast differences in genes enriched in pain-relevant pathways between female and male rats after CCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stephens et al., 2019</xref>). Although these findings suggest that peripheral neuronal mechanisms may also underlie sexual dimorphisms in neuropathic pain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Renthal et al., 2020</xref> reported no differences in injury-induced transcriptional changes between males and females after sciatic nerve crush injury . The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear but may also be due to aforementioned differences in the techniques and animal models, such as the lower read count and numbers of genes detected which may have resulted in decreased ability to detect subtle changes and fewer DEGs in the previous study. Details of the distinct gene networks that function in different neuronal subtypes and might underpin sexual dimorphisms in neuropathic pain must still be explored at a single-cell level in the future.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our findings in a well-established animal model of neuropathic pain share some similarities with recent findings in transection injury models, including the loss of marker genes in injured neurons and the emergence of new, injury-induced clusters. Importantly, we demonstrated that subtype-specific transcriptomic changes occurred in both injured and uninjured neurons of NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2 clusters after CCI. Furthermore, we also provided novel evidence at single-cell level that transcriptomic sexual dimorphism may occur in DRG neurons after nerve injury, and cLTMR may play a pivotal role in sex-specific pain modulation. Lastly, by examining <italic>Fgf3</italic> as proof-of principle, our RNAscope in situ hybridization study provided further evidence supporting findings from scRNA-seq analysis, and in vitro calcium imaging study offered novel insights of the functional implication of <italic>Fgf3</italic>. New knowledge gained from current work and other recent scRNA-seq studies may provide important rationales for developing cell-subtype-specific and sex-based therapies that can optimize neuropathic pain inhibition and sensory nerve regeneration. For instance, an ideal therapy would target top DEGs in uninjured neurons in NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2 clusters for pain control, but would not interfere with important transcription programs needed for the regeneration of injured neurons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mouse</title><p>The <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mouse strain (C57BL/6 background) was a gift from Dr. Xinzhong Dong in the Solomon H Snyder Department of Neuroscience, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University.

All libraries were sequenced with the Illumina NovaSeq platform. The raw sequencing reads were processed by Cell Ranger (v.2.1.0) with the default parameters. The reference genome was mm10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis</title><p>Scrublet with default parameters was used first to remove single-cell doublets. After doublet removal, we filtered out cells with fewer than 1500 genes expressed and cells with more than 10% mitochondrial UMI counts. The rigorous filtering was intended to remove smaller residual non-neuronal cells such as SGCs. After doublet removal and quality control, we applied Seurat’s integration workflow to correct possible batch effects for the remaining cells of the four datasets. Before the integration, the four datasets were transformed into four individual Seurat objects with standard steps including ‘CreateSeuratObject’, ‘NormalizeData’, and ‘FindVariableFeatures’. Subsequently, we used ‘FindIntegrationAnchors’ with the top 3000 variable genes to locate possible anchors among the four datasets. Next, ‘IntegrateData’ was used to merge the four individual datasets. After the integration, default clustering steps embedded in Seurat were performed with 20 principal components (PCA) and 3000 variable genes. The steps included scaling normalized UMI counts with ‘ScaleData’, dimensional reduction with ‘RunPCA’, building a k-nearest neighbor graph with ‘FindNeighbors’, and finding clusters with the Louvain algorithm by ‘FindClusters’. Finally, we visualized identified clusters with 2D UMAP by ‘RunUMAP’. To find the most conserved markers in every cluster, we used ‘FindConservedMarkers’ and show the top 50 markers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. To evaluate similarities between identified single-cell clusters, we applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering with the pairwise Pearson correlation using 3000 variable genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To find DEGs between clusters or conditions, we used ‘FindMarkers’ with padj &lt;0.05 and Log<sub>2</sub>fold-change &gt;0.5 as the thresholds.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Classification of <italic>Sprr1a<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Sprr1a<sup>-</sup></italic> neurons</title><p>We used the expression level of <italic>Sprr1a</italic> to divide neuronal clusters into two subpopulations (<italic>Sprr1a<sup>+</sup></italic>and <italic>Sprr1a<sup>-</sup></italic>). <italic>Sprr1a<sup>+</sup></italic>represent cells with normalized UMI &gt;1 and <italic>Sprr1a<sup>-</sup></italic> represent cells with normalized UMI &lt;1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>GO analysis</title><p>GO analysis was conducted with DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huang et al., 2009b</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Theodore J. Price (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Four issues were brought up in the review.</p><p>1. It was felt that there is limited novelty as single cell RNA seq datasets had been published previously. Please discuss you findings in relation to other papers.</p><p>2. The newly-identified gene candidates have not been validated for functionality.</p><p>Knockdown experiments will strengthen this aspect.</p><p>3. As noted below, there is the issue of separating injured from uninjured cells, which, once again, needs to be worked on or discussed in depth.</p><p>4. All comments under &quot;Recommendations to Authors&quot; need to be addressed.</p><p>The request for a later time point is not considered as an essential revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Despite solid insights, the level of mechanistic advance and in-depth understanding represented by the results in the current form is limited. For example, although it is a major benefit to separate injured and uninjured neurons, axonal regeneration and plasticity-related genes were reported in both types. This is similar to previous bulk sequencing data which reports regulation of a vast number of injury-related genes.</p><p>Moreover, sexual dimorphism was noted here in contrast to a previous study on single cell RNAseq, but this has already been reported in previous bulk sequencing data from the same model of neuropathic pain.</p><p>Most importantly, the data remain at a descriptive level and exclusively involve data analyses on transcriptomic experiments. There are no follow-up analyses on the functional significance of the findings. Given that at least 3 single cell transcriptomics studies have been already published on the DRG after nerve injury, it would be of crucial importance to take up some of the most interesting transcriptional changes, such as in the new clusters described here or in injured vs. uninjured neurons, and study their functional impact on excitability of peripheral sensory neurons and neuropathic pain.</p><p>An additional experiment which would enhance the value of the study in revealing core mechanisms of neuropathic pain and particularly help delineate which transcriptomic signatures pertain to injury-related axonal structural changes vs. the emergence of neuropathic pain would be to perform single cell RNAseq after hyperexcitability is reduced and normal pain sensitivity is established. This is possible with the CCI model, since, as opposed to the spared nerve injury model employed in other transcriptomics studies, hypersensitivity and neuropathic pain are reversed within a few weeks post-injury.</p><p>Other Points:</p><p>Introduction: Sprr1a is indicated to be selectively expressed in injured neurons and employed as a marker for distinguishing these from uninjured neurons, but no citation provided.</p><p>In methods, please state how many DRGs from how many different mice were pooled to constitute single single samples for sequencing.</p><p>In order for the readers to judge the quality of the sequencing data, please show in methods or supplementary information how many cells showed less than 1500 genes and what proportion of the raw sequencing data was represented by doublets.</p><p>At the beginning of the Results section on sequencing data, please indicate the final n number of mice used for sequencing and the n number of samples. For behavioural experiments, an n of 5 mice/sex is indicated. Since DRGs were pooled across mice, does this mean that the n number for sequencing was less than 5?</p><p>Figure 1: The color coding in Figure 1C does not allow to clearly delineate the 4 different experimental conditions shown. The shades CCI and sham are hardly different and cannot be distinguished at the size shown. Please change to distinct colors. The data also do not enable determining whether the putative new CCI clusters are only seen in CCI mice. In Figure 2c, for example, one can see a similar cluster, albeit less dense, in sham-treated mice.</p><p>What is the neurochemical identity of the new CCI clusters? The Results section states that these neurons likely emerge from other cellular clusters owing to a loss of expression of typical markers. Since this is an important finding of this manuscript, the study should study the neurochemical properties and origins of these neurons. At least some of the genes induced in transcriptomics analyses should be validated at protein level and/or at least at mRNA level using in situ hybrisidation.</p><p>In the discussion, it is stated that Pirt1 is expressed in 'most' DRG neurons. Thus, are there DRG neurons that do not express Pirt1? It is important to transparently present this information since it is highly pertinent to the interpretation of the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have a comment with respect to adding new experiments, in addition to the public critique. I think that the paper is relatively weak compared to similar published papers on transcriptomic changes in the DRG after nerve injury for 2 reasons:</p><p>1) The authors focused on only a single time point. The paper would be far better if the transcriptomes of DRG neurons were evaluated at a late time point, and after pain had resolved. As mentioned above, this is the strength of the model used here.</p><p>2) The authors have not really used their data to gain new insight. For instance, they suggest that the NF1 and NF2 neurons might be involved in key aspects of neuropathic pain, but they have not used the information gained from the transcriptomes of these cells to do any pharmacological or genetic experiments to expand the insight.</p><p>Addressing one of these issues with new experiments would greatly improve the paper, at least in my opinion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;scRNA-sequencing reveals subtype-specific transcriptomic perturbations in DRG neurons of <italic>Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup></italic> mice in neuropathic pain condition&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Mone Zaidi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In particular, information on statistical analyses should be included more prominently and clearly in the manuscript. A section should be added under methods, and the figure legends should clearly describe the statistical tests employed. At present, asterisks are included with p values in some figures, but information on the tests employed is missing, while in other figures, statistical information is missing altogether.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76063.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Four issues were brought up in the review.</p><p>1.

For example, injured and uninjured DRG neurons may play different roles in neuropathic pain. Specifically, since the injured (axotomized) neurons have lost peripheral innervations, they can no longer mediate evoked pain hypersensitivity. Instead, these neurons may develop spontaneous activity, and play an important role in ongoing pain and central sensitization. On the other hand, uninjured neurons still maintain peripheral innervations and mediate evoked pain hypersensitivity. Clinically, both ongoing pain and evoked pain hypersensitivities are important neuropathic pain manifestations, and may require different treatments due to different underlying mechanisms which remain partially known. Thus, identifying and differentiating transcriptional changes in both injured and uninjured neurons in a cell-type-specific manner will be important to search for new targets for treatment. However, to our knowledge, previous scRNA-seq studies have mainly focused on changes in injured neurons. So far, details of subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in uninjured DRG neurons under neuropathic pain conditions remain unclear.</p><p>Technically, we developed a new methodology by using Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup> mice that selectively express an enhanced green fluorescent protein in DRG neurons, and established a highly efficient purification approach to enrich neurons for single-cell RNA-seq. This approach significantly increased the number of genes detected in DRG neurons, thus unraveling more details that have not been shown in previous studies. Our findings extended previous findings of changes in injured neurons. Importantly, we unraveled that uninjured DRG neurons of four unique clusters/subtypes exhibited significant transcriptomic perturbations after CCI. Conceptually, these findings of subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in uninjured DRG neurons have not been reported before.</p><p>We further applied pain-focused analysis of these data sets and demonstrated neuropathic pain-specific PPI networks of CCI-induced DEGs in NP1, PEP5, NF1, and NF2 clusters (Figure 4B-E). To our knowledge, this has not been done before. In addition, our study provided novel evidence of sex differences in transcriptional changes of different DRG neuronal subtypes after CCI, which have not been shown previously at the single-cell level. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the conceptual novelty of our study.</p><p>Finally, in this revision, we added new RNAscope in situ hybridization studies to validate changes in <italic>Fgf3</italic> gene expressions and distribution in DRG neurons. Moreover, we performed functional studies using in vitro calcium imaging and demonstrated the functional impact of <italic>Fgf3</italic> as proof of principle. Thus, we further improved the scientific rigor, innovation, and significance of our study. New knowledge gained from current work and other recent scRNA-seq studies may provide important rationales for developing cell subtype-specific and sex-based therapies that can optimize neuropathic pain inhibition and sensory nerve regeneration.</p><p>This research field is developing rapidly, we highlighted the novelty and significance of our findings in the discussion (Page 20), and also discussed about several major publications in the field as suggested by the reviewer. (e.g., Page 21, 22, 23, 25).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The newly-identified gene candidates have not been validated for functionality.</p><p>Knockdown experiments will strengthen this aspect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this good comment. We agree that functional validation of newly-identified gene candidates is important to extend current findings. The expression of <italic>Fgf3</italic> is among the top upregulated genes in CCI-ind1-4 clusters. Our new in situ hybridization study provided molecular evidence supporting the findings from the scRNA-seq analysis. Accordingly, we conducted an in vitro calcium imaging study to examine the function of upregulated <italic>Fgf3</italic> expression as a proof of principle. Future studies need to examine the functional roles of other top DEGs in CCI-ind1-4 clusters and those in uninjured neurons, to identify new targets for cell-type specific treatment to promote nerve regeneration and inhibit neuropathic pain. We included these new findings in Results (Figure 7, Figure S5, Page 19-20) and also provided a discussion (Pages20, 24-25)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Importantly, since glia-neuron and neuron-neuron interaction may occur within the same DRG, the excitability and transcriptional changes in uninjured neurons can be greatly affected by neighboring injured neurons.

We provided a further discussion of these issues (please see details below).</p><p>DRG contains functional different and molecular heterogeneous subgroups of sensory neurons and may show different transcriptional and function changes after injury. Sciatic nerves contain axons from multiple lumbar DRGs, and CCI causes partial injury to the sciatic nerve. Accordingly, each lumbar DRG contains a mixture of injured and uninjured neurons. Unlike CCI, the L5 spinal nerve ligation (SNL) would injure most neurons in L5 DRG, but neurons in neighboring DRGs were largely uninjured. Although injured and uninjured neurons can be readily segregated in the SNL model, clinical neuropathic pain conditions often result from a peripheral nerve injury involving a mixture of injured and uninjured neurons in the same DRG. Importantly, since glia-neuron and neuron-neuron interaction may occur within the same DRG, the excitability and transcriptional changes in uninjured neurons can be greatly affected by neighboring injured neurons. Thus, we used CCI model in this study for studying changes in both injured and uninjured neurons after nerve injury. We provided further information in the introduction (Page 5) and discussion (Page 23)</p><p>Although some findings of axonal regeneration and plasticity-related genes were similar to those identified in the bulk RNA-seq study, our scRNA-seq study provided much more details and new findings of the cell-type-specific change. This is partially due to our new methodology of using Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup> mice that selectively express an enhanced green fluorescent protein in DRG neurons, and established a highly efficient purification approach to enrich neurons for single-cell RNA-seq. This approach significantly increased the number of genes detected in DRG neurons, thus unraveling more details, especially changes in uninjured DRG neurons, which have not been shown in previous studies. For example, we found that uninjured DRG neurons of four unique clusters/subtypes exhibited significant transcriptomic perturbations after CCI. Since peripheral inputs are mediated by uninjured neurons, they mediate evoked pain hypersensitivity through the remaining peripheral innervations. Clinically, evoked pain hypersensitivities are common and important neuropathic pain manifestations, and may require different treatments from ongoing pain due to different underlying mechanisms. Thus, identifying transcriptional changes in uninjured neurons in a cell-type-specific manner will be important to search for new targets for neuropathic pain treatment. To our knowledge, these findings of subtype-specific transcriptomic changes in uninjured DRG neurons cannot be detected by using bulk RNA-seq and have not been reported before.</p><p>Regarding the sex difference, our study also provided novel evidence of sex differences in transcriptional changes of different DRG neuronal subtypes after CCI. These findings are consistent with sexual dimorphism shown in previous bulk sequencing data and further substantiated peripheral neuronal mechanisms for sexual dimorphisms in neuropathic pain conditions. Importantly, compared to bulk RNA-seq, the scRNA-seq study provided more details of cell-type-specific information. For example, Figure 6E shows the correlation between male and female datasets is strong in NP, PEP, NF, and CCI-induced clusters, but is only moderate in the cLTMR cluster.</p><p>We are aware that sexual dimorphism was not detected in a previous scRNA-seq study (see Discussion Page 25). Renthal et al. reported no differences in injury-induced transcriptional changes between males and females after sciatic nerve crush injury (Renthal et al., 2020). Although the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, we speculate that it may be partially due to differences in the techniques (e.g., tissue processing, cell sorting, sequencing depth) and animal models (CCI versus crush injury). For example, we used Pirt<sup>EGFPf</sup> mice to establish a highly efficient purification approach to enrich DRG neurons for single-cell RNA-seq, and therefore largely increased the number of genes detected in DRG neurons. Comparatively, the neuronal selectivity and number of genes detected could be lower in the previous study, which may have resulted in fewer DEGs and decreased ability to detect subtle changes.</p><p>We agree that details of the distinct gene networks that function in different neuronal subtypes underlying sexual dimorphisms still need to be explored in the future, and we included a brief discussion (Page 25).

There are no follow-up analyses on the functional significance of the findings. Given that at least 3 single cell transcriptomics studies have been already published on the DRG after nerve injury, it would be of crucial importance to take up some of the most interesting transcriptional changes, such as in the new clusters described here or in injured vs. uninjured neurons, and study their functional impact on excitability of peripheral sensory neurons and neuropathic pain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that functional validation of newly-identified gene candidates is important to extend current findings. Thus, we conducted a new in vitro calcium imaging study to examine the function of upregulated <italic>Fgf3</italic> expression after CCI as a proof-of-principle. <italic>Fgf3</italic> is among the top upregulated genes in CCI-ind1-4 clusters.

Fully examining the functionality of other top DEGs in CCI-ind1-4 clusters and those in uninjured neurons of NP1, PEP5, NF1 and NF2, especially in vivo on neuropathic pain and nerve regeneration will require a significant amount of work, and will be conducted in the future. We included these new findings in Results (Figure 7, Figure S5, Page 19-20) and also provided a discussion (Pages20, 24-25)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional experiment which would enhance the value of the study in revealing core mechanisms of neuropathic pain and particularly help delineate which transcriptomic signatures pertain to injury-related axonal structural changes vs. the emergence of neuropathic pain would be to perform single cell RNAseq after hyperexcitability is reduced and normal pain sensitivity is established. This is possible with the CCI model, since, as opposed to the spared nerve injury model employed in other transcriptomics studies, hypersensitivity and neuropathic pain are reversed within a few weeks post-injury.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this good suggestion. However, conducting a new set of scRNA-seq studies at the later post-injury time point when neuropathic pain has diminished would require a significant amount of work and is beyond the scope of this study. We acknowledged this limitation and provided a brief discussion (Page 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other Points:</p><p>Introduction: Sprr1a is indicated to be selectively expressed in injured neurons and employed as a marker for distinguishing these from uninjured neurons, but no citation provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide the reference for Sprr1a (Bonilla et al., 2002).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In methods, please state how many DRGs from how many different mice were pooled to constitute single single samples for sequencing.</p></disp-quote><p>We provided more information on the methods.

The shades CCI and sham are hardly different and cannot be distinguished at the size shown. Please change to distinct colors. The data also do not enable determining whether the putative new CCI clusters are only seen in CCI mice. In Figure 2c, for example, one can see a similar cluster, albeit less dense, in sham-treated mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the color coding. We did NOT claim that the new CCI-induced clusters are only seen in CCI mice. Compared to the prominent presence in CCI groups, these CCI-induced clusters were minimal in sham groups. We discussed the presence of these clusters at a low level in sham groups in our original Discussion section (Page 22). As the reviewer suggested, this may have been induced by the skin incision and muscle damage of sham surgery, which can produce minor nerve injury, or by the cell stress and injury that occur during tissue harvesting and processing (e.g., dissociation, enzymatic digestion). A previous study showed that even sham surgery and minor peripheral injury may increase Atf3, Sox11, Sema6a, Csf1, and Gal in a small portion of DRG neurons (Nguyen et al., 2019). This information was included in our original Discussion section (Page 22).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the neurochemical identity of the new CCI clusters? The Results section states that these neurons likely emerge from other cellular clusters owing to a loss of expression of typical markers. Since this is an important finding of this manuscript, the study should study the neurochemical properties and origins of these neurons. At least some of the genes induced in transcriptomics analyses should be validated at protein level and/or at least at mRNA level using in situ hybrisidation.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the loss of marker genes for different clusters, the neurochemical identity of the new CCI clusters is difficult to confirm. However, a previous study employed an elegant method to trace back the originalities of “injured state” neuronal clusters (Renthal et al., 2020). Their findings suggested that these newly emerged clusters may arise from neurons with different neurochemical identities before injury. We compared our CCI-ind 1-4 clusters with their datasets (7 days after crush) and found that the CCI-ind1-4 clusters showed good correlation with some clusters such as cLTMR1, cLTMR2, and NP in their datasets (Figure S6). We include this finding and more information in the discussion (Page 23).</p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we conducted a new in situ hybridization study to examine genes induced in transcriptomics analyses. Our RNAscope in situ hybridization study showed that Sprr1a expression was minimal in the sham group but remarkably increased after CCI. In contrast, uninjured neurons which express the cell subtype markers examined in the current study (Tac1, Nefh, Nppb) rarely colocalize with Sprr1a. Moreover, the expression of <italic>Fgf3</italic> which is among the top upregulated genes in CCI-ind1-4 clusters, also robustly increased after CCI and highly colocalized with Sprr1a. Collectively, the molecular evidence further suggests that Sprr1a may represent an injury indicator, and supports our scRNA-seq results. We included these new findings in Results (Figure 7) and provided a discussion (Page 23)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, it is stated that Pirt1 is expressed in 'most' DRG neurons. Thus, are there DRG neurons that do not express Pirt1? It is important to transparently present this information since it is highly pertinent to the interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>This information was presented in the last paragraph of the introduction that Pirt is expressed in &gt;83.9% of neurons in mouse DRG, but not in other cell types (Kim et al., 2008). Specifically, in the previous study done by our colleague Dr. Xinzhong Dong who developed this transgenic mouse line, expression of the knockin EGFPf was under the control of the endogenous <italic>Pirt</italic> promoter. Anti-GFP antibody staining revealed that GFP is widely expressed in the DRG isolated from these mice, labeling 83.9% of all neurons. Interestingly, <italic>Pirt</italic>-negative neurons are mainly NF200<sup>+</sup> and have large-diameter cell bodies. We included a brief discussion of a potential limitation that the NF population may be slightly underrepresented in our sample (Page 21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have a comment with respect to adding new experiments, in addition to the public critique.

Although meaningful, it was not our intention to conduct a time course study to fully characterize time-dependent transcriptional changes using scRNA-seq, which is costly and require a great effort for data analysis, etc., and is beyond the scope of the current study.
