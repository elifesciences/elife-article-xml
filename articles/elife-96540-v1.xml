to environmental cues and the regulation mechanism related to this event remain unknown. Adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification that extends transcriptome variety without altering the genome, playing essential roles in numerous biological and physiological processes. Here, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly of the rose-grain aphid <italic>Metopolophium dirhodum</italic> by using PacBio long HiFi reads and Hi-C technology. The final genome assembly for <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> is 447.8 Mb, with 98.50% of the assembled sequences anchored to nine chromosomes. The contig and scaffold N50 values are 7.82 and 37.54 Mb, respectively. A total of 18,003 protein-coding genes were predicted, of which 92.05% were functionally annotated. In addition, 11,678 A-to-I RNA-editing sites were systematically identified based on this assembled <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> genome, and two synonymous A-to-I RNA-editing sites on <italic>CYP18A1</italic> were closely associated with transgenerational wing dimorphism induced by crowding. One of these A-to-I RNA-editing sites may prevent the binding of miR-3036-5p to <italic>CYP18A1</italic>, thus elevating CYP18A1 expression, decreasing 20E titer, and finally regulating the wing dimorphism of offspring. Meanwhile, crowding can also inhibit miR-3036-5p expression and further increase CYP18A1 abundance, resulting in winged offspring. These findings support that A-to-I RNA editing is a dynamic mechanism in the regulation of transgenerational wing dimorphism in aphids and would advance our understanding of the roles of RNA editing in environmental adaptability and phenotypic plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aphid</kwd><kwd>RNA editing</kwd><kwd>wing dimorphism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012453</institution-id><institution>China Agricultural Research System</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CARS-05-03A-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Pei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Binding of miR-3036-5p to <italic>CYP18A1</italic> can be prevented by an A-to-I RNA editing, thus elevating <italic>CYP18A1</italic> expression, decreasing 20E titer, and finally regulating the wing dimorphism of offspring in aphid.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The rose-grain aphid, <italic>Metopolophium dirhodum</italic> (Walker) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is one of the most common and economically important aphid pests of cereals, including wheat, barley, rye, and oat, worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cannon, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honěk, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2020a</xref>). <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> is native in the Holarctic and then introduced into South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martinkova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackman and Eastop, 2000</xref>). Under the continental climate of Central Europe, <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> is usually the most abundant aphid species on cereals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Martinkova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Honěk, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Praslicka, 1996</xref>). In China, <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> was first recorded in the 1980s and then gradually spread from the western to eastern side of the wheat-growing regions, resulting in increased crop yield reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> damages cereals by sucking the juice from wheat leaves, stems, and young ears, further resulting in the deterioration of plant nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 1984</xref>). This aphid defecates sticky honeydew that further obstructs photosynthesis and reduces wheat quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>) and transmits a number of pathogenic plant virus, including the barley yellow dwarf virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kennedy and Connery, 2005</xref>). The nymphs and adults of this aphid may cause yield losses of 27–30% during the latter part of flowering stages of wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holt et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sánchez Chopa and Descamps, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Wing polymorphism is commonly observed in insects of various orders, including Hemiptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Orthoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Isoptera, Psocoptera, and Dermaptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>). Similar to most aphids, <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> can produce wing morphs when exposed to crowding, poor nutrition, and temperature or photoperiod changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Müller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braendle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>). Wing dimorphism in insects is an adaptive switch to environmental changes. In particular, wingless morphs allocate additional resources to reproduction, enabling rapid colony growth. Meanwhile, winged morphs focus on dispersal, which enables them to look for new habitats and food resources. Compared with wingless ones, winged morphs are better at long-distance migration and host alternation, thus causing more serious host damage and virus transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2019b</xref>). Great breakthrough has been recently achieved in the exploration on the molecular mechanism underlying the wing differentiation of planthopper. Transcription factors, Zfh1 and FoxO, were verified to regulate alternative wing morphs by faithfully relaying the insulin signaling activity in <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic>, providing a new dimension to the molecular explanations of this unique feature in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, miR-34 could regulate wing dimorphism by mediating the cross-talk among insulin signaling pathway, 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), and juvenile hormone in a positive feedback manner in <italic>N. lugens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ye et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Aphids and planthoppers may develop two different strategies in wing dimorphism. Planthopper nymphs can respond to environmental cues to develop into long- or short-winged morphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>). Meanwhile, wing polymorphism in aphids is usually transgenerational. The parthenogenetic mother could produce either winged or wingless offspring in response to different environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brisson et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, different regulation mechanisms may exist between planthoppers and aphids. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref> observed that a relatively high number of wingless offspring were produced after treatment with 20E or its analogue. Conversely, many winged offspring were produced when ecdysone signaling was suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) targeting the ecdysone receptor (EcR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>). A hypothesized model suggested that the elevated maternal ecdysone signaling may suppress the embryonic insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IIS) signaling and result in the high expression of FoxO-targeted genes for producing wingless offspring; the opposite is true for producing winged offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grantham et al., 2020</xref>). These results indicated that 20E is an essential regulatory factor underlying transgenerational plasticity in wing-dimorphic aphid.</p><p>In RNA editing, the sequence of an RNA is post-transcriptionally altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sapiro et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuddleston et al., 2022</xref>). Adenosine (A) to inosine (I) editing is the most prevalent type of RNA post-transcriptional modification catalyzed by adenosine deaminase (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA [ADAR]) that uses double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) as substrate. Owing to the highly similar structures of I and guanosine (G), cellular machineries usually recognize I as G during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Duan et al., 2017</xref>). High-throughput sequencing has greatly facilitated the genome-wide identification of RNA-editing events, and A-to-I RNA-editing sites have been systematically characterized in various organisms, such as humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Picardi et al., 2017</xref>), macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2019</xref>), mice, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Licht et al., 2019</xref>), worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rajendren et al., 2021</xref>), and cephalopods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liscovitch-Brauer et al., 2017</xref>). In this work, we generated a high-quality reference genome of <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> and performed transcriptome analyses to systematically identify the A-to-I RNA-editing sites of all transcripts.</p><p>The A-to-I mRNA-editing events of numerous genes in 20E biosynthesis and signaling were examined, and two synonymous A-to-I RNA-editing sites on <italic>CYP18A1</italic> were identified to be closely associated with transgenerational wing dimorphism induced by crowding. CYP18A1 plays key roles in 20E metabolism, and its abnormal expression could significantly change the 20E titer, resulting in developmental disorders in multiple insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guittard et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we identified that one synonymous A-to-I mRNA-editing site may change the binding ability of miR-3036-5p to <italic>CYP18A1</italic>, thus affecting the CYP18A1 expression, 20E metabolism, and wing dimorphism of offspring in <italic>M. dirhodum</italic>. These findings revealed a new crucial regulatory mechanism of phenotypic plasticity in aphids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chromosomal-level de novo genome of <italic>M. dirhodum</italic></title><p>A total of 41.17 Gb of high-quality paired-end reads were obtained by Illumina genomic sequencing (~92.22× coverage, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

More than 5000 species of aphid have been described, and approximately 100 of them are important agricultural pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Niu et al., 2019</xref>). Aphids have gradually become important models to study symbiosis, insect–plant interactions, and developmental polyphenism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Perreau et al., 2021</xref>). Owing to the remarkable advances in sequencing technologies, the genomes of over 20 aphid species have been assembled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). In this research, a high-quality chromosome-level genome of <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> was first produced using PacBio long HiFi reads and Hi-C technology. A total of 447.8 Mb genomic sequences were located on nine chromosomes, and 18,003 protein-coding genes were annotated. These genomic resources developed for <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> are valuable for understanding its genetics, development, and evolution and provide important references for the study of other insect genomes.</p><p>A-to-I RNA editing is one of the most prevalent forms of post-transcriptional modification in animals, plants, and other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">He et al., 2007</xref>). It acts through multiple mechanisms, including the alteration of protein-coding capacity, generation of diverse protein isoforms, influence on the miRNA binding ability on RNA targets, and alteration of mRNA recognition by RNA binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Teoh et al., 2021</xref>). A-to-I RNA editing also plays an important role in normal physiological processes, such as body development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buchumenski et al., 2021</xref>), reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and responses to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rieder et al., 2015</xref>). However, research on A-to-I RNA editing in insect, especially in agricultural pest, is limited. In the present study, 11,678 A-to-I RNA-editing sites were systematically identified in <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> by using the present assembly genome. This work is also the first systematic identification of RNA-editing events in aphids.</p><p>Wing polymorphism is commonly observed in insects, resulting from variation in both genetic factors and environmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2019a</xref>). For many aphids, polymorphism is transgenerational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>), that is, the mother senses the environment, and her offspring responds with or without wings. High population density is a key environmental factor that induces winged morphs in aphid species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vellichirammal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we also found that a large number of winged offspring of <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> would be generated under crowding conditions. CYP18A1, a key enzyme of 20E inactivation, is involved in crowding-mediated wing dimorphism. CYP18A1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme with 26-hydroxylase activity, a prominent step for ecdysteroid catabolism in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. When CYP18A1 was transfected in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, 20E was extensively converted into 20-hydroxyecdysonoic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guittard et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, <italic>CYP18A1</italic> is a 20E-inducible gene, and its ectopic overexpression in transgenic individuals could induce 20E titer reduction, growth arrestment, and larval lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Considering the essential role of 20E in the wing dimorphism of aphids, we speculated that CYP18A1 might be a key factor mediating this important process. Two synonymous A-to-I RNA-editing sites on <italic>CYP18A1</italic> could be affected by crowding and thus modify the expression of this gene. A-to-I RNA-editing levels are usually affected by changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rieder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garrett and Rosenthal, 2012</xref>). For example, one RNA-editing site in K<sup>+</sup> channels from polar octopuses greatly accelerates gating kinetics by destabilizing the open state so this species can adapt to the extremely cold environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garrett and Rosenthal, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The A-to-I RNA-editing events within mRNA transcripts have the potential to create or destroy the binding site of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Park et al., 2021</xref>). For example, 54,707 A-to-I RNA-editing sites were identified in Tianzhu white yak, and 202 A-to-I-editing sites altered 23 target genes of 140 miRNAs as determined by miRNA–mRNA interaction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakano et al., 2017</xref> showed that ADAR1 could positively regulate the expression of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which plays a key role in folate metabolism by editing the miR-25-3p and miR-125a-3p binding sites in the 3ʹ-UTR of DHFR, resulting in enhanced cellular proliferation and resistance to methotrexate. Here, we also found that one conserved miRNA named miR-3036-5p in this aphid can target on <italic>CYP18A1</italic>, and one synonymous A-to-I RNA-editing site (editing site 528) on <italic>CYP18A1</italic> could destroy this binding. Under normal condition, this site tends to maintain a low RNA-editing level, resulting in the alteration of <italic>CYP18A1</italic> expression and wing dimorphism of offspring regulated by miR-3036-5p. However, under crowding condition, this site has an extremely high editing level, so miR-3036-5p could not affect CYP18A1 expression. Therefore, the RNA-editing level of <italic>CYP18A1</italic> changes with the population density of mother aphids to affect the accurate regulation mediated by miR-3036-5p and the wing dimorphism of offspring in <italic>M. dirhodum</italic>. Epigenetic modifications to the genome such as DNA methylation and RNA editing are proposed to be a mechanism to regulate phenotypic plasticity by affecting the changes in transcription and subsequent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duncan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rangan and Reck-Peterson, 2023</xref>). RNA editing, a widespread epigenetic process, is hypothesized to be an adaptive strategy to generate phenotypic plasticity in cephalopods. Squid could rapidly employ RNA editing in response to changes in ocean temperature, and RNA-editing variants of kinesin generated in cold seawater display enhanced motile properties in single-molecule experiments conducted in the cold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rangan and Reck-Peterson, 2023</xref>). Our findings supported that insects could also use RNA editing as a mechanism to adapt to environmental pressure and generate phenotypic plasticity.</p><p>In conclusion, a high-quality chromosome-level genome of <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> was first assembled, and A-to-I RNA-editing events were identified to be extensively available in this important agricultural pest. Furthermore, we found that two synonymous A-to-I RNA-editing sites on <italic>CYP18A1</italic> could be induced by population density, which is important in crowding-mediated wing dimorphism. One synonymous A-to-I RNA editing at site 528 could inhibit the binding of miR-3036-5p to <italic>CYP18A1</italic>, thus increasing CYP18A1 expression, decreasing 20E titer, and leading to the wing dimorphism of offspring in <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Meanwhile, crowding can also inhibit miR-3036-5p expression and further increase CYP18A1 abundance, resulting in winged offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Transcriptional regulation including changes in the promoter of microRNA genes, and post-transcriptional mechanisms such as changes in miRNA processing and stability can both affect the final expression level of miRNAs.</p><p>This article did not address how crowding treatment regulates miRNA expression. But this will be a very interesting issue, and we will pay attention to it in our future research.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion.</p><p><bold>To Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>(1) “Transgenerational wing dimorphism was observed in <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> in which crowding of the parent (100 mother aphids in a 10 cm³ tube) increased the winged offspring (Fig 3E).” In this experiment, over 250 offsprings were used to calculate the proportion of winged and wingless individuals in normal (277), crowding (255) and crowding+20E (272) groups, respectively.</p><p>“The RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>CYP18A1</italic> and <italic>ADAR2</italic> can significantly increase the titer of 20E (Fig. 4E) and reduce the number of winged offspring by 29.6% and 24.4% (Fig. 4F), respectively.” In this experiment, over 245 offsprings were used to calculate the proportion of winged and wingless individuals in ds<italic>EGFP</italic> (273), ds<italic>CYP18A1</italic>(248), and ds<italic>ADAR2</italic> (250) groups, respectively.</p><p>“miR-3036-5p agomir and antagomir treatments could affect the proportion of winged offspring under normal conditions (Fig. 6F), but have no effect on the wing dimorphism of offspring under crowded conditions (Fig. 6L).” In this experiment, over 235 offsprings were used to calculate the proportion of winged and wingless individuals in each group, respectively.</p><p>So I think our conclusion that crowding treatment, A-to-I RNA editing, and miRNAs could affect the wing dimorphism of offspring in <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> is very reliable. Because the number of aphids we use to count the results is sufficient.</p><p>(2) The quantitative PCR method is used to detect changes in gene expression levels of <italic>CYP18A1</italic> and <italic>ADAR2</italic> after treatment with crowding, 20E, dsRNA, miRNA agomir and antagomir, and the results are shown in Fig. 3J, 4A-C, 5B, 6B, H, respectively. 5 biological replicates (more than 100 aphids were used for each biological replicate) were used in each sample, which might be sufficient for qPCR experiments. And among these biological replicates, the differences in gene expression levels are relatively small.</p><p>(3) The titer of 20E was detected after treatment with crowding, 20E, dsRNA, miRNA agomir and antagomir, and the results are shown in Fig. 3I, 4E, 6E, K, respectively. 8 biological replicates (more than 100 aphids were used for each biological replicate) were used in each sample.</p><p>The number of biological replicates used in each analysis and the number of aphids included in each biological replicate have been added in the Materials and Methods section.

A recent study has shown that editing events are poorly conserved across different <italic>Xenopus</italic> species. Even sites that are detected in both <italic>X. laevis</italic> and <italic>X. tropicalis</italic> show largely divergent editing levels or developmental profiles. In protein-coding regions, only a small subset of sites that are found mostly in the brain are well conserved between frogs and mammals.

A-to-I RNA editing was also observed in 5 other genes that involved in 20E biosynthesis and signaling pathway, but no evident difference was identified for the RNA editing and expression levels of these 5 genes after crowding treatment (Fig. S2, Table S5).

It would be fine to note the homology between Chr1 and the X of other Aphidini, but there are other explanations for that. Inference that Chr 1 is a sex chromosome might come from observations in karyotypes (by relative size comparisons or ideally from FISH) or from comparison of reads mapped to the chromosomes, suggesting Chr1 is hemizygous in males.</p></disp-quote><p>Karyotype analysis experiment was not conducted in this research, so here the sex chromosome was determined based on chromosome homology between <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> and <italic>A. pisum</italic> genome.

Thank you for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L205: It's unclear to me how to interpret RNA editing results, based on RNAseq data, that map to &quot;intergenic regions&quot;, especially when this is such a large fraction (37.3%) of the total result. Does this suggest a fundamental problem with the analysis, that so much RNAseq data maps to parts of the genome that are not annotated as genes?</p></disp-quote><p>Non-coding RNA regions often account for a large proportion in the genome, and this RNAseq data is mapped to non-coding RNA transcription regions (37.3%) between protein-coding genes (intergenic regions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L288-290: What degrees of confidence are attached to the predictions of these miRNA targets?</p></disp-quote><p>There is no clear research indicating the accuracy of miRNA target prediction software.

Therefore, relative realtime PCR is not particularly useful here. Finding that the miR relative expression is reduced by 48.8% is meaningless, because in *relative* expression, zero has no special meaning. In this case, absolute quantitative PCR, measuring actual transcript numbers, would be far more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>miR-3036-5p is not absent in aphids under crowded conditions. Only a significant decrease of miR-3036-5p in expression level under crowded conditions was identified compared to normal feeding conditions (Fig. 5B).

To make it clearer, this sentence has been modified to “Approximately 200 mg of fresh <italic>M. dirhodum</italic> with mixed stages (including first- to fourth-instar nymphs and winged and wingless adults)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L483: What mass or number of individual aphids was used? I assume multiple individuals were pooled?</p></disp-quote><p>Each sample contains approximately 200 aphids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L499: Why was k = 17 used? The default is k = 21.</p></disp-quote><p>The selection of k is usually an odd number between 15 and 21, which ensures that the types of k-mers can cover the genome while being small enough to avoid erroneous effects. Therefore, using 17 is very reasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L574: what does it mean &quot;multiple editing types&quot;? What different types are possible? Are you referring to things other than A-to-I editing?</p></disp-quote><p>That means besides A-to-I, this locus may also have other editing situations, such as A-to-C. If this situation occurs, it will be discarded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- L635: Which luciferase construct or plasmid has been used in this experiment? Citation to that source is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>PmirGLO vector (Promega, Leiden, Netherlands) was used in this experiment, and a reference has been added.</p><p>B. Zhu, L. Li, R. Wei, P.
