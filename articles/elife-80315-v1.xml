resistant tumors. While treatment resistance has frequently been attributed to clonal selection and immunoediting, comparisons of paired primary and relapsed tumors in melanoma and breast cancers indicate that they share the majority of clones. Here, we demonstrate in both mouse models and clinical human samples that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique transient cell-in-cell structures, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this cell-in-cell formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells remain intact and disseminate into single tumor cells once T cells are no longer present. This formation is mediated predominantly by IFNγ-activated T cells, which subsequently induce phosphorylation of the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and early growth response-1 (EGR-1) in tumor cells. Indeed, inhibiting these factors prior to immunotherapy significantly improves its therapeutic efficacy. Overall, this work highlights a currently insurmountable limitation of immunotherapy and reveals a previously unknown resistance mechanism which enables tumor cells to survive immune-mediated killing without altering their immunogenicity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer immunotherapies use the body’s own immune system to fight off cancer. But, despite some remarkable success stories, many patients only see a temporary improvement before the immunotherapy stops being effective and the tumours regrow.</p><p>It is unclear why this occurs, but it may have to do with how the immune system attacks cancer cells. Immunotherapies aim to activate a special group of cells known as killer T-cells, which are responsible for the immune response to tumours. These cells can identify cancer cells and inject toxic granules through their membranes, killing them. However, killer T-cells are not always effective. This is because cancer cells are naturally good at avoiding detection, and during treatment, their genes can mutate, giving them new ways to evade the immune system. Interestingly, when scientists analysed the genes of tumour cells before and after immunotherapy, they found that many of the genes that code for proteins recognized by T-cells do not change significantly. This suggests that tumours’ resistance to immune attack may be physical, rather than genetic.</p><p>To investigate this hypothesis, Gutwillig et al. developed several mouse tumour models that stop responding to immunotherapy after initial treatment. Examining cells from these tumours revealed that when the immune system attacks, they reorganise by getting inside one another. This allows some cancer cells to hide under many layers of cell membrane. At this point killer T-cells can identify and inject the outer cell with toxic granules, but it cannot reach the cells inside.</p><p>This ability of cancer cells to hide within one another relies on them recognising when the immune system is attacking. This happens because the cancer cells can detect certain signals released by the killer T-cells, allowing them to hide. Gutwillig et al. identified some of these signals, and showed that blocking them stopped cancer cells from hiding inside each other, making immunotherapy more effective.</p><p>This new explanation for how cancer cells escape the immune system could guide future research and lead to new cancer treatments, or approaches to boost existing treatments. Understanding the process in more detail could allow scientists to prevent it from happening, by revealing which signals to block, and when, for best results.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>cancer immunology</kwd><kwd>cell in cell</kwd><kwd>entosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003390</institution-id><institution>Fritz Thyssen Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmi</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001698</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmi</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmi</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004375</institution-id><institution>Tel Aviv University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmi</surname><given-names>Yaron</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Tumors escape killing by the immune system through generating transient spatial cell-in-cell structures that are impenetrable to cytotoxic compounds including lytic granules and chemotherapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Given the direct correlation between the prevalence of cytotoxic T-cell immunity and improved clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pagès et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fridman et al., 2012</xref>), most therapeutic strategies are aimed at harnessing T-cell immunity to fight cancer. These attempts include de novo expansion of tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Restifo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenberg, 2014</xref>), engineered T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gross et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kalos et al., 2011</xref>), or blocking antibodies directed against suppressive receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pardoll, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hodi et al., 2010</xref>). However, long-term follow-up indicates that while patients will experience tumor regression, it is frequently followed by recurrence of tumors that are largely resistant to subsequent treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gide et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gauci et al., 2019</xref>). As tumor cells often express mutated proteins or neo-antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vogelstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schumacher and Schreiber, 2015</xref>), it remains unclear why eliciting the full spectrum of T-cell immunity to these antigens is not sufficient to eradicate tumors.</p><p>Several theoretical frameworks have been widely employed to understand how tumors escape T-cell-based therapies. The main conceptual paradigm suggests that in order to avoid killing by T cells, tumor cells edit or lose their targeted antigens, or downregulate HLA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khong and Restifo, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gajewski et al., 2013</xref>). However, the presence of immunogenic clones expressing neoantigens and HLA molecules, despite having infiltrated reactive T cells, has been well-documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Straetemans et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, tumor resistance to immunotherapy was also shown to be acquired through tumor cell-intrinsic mechanisms, including loss-of-function of JNK and PTEN, MYC overexpression, and constitutive WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zaretsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sade-Feldman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peng et al., 2016</xref>). Alternative explanation regarding how immunogenic clones can survive T-cell pressure is attributed to the capacity of relapsed tumors to promote a suppressive microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Topalian et al., 2015</xref>). Along these lines, the discovery that tumor cells, as well as tumor-infiltrating cells, actively express receptors that negatively regulate T cells (i.e. PD-L1, PD-L2, and etc) activity highlighted novel mechanisms by which tumors escape immunosurveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iwai et al., 2002</xref>). Nonetheless, only about 30% of the patients achieve durable objective response following treatment with checkpoint blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Topalian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haslam and Prasad, 2019</xref>). Moreover, combination therapies of tumor-reactive T cells with immunomodulators such as regulatory receptors blockades are still not sufficient to profoundly improve response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rohaan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swart et al., 2016</xref>), which strongly suggests that additional escape mechanisms are involved.</p><p>While these frameworks provide important insights into the complex interactions between reactive T cells and tumor cells, why tumors recur in patients undergoing complete response following immunotherapy remains largely unknown. Most of our knowledge on this process comes from experiments comparing individuals who respond or do not respond to immunotherapy, and not from experimental settings that measure the cell-intrinsic changes, neoantigen landscape, and immune parameters within the same individual. Surprisingly, whole exome and genome sequencing comparisons of paired primary and relapsed tumors indicate that most clones in relapsed tumors are shared with the primary tumors, suggesting relatively low rates of clonal deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yates et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gundem et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, to study this process in melanoma and breast cancer, we developed several mouse models in which resistant tumors relapse following immunotherapies. In both mice and humans, we found that the tumor cells remaining after immunotherapy form unique cell-in-cell structures and generate membrane architecture that is impenetrable by immune-derived lytic granules, cytotoxic compounds, and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells maintain their integrity and viability and can survive for weeks in culture containing reactive T cells. Once T cells are removed, the inner tumor cells disseminate back into their parental single cells. Overall, this work suggests that this biological process is a central mechanism through which tumor cells escape T-cell immunity and give rise to relapsed tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Relapsed tumor cells share neoantigens with primary tumors</title><p>To study tumor relapse, we initially looked for a mouse model in which tumors recur following their complete regression. Since the effect of classic checkpoint blockade therapies are limited in most mouse models, we used a combination of dendritic cell adjuvant with tumor-binding antibodies to elicit highly potent T-cell immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spitzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carmi et al., 2015</xref>). A version of this therapy is now tested in a multi-center phase-I trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackerman et al., 2021</xref>). While this treatment does not recapitulate the exact effect of checkpoint blockade therapy, it induces T cell-dependant immunity that completely eradicates established tumors across multiple models. Therefore, when palpable melanoma tumors were injected with a combination of TNFα, CD40L, and an antibody against the melanoma antigen TRP1, tumors were almost completely eradicated in all mice. Nonetheless, after about 10 days, half the mice developed recurrent tumors that were resistant to subsequent treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar patterns of tumor relapse and resistance were also observed upon treating BALB/c mice bearing breast tumors with allogeneic antibodies and DC adjuvant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test if this occurrence represents a broader phenomenon, we also treated melanoma-bearing mice with splenic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing TCR against gp100 or TRP2 melanoma antigens. Both treatments induced significant tumor regression, followed by tumor recurrence in all treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As observed with the previous immunotherapy, recurrent tumors were resistant to subsequent treatment with gp100- or TRP2-reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In all cases, immune composition analysis of tumors following the second immunotherapy indicated treated mice across all immunotherapies show massive immune-cell and T-cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) with a dominant representation of T-cell clones against the melanoma antigens TRP2 and gp100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To test if these tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) are active, we adoptively transferred them to naive mice and challenged them with tumor inoculation. In two different tumor models, TIL transfer prevented tumor growth, further indicating that their overall activity favours immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-F</xref>). Next, we assessed changes in immunogenicity of tumors following immunotherapy. Analysis of melanoma cells showed they maintain expression of MHC-I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), as well as TRP2 and gp100 antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To assess changes in immunogenicity of resistant cell lines, beyond TRP2 and gp100 expression, we analysed their neoantigen landscape in comparison to that of B16F10 from untreated mice. To this end, we established four lines of B16F10 that relapsed following immunotherapy and were resistant to subsequent treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Whole exome analysis (WES) indicated comparable neoantigen burden across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) with the same 25 germline mutations with the highest MHCI affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). RNAseq analyses further demonstrated similar patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) as well as known B16F10 neoantigens in cell lines established from relapsed tumors sorted following effective immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To assess the human relevance of these findings, we next plotted the neoantigen burden identified in relapsed melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zaretsky et al., 2016</xref>) and in non-small cell carcinoma patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagnostou et al., 2017</xref> following treatment with checkpoint blockade.

Initially, cell lines established from tumors relapsed following TNFα, CD40L and anti-TRP1 were injected to naïve mice and allowed to reach a palpable size. Consistent with their patterns of gene and neoantigens expression, these tumors were equally susceptible to the same immunotherapy as the parental B16F10 cells, albeit relapsed more rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, these cell lines maintained their baseline levels of MHC-I, TRP2 and gp100 proteins albeit encountered with gp100 and TRP2 reactive T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, overnight incubation of these cell lines with gp100-reactive T cells indicated they are equally susceptible to killing as the parental cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To further corroborate that, we established cell lines from relapsed tumors following treatment with gp100-reactive T cells and assessed their responsiveness to treatment with gp100-reactive T cells. Indeed, these cell lines responded similarly to the parental cells to this treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Next, we tested if tumor cell lines established following killing with TRP2- and gp100-reactive T cells would be less sensitive to killing by the same reactive T cells. First, we established melanoma cell lines that survived killing by either gp100 or TRP2-reactive T cells. These lines were then incubated with gp100 and TRP2-reactive T cells, and their rates of killing were compared to that of the parental cell line (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that both B16F10 parental cells and the cell lines established following killing by reactive T cells were equally susceptible to T cell killing, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Taken jointly, these results suggest that transient in vivo mechanisms rather than inherited ones govern resistance of relapsed tumors. In support of this hypothesis, RNAseq analysis indicated that all the established cell lines cluster within the same principal components, whereas the expression profile of freshly sorted tumor cells from immunotherapy-treated mice is markedly distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Tumor cells surviving immunotherapy organize in a transient cell-in-cell formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tumor size (in mm<sup>2</sup>) of B16F10 control (WT) and cell-lines established from relapsed B16F10 tumors following re-treatments with DC adjuvant and anti-TRP1 tumor-binding antibodies (n=5).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of freshly sorted cells further corroborated a distinct segregation of the membranes and cytosols of the two cells.

We also tested whether tumor cells from different tissue origins can organize in cell-in-cell formation. To this end, we incubated tumor cell lines with allogeneic T cells and quantified the number of cell-in-cell structures after 24 hr. We found significant differences between tumor cell lines; on one end are pancreatic tumors and B cell lymphoma, which do not generate cell-in-cell structures, while on the other end, almost all the colon and ovarian carcinoma tumor cells that survive T cell killing, were organized in such structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>).</p><p>We then tested whether similar structures are also formed by human cancer.

Moreover, a 3-day recording of the interactions between colorectal adenocarcinoma and activated T cells highlighted the dynamic nature of these cell-in-cell structures, as tumor cells constantly form and disseminate from it. These results further stress that most single cells will undergo cell death (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). In contrast, T cell and myeloid lymphomas as well as glioblastomas did not form such structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–G</xref>). We also assessed that in a more clinically relevant model. To this end, we isolated melanoma cells and their autologous reactive T infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from freshly resected primary melanoma tumors. Overnight incubation of patient-derived melanoma and their corresponding reactive TIL, resulted in vast tumor cell killing. Approximately half of the tumor cells that survived in culture were organized in a cell-in-cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–H</xref>). To further corroborate these observations, melanoma cells from human patients were also injected into NSG<sup>-/-</sup> mice and tumors were allowed to grow. Once tumors reached approximately 40 mm<sup>2</sup>, mice were injected i.v. with 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> autologous TIL and with high-dose IL-2. Tumor sizes regressed drastically for several days until reaching a minimum size of 9 mm<sup>2</sup>, but regrew afterwards. Histological sections of tumors at this point indicated high prevalence of tumor cells organized in cell-in-cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We also analysed histological sections of multiple organs from four stage IV melanoma patients undergoing surgical resection of their primary, and metastatic draining lymph nodes. In all patients, cell-in-cell tumor formations were highly abundant in the T cell zone of the draining lymph nodes, but not in the primary tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2H</xref>).

The vast majority of isolated granules had a dark center due to high absorbance of uranyl acetate, rang at about 500 nm in diameter, and their luminal matrix was bounded by a bilayer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar characteristics were also observed in granules on the membranes of activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells incubated with tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next analysed the protein content of the purified granules by mass spectrometry. Overall, we identified approximately 400 proteins and out of those 273 were shared primary T cell secreted granules. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistently, incubation of these granules with tumor cells induced significant cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whether these granules are indeed lysosomes, or other intact lytic granules, such as super macromolecules attack particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bálint et al., 2020</xref>), remain beyond the scope of this work. Along these lines, whether these granules are released from dying T cells or through the active mechanism of exocytosis currently remains unknown. Most importantly, however, incubation of tumor cells with gp100-reactive T cells in the presence of antibodies that block the interactions with lysosomes/secreted granules (i.e. LAMP1, CD95, or CD63) did not alter T cells capacity to induce a cell-in-cell formation, suggesting that these molecules are also expressed on T cell membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Indeed, incubation of tumor cells with extraction of membrane-associated proteins, but not cytosolic or secreted proteins from activated T cells, induce tumor cell-in-cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–H</xref>). To elucidate the type of activations that predominantly induce these molecules, we incubated naïve splenic T cells overnight with various stimulators, washed them extensively, and incubated them with tumor cells. We found that T cells activated with IFNγ, and to a lesser extent anti-CD3 plus high-dose IL-2, induce the most cell-in-cell formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). RNAseq analyses indicated that the expression profile of IFNγ activated T cells differ markedly than that induced by anti-CD3 or LPS, which do not induce cell-in-cell formation in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next tested if other IFNγ -activated cells can induce a cell-in-cell formation, or whether it is restricted to activated T cells. We found that IFNγ -stimulated NK cells and macrophages, but not B cells, could induce a tumor cell-in-cell formation, albeit at a lower percentage compared to activated T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Similarly, human T cells from healthy donors that were pre-activated with IFNγ efficiently induced cell-in-cell formation in allogeneic tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that proteins that are predominantly, but not exclusively, expressed on both the membrane of IFNγ-activated T cells and on secreted granules mediate cell-in-cell formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Cell-in-cell formation spatially prevents the penetration of T cell-derived lytic granules to the inner tumor cells</title><p>Next, we assessed if cell-in-cell formation protects tumor cells from T cell-mediated killing. To this end, we compared the viability and apoptosis rates of single tumor cells to that of cell-in-cell. Initially, cell-in-cell formation was induced by overnight incubation of melanoma cells with T cells-secreted granules. Next, we added different ratios of gp100-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and measured caspase 3/7 activity in the tumor cells after 6 hr and overnight.

We next tested if cell-in-cell formation also endows protection from immunotherapy in vivo. To this end, cell-in-cell tumors were induced in vitro, before injection to animals, by overnight incubation with T cell secreted granules, or in vivo by injection of T cell-derived secreted granules. Cell-in-cell tumors that were induced in vitro have grown slower compared to single tumor cells, but experienced only minor regression following administration of immunotherapy. Similarly, cell-in-cell formation induced in vivo showed only benign response to immunotherapy.

These pores were almost completely absent upon co-culture with reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from perforin<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which have impaired tumor cell killing abilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Taken jointly, these results strongly suggest that cell-in-cell structures do not evade killing by escaping CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell recognition. Alternatively, we considered the possibility that lytic enzymes derived from T cell do not penetrate these cellular structures. Immunostaining of T cells attacking cell-in-cell tumors, indicated that the distribution of granzyme B and perforin is almost limited to the outer cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Initially, we sought to test if the observed results were cell fusion. Thus, we incubated tumor cells whose cytosols were labeled with either Wasabi or tdTomato with tumor-reactive T cells. Confocal analysis indicated that each cell type in the cell-in-cell formation maintained its cytoplasm, and no mix between colors was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, long-term follow-up of cell dissemination from this structure indicated that each cell maintains its initial single labelling color (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Similarly, each cell in this formation was separated and maintained the integrity of its original cell components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Given the similarity of this formation to entosis, we used ROCK inhibitor, which is the key regulator of this process.

We then tested whether the molecular machinery reported to mediate tumor spontaneous entosis applies to govern the current cell-in-cell structure.

Over 400 genes were increased in cell-in-cell formation induced by T cell secreted granules compared to untreated B16F10 cells, 215 of which were also upregulated by the tumor cells sorted from treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, ). KEGG analysis further indicated that multiple signaling cascades, including the JAK/STAT3 axis and FGF-receptors downstream pathways, are enriched in cell-in-cell formation generated in vivo, with approximately 80 significantly elevated genes relating to these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, ). Indeed, EGR1 and STAT3 expression was significantly elevated in cell-in-cell tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Both mice and human tumors incubated with reactive T cells had elevated their p-STAT3 levels, in comparison to untreated tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting this mechanism is conserved across species. Since these results may also reflect adaptation to the tumor microenvironments, we next corroborate the necessity of these factors to cell-in-cell formation ex vivo. Overexpression of either STAT3 or EGR1 was sufficient to induce cell-in-cell formation without additional stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Furthermore, these cells were significantly more resistant to killing by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell, compared to sham transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). We also tested if inhibiting these genes would reduce cell-in-cell tumor formation. Inhibition of STAT3 and EGR1, but not MAPK3 and EGR2, significantly abrogated the capacity of tumor cells to form cell-in-cell structures upon incubation with IFNγ-stimulated T cells and with T cell secreted granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to integrate cell-in-cell inhibition to an in vivo therapy, we first tested the effect of small molecule inhibitors on tumor cell formation. We found that inhibition of STAT3, or EGR pathway, completely prevented cell-in-cell formation upon incubation with reactive T cells or T cell-secreted granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since blocking EGR1 also reduced T cell viability, we then set out to establish a treatment protocol that combines STAT3 inhibition (which also inhibits T cell activity) and immunotherapy. To this end, mice bearing palpable tumors were injected with Stattic or with PBS for two consecutive days. On the second day, we sub-lethally irradiated the mice and injected them with 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> gp100-reactive T cells and IL-2. In another model, we treated mice for two days with Stattic, followed by treatments with anti-CD40, TNFα, and anti-TRP1. Recurrent tumors were treated with the same regimen. In both models, injection of Stattic alone had no effect on tumor growth. We found, however, that injection of Stattic prior to administration of immunotherapy partially restored the responsiveness of tumors that re-occur following immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K–L</xref>). While tumor cell sensitization may be a result from multiple mechanisms, these results stress the benefit of combining immunotherapy with STAT3 inhibition.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cancer immunoediting has been the primary paradigm for explaining how tumors escape T-cell immunity and the framework for most recent immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mittal et al., 2014</xref>). In support of this view, fibrosarcoma clones emerged in T-cell-deficient mice and were deleted upon injection to immunocompetent mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsushita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DuPage et al., 2012</xref>). Immunoediting is further supported by clinical observations in which tumors relapse by omitting their expressed antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verdegaal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">von Boehmer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). While it is clear that immunogenic clones can be eliminated by T cells, the presence of immunogenic clones that express neoantigens, despite having infiltrated reactive T cells, has been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Straetemans et al., 2015</xref>). Given the complexity of such a procedure, only a handful of clinical studies analysed changes in the tumor neoantigen landscape during immunotherapy. Zaretsky JM. et al. found that relapsed melanoma following treatment with pembrolizumab shares the majority of neoantigen with their corresponding primary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zaretsky et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, Anagnostou V. et al. found that non-small cells carcinoma (NSCC) relapsed following treatment with anti-PD1 and CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade bear similar neoantigen load, with only a relatively small number of putative deleted clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anagnostou et al., 2017</xref>). In a recent study, Yost et al. demonstrated replenishment of T cell clones in basal cell carcinomas patients treated with pembrolizumab. Interestingly, three out of four analysed patients exhibited similar neoantigen burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yost et al., 2019</xref>). These studies therefore suggest that immunotherapy-resistant tumors are composite also of immunogenic clones, which can be recognized by the host T cell, and that non-genetic mechanisms underly their persistence.</p><p>Alternative explanation regarding how immunogenic clones can survive T-cell pressure is attributed to the capacity of relapsed tumors to promote a suppressive microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Topalian et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, over the past decade multiple parameters have been suggested to predict patient’s response to immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thorsson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petitprez et al., 2020</xref>). However, why tumors reoccur in patients undergoing complete response remains unknown. Here, we found that tumor cells escape T-cell-based immunotherapies by forming a transient cell-in-cell structure, and not by immunoediting. These structures generate multiple membrane layers, thus reducing the probability of compounds’ internalization leading to increased tumor-cell survival. It should be taken under consideration that most of our results were achieved using immunotherapy of DC adjuvant in combination with tumor-binding antibodies. Albeit reproduced with adoptive cell transfer, whether cell-in-cell tumor-formations form as an escape mechanism for immunotherapy following checkpoint blockade is still not clear. Given the limited efficacy of classical checkpoint blockade therapy in animal models, it is challenging to employ it as a model for tumor relapse.</p><p>Many cell-in-cell formations have been described before including phagocytosis, cell cannibalism, and entosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishna and Overholtzer, 2016</xref>). Recently, some of these structures have been shown to enable tumor-cell survival after chemotherapy treatment by engulfing and digesting neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tonnessen-Murray et al., 2019</xref>). Although the present cell-in-cell structural falls within the definition entosis, it differs in several key elements: First, it is triggered predominantly by reactive T cells, rather than glucose and nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hamann et al., 2017</xref>), mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Durgan et al., 2017</xref>), or loss of adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, it requires de novo synthesis of genes regulated by STAT3, and not through β-catenin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Overholtzer et al., 2007</xref>). Most importantly, the structure described here is reversible and only rarely leads to cell cannibalism and apoptosis.</p><p>We found that only tumor cells that are capable to undergo ‘spontaneous’ entosis due to loss of cell adhesion, can form cell-in-cell structure following interactions with reactive T cells. Why hematopoietic cells do not undergo ‘spontaneous’ or T-cell-mediated entosis is an intriguing question that is not yet not clear. In general, hematopoietic cells do no undergo entosis but rather emperipolesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krishna and Overholtzer, 2016</xref>). It may be that since these cells are equipped with different sets of integrins compared to epithelial cells, they may lack the relevant integrins and cadherins that facilitate cell-in-cell tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). Instead, emperipolesis is thought to governed by hematopoietic-specific integrins, such as ICAM-1 and LFA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). It might be interesting, however, to assess if lymphoma patients that developed refractory tumors following administration of CAR T cells have increased cell-in-cell formation.</p><p>This work also highlights a theoretical limitation of anti-tumor immunity, as even in a model system where all the ‘breaks’ on T cell activity are removed, tumor cells may activate a STAT3 transcriptional program, which promotes spatial architecture impenetrable to cytotoxic mediators. Indeed, over the past decade clinical studies tested various combinations of chemotherapies or tumor-inhibiting drugs with immunotherapy, especially in melanoma and NSCLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apetoh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shafique and Tanvetyanon, 2019</xref>). However, since most tumor-inhibiting drugs also affect T cell activity, what is the optimal combination and sequence has been difficult to determine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karachaliou et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, many of these trials have been using immunotherapy followed by chemotherapy. Here, we suggest that immune-mediated entosis should be inhibited prior to immunotherapy in order to reduce tumor resistance to subsequent drugs.</p><p>Overall, the ability of tumor cells to transiently enter and disseminate from each other in response to T-cell killing is a biological process that has never been described heretofore. It better explains how immunogenic tumors can survive in the host and provides a novel framework for immunotherapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>WT C57BL/6 and BALB/cOlaHsd mice were purchased from Envigo Israel.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by W Kimryn Rathmell as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Clarification of the treatments used and relevance to current immunotherapy practices. If the therapy used is just a &quot;means to an end&quot;, this is ok but should be clearly stated as such.</p><p>2) More clarity in figures and legends.</p><p>3) Analysis of treated tumors for Figure 2I.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It is unclear what the tumor-binding antibody is and what is its mechanism. Is this a T cell engager? Meant to induce ADCC?</p><p>2. The treatment studied (anti-CD40+TNFa+tumor-binding antibodies) is largely irrelevant to most cancer therapies used today. Broadly linking observations with this therapeutic regimen to what is seen with conventional immunotherapy (i.e. checkpoint blockade) should be met with caution and should be more extensively discussed. The impact and relevance to translational cancer research would be much improved if this was studied during PD-1 blockade.</p><p>3.

Briefly, we have previously demonstrated that in order to elicit DC-mediated T cell immunity using tumor-binding antibodies, they must be delivered along with DC adjuvant (e.g. TLR agonist such as LPS, CpG, or a combination of cytokines such TNF and anti-CD40). These findings and the underlying molecular mechanisms were published in Nature 2015 (25924063) and JCI insight 2016 (27812544). We added a section to the Introduction clarifying the rational of choosing this treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Unfortunately, the effect of classical checkpoint blockade therapy in animal models is limited to a small number of benign tumors and it is challenging to employ it for relapsed tumor models. We used a DC-based immunotherapy that is shown to induce tumor-eradicating T cell immunity (Carmi Y. <italic>Nature</italic> 2015, 25924063; Spitzer M. and Carmi Y. <italic>Cell</italic> 2017, 28111070; Ackerman S. <italic>Nature Cancer</italic> 2022, 35121890) and its potency in human tumors is not been tested in multi-center clinical trials by Bolt Biotherapeutics. To test the relevance of our findings to additional immunotherapies, we also used adoptive transfer of tumor-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells as a treatment for melanoma-bearing mice, which is a common practice in treating melanoma. With that said, we have toned down some of the language and conclusions. Additionally, we have added sentences to the Discussion that highlight the limitation of our experimental model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As for Figure 2I, we replaced it to better present the morphological differences in tumor cells following T cell derived immunotherapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

It now compares histological sections from untreated and immunotherapy-treated mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. These structures don't look like cells inside of other cells, therefore the term cell-in-cell is misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point. We changed the language to describe more accurately these structures. They are now referred as structures where one or more nuclei were surrounded by multiple membranes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
