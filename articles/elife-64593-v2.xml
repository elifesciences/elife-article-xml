The Polycomb repressive system applies the repressive trimethylation on lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which mainly serves to silence genes during defined stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mozgova and Hennig, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the repressive di- or trimethylation on lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me2/3) is mainly associated with constitutively silenced heterochromatin, present in repeat-rich regions and TEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saksouk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wendte and Schmitz, 2018</xref>). Repression mediated by the Polycomb system is transient and dynamically regulated, while repression mediated by H3K9me2/3 is generally stable during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mozgova and Hennig, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Saksouk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wendte and Schmitz, 2018</xref>). The establishment of H3K27me3 is mediated by the evolutionary conserved Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). In plants, there are distinct PRC2 complexes that are active during different stages of plant development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mozgova and Hennig, 2015</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, the EMBRYONIC FLOWER (EMF) and VERNALIZATION (VRN) PRC2 regulate sporophyte development, while the FERTILIZATION-INDEPENDENT SEED (FIS) PRC2 is active in the central cell of the female gametophyte and the descendent endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mozgova and Hennig, 2015</xref>). The establishment of H3K9me2 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> depends on the SU(VAR)3–9 homologous proteins (SUVHs), KRYPTONITE (or SUVH4), SUVH5 and SUVH6 that act in a feedback loop with CHG methylation (CHGm) established by the CHROMOMETHYLTRANSFERASE 3 (CMT3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kenchanmane Raju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). In animals and plants, H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 are generally exclusive repressive marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiles and Selker, 2017</xref>); however, they co-occur in certain tissue types like the plant endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klosinska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Romero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weinhofer et al., 2010</xref>), as well as in specific organisms as filamentous fungi and bryophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montgomery et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, redistribution of H3K27me3 to heterochromatic regions occurs when constitutive heterochromatin is disrupted, indicating that specific features of heterochromatin prevent PRC2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Deleris et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jamieson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peters et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wiles and Selker, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Erasure of H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 is mediated by different types of JUMONJI lysine demethylases (KDMs) that belong to the KDM4 and KDM3 type, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2020</xref>). RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6) and EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) function redundantly as major erasers of H3K27me3 during <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). The zinc-finger (ZnF) domains of REF6 recognize the sequence motif CTCTGYTY (Y = T or C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Binding of REF6 to this motif is negatively affected by non-CG methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>), revealing cross-talk between different epigenetic modifications.</p><p>Seed development in flowering plants is initiated by a double fertilization event, where one of the sperm cells fertilizes the haploid egg, giving rise to the diploid embryo and the other sperm cell fertilizes the diploid central cell, initiating development of the triploid endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou and Dresselhaus, 2019</xref>). The endosperm regulates the transfer of nutrients to the developing embryo, similar as the placenta in mammals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linkies et al., 2009</xref>). The endosperm furthermore regulates seed dormancy, a process preventing germination of seeds under favourable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nonogaki, 2019</xref>). Both processes have been linked to genomic imprinting, an epigenetic phenomenon causing parent-of-origin specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batista and Kohler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gehring and Satyaki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piskurewicz et al., 2016</xref>). Imprinted genes are epigenetically modified during gametogenesis, establishing parental-specific expression patterns that are maintained after fertilization. Genomic imprinting leading to maternally biased expression is predominantly connected to DNA demethylation of maternal alleles mediated by the DNA glycosylase DEMETER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gehring et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsieh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, paternally biased expression is predominantly connected to the presence of H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHGm on maternal alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klosinska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreno-Romero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Romero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moreno-Romero et al., 2017</xref>). The FIS-PRC2 establishes H3K27me3 in the central cell, which is maintained on the maternal alleles after fertilization. Loss of FIS-PRC2 function impairs CHGm establishment, indicating that H3K27me3 is the primary imprinting mark and CHGm and H3K9me2 are recruited after H3K27me3 establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreno-Romero et al., 2019</xref>). The biological meaning of the co-occurance of H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHGm on the maternal alleles of paternally expressed genes (PEGs) is unclear. In this study, we reveal that genes marked by H3K27me3 on their maternal alleles are targeted by REF6 and become reactivated during germination. In contrast, REF6 fails to activate genes marked by H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHGm, consistent with the finding that DNA methylation prevents REF6 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). Among those genes with triple repressive marks was the <italic>ABA INSENSITIVE 3</italic> (<italic>ABI3</italic>) gene, a known positive regulator of seed dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tian et al., 2020</xref>). Genes activated by REF6 are enriched for ethylene signaling, a process activated during germination. Consistently, loss of <italic>REF6</italic> causes increased dormancy, as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). Together, our study unveils a mechanism that employs the combination of different repressive epigenetic modifications to time a crucial developmental process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genes marked by single H3K27me3 are expressed during germination</title><p>To understand the functional relevance of different combinations of repressive epigenetic modifications in the endosperm, we analyzed gene ontologies (GOs) of genes marked with single H3K27me3, single H3K9me2, and both modifications (referred to as H3K27me3/H3K9me2) using AgriGO v2.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/">http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/agriGOv2/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Genes marked by single H3K9m2 were not enriched for any GO category and genes marked by H3K27me3/H3K9me2 only for one; in contrast, genes marked with single H3K27me3 were significantly enriched for many GOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, among those GOs was an enrichment of genes related to ethylene signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dubois et al., 2018</xref>), a pathway which is activated in the endosperm tissue during germination to allow root protrusion through cell loosening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Linkies and Leubner-Metzger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linkies et al., 2009</xref>) and known to release seed dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudoin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corbineau et al., 2014</xref>). Supporting the GO enrichment, we found that genes with single H3K27me3 significantly overlapped with ethylene-inducible genes identified in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2016</xref>), while genes with single H3K9me2 and H3K27me3/H3K9me2 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We analyzed the expression of ethylene-inducible genes marked by single H3K27me3 during germination in the endosperm using previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>). We found that ethylene-inducible genes with single H3K27me3 were induced during germination, especially around the time point of endosperm rupture (p&lt;0.05, Wilcoxon test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), while there were no significant expression differences between different time points for genes with single H3K9me2 and genes with both H3K27me3/H3K9me2. Increased gene expression in the endosperm during germination was not restricted to ethylene inducible genes marked by H3K27me3, but also detectable for all H3K27me3 marked genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This data reveal that genes with single H3K27me3 are initially suppressed during early endosperm development and become reactivated during germination, while genes with single H3K9me2 and genes with H3K27me3/H3K9me2 remain continuously suppressed throughout endosperm development and germination. This implies the presence of a molecular mechanism that allows to differentially regulate the expression of the three groups of epigenetically marked genes during germination.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genes marked by H3K27me3 become activated in the endosperm during germination.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Venn diagrams show overlaps between three groups of genes with different patterns of histone modifications and ethylene (ET)-inducible genes in seedlings.

We recently showed that genes with dual H3K27me3/H3K9me2 modifications are marked by CHGm in the endosperm and that CHGm is established in the central cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreno-Romero et al., 2019</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the presence of CHGm may prevent REF6 from targeting and activating those genes. To test this hypothesis, we identified genes with REF6 binding sites in their gene bodies and associated the presence of the REF6 motif, CHGm status, and expression during germination. We found that REF6 binding sites within genes that were marked either by single H3K9me2 or by H3K27me3/H3K9me2 were more frequently CHG methylated in the central cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) compared to single H3K27me3 marked genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Romero et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, genes marked by H3K27me3/H3K9me2 were frequently marked by CHGm at position five within the REF6-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Methylation at position five was found to be sufficient to abolish the affinity of REF6 for this target site, while methylation at position three was less effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the hypothesis that CHGm on REF6 binding sites prevents REF6 targeting and thus gene activation, we found that genes with non-methylated REF6 binding sites were significantly more frequently activated during germination than genes with methylated REF6 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Together, this data supports the idea that the methylation status of REF6-binding sites affects the reactivation of genes in the endosperm during germination. While H3K27me3 marked genes can be activated during germination, genes with H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHGm fail to be activated since REF6 (or homologous proteins) recruitment is blocked by DNA methylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gene activation during germination depends on CHG methylation (CHGm) on REF6 binding sites (REF6-BS).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Plot shows the percentage of REF6-BS with CHGm in the three groups of genes with different combinations of histone modifications.

There are two REF6 orthologs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6), and JUMONJI 13 (JMJ13). The DNA-binding domains of REF6 and ELF6 share amino acids that are required for binding to REF6-sequence motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>) contrasting with lack of conservation of those sites in JMJ13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We tested two independent mutant alleles of <italic>ref6</italic> and <italic>elf6</italic> that all showed late germination phenotypes, but the <italic>ref6</italic> mutants were more strongly delayed than <italic>elf6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Genes with single H3K27me3 and unmethylated REF6-binding sites were significantly enriched among downregulated but not upregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>), supporting the model that REF6 activates genes with single H3K27me3 through the unmethylated REF6-binding sites. Furthermore, there was no significant enrichment of genes with single H3K9me2 among deregulated genes in <italic>ref6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, while genes with double H3K27me3/H3K9me2 and CHG methylated REF6-binding sites were not significantly enriched among deregulated genes, genes with double H3K27me3/H3K9me2 and unmethylated REF6-binding sites were slightly enriched among downregulated genes, although the enrichment was not significant (p=0.0568, pairwise Fisher’s exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 59 genes with single H3K27me3 and REF6-binding sites that were downregulated in <italic>ref6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) were significantly enriched for germination- and ethylene-inducible genes, but not for gibberellin-inducible genes according to previous transcriptome analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). These findings are consistent with the idea that REF6 promotes germination by activating germination-inducible genes acting in the ethylene pathway. Among the candidate REF6 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) was <italic>ETHYLENE RESPONSE DNA BINDING FACTOR 4</italic> (<italic>EDF4</italic>) that was previously reported to mediate ethylene responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed significant suppression of <italic>EDF4</italic> in the <italic>ref6</italic> mutant endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>), supporting the proposed endosperm-specific function of REF6 during germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). We furthermore found three genes encoding for ethylene biosynthesis enzymes converting the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) to biologically active ethylene (ACC oxidases, ACOs) significantly downregulated in <italic>ref6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). <italic>ACO</italic> genes were not marked by H3K27me3 in the 4 days after pollination (DAP) endosperm, suggesting that REF6 activates these genes at an earlier timepoint. REF6 was shown to target the ABA catabolism genes <italic>CYP707A1</italic> and <italic>CYP707A3</italic>, but not <italic>CYP707A2</italic> during seed development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).

Like for <italic>ACO</italic> genes, we did not detect H3K27me3 on all three genes in 4 DAP endosperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Romero et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that REF6 acts on these genes before this timepoint. To further test the contribution of the ethylene and ABA pathways to the delayed germination phenotypes in <italic>ref6</italic> mutants, we analyzed germination of <italic>ref6</italic> in the presence of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone, which both were reported to induce seed germination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Linkies et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martinez-Andujar et al., 2011</xref>). Treatment with only ACC or fluridone partially suppressed the <italic>ref6</italic> delayed germination phenotype, but the germination ratios were significantly lower than non-treated wild type after stratification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). In contrast, treatment of <italic>cyp707a2</italic> mutants with fluridone resulted in comparable germination frequencies as for wild-type seeds without treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that induction of the ABA pathway can be effectively suppressed by fluridone, in line with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martinez-Andujar et al., 2011</xref>). The failure of fluridone to suppress the <italic>ref6</italic> mutant phenotype is also consistent with previous findings showing that a mutation in the ABA biosynthesis gene <italic>ABA2</italic> does not completely rescue the delayed germination phenotype of <italic>ref6-1</italic> after stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>).

Using previously published parental-specific transcriptome data of the endosperm during germination (F1 seeds of maternal Col and paternal Cvi accessions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piskurewicz et al., 2016</xref>), we found that genes with triple repressive marks H3K27me3/H3K9m2/CHGm on REF6-binding sites were significantly paternally biased compared to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> all genes in both dormant and non-dormant seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>, upper blue boxes), consistent with our data showing the relationship between triple repressive marks and expression during germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

The maternally biased expression pattern of genes with single H3K27me3 in dormant seeds are turned into biallelic expression in non-dormant seeds. The FIS-PRC2 and/or H3K27me3 can recruit H3K9me2 and CHG methylation (CHGm) to dormancy-related genes.

Using the same published parental-specific transcriptome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piskurewicz et al., 2016</xref>), we found that genes with single H3K27me3 that were downregulated in <italic>ref6</italic> were significantly maternally biased in both dormant and non-dormant seeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>, orange boxes).

Together, this data suggests that REF6 and SUVH4/5/6 regulate genomic imprinting during germination.</p><p>The maternally biased expression of genes with single H3K27me3 suggests suppression of the paternal alleles by an epigenetic mechanism. Maternally biased gene expression during germination was previously reported to be mediated by the non-canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway targeting the paternal alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwasaki et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore analyzed DNA methylation levels in genic as well as 2 kb up- and downstream regions on the paternal alleles of genes with single H3K27me3 on the maternal alleles using previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ibarra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Romero et al., 2016</xref>). We found that paternal CHHm levels in downstream regions of genes with maternal H3K27me3 and in gene bodies of genes with maternal H3K27me3 and unmethylated REF6-binding sites were significantly higher compared to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> all genes in 7–8DAP endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). CHGm levels in downstream regions were significantly higher in 4DAP endosperm, but this trend was not detected at 7–8DAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Levels of CG methylation (CGm) were marginally increased in gene bodies of genes with maternal H3K27me3 and unmethylated REF6-binding sites in 4DAP and 7–8DAP endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4</xref>). This data suggests that CHHm of genes with maternal H3K27me3 and unmethylated REF6-binding sites can be one possible factor to establish maternally biased expression of genes with single H3K27me3 in dormant seeds. However, detailed parental-specific DNA methylome data in dormant and non-dormant seeds are necessary to validate this conclusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we uncovered the molecular function and physiological role of the endosperm-specific triple modification of the maternal genome with H3K27me3/H3K9me2 and CHGm. We found that genes marked by only H3K27me3 became reactivated during seed germination, a process that depends on the H3K27me3 demethylase REF6. In contrast, genes marked by triple repressive modifications remained silenced during germination because REF6 binding is repelled by H3K9me2/CHGm, consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). Supporting the functional requirement of REF6 to initiate germination, loss of <italic>REF6</italic> caused higher seed dormancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), connected with decreased expression of many germination-inducible genes. Loss of <italic>SUVH4/5/6</italic> also increased dormancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>), which was associated with increased expression of potential REF6 target genes. Since H3K9me2 acts in a feedback loop with CHGm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Du et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jackson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindroth et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malagnac et al., 2002</xref>), loss of <italic>SUVH4/5/6</italic> is expected to expose unmethylated binding sites for REF6 that can then be activated by REF6. Consistent with this model, loss of <italic>CMT3</italic> also caused increased dormancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, among those upregulated SUVH4/5/6 targets was the positive regulator of seed dormancy <italic>ABI3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), providing a possible explanation for the increased dormancy in <italic>suvh4/5/6</italic>. Consistent with this notion we found that downregulated genes with single H3K27me3 were enriched for ABI3 binding motifs. Nevertheless, the small fraction of germination-inducible genes with triple repressive marks suggests possible additional mechanisms removing triple epigenetic marks.</p><p>Our work furthermore revealed the connection between maternal-specific repressive marks, gene imprinting, and seed dormancy. Imprinted genes were previously shown to play a role in regulating seed germination and were connected to the maternal inheritance of seed dormancy levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwasaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piskurewicz et al., 2016</xref>). The non-canonical RdDM pathway was found to target and silence the paternal alleles of the dormancy-related gene <italic>ALN1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwasaki et al., 2019</xref>). Our data suggests that in addition to RdDM, maternally biased expression of dormancy-related genes also requires REF6, which activates maternal H3K27me3 marked genes. We propose that both mechanisms together ensure the maternal control of seed dormancy; while REF6 regulates the time of activation of certain genes, RdDM-mediated CHHm on the paternal alleles prevents their activation. Interestingly, the timing of REF6 action probably differs for distinct genes. While some genes, like <italic>ALN1, CYP707A1,</italic> and <italic>CYP707A3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) are likely activated in the central cell of the female gametophyte and therefore lack detactable H3K27me3 in the endosperm, other genes are activated during endoperm development. To the latter category belongs the previously reported gene <italic>CP1</italic>, which is maternally biased in dormant seeds and biallelically expressed in non-dormant seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piskurewicz et al., 2016</xref>) and marked with single H3K27me3 on the maternal alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Romero et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to genes with single H3K27me3, genes with triple repressive marks on maternal alleles are not targeted by REF6, causing the maternal alleles to be silenced and the paternal alleles to be active. Genes with triple repressive marks on REF6-binding sites were upregulated <italic>in suvh4/5/6</italic> and were paternally biased during germination. Although more detailed parental-specific DNA methylome analyses in germinating endosperm are required to precisely determine the molecular mechanism repressing the paternal alleles of genes with maternal H3K27me3 during germination, this data supports the model that the presence of single H3K27me3 and triple repressive marks determines whether genes are maternally or paternally biased during germination, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>SUVH4/5/6</italic> genes are not imprinted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsieh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreno-Romero et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pignatta et al., 2014</xref>); however, the delay of germination in <italic>suvh4/5/6</italic> was under maternal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). This indicates that maternal-specific triple repressive marks are established before fertilization in the central cell and maintained after fertilization, consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreno-Romero et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that maternal-specific triple epigenetic marks of H3K27me3/H3K9me2 and CHGm contribute to maternally controlled seed dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Iwasaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piskurewicz et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, also <italic>REF6</italic> is not imprinted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsieh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pignatta et al., 2014</xref>), but <italic>ref6</italic> had a maternal effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), supporting the notion that derepression of some dormancy-controlling genes starts in the central cell of the female gametophyte. Nevertheless, the fact that some REF6 targets have detectable levels of H3K27me3 in the endosperm and since we could partially complement the <italic>ref6</italic> mutant by expressing <italic>REF6</italic> in the micropylar domain of the endosperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), strongly suggests that REF6 also acts after fertilization. In support of this view, homozygous <italic>ref6</italic> mutants had a stronger delay in germination than maternal <italic>ref6</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p><p>Our data furthermore uncovered a relationship among REF6, ethylene, and ABA. Consistent with previous work showing that loss of <italic>ABA2</italic> does not completely suppress the delayed germination of <italic>ref6</italic> after stratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), we found that the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone was not sufficient to suppress delayed germination phenotypes of <italic>ref6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, the ethylene precursor ACC caused only a partial suppression of the germination delay. However, the combined treatment with fluridone and ACC completely suppressed the <italic>ref6</italic> germination phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), supporting our and previous data revealing that REF6 is required to activate ABA catabolism and ethylene signaling through removal of H3K27me3. Since the activation of the ABA catabolism genes <italic>CYP707A1</italic> and <italic>CYC707A3</italic> likely occurs in the central cell while activation of ethylene signaling genes occurs during endosperm development, we propose that there is a two-step maternal control of germination by REF6. The first step occurs in the central cell and leads to the suppression of ABA signaling, while the second step occurs in the endosperm and leads to the activation of ethylene signaling. This two-step control of germination may ensure the best timing of germination. Understanding by which mechanism the timing of REF6 action is regulated will be subject of future investigations.</p><p>Previous data showed that loss of FIS-PRC2 function causes upregulation of genes with both H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hsieh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moreno-Romero et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that establishment of H3K9me2 depends on H3K27me3. This idea was substantiated by data showing that deficiency of FIS-PRC2 in the central cell causes depletion of CHGm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moreno-Romero et al., 2019</xref>), pointing that H3K9me2/CHGm depend on FIS-PRC2. Also data shown in this study are consistent with this scenario; we demonstrate that loss of H3K9me2/CHGm only caused an effect if H3K27me3 was removed by REF6, revealing that H3K27me3 is the primary repressive mark. Additionally, we found that maternal loss of <italic>SUVH4/5/6</italic> was sufficient to cause delayed gemination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), while that of <italic>CMT3</italic> was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). One possible explanation is that the effects caused by loss of SUVH4/5/6 and CMT3 function differ. While H3K9me2 and CHGm are severely depleted in <italic>suvh4/5/6</italic>; loss of <italic>CMT3</italic> mainly affects CHGm with only intermediate effects on H3K9me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Underwood et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, genes with H3K27me3/H3K9me2 can likely be suppressed by CMT3 after fertilization.</p><p>A possible mechanism is that the FIS2-PRC2 complex or H3K27me3 recruits SUVH4/5/6 and that H3K9me2 recruits CMT3, suggesting the presence of a molecular mechanism that distinguishes target genes to be marked by single H3K27me3 or triple marks of H3K27me3/H3K9me2 and CHGm. To identify this distinguishing mechanism remains an important future endeavor.</p><p>Our data bear striking similarities to maternal H3K27me3-dependent non-canonical imprinting reported in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanna et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inoue et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inoue et al., 2017b</xref>). In non-canonical imprinting, maternal-specific H3K27me3 inherited from oocytes serves as the primary epigenetic mark for imprinted paternal-specific expression. Most of this non-canonical imprinting is transient and restricted to preimplantation embryos, with only some genes important for placental development remain imprinted in extraembryonic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inoue et al., 2017a</xref>). Maintenance of non-canonical imprinting is mediated by DNA methylation, which is specifically applied on the maternal alleles of previously H3K27me3 marked regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanna et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, similar to the findings reported in this study, genes regulated by non-canonical imprinting in mammals are transiently imprinted by inheriting maternal-specific H3K27me3 and only few genes remain imprinting by establishing DNA methylation as secondary imprint. Genomic imprinting has independently evolved in flowering plants and mammals; however, rather remarkably, similar molecular mechanisms have been coopted to regulate imprinted genes in the accessory, nutrient-transferring tissues.</p><p>The combined presence of H3K27me3 with the heterochromatic modification H3K9me3 was also reported to occur on TEs and repeat-rich regions in the protozoa <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> and <italic>Paramecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Frapporti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>) and the fungus <italic>Podospora anserine</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlier et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>P. anserine</italic>, the presence of double repressive modifications is restricted to TEs and repeat-rich regions, while H3K27me3 alone is located in genic regions, indicating a similar molecular distinction of constitutively silenced regions marked by double modifications from regions that require activation during specific developmental stages marked by H3K27me3 alone. It is tempting to speculate that the co-occurrence of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 may prevent H3K27me3 demethylases to target and activate those regions, similar to the findings reported in this study.</p><p>In summary, in this study, we uncovered a new molecular mechanism leading to maternal-specific dormancy control that distinguishes genes marked by either H3K27me3 alone from genes marked by the generally antagonistic repressive epigenetic modifications, H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHGm. We uncovered how the H3K27me3 demethylase REF6 controls release of dormancy and revealed the underlying mechanism for the H3K9me2 methylases SUVH4/5/6 in controlling dormancy and propose that these regulators form a regulatory network through ABA and ethylene pathways. Our data provide new insights into how maternal-specific epigenetic modifications control dormancy and thus ensure timely germination.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant material and growing conditions</title><p>All mutants used in this study are in the Col background.

Experiments were done in biological replicates, as indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA preparation and qRT-PCR</title><p>For gene expression analysis, embryos and endosperm were manually dissected from seeds that were imbibed for 24 hr as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Endo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piskurewicz et al., 2016</xref>). Total RNA from embryos and endosperm was extracted using MagMAX Plant RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the supplier’s instructions for RNA extraction from plant seeds. For quantitative RT-PCR, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using the Thermo Scientific RevertAid First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit according to the supplier’s instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed using a BIO RAD CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System. HOT FIREPol EvaGreen qPCR Mix Plus (ROX) (Solis BioDyne) was used for the reactions. The primers used for quantitative RT-PCR are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Libraries were sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq platforms as paired-end through Novogene mRNA sequencing services. For each replicate, the 150 bp long reads were trimmed by removing the 20 bp from the 5’ end and 30 bp from the 3’ and mapped in single-end mode to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (TAIR10) genome, masked for rRNA genes, using TopHat v2.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Trapnell et al., 2009</xref>) (parameters adjusted as -g 1 -a 10 -i 40 -I 5000 F 0 r 130).

For the analyses of methylated sites on REF6-binding sites, methylated CHG sites were defined as those containing one or more methylated cytosines among at least five reads in both replicates. For the analyses of parental-specific methylation, numbers of methylated and unmethylated cytosines of two replicates were pooled and methylated sites were defined as those containing one or more methylated cytosines among at least five reads.

This paper will be of interest to scientists working on epigenetics, seed development and germination. Most of the claims are supported by data and the authors have generated many genomic datasets and knowledge that could be useful for the study of seed dormancy in other plant species. The authors show that the REF6/H3K27me3 suvh456/H3K9me2 interaction is important for gene regulation in the endosperm during germination. The authors also investigate the role of REF6 in germination responses in seeds. This aspect of the study is intriguing, but less strongly supported and is in apparent disagreement with recently published conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers and editors felt that the most important revisions concern the narrative that REF6 and SUVH4-6 control dormancy via ethylene responses. The mechanism by which REF6 regulates dormancy is an essential component of the manuscript. However, the presented mechanism is not convincingly supported by the supplied data and differs from the conclusions of a recently published paper (Chen et al., Plant Physiology 2020), which implicates ABA catabolism during seed development. The authors should establish the relationship between REF6, ethylene and ABA signalling, and ideally reconcile their findings with those of Chen et al., 2020.</p><p>2. Related to the above point, seed dormancy should be assessed in the absence of dormancy-breaking stimuli, especially nitrate in the MS medium. Sowing freshly harvested seed on minimal media would result in higher quality data and be the normal approach in the field, showing that seed lots indeed show dormancy (germination &lt;50% is better). Then the authors would clearly be able to show that dormancy rather than germination is affected.</p><p>3. The authors are not always clear on the mutant allele used in different experiments. A major caveat is that the ref6-1 and ref6-3 mutants used in germination experiments (Figure 3, Figure 3¬—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3-—figure supplement 3) and most of the molecular analyses are not a full knockout (null) mutants (Yan et al., 2019 and Antunez et al., 2020). The use of partial-loss-of-function REF6 alleles could be problematic, in particular for germination assays with seeds from reciprocal crosses. To address this issue, authors should use a loss-of-function mutant line ref6C, which they have used to generate the triple elf6-3 ref6C jmj13G mutant.</p><p>Similarly, the interpretations arising from the endosperm transcriptome analysis with ref6-1 mutant plants should be carefully considered in their conclusions.</p><p>4. The interpretation that suvh4/5/6 cause a maternal effect in germination due to the activity of these histone methylases in the central cell is not fully supported. Genetic analyses would be required to distinguish sporophytic and gametophytic effects of these mutants on seed germination. Similarly, the parent-of-origin effects on germination arising in the cmt3 mutant are far from clear. The role of suvh4/5/6 and cmt3 in parent-of-origin effects on germination should be critically assessed and described in the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>5. The expression of REF6 in the micropylar endosperm and embryo using EPR1::REF6 and TPS1::REF6 should be confirmed experimentally (eg. RT-PCR with dissected tissues).</p><p>6. The strong claims about the effects of CHGm on REF6 should be moderated. The model communicated by the authors involves a binary distinction between genes that only have H3K27me3 (accessible to REF6) and genes that also have H3K9me2 and CHGm (inaccessible to REF6). However, the data do not support such a strong conclusion. For example, Figure 2c shows significant but modest differences between control genes (about 90% are not upregulated) and genes with REF6 target domains that lack CHGm (about 80% not upregulated). Furthermore, because CHGm is not absolute and rarely reaches 50%, the effects of CHGm on REF6 recruitment in endosperm are likely to be quantitative rather than qualitative. These limitations should be clearly explained.</p><p>7. Statistical approaches are not always deployed appropriately. Throughout the manuscript, statistical comparisons are performed between multiple test groups and a single control group. This is appropriate when differences with the control group are key, but not appropriate when differences between the test groups are of primary interest. In such cases, the authors should use ANOVA or a similar approach that can simultaneously evaluate multiple groups.</p><p>An example of this issue is in Figure 2c. The lower four bars indicate that genes without CHGm are significantly upregulated, but not genes with CHGm. However, there are many fewer CHGm genes. The key issue is whether genes with and without CHGm behave differently from each other. A similar example is in Figure 5b. Genes with and without CHGm are likely not different from each other, but genes with CHGm do not reach significance in comparison to the control group because they are fewer (116) than genes without CHGm (488). Figure 8a also suffers from this problem. The top three blue boxes are marked as significant, and the following three grey boxes are not, but the blue and grey boxes are probably not significantly different from each other. The authors should carefully reassess the statistical comparisons and adjust their conclusions accordingly.</p><p>8. The regulation of genomic imprinting during germination by REF6 and SUVH4/5/6 is supported by a small number of genes (Figure 8). Similarly, the silencing of paternal alleles of maternally-expressed genes is linked to a very small level of CHH methylation on genes. The authors should acknowledge that regulation of genomic imprinting during germination by REF6 and SUVH4/5/6 is not fully demonstrated by the data shown, and the authors should moderate their claims accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The study by Sato et al. examines the role of chromatin remodelling in the endosperm during dormancy and germination control. The challenge with any study if this kind is that individual epigenetic processes are very general, required at multiple stages for the regulation of seed development, germination and associated metabolism. When a phenotype is observed in mutants lacking a chromatin remodelling process this may be a product of multiple effects, or specific effects on a limited number of loci at one developmental stage. In this study the authors show that the REF6/H3K27me3 suvh456/H3K9me2 interaction is important for gene regulation in the endosperm during germination. I find this interesting and the authors understandably would like to expand this to show that functionally REF6 is required for germination responses in seeds. In my view this aspect of the study is less successful, perhaps reflecting the fact that the authors are world leaders in the field of plant epigenetics but less experienced in the study of seed physiology.</p><p>1. Lets start with reviewing what I believe is shown to the highest degree of confidence. In my view the data strongly support the conclusion that the ref6 mutants have germination phenotype which is conferred through endosperm-specific REF6 activity. Although the phenotypes are very weak, the authors take care to generate consistent data across experiments. Cmt3 and suvh456 mutants seem to have a maternal effect on dormancy consistent with previous studies of the maternal roles of these genes in the endosperm. The interaction between H3K27me3, H3K9me2, REF6 and CHG methylation is clearly described on the context of chromatin remodelling during germination, and I agree looks similar in seeds to that shown in a recent study (Qi et al., 2019). It seems clear that REF6-mediated epigenetic remodelling plays a role in the induction of ethylene responsive genes but also for genes in cell wall remodelling, lipid metabolism and other processes known to occur in the endosperm during germination, perhaps in response to ethylene. I would contrast the function of REF6 with that of PICKLE (Ogas et al., 1998) which is required for silencing of the seed expressed genes upon the transition to vegetative growth.</p><p>2. There is one experimental issue that make some of the data hard to interpret. The authors would ideally take more care to distinguish clearly between dormancy and germination of non-dormant seeds. Firstly, the dormancy assays are confounded by the fact that a nitrate source was added to the germination medium, a strong dormancy-breaking signal. As such all seed lots behave as if non-dormant in all the experiments, although a difference in germination speed between mutant and wt is recorded. It is not clear from the data provided whether without nitrate the seeds would actually show dormancy, but my feeling is that they would, but only then can it be studied. Certainly, where seeds lots germinate 100% after a few days of imbibition the field would not ascribe any dormancy to them, and would not usually use such experiments to make judgements about dormancy or use the word dormancy to describe the phenotypes. However, the authors rightly intuit that differences in germination speed can result from residual activity of dormancy-inducing pathways even if they have insufficient activity to completely prevent germination (Bassel and Finch-Savage, 2016). Evidence that this is happening is that germination speed is further increased by cold stratification, another dormancy-breaking signal. However, sowing freshly harvested seed on minimal media would result in higher quality data and be the normal approach in the field, showing that seed lots indeed show dormancy (germination &lt;50% is better). Then the authors would clearly be able to show that dormancy rather than germination is affected.</p><p>3. The main implied narrative in the abstract that these marks cooperate to regulate dormancy loss through reactivation of maternal copies of ethylene response genes is only partly supported by the data in my view. There is no evidence presented to show that only maternal copies are activated, or describing how imprinting affects the activation rate. So the wider significance was less clear, in contrast to Piskurewicz 2016 who showed that dormancy status affected the degree of imprinting, and that imprinting of these genes affected the rate of protein catabolism or dormancy loss.</p><p>4. In my view more supporting evidence is required to show that REF6 directly affects endosperm responses to ethylene. I would inhibit germination with paclobutrazol to remove secondary effects and apply ethylene or a precursor, comparing the transcriptional response of wt and ref6 seeds.</p><p>5. If REF6 does affect the ethylene response, more evidence is required to show that this is linked to dormancy loss rather than germination promotion. The latter will occur in both dormant and non dormant seeds, and the seeds examined here are either non-dormant or have unknown dormancy because of the problems mentioned previously. The data in figure 1 only show an increase in the expression of H3K27me3-marked ethylene-inducible genes after testa rupture, ie after the germination process has already begun. This also suggests that the process is linked to the mechanics of germination rather than dormancy. This ought to be manifest in germination speed phenotypes even in non-dormant seeds, eg in a ref6 aba2 double mutant. Conversely, if REF6 is involved in dormancy loss maybe there is no dormancy phenotype until a dormancy-breaking signal is applied.</p><p>6. Timing of REF6 activity. Primary dormancy is established during seed development and seed maturation. Thus if seeds have different levels of primary dormancy, with some exceptions the cause is usually found in the processes that occur prior to desiccation. It is unclear when the EPR1:REF6 construct is expressed, whether it is also active prior to desiccation when it may affect the establishment of dormancy, rather than dormancy loss during germination. The unfortunate recent publication (Chen et al., 2020) which shows that REF6 affects ABA metabolism during seed maturation also seems to me to be a plausible mechanism for the ref6 dormancy phenotype. However, disagreement over the cause of the phenotype does not necessarily detract from the fact that REF6 is clearly affecting gene expression in the endosperm during germination, it just means that the significance of the process is less clear for the observed phenotype.</p><p>7. Also influencing my conclusions is the observation that the suvh456 effect is not limited to the endosperm but also observable in the embryo, where ABI3 is also higher expressed than wt (Figure 7d). This suggests that suvh456 mutant seeds have higher ABA levels or some global effect on dormancy that affects the whole seed and is capable of up-regulating ABI3 expression. I found the authors' discussion of ABI3 hard to follow. It is surprising that ABI3 reaches maximal expression in the mature seed, but is marked with the repressive H3K27me3. If I understand correctly the authors suggest that in suvh456 ABI3 is further activated by REF6. Again this is surprising because their seeds are germinating and during germination ABI3 expression falls rapidly (if the seeds were dormant then this would be more plausible). So it is possible that ABI3 regulation is several steps removed from the activity of the epigenetic process, or that REF6 acts on ABI3 earlier in seed development. Recent paper Chen et al., 2020 seems to shed some light on this, showing that ref6 seeds have higher ABA content. This would lead to an increase in dormancy and higher ABI3 expression, even in the embryo, because endospermic ABA is transported to the embryo to maintain dormancy (Kang et al., 2015).</p><p>So in conclusion I think the authors have discovered an interesting process which could well be very important for gene regulation during germination in the endosperm, but have not convinced me that the observed phenotype is due to disruption of this process. However, there may be other consequences that are observable if endosperm responses to ethylene are investigated in more detail, rather than focussing on the effect on primary dormancy. Alternatively, if the authors wish to explain the germination phenotype it may be worth expanding the study to events during the establishment of primary dormancy, taking into account the recent published observations of Chen et al., 2020.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Combinations of maternal-specific repressive epigenetic marks in the endosperm control seed dormancy&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn (Senior Editor), Daniel Zilberman (Reviewing Editor) and the original reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved and the reviewers and editors are generally satisfied that the revisions address the majors points raised after initial review. A single important remaining issue remains, as explained in the three related major points below. Please consider these points and address them in the manuscript as appropriate.</p><p>1. Although they germinate slower than wild type, ref6 mutant response to ACC is similar to wt in terms of the type of germination increase promoted. Certainly ref6 does not appear to have low sensitivity to ACC. Therefore the authors' data suggest that ethylene responses are normal in ref6 mutants. The authors conclude that because ref6 germination deficiency is reversed by ACC (with fluridone), ref6 must be acting through ethylene signalling. How the authors reached this conclusion is not clear.</p><p>2. The authors may not be correctly interpretating the aba2 rescue of ref6 in Chen 2020. Chen 2020 show that aba2 more-or-less fully rescues the ref6 phenotype, and indeed any other finding would be very surprising. There are small differences but these are well within normal biological variation. The issue with the fluridone experiment is that fluridone inhibits ABA synthesis in imbibed seeds, and cyp707a2 is important for ABA catabolism in imbibed seeds. But according to Chen et al. REF6 mainly affects CYP707A1 and A3, which are active primarily during seed maturation, and therefore affect germination through the amount of ABA left over in mature seeds (Okamoto et al., 2006). In that context the failure of fluridone to completely suppress the ref6 phenotype, if caused by up-regulation of CYP707A1/3, is unsurprising.</p><p>3. New genetic data is presented that shows that the activity of REF6 in the central cell is sufficient to lead to most of the phenotypic effects. The H3K27me3 data used for figure 1 is from developing endosperm, after REF6 could have acted in the gametophyte. But the authors argue that REF6 is affecting de-methylation during dormancy loss or germination, or at least after the stage tissue was collected for the 2016 paper. So is the activity of REF6 described in the rest of the paper the weak phenotype attributed to the paternal effect? Could the differences (which are small) be simply due to gene dosage effects in the endosperm, if REF6 is a rate limiting factor, even if REF6 is not imprinted? If dormancy is determined by central cell REF6 activity, then it can't relate to the effects on imprinted gene expression during germination.</p><p>If the above is true, the statement in the manuscript title is mis-leading, because dormancy is determined by central cell ref6 function – the events during germination are clearly affected by REF6, but lack an obvious phenotypic outcome (in Col-0 at least). This is also pertinent to the normal ACC response in ref6 mutants. A clear statement on this issue is hence necessary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64593.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

First, to test the contribution of the ethylene and ABA pathways to the delayed germination phenotypes in <italic>ref6</italic>, we analyzed germination of <italic>ref6</italic> upon treatment with the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1carboxylic acid (ACC), and the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone, which were reported to induce seed germination (Linkies et al., 2009; Martinez-Andujar et al., 2011). Treatment with only ACC or fluridone failed to completely suppress the delayed germination of <italic>ref6</italic> (Figure 5—figure supplement 4), consistent with previous data showing that loss of the ABA biosynthetic gene <italic>ABA2</italic> does not completely rescue the delayed germination phenotype of <italic>ref6</italic> after stratification (Chen et al., 2020). In contrast, fluridone could completely suppress the <italic>cyp707a2</italic> germination phenotype (Figure 5—figure supplement 4), revealing that fluridone can effectively suppress ABA biosynthesis as previously shown (Martinez-Andujar et al., 2011). Supporting our transcriptome data showing that ethylene pathways were suppressed in <italic>ref6</italic> (Figure 5c), we found that treatment with both, ACC and fluridone, could completely rescue the delayed germination phenotype of <italic>ref6</italic> after stratification(Figure 5— figure supplement 4). We thus conclude that suppression of the ethylene pathway together with the previously revealed induction of the ABA pathway (Chen et al., 2020) account for the delay of germination in <italic>ref6</italic>. We included and discussed this new data on P11, L243 to L261.</p><p>Second, we have further investigated the contribution of SUVH4/5/6 in regulating germination. As shown in our previous version of the manuscript, the <italic>ABI3</italic> gene has triple repressive marks on the maternal alleles and was upregulated in <italic>suvh456</italic> endosperm during germination (Figure 7). We furthermore found that genes with single H3K27me3 tend to be suppressed in <italic>suvh456</italic> endosperm probably through indirect effects (Figure 7—figure supplement 2). In the revised manuscript we include data showing that B3 type transcription factors-binding motifs (RY motifs) are enriched among the downregulated genes with single H3K27me3 in <italic>suvh456</italic> (Figure 7—figure supplement 5). This data suggests that upregulated ABI3 in <italic>suvh456</italic> suppresses genes with single H3K27me3. Supporting this idea, we found that genes with single H3K27me3 are significantly enriched among direct ABI3 target genes (Tian et al., 2020), while genes with single H3K9me2 and double H3K27me3/H3K9me2 are not enriched (Figure 7—figure supplement 5). Together, this data reveals a complex network between ABA and ethylene pathways in the endosperm that are both epigenetically and transcriptionally regulated by multiple factors. We have included this new data on P14, L332 to L338 and discussed on P17, L417 to L418, P18, L431 to L437, P19, L461 to L476 and P21, L525 to L526.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This raises the possibility that the Zinc-finger domain-independent functions of REF6 still remain active in <italic>ref6-1</italic> or <italic>ref6-3</italic>.

The results show that the phenotypes of the mutant alleles are highly comparable, justifying the use of the <italic>ref6-1</italic> and <italic>ref6-3</italic> alleles for this study.</p><p>2. We investigated the possibility that REF6 is recruited to MADS-box motifs by analyzing whether predicted REF6 targets have REF6 binding sites. As shown in the manuscript, the presence of REF6binding sites is associated with the activation of genes with single H3K27me3 and double H3K27me3/H3K9me2 (Figure 2c). Consistently, REF6-binding sites are significantly enriched within gene bodies of upregulated genes with single H3K27me3 and double H3K27me3/H3K9me2 (additional figure 1c, left panel), while MADS-box binding sites on promoter regions are not enriched among the upregulated genes (additional figure 1c, right panel). Furthermore, we found that there were substantially fewer MADS-box binding sites (around 10%) than REF6-binding sites (40-60%) among upregulated genes. This data suggests that the possible recruitment of REF6 by MADS-box transcription factors in <italic>ref6-1</italic> and <italic>ref6-3</italic> is unlikely to have a large contribution to total gene activation. This data are in support with our observations that the <italic>ref6-1/ref6-3</italic> alleles behave very similar to the <italic>ref6c</italic> allele and justify their use in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The interpretation that suvh4/5/6 cause a maternal effect in germination due to the activity of these histone methylases in the central cell is not fully supported. Genetic analyses would be required to distinguish sporophytic and gametophytic effects of these mutants on seed germination. Similarly, the parent-of-origin effects on germination arising in the cmt3 mutant are far from clear. The role of suvh4/5/6 and cmt3 in parent-of-origin effects on germination should be critically assessed and described in the manuscript accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we analyzed the gametophytic effect of <italic>suvh456</italic> on germination using F1 seeds generated by pollinating heterozygous <italic>suvh456</italic> mutants with wild-type pollen. The results support the conclusion that <italic>suvh456</italic> caused delayed germination through gametophytic effects (Figure 6b).

The results support the conclusion that the maternal effect of <italic>ref6</italic> is caused by a gametophytic effect (Figure 3c). We described this new data on P8, L183 to P9, L191.</p><p>The <italic>cmt3-11</italic> mutant did not have a maternal effect on germination (Figure 6d), indicating that CMT3 acts after fertilization on H3K9me2 marks established in the female gametophyte. One possible explanation for the difference between <italic>suvh456</italic> and <italic>cmt3</italic> mutants is different effect on H3K9me2; while loss of <italic>SUVH4/5/6</italic> causes severe depletion of both, H3K9me2 and CHGm (Stroud et al., 2014; Underwood et al., 2018), loss of <italic>CMT3</italic> causes depletion of CHGm but has only intermediate effects on on H3K9me2 (Stroud et al., 2014; Inagaki et al., 2010). This suggests that genes with H3K27me3/H3K9me2 are suppressed by the paternal CMT3 after fertilization. We have discussed this data on P13, L298 to L301 and P20, L485 to L489.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The expression of REF6 in the micropylar endosperm and embryo using EPR1::REF6 and TPS1::REF6 should be confirmed experimentally (eg.

The strong claims about the effects of CHGm on REF6 should be moderated. The model communicated by the authors involves a binary distinction between genes that only have H3K27me3 (accessible to REF6) and genes that also have H3K9me2 and CHGm (inaccessible to REF6). However, the data do not support such a strong conclusion. For example, Figure 2c shows significant but modest differences between control genes (about 90% are not upregulated) and genes with REF6 target domains that lack CHGm (about 80% not upregulated). Furthermore, because CHGm is not absolute and rarely reaches 50%, the effects of CHGm on REF6 recruitment in endosperm are likely to be quantitative rather than qualitative. These limitations should be clearly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we moderated our claim about the relationship between CHGm directly on REF6 binding sites and REF6 accessibility. As the editor suggests about 10% of genes with H3K27me3/H3K9me2 and CHGm on REF6 binding sites are induced during germination, suggesting unknown mechanisms can remove the triple repressive marks or paternal alleles of some of those genes are activated during germination. It will be interesting to study whether and how the strong suppressing mechanism can be released. More detailed analyses of individual genes with triple repressive marks will be required to reveal the complete molecular mechanisms establishing and removing triple repressive marks. We have discussed these points on P17, L418 to L420.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Statistical approaches are not always deployed appropriately. Throughout the manuscript, statistical comparisons are performed between multiple test groups and a single control group. This is appropriate when differences with the control group are key, but not appropriate when differences between the test groups are of primary interest. In such cases, the authors should use ANOVA or a similar approach that can simultaneously evaluate multiple groups.</p><p>An example of this issue is in Figure 2c. The lower four bars indicate that genes without CHGm are significantly upregulated, but not genes with CHGm. However, there are many fewer CHGm genes. The key issue is whether genes with and without CHGm behave differently from each other. A similar example is in Figure 5b. Genes with and without CHGm are likely not different from each other, but genes with CHGm do not reach significance in comparison to the control group because they are fewer (116) than genes without CHGm (488). Figure 8a also suffers from this problem. The top three blue boxes are marked as significant, and the following three grey boxes are not, but the blue and grey boxes are probably not significantly different from each other. The authors should carefully reassess the statistical comparisons and adjust their conclusions accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we reanalyzed our data using pairwise statistical tests with multiple testing correction. The statistical methods are described in the legend of each figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The regulation of genomic imprinting during germination by REF6 and SUVH4/5/6 is supported by a small number of genes (Figure 8). Similarly, the silencing of paternal alleles of maternally-expressed genes is linked to a very small level of CHH methylation on genes. The authors should acknowledge that regulation of genomic imprinting during germination by REF6 and SUVH4/5/6 is not fully demonstrated by the data shown, and the authors should moderate their claims accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we moderated our claims and specifically noted that further studies are required to validate the conclusions. Modifications are on P16, L376 to L377, L395 to L397 and P18, L441 to L443.</p><p>We also reanalyzed the DNA methylation data using pairwise Wilcoxon test and included up-and downstream regions in the analyses (Figure 8—figure supplement 2, 3 and 4). Also for this analyses we toned down the conclusions and included the modifications on P16, L383 to L397.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Although they germinate slower than wild type, ref6 mutant response to ACC is similar to wt in terms of the type of germination increase promoted. Certainly ref6 does not appear to have low sensitivity to ACC. Therefore the authors' data suggest that ethylene responses are normal in ref6 mutants. The authors conclude that because ref6 germination deficiency is reversed by ACC (with fluridone), ref6 must be acting through ethylene signalling. How the authors reached this conclusion is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the <italic>ref6</italic> mutant can respond to ethylene; however, also ethylene biosynthesis is negatively affected in ref6 mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 3); thus by adding ACC, ethylene production likely increases and thus ethylene signalling. Furthermore, since ethylene biosynthesis and signalling are in a feedback loop and ethylene was shown to directly regulate its biosynthesis (doi.org/10.1111/nph.16873), it is well possible that by adding ACC and thus highly increasing ethylene levels, ethylene signalling is enhanced. Since the combined treatment of fluridone and ACC completely suppressed the <italic>ref6</italic> mutant phenotype, we consider our interpretation that REF6 acts (as well) through ethylene signalling justified. We discussed the requirement of REF6 to induce ethylene biosynthesis on P11, L239 to P11, L244.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors may not be correctly interpretating the aba2 rescue of ref6 in Chen 2020. Chen 2020 show that aba2 more-or-less fully rescues the ref6 phenotype, and indeed any other finding would be very surprising. There are small differences but these are well within normal biological variation. The issue with the fluridone experiment is that fluridone inhibits ABA synthesis in imbibed seeds, and cyp707a2 is important for ABA catabolism in imbibed seeds. But according to Chen et al. REF6 mainly affects CYP707A1 and A3, which are active primarily during seed maturation, and therefore affect germination through the amount of ABA left over in mature seeds (Okamoto et al., 2006). In that context the failure of fluridone to completely suppress the ref6 phenotype, if caused by up-regulation of CYP707A1/3, is unsurprising.</p></disp-quote><p>The data from Chen et al., 2000 show that the <italic>ref6 aba2</italic> double mutant has lower germination rates than the <italic>aba2</italic> single mutant after stratification (Figure 2C). While the difference has not been statistically evaluated, a germination difference of 50% versus 90% at 1.5 DAP seems to be highly significant. Since the data are generated in biological triplicates; we consider it unlikely that the difference is solely due to biological variation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. New genetic data is presented that shows that the activity of REF6 in the central cell is sufficient to lead to most of the phenotypic effects. The H3K27me3 data used for figure 1 is from developing endosperm, after REF6 could have acted in the gametophyte. But the authors argue that REF6 is affecting de-methylation during dormancy loss or germination, or at least after the stage tissue was collected for the 2016 paper. So is the activity of REF6 described in the rest of the paper the weak phenotype attributed to the paternal effect? Could the differences (which are small) be simply due to gene dosage effects in the endosperm, if REF6 is a rate limiting factor, even if REF6 is not imprinted? If dormancy is determined by central cell REF6 activity, then it can't relate to the effects on imprinted gene expression during germination.</p><p>If the above is true, the statement in the manuscript title is mis-leading, because dormancy is determined by central cell ref6 function – the events during germination are clearly affected by REF6, but lack an obvious phenotypic outcome (in Col-0 at least). This is also pertinent to the normal ACC response in ref6 mutants. A clear statement on this issue is hence necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>While <italic>ref6</italic> has a maternal effect, the fact that many REF6 targets have detectable levels of H3K27me3 in the endosperm and since we could partially complement the <italic>ref6</italic> mutant by expressing <italic>REF6</italic> in the micropylar domain of the endosperm (Figure 5a), strongly suggests that REF6 also acts after fertilization. In support of this, homozygous <italic>ref6</italic> mutants have a stronger delay in germination than mutants inheriting a maternal <italic>ref6</italic> and a wild-type paternal allele (Figure 3b). Nevertheless, independent of when REF6 acts; the consequence of REF6 activity occurs during germination. We had discussed the idea that there are two types of genes that are either activated in the central cell or later on in the endosperm in the manuscript lines 472 to 495. In summary, we do not think that our title is misleading, the combination of epigenetic modifications present in the endosperm (independent on when they are established) determines the activity status of the alleles during germination.</p></body></sub-article></article>
