Evolution, especially evolution in the distant past, is not easily accessible to laboratory experimentation. Modelling can provide a window into evolutionary processes by allowing the examination of selective pressures which lead to particular optimal solutions in the model. To study the evolution of C4 photosynthesis from a ground state of C3 photosynthesis, we initially construct a C3 model. After duplication into two cells to reflect typical C4 leaf architecture, we allow the model to predict the optimal metabolic solution under various conditions. The model thus identifies resource limitation in conjunction with high photorespiratory flux as a selective pressure relevant to the evolution of C4. It also predicts that light availability and distribution play a role in guiding the evolutionary choice of possible decarboxylation enzymes. The data shows evolutionary CBM in eukaryotes predicts molecular evolution with precision.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Virtually all plants use energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and sugars via a process called photosynthesis. This process has many steps that each rely on different enzymes to drive specific chemical reactions. Most plants use a pathway of enzymes that is referred to as C3 photosynthesis.</p><p>Plants absorb carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere. However, the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are very low, so this limits the amount of photosynthesis plants can perform. To overcome this problem, some plants have evolved a different type of photosynthesis – called C4 photosynthesis – with a mechanism that increases the levels of carbon dioxide in the cells.</p><p>Today, plants that use C4 photosynthesis (so-called ‘C4 plants’) typically grow faster than other plants, especially in warmer climates. This gives C4 plants, such as corn, an advantage over their competitors and also helps them to colonize harsh environments that other plants struggle to thrive in. However, it remains unclear how C4 photosynthesis evolved in some plants living in wet habitats, or why other plants use forms of photosynthesis that are intermediate between C4 and C3 photosynthesis.</p><p>C4 photosynthesis uses pathways containing enzymes that are found in all plants; therefore, C4 plants evolved by changing how they used enzymes they already had. To understand how these different enzyme pathways may have evolved, Blätke and Bräutigam used an approach known as constraint-based modelling. The researchers built a mathematical model of C3 photosynthesis and used it to predict the optimal enzyme pathways (for example, pathways involving the fewest enzymes or requiring the least energy) for photosynthesis under particular conditions.</p><p>The model predicted that, in addition to shortages in carbon dioxide, shortages in an important plant nutrient known as nitrogen may have driven the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Furthermore, enzyme pathways that were intermediate between C3 and C4 photosynthesis were predicted to be optimal solutions under particular conditions. Together, the findings of Blätke and Bräutigam may explain why different variations of C4 photosynthesis exist in plants. These findings could be used to breed crops that use the most efficient type of photosynthesis for the conditions they are grown in, leading to better yields.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolic networks</kwd><kwd>constraint-based model</kwd><kwd>C4 photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>model evolution</kwd><kwd>flux balance analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors declare that there was no funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Constraint-based modelling predicts C4 photosynthesis evolves under resource limitation from an ancestral ground state of C3 photosynthesis and attributes divergent metabolic routes in extant C4 subtypes to light.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Identifying specific evolutionary trajectories and modelling the outcome of adaptive strategies at the molecular levels is a major challenge in evolutionary systems biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Papp et al., 2011</xref>). The evolution of novel metabolic pathways from existing parts may be predicted using constraint-based modelling (CBM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orth et al., 2010</xref>). In CBM, selective pressures are coded via the objective functions for which the model is optimised. The factors which constrain evolution are integrated into the models via changes in model inputs or outputs and via flux constraints. We hypothesised that the evolution of the agriculturally important trait of C4 photosynthesis is accessible to CBM.</p><p>C4 photosynthesis evolved independently in at least 67 independent origins in the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheben et al., 2017</xref>) and it allows colonisation of marginal habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sage et al., 2012</xref>) and high biomass production in annuals such as crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edwards et al., 2010</xref>). The C4 cycle acts as a biochemical pump which enriches the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the site of Rubisco to overcome a major limitation of carbon fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sage, 2004</xref>). Enrichment is beneficial because Rubisco, the carbon fixation enzyme, can react productively with CO<sub>2</sub> and form two molecules of 3-PGA, but it also reacts with O<sub>2</sub> and produces 2-phosphoglycolate which requires detoxification by photorespiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ogren and Bowes, 1971</xref>). The ratio between both reactions is determined by the enzyme specificity towards CO<sub>2</sub>, by the temperature, and the concentrations of both reactants, which in turn is modulated by stresses such as drought and pathogen load. Evolution of Rubisco itself is constrained since any increase in specificity is paid for by a reduction in speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spreitzer and Salvucci, 2002</xref>). Lower speeds most likely cause maladaptivity since Rubisco is a comparatively slow enzyme and can comprise up to 50% of the total leaf protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellis, 1979</xref>). In the C4 cycle, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase affixes CO<sub>2</sub> to a C3 acid, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), forming a C4 acid, oxaloacetate (OAA). After stabilisation of the resulting C4 acid by reduction to malate or transamination to aspartate, it is transferred to the site of Rubisco and decarboxylated by one of three possible decarboxylation enzymes, NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD-dependent malic enzyme (NAD-ME), or PEP carboxykinase (PEP-CK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schlüter et al., 2016b</xref>). Species such as corn (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pick et al., 2011</xref>) and great millet (<italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Döring et al., 2016</xref>) use NADP-ME, species like common millet (<italic>Panicum miliaceum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatch, 1987</xref>) and African spinach (<italic>Gynandropsis gynandra</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feodorova et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Voznesenskaya et al., 2007</xref>) use NAD-ME and species such as guinea grass (<italic>Panicum maximum</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bräutigam et al., 2014</xref>) use mainly PEP-CK with the evolutionary constraints leading to one or the other enzyme unknown. Mixed forms are only known to occur between a malic enzyme and PEP-CK but not between both malic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). After decarboxylation, the C3 acid diffuses back to the site of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and is recycled for another C4 cycle by pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatch, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Schlüter et al., 2016b</xref>). All the enzymes involved in the C4 cycle are also present in C3 plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aubry et al., 2011</xref>). In its most typical form, this C4 cycle is distributed between different cell types in a leaf in an arrangement called Kranz anatomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haberlandt, 1904</xref>). Initial carbon fixation by PEPC occurs in the mesophyll cell, the outer layer of photosynthetic tissue. The secondary fixation by Rubisco after decarboxylation occurs in an inner layer of photosynthetic tissue, the bundle sheath which in turn surrounds the veins. Both cells are connected by plasmodesmata which are pores with limited transfer specificity between cells. A model which may test possible carbon fixation pathways at the molecular level thus requires two cell architectures connected by transport processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bräutigam and Weber, 2010</xref>).</p><p>CBM of genome-scale or close to it are well suited to study evolution (summarised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Papp et al., 2011</xref>). Evolution of different metabolic modes from a ground state, the metabolism of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, such as glycerol usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>) or endosymbiotic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pál et al., 2006</xref>) have been successfully predicted. Metabolic maps of eukaryotic metabolism are of higher complexity compared to bacteria since they require information about intracellular compartmentation and intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duarte, 2004</xref>) and may require multicellular approaches. In plants, aspects of complex metabolic pathways, such as the energetics of CAM photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>), and fluxes in C3 and C4 metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyle and Morgan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomes de Oliveira Dal’Molin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Oliveira Dal'Molin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Nikoloski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saha et al., 2011</xref>) have been elucidated with genome scale models. The C4 cycle is not predicted by these current C4 models unless the C4 cycle is forced by constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomes de Oliveira Dal’Molin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mallmann et al., 2014</xref>). In the C4GEM model, the fluxes representing the C4 cycle are a priori constrained to the cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gomes de Oliveira Dal’Molin et al., 2011</xref>), and in the Mallmann model, the C4 fluxes are induced by activating flux through PEPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mallmann et al., 2014</xref>). Models in which specific a priori constraints activated C4 were successfully used to study metabolism under conditions of photosynthesis, photorespiration, and respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saha et al., 2011</xref>) and to study N-assimilation under varying conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Simons et al., 2013</xref>). However, they are incapable of testing under which conditions the pathway may evolve.</p><p>Schematic models suggest that the C4 cycle evolves from its ancestral metabolic state C3 photosynthesis along a sequence of stages (summarised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräutigam and Gowik, 2016</xref>). In the presence of tight vein spacing and of photosynthetically active bundle sheath cells (i.e. Kranz anatomy), a key intermediate in which the process of photorespiration is divided between cell types is thought to evolve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sage et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heckmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauwe, 2010</xref>). The metabolic fluxes in this intermediate suggest an immediate path towards C4 photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mallmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräutigam and Gowik, 2016</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heckmann et al., 2013</xref>) built a kinetic model in which the complex C4 cycle was represented by a single enzyme, PEPC. Assuming carbon assimilation as a proxy for fitness, the model showed that the evolution from a C3 progenitor species with Kranz-type anatomy towards C4 photosynthesis occurs in modular, individually adaptive steps on a Mount Fuji fitness landscape. It is frequently assumed that evolution of C4 photosynthesis requires water limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräutigam and Gowik, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heckmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mallmann et al., 2014</xref>). However, ecophysiological research showed that C4 can likely evolve in wet habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osborne and Freckleton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundgren and Christin, 2017</xref>).

We test under which conditions and constraints C4 photosynthesis is predicted as the optimal solution. Finally, we test which constraints result in the prediction of the particular C4 modes with their different decarboxylation enzymes. In the process, we demonstrate that evolution is predictable at the molecular level in an eukaryotic system and define the selective pressures and limitations guiding the 'choice' of metabolic flux.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The curated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> core model predicts physiological results</title><p>Flux balance analysis requires five types of information, the metabolic map of the organism, the input, the output, a set of constraints (i.e. limitations on input, directionality of reactions, forced flux through reactions), and optimisation criteria for the algorithm which approximate the selective pressures the metabolism evolved under. In this context, inputs define the resources that need to be taken up by the metabolic network to fulfil a particular metabolic function, which is related to the outputs, for example the synthesis of metabolites part of the biomass or other specific products.

Light, sulphates, and phosphate are freely available. Due to the observation that nitrate is the main source (80%) of nitrogen in leaves in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macduff and Bakken, 2003</xref>), we set nitrate as the sole nitrogen source. If both ammonia and nitrate are allowed, the model will inevitably predict the physiologically incorrect sole use of ammonia since fewer reactions and less energy are required to convert it into glutamate, the universal amino group currency in plants. Water and oxygen can be freely exchanged with the environment in both directions.</p><p>To compute the output, we assume a mature fully differentiated and photosynthetically active leaf, which is optimised for the synthesis and export of sucrose and amino acids to the phloem under minimal metabolic effort. Following the examples of models in bacteria, many plant models use a biomass function which assumes that the leaf is required to build itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Oliveira Dal'Molin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Nikoloski, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saha et al., 2011</xref>) using photoautotrophic that is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold and Nikoloski, 2014</xref>) or heterotrophic that is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung et al., 2014</xref>) energy and molecule supply. In plants, however, leaves transition from a sink phase in which they build themselves from metabolites delivered by the phloem to a source phase in which they produce metabolites for other organs including sink leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Turgeon, 1989</xref>). The composition of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> phloem exudate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilkinson and Douglas, 2003</xref>) was used to constrain the relative proportions of the 18 amino acids and the ratio of sucrose : total amino acids (2.2 : 1). To account for daily carbon storage as starch for export during the night, we assume that half of the assimilated carbon is stored in the <italic>one-cell</italic> model. We explicitly account for maintenance costs by the use of a generic ATPase and use the measured ATP costs for protein degradation and synthesis of a mature <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>) as a constraint. We initially assume a low photorespiratory flux according to the ambient CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> partial pressures considering no heat, drought, salt or osmotic stress which may alter the ratio towards higher flux towards the oxygenation reaction.</p><p>To develop a largely unconstrained model and detect possible errors in the metabolic map, we initially kept the model unconstrained with regard to fixed fluxes, flux ratios, and reaction directions. Different model iterations were run in (re-)design, simulate, validate cycles against known physiology with errors sequentially eliminated and a minimal set of constraints required for a C3 model recapitulating extant plant metabolism determined. After each change, the CBM predicted all fluxes which were output as a table and manually examined (for example see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).</p><p>The initial FBA resulted in carbon fixation by enzymes such as the malic enzymes which, in reality, are constrained by the kinetics of the enzymes towards decarboxylation. All decarboxylation reactions were made unidirectional towards decarboxylation to prevent erroneous carbon fixation in the flux distribution. The next iteration of FBA predicted loops through nitrate reductases which ultimately converted NADH to NADPH. We traced this loop to an error in the initial model, in which malate dehydrogenases in the cytosol and mitochondrion were NADP-dependent instead of NAD-dependent. After correction of the co-factor in the <italic>one-cell</italic> model, the loops through nitrate reductases were no longer observed. Another iteration predicted excessive flux through the mitochondrial membrane where multiple metabolites were exchanged and identified missing transport processes as the likely reason. Based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linka and Weber (2010)</xref>, we added known fluxes across the mitochondrial and plastidic envelope membranes which remedied the excessive fluxes in the solution. The chloroplastic ADP/ATP carrier protein is constrained to zero flux since its mutant is only affected during the night but not if light is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reiser et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The obtained flux distribution still contained excessive fluxes through multiple transport proteins across internal membranes which ultimately transferred protons between the organelles and the cytosol. Since for most if not all transport proteins the precise protonation state of metabolites during transport is unknown and hence cannot be correctly integrated into the model, we allowed protons to appear and disappear as needed in all compartments. This provision precludes conclusions about the energetics of membrane transport.

These different levels of photorespiration integrate changes to external CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and stomatal opening status which is governed by plant water status and biotic interactions. From the complete flux distribution, we extracted fluxes of PEPC and PPDK, the decarboxylation enzymes, Rubisco and metabolite transporter between the two cells to ascertain the presence of a C4 cycle, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. At low photorespiratory levels, flux through PEPC is barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(A)</xref>). If photorespiration increases to moderate levels, flux through PEPC can be predicted and increases to 40 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s), that is all CO<sub>2</sub> is funnelled through PEPC, for high photorespiratory fluxes. Concomitant with flux through PEPC, the activity of the decarboxylation enzymes changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(B)</xref>). At low to intermediate levels of photorespiratory flux, glycine decarboxylase complex activity is predicted to shuttle CO<sub>2</sub> to the bundle sheath at up to 4.7 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s). Decarboxylation of C4 acids is initially mostly mediated by PEP-CK and is largely taken over by NADP-ME at high fluxes through photorespiration. Flux through NAD-ME is very low under all photorespiration levels. The decarboxylation enzymes dictate flux through the different Rubiscos in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(C)</xref>). At low photorespiratory flux, both the Rubiscos in mesophyll and bundle sheath are active. Only very little flux occurs through the CCM-dependent Rubisco, which is a result of the glycine decarboxylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(B)</xref>). With increasing photorespiratory flux, this flux through glycine decarboxylase increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(B)</xref>) and therefore, total Rubisco activity exceeds the carbon intake flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(C)</xref>).

To analyse whether the predicted evolution of the C4 cycle is independent of a particular decarboxylation enzyme, we performed three separate experiments, where only one decarboxylation enzyme can be active at a time. The other decarboxylation enzymes were de-activated by constraining the reaction flux to zero resulting in three different predictions, one for each decarboxylation enzyme. The flux distributions obtained under the assumption of oxygenation : carboxylation ratio of 1 : 3 and minimisation of photorespiration as an additional objective predicts the emergence of a C4 cycle for each known decarboxylation enzyme. To visualise the possible C4 fluxes, the flux distribution for candidate C4 cycle enzymes was extracted from each of the three predictions and visualised as arc width and color (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). While the flux distribution in the mesophyll is identical for three predicted C4 cycles of the decarboxylation enzymes, it is diverse in the bundle sheath due to the different localisation of the decarboxylation and related transport processes, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The flux distribution does not completely mimic the variation in transfer acids known from laboratory experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hatch, 1987</xref>) since all of the decarboxylation enzymes use the malate/pyruvate shuttle. In the case of NAD-ME and PEP-CK, the <italic>two-cell</italic> model also predicts a supplementary flux through the aspartate/alanine shuttle. We tested whether transfer acids other than malate and pyruvate are feasible and explored the near-optimal space. To this end, the model predictions are repeated, allowing deviation from the optimal solution and the changes recorded. Deviations from the optimal solution are visualised as error bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Performing a flux variability analysis (FVA) and allowing the minimal total flux to differ by 1.5%, predicts that for most metabolites which are transferred between mesophyll and bundle sheath, the variability is similar for all three decarboxylation types. For the NAD-ME and PEP-CK types, changes in the near-optimal space were observed for the transfer acids malate, aspartate, pyruvate and alanine. Minor differences were present for triose phosphates and phosphoglycerates as well as for PEP. For the NADP-ME type, FVA identifies only minor variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the case of NAD-ME but not in the case of NADP-ME the activity of the malate/pyruvate shuttle can be taken over by the aspartate/alanine shuttle and partly taken over in case of PEP-CK, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The aspartate/alanine shuttle is thus only a near-optimal solution when the model and by proxy evolutionary constraints are resource efficiency and minimal photorespiration.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Flux maps illustrating the effect of the C4 mode.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) NADP-ME, (<bold>B</bold>) PEP-CK, (<bold>C</bold>) NAD-ME.

Since NAD-ME and PEP-CK type plants use amino acids as transfer acids in nature, nitrogen availability has been tagged as a possible evolutionary constraint that selects for decarboxylation by NAD-ME or PEP-CK. When nitrate uptake was limiting, the optimal solution to the model predicted overall reduced flux towards the phloem output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) but reactions were predicted to occur in the same proportions as predicted for unlimited nitrate uptake. Flux through NADP-ME and supplementary flux through PEP-CK dropped proportionally, since restricting nitrogen limits the export of all metabolites from the system and reduced CO<sub>2</sub> uptake is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, limiting water or CO<sub>2</sub> uptake into the model resulted in overall reduced flux towards the phloem output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) but reactions were predicted to occur in the same proportions as predicted for unlimited uptake.</p><p>Given that C4 plants sometimes optimise light availability to the bundle sheath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellasio and Lundgren, 2016</xref>) we next explored light availability and light distribution. The model prediction is re-run with changes in the constraints, and the resulting tables of fluxes are queried for CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and fluxes through the decarboxylation enzymes. In the experiment, we varied the total PPFD between 0 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s) to 1000 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s) and photon distribution in the range <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.1</mml:mn><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> / <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Under light limitation, if the total PPFD is lower than 400 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s) , the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake rate is reduced, leading to a decreased activity of the decarboxylation enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(A)</xref>). PEP-CK is used in the optimal solutions active under light-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(B)</xref>). Under limiting light conditions, photon distribution with a higher proportion in the bundle sheath shifts decarboxylation towards NADP-ME but only to up to 26%. Under non-limiting conditions, the distribution of light availability determines the optimal decarboxylation enzyme. NADP-ME is the preferred decarboxylation enzyme with supplemental contributions by PEP-CK if light availability is near the threshold of 400 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s) or if at least twice as many photons are absorbed by the mesophyll. Excess light availability and a higher proportion of photons reaching the bundle sheath leads to optimal solutions which favour PEP-CK as the decarboxylation enzyme.

Design, simulation, validation cycles used current knowledge about plant biochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heldt, 2015</xref>) to identify possible errors in the metabolic map required for modelling. Even after error correction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), a significant problem remained, namely excessive fluxes to balance protons in all compartments. This observation leads to the realisation that the biochemical knowledge about transport reactions does not extend to the protonation state of the substrates, which affects all eukaryotic CBM efforts. In plants, predominantly export and vacuolar transport reactions are directly or indirectly coupled with proton gradients to energise transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bush, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neuhaus, 2007</xref>). For chloroplasts and mitochondria, proton-coupled transport reactions have been described but may couple different metabolite transporters together rather than energising them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Furumoto et al., 2011</xref>). Introducing proton sinks in all compartments solves the immediate modelling problem. However, intracellular transport reactions and their energetic costs are no longer correctly assessed by the model. Despite this band-aid fix which will be required for all eukaryotic constraint-based models which include proton-coupled transport reactions, the curated <italic>one-cell</italic> model correctly predicts energy usage and its distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2017</xref>). This indicates that in models which exclude vacuolar transport and energised export reactions, energy calculations remain likely within the correct order of magnitude. Overall, our <italic>one-cell</italic> model operates within parameters expected for a C3 plant: The predicted PPFD lies within the range of light intensities used for normal growth condition of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which varies between 100 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s)–200 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s), see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

The current model excludes specialised metabolism since the output function focuses solely on substances exported through the phloem in a mature leaf. If the model were to be used to study biotic interactions in the future, the addition of specialised metabolism in the metabolic map and a new output function would be required.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The two-cell model predicts a C4 cycle if photorespiration is present</title><p>Most evolutionary concepts about C4 photosynthesis assume that selective pressure drives pathway evolution due to photorespiration and carbon limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heckmann et al., 2013</xref>). Most extant C4 species occupy dry and arid niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edwards et al., 2010</xref>), even more, the period of C4 plant evolution was accompanied with an increased oxygen concentration in the atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sage, 2004</xref>). Therefore, it is frequently assumed that carbon limitation by excessive photorespiration drives the evolution of C4 photosynthesis. Yet, in most habitats plants are limited by nutrients other than carbon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Körner, 2015</xref>). Ecophysiological analyses also show that C4 can evolve in non-arid habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Osborne, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundgren and Christin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Osborne and Freckleton, 2009</xref>). To resolve this apparent contradiction, we tested whether resource limitation may also lead to the evolution of a C4 cycle. We optimised the model approximating resource limitation via an objective function for total minimal flux at different photorespiratory levels. Indeed, with increasing photorespiration, the optimisation for resource efficiency leads to the emergence of the C4 cycle as the optimal solution. Balancing the resource cost of photorespiration against the resource cost of the C4 cycle, the model predicts that N limitation may have facilitated C4 evolution given high levels of photorespiration. Other possible selective pressures such as biotic interactions can currently not be tested using the model since specialised metabolism is not included in the metabolic map or the output function. Extant C4 species have higher C : N ratios reflecting the N-savings the operational C4 cycle enables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sage et al., 1987</xref>). The photorespiratory pump using glycine decarboxylase based CO<sub>2</sub> enrichment also emerges from the model, showing that C2 photosynthesis is also predicted under simple resource limitation. Indeed N-savings have been reported from C2 plants compared with their C3 sister lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schlüter et al., 2016a</xref>). Simply minimising photorespiration as the objective function also yields C4 photosynthesis as the optimal solution. Hence, two alternatively or parallelly acting selective pressures towards C4 photosynthesis, limitation in C and/or N, are identified by the model. In both cases, the model correctly predicts the C4 cycle of carboxylation and decarboxylation and the C2 photorespiratory pump as observed in extant plants. The evolution of C4 photosynthesis in response to multiple selective pressures underscores its adaptive value and potential for agriculture. Intermediacy also evolves indicating that it, too, is likely an added value trait which could be pursued by breeding and engineering efforts.</p><p>The optimal solutions for the metabolic flux patterns predict an intermediate stage in which CO<sub>2</sub> transport via photorespiratory intermediates glycolate and glycerate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(E) and (F)</xref>) and decarboxylation by glycine decarboxylase complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(B)</xref>) is essential. All of the models of C4 evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Monson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauwe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sage et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heckmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Williams et al., 2013</xref>) predict that the establishment of a photorespiratory CO<sub>2</sub> pump is an essential intermediate step towards the C4 cycle. The photorespiratory CO<sub>2</sub> pump, also known as C2 photosynthesis, relocates the photorespiratory CO<sub>2</sub> release to the bundle sheath cells. Plants using the photorespiratory CO<sub>2</sub> pump are often termed C3-C4 intermediates owing to their physiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sage et al., 2012</xref>). Displaying the flux solution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> on a metabolic map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> clearly illustrates that increasing photorespiratory flux through Rubisco drives the two-cell metabolic model from C3 to C4 metabolism by passing the C3-C4 intermediate state. On the C3-C4 trajectory, the activity of Rubisco is shifted from the mesophyll to the bundle sheath, as well as from the constrained to the CCM-dependent Rubisco population as a consequence of the increased costs of photorespiration under increased <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:msub><mml:mo>:</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> ratio, see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Equation 5</xref>. The increase of the oxygenation rate in the photorespiration constraint drives the reprogramming of the metabolism to avoid oxygenation by establishing the C4 cycle. Therefore, our analysis recovers the evolutionary C3-C4 trajectory and confirms the emergence of a photorespiratory CO<sub>2</sub> pump as an essential step during the C4 evolution also under optimisation for resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heckmann et al., 2013</xref>). The model may also provide a reason for why some plant species have halted their evolution in this intermediary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheben et al., 2017</xref>). Under the conditions of resource limitations and intermediate photorespiration, the model predicts intermediacy as the optimal solution. In a very narrow corridor of conditions, no further changes are required to reach optimality and the model thus predicts that a small number of species may remain intermediate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title><italic>Two-cell</italic> model realises different C4 states</title><p>Since the model predicts C4 metabolism without specific constraints, different input and reaction constraints can be tested for their influence on the molecular nature of the C4 cycle. This approach may identify the selective pressure and boundaries limiting evolution. Initial optimisation without additional constraints or input limitations predict a C4 cycle based on decarboxylation by NADP-ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1(A)</xref>). This prediction recapitulates intuition; the NADP-ME based C4 cycle is considered the 'most straight forward' incarnation of C4 photosynthesis, it is always explained first in textbooks and is a major focus of research. The NADP-ME based cycle thus represents the stoichiometrically optimal solution when resource limitation or photorespiration are considered. Once NADP-ME is no longer available via constraint, PEP-CK and NAD-ME become optimal solutions albeit with a prediction of malate and pyruvate as the transfer acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The FVA identified aspartate and alanine as slightly less optimal solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Since <italic>in vivo</italic> this slightly less optimal solution has evolved in all NAD-ME origins tested to date, kinetic rather than stoichiometric reasons suggest themselves for the use of aspartate and alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bräutigam et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Light is a potential evolutionary driver for the different C4 states</title><p>Since all extant C3 species and therefore also the ancestors of all C4 species contain all decarboxylation enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aubry et al., 2011</xref>), it is unlikely that unavailability of an enzyme is the reason for the evolution of different decarboxylation enzymes in different origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sage, 2004</xref>). Stochastic processes during evolution, that is up-regulation of particular enzyme concentrations via changes in expression and therefore elements <italic>cis</italic> to the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bräutigam and Gowik, 2016</xref>), may have played a role in determining which C4 cycle evolved. Alternatively, environmental determinants may have contributed to the evolution of different C4 cycles. Physiological experiments have pointed to a connection between nitrogen use efficiency and type of decarboxylation enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pinto et al., 2016</xref>). Hence the variation in nitrogen input to the model was tested for their influence on optimal solutions with regard to decarboxylation enzymes. Input limitation of nitrogen, water as a metabolite, and CO<sub>2</sub> limited the output of the system but did not change the optimal solution concerning decarboxylation <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> making it an unlikely candidate as the cause. Differences in nitrogen use is possibly a consequence of decarboxylation type.</p><p>In some grasses, light penetrable cells overlay the vascular bundle leading to different light availability (summarised in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellasio and Lundgren, 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karabourniotis et al., 2000</xref>) and hence light availability and distribution were tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(B)</xref>). Changes in light input and distribution of light input between mesophyll and bundle sheath indeed altered the optimal solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(B)</xref>). The changes in the solution can be traced to the energy status of the plant cells. For very high light intensities, the alternative oxidases in the mitochondria are used to dissipate the energy and hence a path towards NAD-ME is paved. Under light limitation, the C4 cycle requires high efficiency and hence PEP-CK which, at least in part allows energy conservation by using PEP rather than pyruvate as the returning C4 acid, is favoured. Interestingly, the sensitivity of different species towards environmental changes in light is influenced by the decarboxylation enzyme present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sonawane et al., 2018</xref>). NADP-ME species are less compromised compared to NAD-ME species by shade possibly reflecting an evolutionary remnant as NAD-ME is predicted to emerge only in high light conditions. PEP-CK is more energy efficient compared to malic enzyme based decarboxylation which requires PEP recycling by PPDK at the cost of two molecules of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3(D)</xref>). Notably, two C4 plants known to rely on PEP-CK <italic>P. maximum</italic> and <italic>A. semialata</italic> (African accessions) are shade plants which grow in the understory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lundgren and Christin, 2017</xref>). PEP-CK can be co-active with NADP-ME and NAD-ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6(B)</xref>).

When photoautotrophic metabolism was optimised in a single cell for minimal metabolic flux and therefore, optimal resource use, C3 photosynthetic metabolism was predicted as the optimal solution. Under low photorespiratory conditions, a two-celled model which contains a CCM-dependent Rubisco optimised for resource use, still predicts C3 photosynthesis. However, under medium to high photorespiratory conditions, a molecularly correct C4 cycle emerged as the optimal solution under resource limitation and photorespiration reduction as objective functions which points to resource limitation as an additional driver of C4 evolution. Light and light distribution was the environmental variable governing the choice of decarboxylation enzymes.

The C4 evolution not only confined Rubisco to the bundle sheath cells, the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism steadily supplies Rubisco with CO<sub>2</sub> in such a way that the oxygenation rate is negligible. Therefore, the bundle sheath network is equipped with two Rubisco populations. The native Rubisco population binds external CO<sub>2</sub> and adheres to forced oxygenation : carboxylation ratios, where the optimised evolutionary population binds only internal CO<sub>2</sub> and the carboxylation occurs independently of the oxygenation. External CO<sub>2</sub> is defined as <italic>[B]_CO2_ex_</italic>{<italic>c,h</italic>} supplied by the mesophyll network.

Due to declining CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over evolutionary time and/or adverse conditions which close the stromata, the oxygenation : carboxylation ratio of the native Rubisco population in the bundle sheath and the mesophyll is increased and can be predicted as 1 : 3, the corresponding flux ratios are adapted accordingly. Furthermore, we assume that the total photon uptake in the mesophyll and bundle sheath is in the range of 0 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s)to 1000 μmol/(m<sup>2</sup>s). Since they are more central in the leaf, the photon uptake by the bundle sheath must be equal or less compared to the mesophyll.

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The environmental and evolutionary forces pushing the transition between different types of photosynthesis in plants has been a question of long-standing interest. In this work, the authors utilized computational modelling of plant metabolism in conjunction with the environmental parameters to test this question. They identify a surprisingly limited set environmental parameters and metabolic features that are sufficient to explain how these transitions occur and why.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evolution of C4 photosynthesis predicted by constraint-based modelling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gavin Conant (Reviewer #2); Amy Marshall-Colon (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The main requests for clarity by the reviewers revolve around these three general areas.</p><p>1) Commenting on how this model may or may not fit to reality. This includes issues of assumptions inherent to the CBM model, flux issues in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that are lineage specific, and how existing physiological measures could be used to support the modeling.</p><p>2) Noted issues with the Jupyter Notebook.</p><p>3) Making the writing more accessible in how the data shows the claims and what are hypothesis generated by the models that need testing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors use a flux based optimization approach to investigate the C3/C4 transitions and the different C4 possibilities. Overall, this is a very interesting manuscript. As an editorial note, as a general biologist, I could understand the main conclusions due to the explicit statements making these conclusions. It would help however to walk the general biologists through the results and figures more to help them understand how the data makes these conclusions. I was able to divine this from the data but it did take effort that a general biologist may not put into the work.</p><p>I do have one point of clarification. The model is built on the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flux model but I was unsure if this is the generic flux model or the one that incorporates specialized metabolism. It might make some sense to comment on how using the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> C3 map as a resource from the flux model given that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> has very different sulfate/sulfur fluxes in comparison to non-Brassicaceous plants. This links directly to sulfur-amino acids and glutathione metabolism due to the heavy requirement for glucosinolate metabolism as shown by the work of Conant, Pires and colleagues. At the very least some discussion about how large carbon sinks not in the model may or may not change the conclusions would be helpful especially to guide future modelling efforts.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors develop a constraint-based metabolic model (CBM) of C4 photosynthesis using known C3 metabolic models with additional constraints. They compare the C3 and C4 models to see if various evolutionary pressures can drive a metabolic shift from C3 to C4 photosynthesis. They find that selection for minimizing metabolic turnover will drive metabolism total the C4 solution with differing light conditions controlling the appearance of different classes of C4.</p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript, and I commend the authors on their approach to an important and complex topic. However, I think that the manuscript could use improvement in two key areas.</p><p>First, while the authors discuss at several points how their models are consistent with physiological data, these comparisons appear to be vague and qualitative. For instance, in the ninth paragraph of the subsection “The curated <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> core model predicts physiological results”, the authors give many numerical predictions of their model, but no comparative values from real plants. Obviously, many model parameters are not measurable (hence the value of the model). But if the model is reproducing physiology, the authors should clearly specify how and with what level of error. Note also that there are advanced approaches for fitting models such as these to real data on gene expression levels, trying to make models that more closely follow observed physiology (1). The authors certainly need not apply them, but the text (c.f., especially the Abstract) as written rather implies that CBMs have not been successfully used with eukaryotes, which is not true. (Also note that &quot;eukaryote&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;multicellular&quot; (2)).</p><p>My second concern is that the authors do not make enough of an effort to guide the reader through the potential confounds of CBM for problems such as this one. For instance, in the last paragraph of the subsection “C4 modes with different decarboxylation enzymes result from different set of constraints”, the authors reject nitrogen-limitation as a driver of C4 evolution. However, if compounds that are composed of a good deal of nitrogen are used as catalysts in a CBM, the model will not predict a need for high levels of nitrogen because those compounds are regenerated. I believe that the various C4 carbon shuttles function in exactly this way, and a CBM that seeks only to synthesize sugars and amino acids and has no biomass component will not predict an increased nitrogen requirement for C4 even if that requirement exists, because the compounds requiring that nitrogen cycle in the model. To be clear, I suspect the authors are correct that light is a more likely driver of C4 evolution than nitrogen limitation. But I am not convinced the CBM proves this.</p><p>Likewise, CBMs &quot;overpredict&quot; solutions to metabolic problems because they are not kinetic. Hence, the fact that the base 2-cell model does not differentiate between the C4 classes does not mean that there are not kinetic differences that are evolutionarily important.</p><p>References:</p><p>1) Shlomi T, Cabili MN, Herrgard MJ, Palsson BO, and Ruppin E (2008) Network-based prediction of human tissue-specific metabolism.

The take-away from this study is that C4 metabolism emerged from increasing photorespiration with concomitant resource efficiency, and that light is a driver for different C4 states. The model presented here overcomes some of the limitations of previous flux models of C3 and C4 metabolism, and makes an important contribution to the field. However, the main take-aways of this study are not easy for the reader to pull out as they are buried within the manuscript. This very interesting manuscript could be improved by streamlining the text and more clearly summarizing the main results either in the section titles or as a couple of sentences at the end of each Results section. Much of the Discussion is redundant to the results, so can be shortened for clarity. Likewise, the Discussion would be more interesting if the authors took a deeper dive into the potential outcomes and applicability of their results; how can the information revealed in this study guide future efforts for engineering C4 metabolism into C3 crops? Are there potential transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that could be investigated to evolve C4 metabolism in C3 crops? It is also unclear if the authors altered exogenous CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the model; this should either be more clearly explained how it was done and the results, or why it wasn't done. Finally, it is wonderful that the authors include their Jupyter Notebooks and source data for the reader; however, we identified a few issues that made it difficult to run the code. First, there is no Readme file to follow.</p><p>Second, the code would not run with the current installations of the Cobra and Escher packages; this was resolved by changing cobra.io.sbml3.read_sbml_model() to cobra.io.sbml.read_sbml_model() in the load_sbml_model.py file as cobra.io.sbml3 does not appear to exist in the current version of the cobra package. The escher package returned a syntax error from the plots.py file in the initialization step of the jupyter notebook files. In order to run the files, we commented out (removed) any uses of the escher package in the code.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Evolution of C4 photosynthesis predicted by constraint-based modelling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Dan Kliebenstein as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before final acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>There are a few suggestions where in a couple of places the writing could be tightened to improve the accessibility for the general reader.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have nicely addressed my previous concerns and I have nothing further to add.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors develop a constraint-based metabolic model (CBM) of C4 photosynthesis using known C3 metabolic models with additional constraints.

The original plant model on which the single-cell model was based contained multiple reactions which lead to flux distributions through enzymes and transporters not known to carry large fluxes in plants. This included circular fluxes across membranes for simple transport processes since transport reactions were missing. All of these were corrected, leading to a state more in agreement with the physiological state and the biochemistry according to current textbooks.</p><p>To our knowledge, MFA in plant leaves is currently limited to the Calvin Benson Bassham cycle (https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/47/16967.full.pdf), and hence it is presently not possible for us to benchmark the model predictions against a known flux distribution.</p><p>Hence, we limit our comparison to output from the model and make the comparison explicit in a table in Figure 1B, which includes the model predictions and the measured values. A more detailed interpretation and comparison to experimental measurements can be found in the Discussion section, for the particular case “One cell model reflects C3 plant physiology”. We now also include a flux distribution table. Using this table, one can check the fluxes against one’s own expectations of plant metabolism without having to re-run the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note also that there are advanced approaches for fitting models such as these to real data on gene expression levels, trying to make models that more closely follow observed physiology (1).
