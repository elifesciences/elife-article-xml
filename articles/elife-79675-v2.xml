entirely undescribed. Here, by integrating epigenetic and expression data we use multiple sources of evidence to predict enhancer elements active in the adult stem cell populations that drive regeneration. We have used ChIP-seq data to identify genomic regions with histone modifications consistent with enhancer activity, and ATAC-seq data to identify accessible chromatin. Overlapping these signals allowed for the identification of a set of high-confidence candidate enhancers predicted to be active in planarian adult stem cells. These enhancers are enriched for predicted transcription factor (TF) binding sites for TFs and TF families expressed in planarian adult stem cells. Footprinting analyses provided further evidence that these potential TF binding sites are likely to be occupied in adult stem cells. We integrated these analyses to build testable hypotheses for the regulatory function of TFs in stem cells, both with respect to how pluripotency might be regulated, and to how lineage differentiation programs are controlled. We found that our predicted GRNs were independently supported by existing TF RNAi/RNA-seq datasets, providing further evidence that our work predicts active enhancers that regulate adult stem cells and regenerative mechanisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>planarian</kwd><kwd>neoblast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Schmidtea mediterranea</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/T028165/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aboobaker</surname><given-names>Aziz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/J014427/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dattani</surname><given-names>Anish</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M011224/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neiro</surname><given-names>Jakke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Predicted gene regulatory networks active in planarians adult stem cells provide testable hypotheses about the control of pluripotency and differentiation in animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of regeneration remain underexplained compared to animal development. This can be attributed to the greater technical difficulty historically associated with studying the molecular mechanisms of adult biology compared with development. However, an ever-broadening repertoire of model organisms for regeneration, progress in understanding the variety of cellular and molecular mechanisms used across taxa, and advances in experimental tools are serving to close this gap. One area of slower progress has been our knowledge of the regulatory logic of regenerative mechanisms, with relatively few studies in highly regenerative models providing precise insight into the epigenetic regulation of regeneration. While transcription factors (TFs) have been assigned functions, and in some cases a list of likely targets through transcriptome analysis, regulatory logic has been studied in only a few cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pascual-Carreras et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This is particularly true in the highly regenerative planarian model system, where only a few studies credibly address epigenetic and regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duncan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dattani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mihaylova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dattani et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pascual-Carreras et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Enhancers are distal-acting elements that regulate transcription initiation when TFs attach to TF binding sites, containing conserved sequences. In a regenerative context, active enhancers have been identified at the tissue level in zebrafish, the African killifish <italic>Nothobranchius furzeri,</italic> and the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, and at the whole-body level in the acoel worm <italic>Hofstenia miamia</italic> and the cnidarian <italic>Hydra vulgaris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Harris et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Goldman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gehrke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Murad et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Yang and Kang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Despite their importance as a model for understanding regeneration, there are only a few putative enhancers identified or implicated in planarians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pascual-Carreras et al., 2020</xref>), partly due to the lack of transgenic approaches allowing for direct functional testing of potential regulatory elements. Hence, other analytical methods must be used to discover enhancer regions de novo across the genome. A set of putative planarian TFs have been identified based on available transcriptomic data, but genome-wide TF interaction with potential enhancers has not been elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Swapna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pascual-Carreras et al., 2020</xref>). Ultimately, TF interactions with enhancers can be used to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duren et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lowe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Miraldi et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Duren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Janssens et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In planarians, regeneration is based on a population of somatic pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts that can differentiate into all cell types of the adult body plan and are the only cycling cells in the adult worm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aboobaker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Rink, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhu and Pearson, 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, how neoblasts dynamically retain pluripotency, specify fate, and differentiate remains unknown from a regulatory network perspective, while a number of different models at the cell biological level have been hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adler and Sánchez Alvarado, 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Swapna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) separates cells into three compartments: S/G2/M cell-cycle stage neoblasts (known as X1), G1 stage neoblasts and postmitotic progeny (known as X2), and differentiated cells (known as Xins, as the insensitive to radiation treatment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Romero et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Solana et al., 2012</xref>). Analysis of the X1 cells has been used to catalog genes expressed in neoblasts, and these studies have revealed that neoblasts are heterogeneous and can be subdivided into multiple classes based on their gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fincher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Plass et al., 2018</xref>). Some classes of fate-specified neoblasts are termed specialized neoblasts, which include precursors to eyes, protonephridia, epidermis, intestine, pharynx, neurons, and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). Fate-specific transcription factors (FSTFs) are expressed in S/G2/M phase and are thought to direct fate specification into different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). Evidence from current experimental data supports a model where specialized neoblasts can divide asymmetrically giving rise to one fate-specified, postmitotic daughter and a proliferative neoblast that may still specify different fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Raz et al., 2021</xref>). Genome-wide identification of active enhancers in the X1 compartment would shed light on the GRNs regulating the dynamic behavior of neoblasts in planarian regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Onal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Solana et al., 2012</xref>). Currently, no such predictions of enhancers or GRNs of TFs exist.</p><p>Identifying enhancers is challenging and especially so in non-model organisms, but various genome-wide high-throughput sequencing techniques have revealed signatures indicative of enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tomoyasu and Halfon, 2020</xref>). Chromatin accessibility has proven to be a universal attribute of active enhancers and other regulatory regions in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">West et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Daugherty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>). Assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) has become the standard method of mapping open chromatin regions in various taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yan et al., 2020</xref>). However, chromatin accessibility is not unique and specific to enhancers, and thus other complementary methods are used to discriminate enhancers from other open chromatin regions, particularly at the point of initial identification.</p><p>Enhancers are known to be flanked by nucleosomes with specific histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). In both mammals and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, acetylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27ac) is known to mark active enhancers together with mono-methylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4me1), whereas H3K4me1 alone marks predetermined or poised enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Heintzman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ernst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bonn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>). However, poised enhancers are not always activated, most enhancers are activated without a prior poised state, and some poised enhancers are later actively repressed, indicating that the poised enhancer state is not necessarily indicative of a pre-activation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bonn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Koenecke et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, the bivalent epigenetic signature of H3K27ac and H3K4me1 seems to be a conserved indicator of active enhancers in metazoans and has been successfully used for enhancer detection in non-model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gaiti et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Jänes et al., 2018</xref>). In planarian neoblasts, the same histone modifications mark the active, suppressed, and bivalent state of promoters as in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dattani et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that epigenetic marks may have a conserved association with regulatory elements across bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schwaiger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sebé-Pedrós et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gaiti et al., 2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dattani et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we significantly improve upon the annotation of the planarian genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grohme et al., 2018</xref>), take a computational approach to identify all TFs in this annotation, identify putative enhancers in the planarian genome supported by multiple lines of evidence, and then construct hypothetical GRNs active in neoblasts. We find that multiple enhancers have evidence of FSTF-mediated regulation, supporting the view that fate specification occurs in the S/G2/M phases. The FSTFs of different cell types seem to cross-regulate each other, revealing the potential for a dynamic GRN governing neoblast fate specification. We identified enhancers linked to several unstudied TFs implicating them in potentially central roles in neoblast TF GRNs. Enhancers linked to well-known planarian positional genes suggest regulatory mechanisms for some of the known links between these genes implicated by phenotypic studies. Finally, we show that our GRNs predict TF regulatory interactions implicated by available data measuring gene expression changes after TF RNAi. Overall, this work provides a foundation for future work on the regulatory logic of planarian stem cell biology and identifies many candidate TFs with predicted roles in regulating adult stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Annotation with a full range of transcriptome samples identifies more than 3000 new protein coding genes in the <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> genome</title><p>We refined and extended the current annotation of the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> genome (SMESG.1 genome and SMESG high-confidence annotation at Planmine; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brandl et al., 2016</xref>).

While some of these unstudied ZNFs could be assigned to well-known ZNF families such as GATA, KLF, EGR, and PRDM, many could not be assigned to well-described families. The nomenclature of ZNFs was based on the naming of human proteins to which they have the highest identity, and hence many appear in the ZNF and ZNP categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, we also find ZNFs related to SCAN-domain containing zinc fingers (ZSCAN) and pogo transposable elements with KRAB domain (POGK) previously only described in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Emerson and Thomas, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gao and Qian, 2020a</xref>). However, these planarian ZNFs do not contain the SCAN or KRAB domains, and the similarity arises from the DNA-binding domains. While members of the pogo transposable element superfamily are found throughout the metazoans, the KRAB subfamily is specific to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gao et al., 2020b</xref>).

In other words, few TFs were specific to the X2 compartment, while most TFs were specifically expressed in stem cells and their nascent progeny (X1 and X2) or in progeny and differentiated cells (X2 and Xins). This would be expected by overall lineage relationships. There was no compartment-specific enrichment for different TF domains (χ<sup>2</sup> test, p=0.2).</p><p>We then moved to assigning predicted target binding motifs to the annotated set of planarian TFs.

The null hypothesis assumes that differential expression and enhancers are randomly assigned to genes and that footprints are randomly assigned to the enhancers (for details, see ‘Materials and methods’). On average across these eight TFs with RNAi transcriptome data, we discovered 10.38 times more regulatory links between TFs than expected supported by transcriptome data with unbound footprints in a predicted enhancer. For TFs with predicted bound footprints, we found on average 21.09 times more regulatory links than expected (unbound p-value&lt;0.0001, bound p-value&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Results varied between knockdown experiments, indicating that the whole worm transcriptomic data reflects stem cell transcriptomics better for some TFs than others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>). The predictive power of the GRNs developed in our study correlates with the proportional expression of the knockdown TF in the X1 compartment, which only contains stem cells, and inversely correlates with the level of expression in the Xins compartment, which only contains differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that our GRNs are indeed reflective of activity in stem cells but not necessarily in postmitotic differentiating or differentiated cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Transcriptomic data from knockdown experiments supports predicted regulatory links.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The number of observed regulatory links between the knocked down transcription factor (TF) (y-axis) and differentially expressed TFs in our gene regulatory network (GRN) model.

Upon coe(RNAi) of whole worms, we observed eight DETFs, and by collating these two datasets, we obtained pou4-1 as the only DETF containing a putative bound coe footprint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). This putative footprint is located within an enhancer downstream of the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>).

We reviewed the literature on both computationally and experimentally derived planarian TFs and defined a high-confidence set of TFs. If possible, we also predicted binding motifs for the planarian TFs. We developed and performed ATAC-seq on the proliferating stem cell compartment and determined genomic regions of open chromatin. We analyzed genome-wide profiles of the histone modifications H3K27ac and H3K4me1, along with chromatin accessibility data, and used these epigenetic datasets to delineate putative active enhancers in planarian stem cells. Lastly, we identified TFs binding to the enhancers of potential target genes and constructed hypothetical GRNs active in the stem cells.</p><p>We found more than 50,000 new isoforms to known transcripts in our annotation. This information has already helped to improve the clustering of single-cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">García-Castro et al., 2021</xref>). Our approach demonstrated that the principle of integrating available RNA-seq data into a comprehensive expression-driven annotation can significantly improve genome annotation. We were also able to annotate more than 7000 new loci, with over 3000 predicted to be coding, increasing the number of protein coding genes by more than 10%. These new proteins tend to be shorter, are more likely to be proteins specific to planarians, but are expressed at similar levels to the rest of the coding transcriptome. This, together with the extensive annotation of alternate splice forms, gives a more complete picture of the genome of the model planarian.</p><p>Altogether, we annotated 551 TFs that were distributed evenly with respect to enrichment across all three FACS cell compartments in planarians (X1, X2, and Xins). In planarians, most studied functionally have been involved in regulating differentiation. Here, we define many neoblast-enriched TFs that have not been formally studied, with potential roles in maintaining neoblast pluripotency and potentially early lineage commitment. A future systematic functional screen of these may help to uncover the GRN network that maintains pluripotency analogous to that in mammals and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, we found a large number of uncharacterized planarian zinc finger TFs, and this large and diverse family of TFs is still relatively poorly studied, perhaps because they evolve relatively rapidly in metazoans in general and often homology cannot be confidently assigned across phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albà, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cassandri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Najafabadi et al., 2017</xref>). Currently little is known about transcriptional control of pluripotency in adult stem cells across animals, outside of vertebrates. In planarians, both the NuRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jaber-Hijazi et al., 2013</xref>) and BRG/Brahma complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Onal et al., 2012</xref> have been implicated in regulating pluripotency through their RNAi phenotypes that block differentiation without affecting stem cell maintenance/self-renewal. By analogy with vertebrates, these chromatin remodeling complexes may directly regulate the activity of pluripotency TFs, which may include some unstudied TFs in our predicted GRNs.</p><p>Overall, for the main goals of this study, our analysis and identification of TFs allowed us to confidently assign likely binding motifs to just under half of the annotated planarian TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the future as the number of planarians studies using ATAC data increases, and by looking at the actual sequence motifs implicated by footprinting analyses, it should be possible to refine motifs for planarian TFs and even define motifs for some TFs to which motifs could not be assigned, for example, in the diverse zinc finger TF group.</p><p>Based on combining epigenomic experiments and data types, we could identify putative intergenic and intronic enhancers in the planarian the genome of proliferating stem cells. The combined use of ChIP-seq data, RNAi of a histone methyltransferase combined with ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq data, and footprinting analyses together provided strong evidence for the identification of bona fide planarians stem cell enhancers. In the future, genome-wide ChIP-seq against the transcriptional cofactor p300 could serve as a complementary high-throughput approach to further substantiate these enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Visel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schwaiger et al., 2014</xref>), if available antibodies recognize the planarian ortholog of this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fraguas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stelman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Verification of the function and targets of planarian enhancers is currently not possible using traditional approaches as no transgenic reporter technologies enabling enhancer-reporter constructs to be assayed are available. Therefore, we are bound to rely on less direct evidence from genome-wide sequencing technologies. Here, we assigned enhancers to target genes based on distance and the expression of the target gene, similar to established protocols used by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duren et al., 2017</xref>). We find cases where regulatory interactions suggested by previous expression-based studies of neoblast fate control and RNAi-based studies of gene function are supported by the GRNs interactions uncovered by our analyses. We find evidence that regulators of one differentiation lineage bind the enhancers of genes that regulate another, presumably acting as repressors. Our predicted GRNs were statistically supported by differential expression analyses of RNA-seq sets collected after RNAi of specific TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), suggesting that many of the predicted regulatory interactions may be real. Experiments based on the predictions from our data combining RNAi against TFs with RNA-seq and ATAC-seq approaches will allow these GRNS to be studied further to help us understand how stem cells drive regeneration and homeostasis in planarians. In the future, both promoter-capture HiC and the co-accessibility of putative enhancers and promoters in scATAC-seq data would offer further computational possibilities to study these promoter–enhancer interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schoenfelder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pliner et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our definition of enhancers in stem cells genome wide creates a foundation for constructing detailed GRNs to help understand regenerative mechanisms driven by stem cells in planarians.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reference assembly and annotations</title><p>The sexual genome SMESG.1 genome, the SMESG high-confidence annotation (SMESG-high release 1), and the SMESG annotation filtered for repeats (SMESG-repeat release 2) were downloaded from PlanMine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brandl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Grohme et al., 2018</xref>).

Currently there is no rigorous attempt to this, with multiple lines of evidence, in an adult stem cell population outside of the vertebrate lineage. We perform a set of genome wide analyses that support the identification of regions that are most probably active enhancers in stem cells. At this stage we do not propose to extend this study to specific individual transcription factors or enhancers as we think this lies beyond the scope of this study. Publication of our study at this stage establishes this as an opportunity for all planarian research group, not just ours. The evidence we provide to identify enhancers is sufficient based on similar genome wide studies predicting enhancers in other models, and the assignment of enhancer status conservative enough to give confidence to our set of predictions. We note one key piece of ‘functional’ data worth highlighting is that RNAi of the methyltransferase responsible for H3K4me1 at enhancers leads to reduction of this mark at our predicted enhancers, but not elsewhere in the genome (Figure 3K). We certainly agree that each individual predicted enhancer and regulatory interaction of interest needs to be studied for its exact role in stem cells and/or during regeneration and will make sure the revision of the text reflects this.</p><p>We have added extensive new analyses to address two of the reviewers’ comments that further functional evidence was required through new experiments using RNAi of TFs coupled to RNA-seq, to find independent evidence of for links between TFs and predicted targets. As this research project was affected by the pandemic, we were unable to currently afford this significant extension to the work in terms of lab time or resources, rather we see this as the work of many labs in the coming years. Nonetheless, we acted on the reviewers’ suggestions by using existing TF RNAi/RNA-seq data sets for TFs that we predict to be active in the stem cell regulatory networks predicted in our initial submission (new Figure 8). Despite these experiments being performed in mixed tissues (stem cells, progeny, differentiated cells) we still observe clear evidence for differential expression of TFs predicted by our enhancer and footprint predictions to be downstream of the TF targeted by RNAi. This improves the confidence of our original findings significantly and we are grateful for the reviewers’ for suggesting this approach. Overall, we strongly agree with the reviewers’ comments that our work will be a valuable resource for those studying regeneration and animal stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this manuscript Neiro et al. aim to expand our knowledge on the regulation of gene expression in stem cells of the planarian model organism.</p><p>As a first step the authors used published available data to expand the repertoire of the planaria transcriptome. By combining 183 RNAseq datasets the authors were able to identify thousands of new coding and non-coding transcripts. They then screened for TF motifs in the new annotations, identifying 551 putative TFs, of which 248 were already described in the planarian literature.</p><p>The most substantial contribution of this work to the field of stem cells and planaria biology is the characterization of new putative enhancers that were identified by performing H3K27ac ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq and combining these data with previously published H3K4me1 ChIPseq dataset.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful assessment of our work, we agree that the identification of likely enhancers genome wide is a substantial contribution. Equally the improved annotation of all genes, including the collected set of transcription factors we choose to focus on here, is a substantial step forward for the planarian research community.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>By overlapping H3K27ac and H3K4me1the authors find 5,529 new enhancers, for which they report a higher chromatin accessibility than random points in the genome as assessed by ATAC-seq. By using ATAC-footprints Neiro et al. refined the subset of TFs that have binding motifs in the predicted enhancer-like regions and present a list of 22,489 such factors.</p><p>The manuscript is well written and organized and overall, the reported data will provide an important resource to study gene expression regulation in planaria's stem cells. However, this manuscript would greatly benefit from some functional validation to support the predicted gene regulatory networks. One option would be to use a CRISPR-dCas9-KRAB system to silence the putative enhancers identified in the manuscript and check by qPCR the expression of nearby genes.</p></disp-quote><p>Currently mis-expression technologies, in order too directly test enhancer elements in driving expression, are still not available in planarians. This also preempts us using the suggested silencing system used in mammals and other animals with robust mis-expression tools.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If this type of experiment is not feasible in planaria (I am not an expert in this model organism) another simple but key experiment would be to perform a knockdown of one (or more) putative enhancer-bound TFs identified in this study followed by RNA-seq. This would allow the authors to verify what are the target genes of the putative enhancer-bound TFs and if they correspond to the predicted gene networks they identified. Simultaneously, this experiment would allow the authors to verify if there are any changes in the expression of differentiation/pluripotency markers as a result of the knockdown of the putative enhancer-bound TF.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments are possible, but this would be the work of many labs in the future expert in studying those TFs, the organs and tissues they are expressed in, and their roles in planarian stem cells and regeneration. However, what we have done is analyze existing RNA-seq data collected after specific TF RNAi (new Figure 8). There are several studies where TF have been studied and RNA-seq performed after RNAi. Although these studies are performed in specific experimental regenerative contexts, and not specifically in stem cells, it was nonetheless possible to look at expression changes of potentially downstream TFs with predicted enhancers for those TFs knockdown by RNAi. We analyzed these data and added it to the manuscript, rather than perform further TF RNAi experiments, as this was just about feasible within a 3-month revision time. We would add that currently there are no genes implicated in controlling pluripotency in the same way we might consider, for example, OSKM in mammals. Our identification of the TFs enriched in stem cell expression and implicated in binding predicted enhancers suggests future candidates.</p><p>Our additional analyses (Figure 8) clearly show that TF predicted to be regulated by our enhancer predictions are significantly enriched amongst differentially expressed TFs after RNAi of the predicted regulating TF. We observed differences between the levels of unbound enhancers (10x enrichment) and bound enhancers with footprint evidence (21x enrichment) across all the TF RNAi/RNA-seq studies, and a correlation between the predictive power of our GRNs and the proportion of expression of the knockdown TF in the stem cell compartment. This suggests that our predicted GRNs are reflective of activity in stem cells, but not of other cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor revision:</p><p>The authors have mostly focused on the identification of enhancer-bound TFs. However, it would be interesting to look at differential enrichment of TFs in promoters versus enhancers and identify if there are specific factors that are enriched specifically at the planarian newly identified enhancer regions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not looked at potential TF binding sites near promoters/transcriptional start sites. We have added an analysis to look at this (new Figure S3). This analysis does not reveal any TFs or TF families that show a pattern of having binding sites that are more proximal to promoters than others. We did not pursue this further as it was beyond the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All tornado plots are missing a color bar (Figure 3 and FigS2)</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is a typo in the discussion: &quot;the combined use of ChIP-seq data, RNAi of a histone methyltransferase combines with ChIP-seq&quot; should be changed to &quot;combined&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this and other typographical errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript is well written and organized and overall the reported data will provide an important resource to study gene expression regulation in planaria's stem cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their appreciation of our work</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referees cross-commenting</p><p>I agree with the other reviewers that additional functional data should be added to support the author's claims (such as knock down of potential TFs that are identified by computational analyses and assessing the impact on gene expression).</p></disp-quote><p>See response above, with regard to adding further analyses , see Figure 8 and new Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, as noticed by the third reviewer, all data should be made publicly available to the scientific community.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made all data publicly available and have submitted all relevant data to public database repositories in advance of final publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript aims at identifying enhancers in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. The authors start with the integration of transcriptome with genome sequencing data to more precisely annotate the genome of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. The second part of the manuscript actually then deals with the identification of potentially active enhancer elements in adult stem cells of this regenerating organism using genomic techniques like ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq of histone marks combined with motif searches and in silico footprint analysis. Using these data, the authors predict regulatory interactions potentially critical for pluripotency and regeneration in planarian adult stem cells.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>- Are the key conclusions convincing?</p><p>1) The authors claim (already in the abstract) that their study identifies enhancers regulating adult stem cells and regenerative mechanisms. This is an over-statement found throughout the manuscript, as none of these enhancers are functionally tested nor is it shown that target gene expression changes when transcription factors predicted to interact with such enhancers are knocked down.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and it was not our intention to overstate our results, this is why we have tried to refer to putative enhancers, enhancer-like elements etc in manuscript from the title onwards. Only once we have demonstrated a set of elements with key conserved and widely supported characteristics do we suggest we have a set of higher confidence enhancers to study. However, we have adjusted the manuscript to reflect that our claims await direct testing as is the case for all enhancers implicated with the approaches used here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another example is at the end of paragraph 1 of section 2.4. Here the authors claim that identifying many fate-specific transcription factor genes in the vicinity of potential enhancers is a further proof that the identified regions represent &quot;real enhancers&quot;. It strongly supports this hypothesis, but no evidence for real enhancer activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the total body of evidence strongly supports that we have identified enhancer elements, but have adjusted the language to suggest further directed functional work will follow from many groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, although the authors state that the regulatory interactions and networks they predict from their data can be studied now in future, they should be more careful with their wording and correct these over-statements. Therefore, the key conclusion is that they identified by various techniques potential enhancers, which are close to genes controlling adult stem cells and potentially controlling these genes, which has to be shown by further analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, also the title needs to be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed ‘enhancer-like’ to “putative enhancer-like” and “defines” to “predicts” in the title as well as broadly adjusting the text to caveat that further work will clarify their functions and roles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have no proof that the networks are active in planarian adult stem cells, as they do not show that the predicted networks are active in the presented way.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, see comments above. It was not our attention to claim we are showing pathways that were definitively active, but rather predicted by our experiments and analyses of the data from these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly, the identification of TF motifs within these potential motifs strongly suggests but not shows that these factors are binding, even when these sites were found to be bound by a protein using the ATAC-seq footprinting analysis. Thus, the authors need to be careful with their wording. One example is in the second paragraph of section 2.5, where the authors write that &quot;We found that numerous FSTFs were binding to putative intronic enhancers.… &quot;. The motif suggests that these factors bind, however, they have no experimental confirmation that these sequences are indeed bound by the planarian TFs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have been careful to emphasize “predicted” and “putative”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, this manuscript uses existing genomic tools to define potential enhancer regions in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. The manuscript is informative yet descriptive, as tit presents no functional evidence for any of the predictions. If further toned down, the key conclusions are valid.</p></disp-quote><p>Future functional experiments to test the roles of all TFs and enhancers is now possible due to our work. The combination of data and analyses provides strong support of enhancer elements activity in stem cells across the genome. We have added analyses of previous RNAi work on TFs which provide strong cross validation for our predicted TF GRNs (Figure 8) and RNAi of the H3 K4 mono-methyl transferase provides genome wide functional validation of the predicted enhancer regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Should the authors qualify some of their claims as preliminary or speculative, or remove them altogether? The experiments performed are well designed and in line with what is known in the field about enhancer architecture. However, as this model system is not very well characterized on that level and the authors do not provide real experimental evidence that any of the identified regions has really enhancer activity and that any of the identified motifs binds indeed the predicted TF, the authors need to be very careful with their statements. The authors should maybe emphasize even stronger that all the GRNs predicted under section 2.6 are really preliminary and need to be validated.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we are happy to have been even clearer about this as the reviewer suggests</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Would additional experiments be essential to support the claims of the paper? Request additional experiments only where necessary for the paper as it is, and do not ask authors to open new lines of experimentation.</p><p>One experiment that could provide more evidence for their predicted regulatory interactions is to knock-down one of the FSTFs for which motifs have been identified in potential enhancer regions and to study expression of associated genes (to confirm that the enhancers potentilla bound by these TFs control the expression of associated genes) or by analyzing the chromatin status of selected chromatin regions (by Q-PCR). These experiments would strongly support the claims of the authors. However, it also depends strongly on the journal whether I would consider these experiments essential or &quot;nice to have&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This suggestion of possible extra experiments is very similar to that of Reviewer 1. We are copying our earlier comment as this also addresses this point.</p><p>These experiments are possible, but this would be the work of many labs in the future expert in studying those TFs and their roles in planarian stem cells and regeneration. However, what we have done is analyze existing RNA-seq data after specific TF RNAi, where this data is available. There are several studies where TF have been studied and RNA-seq performed after RNAi. Although these studies are performed in specific experimental regenerative contexts, and not specifically in stem cells, it was nonetheless possible to look at expression changes of potentially downstream TFs with predicted enhancers for those TFs knockdown by RNAi.

This suggests that our predicted GRNs are reflective of activity in stem cells, but not of other cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Are the suggested experiments realistic in terms of time and resources? It would help if you could add an estimated cost and time investment for substantial experiments.</p><p>This reviewer is not an expert in <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>, thus it is hard to judge how time consuming these experiments would be. Cost-wise they should be feasible, as it would include primarily Q-PCR experiments. And some functional back-up of their claims would be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>See previous comment regarding additional analyses.

The figures are clear, the text (besides over-statements) is clear. However, the writing can be improved. A few examples: section 2.2 paragraph 1: &quot;… we found 248 to be described in the planarian literature in some way.&quot; In which way described?; same paragraph: &quot;… but significantly we could identify new homologs of.…&quot; what does significantly mean? Which test etc? section 2.2, last paragraph: &quot;Most TFs assigned to the X1 and Xins compartments and the least to the Χ2 compartment&quot;, &quot;Very few TFs had expression in X1s and Xins to the exclusion of Χ2 expression as would be expected by overall lineage relationships&quot;; what do these sentences mean?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for paying careful attention to the language in our manuscript throughout. We will provide clearer explanation of the sentences indicated. We have better explained terms specific to the planarian model system that are obviously not intuitive and be clear in the figure legends, methods and included code notebook about statistical tests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Do you have suggestions that would help the authors improve the presentation of their data and conclusions?</p><p>No over-statements.</p></disp-quote><p>See previous comments agreeing with the careful adjustment of our language to avoid this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):– Describe the nature and significance of the advance (e.g. conceptual, technical, clinical) for the field. This manuscript identifies genome-wide potential enhancers in adult planarian stem cells, and thus represents a very valuable resource for the community to study these enhancers and the gene regulatory networks they control in the future.</p><p>– Place the work in the context of the existing literature (provide references, where appropriate).</p><p>As I am not a planarian scientist, it is hard to judge this part.</p><p>– State what audience might be interested in and influenced by the reported findings.</p><p>In my opinion, this work will be primarily interesting for people working with planarian.

They integrate analysis of enhancers with transcription factor binding sites to generate testable hypotheses for the regulatory function of transcription factors active in stem cells or control of cell lineage trajectories. Their work creates an excellent resource for future work to resolve the regulatory logic underpinning stem cell biology and tissue regeneration in planarians.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad the reviewer likes our research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major: Overall, the work in this manuscript and methodology are well executed and presented. However, the authors should consider the following comments to improve the clarity and accessibility of the data and interpretations.</p><p>1) The new transcriptome does not appear to be publically accessible. The links to Github resources are broken, and there is nothing on Neiro's Github page. Will the new transcriptome be integrated with Planmine?</p></disp-quote><p>The new <italic>annotation</italic> has been available for over a year as we wished the community to have access to it ASAP (see Garcia Castro, 2021, Genome Biology https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02302-5). We tested the links in the paper before depositing our preprint and after review and they seemed to work for us both within and outside our institutional network. We can only apologize if they were broken or have not worked for the reviewer. We are unclear if this new annotation will be included in Planmine, but we have asked the colleagues maintaining this database to consider including it. Our recent analyses of Planmine suggest that our annotation is now all included as all the new genes have appeared, even if our work is not explicitly referenced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1: Ternary plot in 1F. The legend is not clear or could be explained better. What is the metric? It could be my misunderstanding, but I didn't consider the ternary plots as insightful or unnecessary. Perhaps the authors can expand on what they are showing.</p></disp-quote><p>These plots are important in demonstrating the distribution of mRNA expression of all genes across cell sorted compartments. Given the broad lineage relationship between sorted cell compartments This analysis allows us to identify genes expressed predominantly in one cell compartment or another, or across a specific transition. For example, genes enriched in Χ2 cells and Xins, but not X1 are likely to be enriched in post-mitotic differentiating progeny and differentiated cells. In contrast to single cell data where expression data can be sparse this analysis with bulk data allows identification and assignation of lowly expressed genes, like transcription factors. We will provide some further explanation of this in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1I is a map of exons, not alternative splicing. So, it isn't clear what the authors intend t show. Are the specific exons that are more likely to be spliced? Is the figure necessary?</p></disp-quote><p>We wished to demonstrate the power of the annotation approach and the richness of the annotation for looking at alternate splicing. We have provided a more informative figure that indicates the variety of splice forms. We apologize for this oversight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 2: 2A labels Xins as irradiation responsive. Is this the case (just making sure)?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, this is wrong! This should read “insensitive” or “resistant” In Figure 1A. We thank the reviewer for spotting this error. We have fixed this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2F-G: Ternary plot in F seems redundant with G, but that could be my lack of understanding. In 2G, what is represented on the plots on the right of the hierarchical clusters?</p></disp-quote><p>The ternary plot (2F) and heatmap of hierarchical clustering (2G) are complementary ways to visualize the proportional expression values of transcription factors. The ternary plot (2F) allows an overview of all the proportional expression values, while the heatmap (2G) shows how the proportional values may be grouped into clusters of similar expression profiles and displays the relative size of these clusters. For example, the heatmap shows that the clusters of X1 and Xins are more prominent than Χ2, suggesting that there are relatively a few Χ2-specific transcription factors. We have edited the text to better to explain this difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 3: The heat maps need a legend (i.e., please define the colors). In addition, labeling the figures could help the reader. For example, in G-J, a header about the different experiments above each map, such as &quot;enhancers&quot; and &quot;random,&quot; etc., would make the figure more accessible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree the figures to be more easily interpretable and provided an independent scales and labels for the heatmaps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5: Although it is in the figure legend, the authors could label the 6th track as &quot;RNA-seq in X1.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this to the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Section 2.6 second page last sentence of the first paragraph &quot;GRN of asexual reproduction is not active in neoblasts&quot; data in the supplement? Is it not shown?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this poorly written sentence. In line with Reviewer 2s comments this statement needs to be toned down and clarified. The raw information is included in the general table of enhancers (Supplementary File 2), but the genomic tracks visually highlighting the motifs at the promoters of lox5b and post2b are presented now Figure S4 A and B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion: The discussion about pluripotency factors in planarians could be expanded. The authors could contrast the study's findings with Önal et al. 2012.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree have expanded our discussion. But we very little is known with regard to TF roles in controlling pluripotency in adult stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor: The manuscript has no page numbers or line numbers, so I'll provide a general location of the potential issues.</p><p>1) Section 2 – newly identified isoforms are shorter (1656 vs. 1618). Is the order of the median length reversed?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) No mention of Figure S1B in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a correct reference to this figure in the presentation of transcript diversity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1H should be 1I in the text?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have corrected this</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The discussion contains some minor typos and grammatical errors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed with careful rereading.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting these errors and we will fix them in revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Neiro et al. provide an excellent resource for the planarian community. The paper is generally very well written and easy to read. The new transcriptome described, which improves the annotation of the planarian genome, should be made readily available. It would be excellent if the transcriptome could be incorporated in Planmine.</p></disp-quote><p>The annotation (without broad analysis) has been available since the pre-print for Garcia Castro, 2021, Genome Biology was deposited in BioRxiv.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors provide a comprehensive list of transcription factors in the planarian <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>. Their work provides insight into which factors are highly expressed in the stem cell compartment. Their computational identification of transcription factors and putative enhancers will be helpful to the growing community of researchers studying stem cell and regenerative biology using planarians. In addition, the large dataset generated in this study could inform studies in the evolution of regulatory sequences and transcription factor function.Referees cross-commenting</p><p>The data presented are well supported by previous studies. As noted by the authors, it is not possible to make transgenic planarians, and thus the field needs to rely on indirect methods. The authors focus on using the stem cell population, which can be isolated from the animals. Overall, I don't think additional experiments are necessary. Additional RNAi experiments combined with RNA-seq (using the stem cells) could take 6-12 months to complete. I believe this is a solid contribution that should be framed as a resource paper. The authors should pay close attention to Reviewer #2's suggestions and edit the paper accordingly.</p><p>I have 20 years of experience in the field. It would be unreasonable to ask the authors to do more experiments, especially in this post-pandemic environment. I hope this helps.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
