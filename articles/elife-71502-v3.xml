As the list of PARP1/2:HPF1 substrates continues to expand, there is a need for technologies to prepare mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins for biochemical interrogation. Here, we investigate the unique peptide ADPr activities catalyzed by PARP1 in the absence and presence of HPF1. We then exploit these activities to develop a method that facilitates installation of ADP-ribose polymers onto peptides with precise control over chain length and modification site. Importantly, the enzymatically mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides are fully compatible with protein ligation technologies. This chemoenzymatic protein synthesis strategy was employed to assemble a series of full-length, ADP-ribosylated histones and show that ADPr at histone H2B serine 6 or histone H3 serine 10 converts nucleosomes into robust substrates for the chromatin remodeler ALC1. We found ALC1 preferentially remodels ‘activated’ substrates within heterogeneous mononucleosome populations and asymmetrically ADP-ribosylated dinucleosome substrates, and that nucleosome serine ADPr is sufficient to stimulate ALC1 activity in nuclear extracts. Our study identifies a biochemical function for nucleosome serine ADPr and describes a new, highly modular approach to explore the impact that site-specific serine mono- and poly-ADPr have on protein function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA damage response</kwd><kwd>post-translational modifications</kwd><kwd>chemical biology</kwd><kwd>protein semi-synthesis</kwd><kwd>PARP</kwd><kwd>HPF1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR180051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liszczak</surname><given-names>Glen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-2039-20200401</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liszczak</surname><given-names>Glen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UTSW-IRG-17-174-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liszczak</surname><given-names>Glen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A technology to produce homogenously poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins reveals key molecular mechanisms that govern ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity at DNA damage sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) has been implicated in diverse mammalian cellular signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>). In this process, the ADP-ribose moiety from an NAD<sup>+</sup> co-factor is deposited onto one of several chemically distinct amino acid side chain functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daniels et al., 2015</xref>). In cells, proteins can be modified with a mono-ADP-ribose adduct or variable length ADP-ribose polymers that emanate from specific protein sites, a process henceforth referred to as poly-ADPr. Among the 17-member poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzyme family, PARP1/2 have emerged as the most extensively studied owing to the success of PARP1/2 inhibitors to treat DNA repair-deficient cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lord and Ashworth, 2017</xref>). As the clinical utility of PARP1/2 inhibitors continues to expand, it is critical to understand how PARP1/2-dependent ADPr impacts cellular physiology and disease. In light of intense PARP1/2 substrate identification efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonfiglio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>), several creative methods have been developed to install serine mono-ADPr onto synthetic peptides for biochemical interrogation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voorneveld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). However, these technologies have been limited to relatively short peptide constructs. Additionally, no methods exist to reconstitute well-defined ADP-ribose chains at specific sites on isolated proteins for functional analysis. Hence, there is a dearth of mechanistic insight into how specific PARP1/2:HPF1-dependent mono- and poly-ADPr events regulate protein function.</p><p>Upon binding to single or double-stranded DNA breaks, PARP1/2 undergo conformational changes that induce the formation of a catalytically competent complex with NAD<sup>+</sup> and the PARP1/2-interacting protein HPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamin and Gill, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawicki-McKenna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Langelier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suskiewicz et al., 2020</xref>). It has long been appreciated that DNA damage-induced ADPr has a profound effect on chromatin architecture through a variety of proposed mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poirier et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ray Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tulin and Spradling, 2003</xref>). Indeed, there are several ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes that localize to damage sites in an ADPr-dependent manner and contribute to decompaction of higher order chromatin structure, ultimately increasing repair factor accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luijsterburg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smeenk et al., 2013</xref>). One such chromatin remodeler, ALC1, harbors a macrodomain module that has been shown to specifically interact with tri-ADP-ribose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). This binding event relieves an autoinhibited ALC1 conformation and activates the ATPase domain that powers nucleosome remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lehmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2017</xref>). ALC1 activation via ternary complex formation with auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 and nucleosomes has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gottschalk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottschalk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lehmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Singh et al., 2017</xref>), and it has been suggested that other DNA-bound, ADP-ribosylated proteins may contribute to this process. However, it remains unclear which PARP1/2:HPF1 substrates and corresponding modification sites can lead to ALC1 activation, and if any are sufficient to do so in the absence of automodified PARP1. Such questions surrounding ALC1 regulation are increasingly important as recent studies show that abrogating ALC1 activity vastly increases the efficacy of PARP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blessing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Verma et al., 2021</xref>) and may even be useful for treatment of PARP inhibitor-resistant cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juhász et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The core histones H2B and H3 are consistently identified as some of the most abundantly modified PARP1/2:HPF1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonfiglio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huletsky et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Larsen et al., 2018</xref>). While much effort has been directed toward deciphering the regulatory mechanisms that govern serine ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilokapic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonfiglio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suskiewicz et al., 2020</xref>), the functional consequences of specific nucleosome serine ADPr sites remain unclear. We and others have demonstrated that histone H2B serine 6 (H2BS6) and histone H3 serine 10 (H3S10) are the primary PARP1/2:HPF1 target sites in biochemical and cellular systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liszczak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>). Building upon these studies, we sought to determine how mono- and poly-ADPr on H2BS6 and H3S10 contribute to PARP1/2-dependent DNA repair activities such as ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling.</p><p>Here we employ an HPLC/MS-based analysis to investigate PARP1-dependent peptide ADPr activity in the absence and presence of HPF1. Reaction analyses guided the development of an approach that combines peptide chemistry, enzymatic catalysis, and protein ligation technologies to generate full-length proteins that bear mono- or poly-ADPr at user-defined serine sites. Key to this method is the separation of two enzyme-based peptide modification steps: 1. mono-ADPr of unmodified peptides by the PARP1:HPF1 complex, and 2. ADP-ribose chain elongation from mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides by the uncomplexed PARP1 enzyme. We prepare eight unique, semi-synthetic ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes and demonstrate that histone serine poly-ADPr marks nucleosomes for ALC1-dependent chromatin remodeling, with ALC1 remodeling rate constants increasing up to ~370 fold relative to unmodified nucleosome substrates. Additional data support a model wherein nucleosome serine ADPr is sufficient to initiate ALC1-dependent chromatin structure alterations with a high degree of spatial precision.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An HPLC/MS-based approach to analyze peptide ADPr by PARP1:HPF1</title><p>While synthetic and enzyme-based methodologies exist to prepare mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hananya et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voorneveld et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>), installation of poly-ADP-ribose is synthetically more complex and has not been reported. Therefore, we envisioned an enzyme-based approach that employs the PARP1:HPF1 complex to modify specific serine sites on synthetic peptides with homogenous ADP-ribose polymers. A similar elegant approach was recently reported by the Matic group to prepare mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides, which included H2B and H3 tail constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>). However, in that study, a post-reaction poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase (PARG) treatment was carried out to reduce any poly-ADP-ribosylated species to the mono-ADP-ribose adduct. Our method is unique in that we developed an RP-HPLC-MS-based assay to simultaneously monitor recombinant PARP1:HPF1 complex activity on a peptide substrate and separate distinct mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated peptide products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of serine mono- and poly-ADPr by the PARP1:HPF1 complex on synthetic peptide substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic showing the workflow employed to analyze peptide poly-APDr by the recombinant PARP1:HPF1 complex.

Multiple H3 peptide product peaks were observed via chromatography-based reaction analysis. ESI-MS characterization revealed a single, unique mass in each HPLC product peak, which corresponded to an H3 peptide modified with mono-, di-, tri-, or tetra-ADP-ribose (henceforth H3S10ADPr<sub>n</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, all products are sensitive to the H3S10A mutation, indicating the presence of an ADP-ribose chain that elongates from the S10 site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, each individual peptide product corresponding to mono-, di-, tri-, or tetra-ADP-ribosylated H3S10 can be separated via RP-HPLC.</p><p>We next treated ADPr reactions with recombinant ADP-ribosylhydrolase enzymes to validate the modification site and chemical identity of modified peptide products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Analysis via HPLC-MS demonstrates that PARG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Slade et al., 2011</xref>) treatment quantitatively converts all observed ADP-ribosylated H3 peptide products to the mono-ADP-ribosylated species, which is consistent with a single modification site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). When the serine-specific ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>) enzyme is substituted for PARG, all ADP-ribosylated species are converted to the unmodified H3 peptide, thus confirming a serine-linked modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). An established LC-MS/MS analysis protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) was used to determine that the peptide-linked ADP-ribose chains were principally linear, with negligible branching ( &lt; 0.03%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>The workflow and characterization strategies described here were next implemented to install ADP-ribose chains at the known PARP1:HPF1 target site on a synthetic H2B peptide (amino acids 1–16). Despite the presence of two serine residues in the H2B peptide, our mutagenesis and ADP-ribosylhydrolase-based characterizations confirmed H2BS6 as the sole acceptor residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> and C). Notably, while conversion of up to 1 mM (~20 mg) of unmodified H2B or H3 peptides to the H2BS6ADPr<sub>1</sub> or H3S10ADPr<sub>1</sub> products could be routinely achieved, a more scalable approach for peptide poly-ADPr would be required to deploy these molecules in protein ligation reactions and biochemical assays.</p><p>Analysis of the PARP2:HPF1 structure suggests that HPF1 binding, while required for serine ADPr, would interfere with the PARP1/2 ADP-ribose chain elongation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suskiewicz et al., 2020</xref>). This observation is consistent with several recent reports that show HPF1-dependent shortening of PARP1/2-catalyzed ADP-ribose chains in cellular and biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rudolph et al., 2021</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the concentration of HPF1 in the peptide modification reaction may affect the final distribution of our mono- and poly-ADP-ribosylated peptide products. To explore this, an HPF1 titration from 5 μM to 100 μM was performed in an ADPr reaction containing the H3 peptide. Notably, unmodified peptide starting material and ADP-ribosylated peptide products could be separated via RP-HPLC and quantified by chromatogram peak integration at A<sub>214</sub> and A<sub>280</sub>, respectively (see Materials and methods for details). Near quantitative conversion ( &gt; 95%) of the unmodified H3 substrate to ADP-ribosylated products was achieved at HPF1 concentrations as low as 5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a gradual increase in mono-ADPr activity and decrease in poly-ADPr activity as HPF1 is titrated into the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In the 5 μM HPF1 reaction, the mono-ADP-ribosylated peptide represents ~41% of the total product, with the remaining ~59% comprising a distribution of di- to penta-ADP-ribosylated peptide. In the 100 μM HPF1 reaction, mono-ADP-ribosylated peptide increases to ~94% of the total product, with di-ADP-ribose representing the remaining ~6%. This is consistent with a mechanism wherein PARP1:HPF1 complex formation switches PARP1 activity from an ADP-ribose chain elongator to a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase. Indeed, these experimental data are congruent with the structure-based hypothesis put forth by Suskiewicz, et al. that HPF1 limits PARP1/2 activity to mono-ADPr.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Synthesis of poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides via two enzymatic steps</title><p>Based on the mechanistic interpretation described above, we surmised that PARP1 would display efficient ADP-ribose chain elongation activity on mono-ADP-ribosylated peptides in the absence of HPF1 in our reconstituted system.

The broad applicability our peptide poly-ADPr strategy was further validated with additional known PARP1:HPF1 target sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>) including TMA16 (amino acids 2–19, target residue S9), a fragment of the PARP1 automodification domain (amino acids 501–515, target residue S507), and a secondary histone H3 site (amino acids 21–34; target residue S28). The mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra- ADP-ribosylated species were isolated for each of these peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref> and B). Thus, PARP1 can dependably elongate ADP-ribose chains from peptides that have been ‘primed’ with serine mono-ADP-ribose by PARP1:HPF1.

This phenomenon implies that macrodomain-ligand specificity may not represent the sole determinant of ALC1 substrate preference. To address this, we sought to analyze full-length ALC1 remodeling activity in the context of ADP-ribosylated nucleosome substrates. The first step towards reconstituting modified nucleosomes requires preparation of full-length, ADP-ribosylated histones. We generated a series of ADP-ribosylated H2B and H3 peptides with C-terminal thioesters to enable an eventual native chemical ligation reaction to the remainder of the corresponding histone fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Following purification via gel filtration chromatography, octamer quality and ADPr stability was determined via SDS-PAGE/western blot analysis. Histone detection via western blotting with H2B and H3 antibodies revealed single, distinct species for each ADP-ribosylated H2B and H3 histone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). We found that ADP-ribose chain length is inversely proportional to histone gel migration distance, suggesting that single migration bands for H2B and H3 are a reliable indicator of modification stability and sample homogeneity. Additionally, all gel species that correspond to ADP-ribosylated histones exhibited strong signal in a pan-ADP-ribose detection blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Next, the eight ADP-ribosylated octamers were assembled into unique nucleosomes using a DNA template that contains the ‘601’ nucleosome positioning sequence and is compatible with a previously reported restriction enzyme accessibility (REA)-based chromatin remodeling assay (see Materials and methods for details) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2006</xref>). Nucleosome quality was analyzed on a native polyacrylamide TBE gel, which shows a single, distinct nucleosome species for each assembly and only trace levels of free 601 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, ADP-ribose has a polymer length-dependent effect on nucleosome gel migration patterns, again indicating sample homogeneity and modification stability. We also note that all H2B and H3 histones have an alanine-to-cysteine mutation at the respective ligation junction (H2BA17C and H3A21C). To ensure that no disulfide bonds were present, native TBE gel analyses were conducted after incubating the nucleosomes in the chromatin remodeling buffer and conditions. Additionally, a recent publication has shown that mono-ADPr is stable under desulfurization conditions, and conversion to the native alanine residue can be employed if desired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hananya et al., 2021</xref>).

Further rate constant analyses show that ALC1 exhibits modest preference for the H2BS6 modification site and tetra-ADP-ribose polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

As previously described, chromatin remodeling reactions were performed on unmodified nucleosome substrates in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> and PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gottschalk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottschalk et al., 2012</xref>). In this experimental setup, PARP1 maintains auto-ADPr activity but is unable to modify histones due to absence of HPF1. Quantitative PARP1 auto-ADPr was observed within 5 min of initiating the reaction as judged by altered PARP1 gel migration in SDS-PAGE/western blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). PARP1 was added to the reaction at equimolar concentrations relative to nucleosome substrates 20 nM to closely mimic ADP-ribose concentrations in our modified nucleosome experiments or 100 nM to ensure optimal ALC1 activation. We found that auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 leads to an ~12 fold increase in ALC1 remodeling rate constant on unmodified nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Notably, higher PARP1 concentrations were unable to further stimulate ALC1 remodeling activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>In the PARP1 automodification reaction described above, aspartate and glutamate side chains are the primary targets for ADPr as no HPF1 is present. However, in the cellular DNA damage response, it is now well-established that automodification occurs primarily on serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonfiglio et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2018</xref>). We also observed partial ADPr of ALC1 during this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), which may impact remodeling activity. We therefore performed a PARP1 automodification reaction in the presence of low (5 µM) or high (25 µM) amounts of HPF1 as a separate step prior to the remodeling assay. By employing different HPF1 concentrations, a full-length PARP1 construct with relatively short (PARP1 SerADPr<sub>short</sub>) and long (PARP1 SerADPr<sub>long</sub>) serine-linked ADP-ribose chains could be generated. These constructs were purified over a heparin column to separate automodified PARP1 from DNA, NAD<sup>+</sup> and HPF1, which could otherwise abrogate the nucleosome interaction or induce spurious ADPr of reaction components such as ALC1. The auto-ADPr linkage identity was then validated via hydroxylamine treatment, which specifically cleaves ADPr from aspartate and glutamate side chains. As expected, the ADP-ribose chains conjugated to PARP1 SerADPr<sub>short</sub> and PARP1 SerADPr<sub>long</sub> are largely resistant to hydroxylamine cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We note that a small amount of hydroxylamine-dependent ADP-ribose chain cleavage was observed in the PARP1 SerADPr<sub>long</sub> sample. Thus, a small population of aspartate- and/or glutamate-linked ADPr is present in this sample, likely due to the relatively low HPF1:PARP1 ratio that was required to produce long ADP-ribose chains. Immunoprecipitations with FLAG-tagged ALC1 revealed that PARP1 SerADPr<sub>short</sub> and PARP1 SerADPr<sub>long</sub> are able to induce formation of an ALC1:nucleosome:PARP1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We then titrated each construct into an ALC1 remodeling reaction with unmodified nucleosomes and observed optimal remodeling stimulation at 100 nM of automodified PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Remodeling rate constant calculations show that PARP1 SerADPr<sub>short</sub> and PARP1 SerADPr<sub>long</sub> stimulate ALC1 activity ~28 fold and ~36 fold, respectively, when compared to activity in the absence of automodified PARP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We also found automodified PARP1 is unable to further stimulate ALC1 remodeling activity when an ADPr nucleosome substrate is employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>), which clearly demonstrates that nucleosome ADPr significantly influences ALC1 remodeling even in the presence of automodified PARP1. We stress that while nucleosome serine ADPr is superior to PARP1 auto-ADPr for ALC1 activation in biochemical assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), these data do not allow us to conclude that this is the case in the cellular DNA damage response. However, our work does raise interesting new questions about regulatory mechanisms underlying ALC1 activity (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ALC1 specificity persists within mixed nucleosome pools</title><p>To further probe ALC1 nucleosome substrate selectivity, we designed a method to pool unmodified, mono-, tri-, and tetra-ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes into a single reaction and analyze nucleosome remodeling activity for each unique substrate simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar next-generation sequencing-based approaches have been implemented for rate constant analysis of the ISWI chromatin remodeler family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dann et al., 2017</xref>).

We again turned to the REA assay but appended a unique 5′ 15-base pair primer binding site to each 601 DNA template. Importantly, we designed priming sequences with similar primer binding efficiencies and found that DNA sequence alterations in this region of the template do not affect remodeling rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The heterogeneous nucleosome substrate pool was employed in ALC1 remodeling reactions as described above, and DNA from various time points was isolated and analyzed via qPCR. We found that relative remodeling rate constants were consistent with those observed in our single substrate, densitometry-based assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).

In all dinucleosome constructs, nucleosome A bears a 45 base pair DNA overhang and is separated from nucleosome B by a 15 base pair DNA linker to allow for remodeling to occur. By removing the PstI site from nucleosome B, we were able to specifically monitor ALC1 remodeling activity on nucleosome A using our REA assay. Following incubation with ALC1, robust nucleosome A remodeling activity was observed (~79% remodeled in 60 min) with the ADPr<sup>A</sup>-unmod<sup>B</sup> construct as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, relatively modest nucleosome A remodeling activity was observed (~21% remodeled in 60 min) with the unmod<sup>A</sup>-ADPr<sup>B</sup> construct. While these single time-point analyses cannot be directly compared to the mononucleosome remodeling rate constant analyses, the dinucleosome remodeling activity results are consistent with the automodified PARP1 experiments; PARP1 auto-ADPr and adjacent nucleosome ADPr both tether poly-ADP-ribose in close proximity to unmodified nucleosomes but neither is able to fully stimulate ALC1. These experiments demonstrate that ALC1 preferentially remodels binding-competent nucleosome substrates and target disengagement triggers rapid transition back to an inactive conformation. This mechanism likely minimizes the potential for freely diffusing, activated ALC1 to be present in the nuclear milieu.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Nucleosome serine ADPr triggers ALC1-dependent chromatin remodeling in nuclear extracts</title><p>It is possible that a poly-anionic chain fused to H2BS6 or H3S10 destabilizes the histone octamer:DNA complex and thereby non-specifically sensitizes nucleosomes to ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers.

CHD4 lacks a macrodomain while its ATPase domain shares a high degree of sequence similarity (63%) with ALC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that the two enzymes may catalyze DNA translocation through similar mechanistic principles.

Each extract was then incubated with unmodified, H2BS6ADPr<sub>1</sub>, H2BS6ADPr<sub>4</sub>, or H2BS6/H3S10ADPr<sub>4</sub> nucleosomes for 60 min and total remodeling activity was determined via the REA assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

We also observed an increase in overall remodeling activity towards all substrates in the ALC1-KO extract (for raw data, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref> and Supplementary Dataset), which may be a consequence of subtle lysate preparation variables or represent a cellular mechanism to compensate for loss of ALC1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Chemical and topological complexities have stymied previous efforts to synthesize poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins. Our investigation of HPF1-dependent and -independent PARP1 activities in peptide serine ADPr reactions guided the development of a multistep chemoenzymatic approach that is broadly applicable for the preparation of poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides and fully compatible with protein ligation technologies. Through the use of chemically homogenous, ADP-ribosylated histones we were able to define a biochemical role for nucleosome serine ADPr and explore long-standing questions related to DNA damage-induced chromatin remodeling.</p><p>Multiple recent reports show that the PARP1/2:HPF1 complex catalyzes the formation of relatively short poly-ADP-ribose chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilokapic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). Our study is unique in that we prepare unmodified and mono-ADP-ribosylated peptide substrates and use HPLC-MS to analyze PARP1 reaction products in the absence and presence of HPF1. This approach demonstrated that HPF1 simultaneously stimulates mono-ADPr activity and blocks ADP-ribose chain elongation on <italic>trans</italic>-peptide substrates. The biological two-step ADPr process explains why mono- and poly-ADPr reactions must be separated for scalable preparation of poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides – the high concentrations of HPF1 required for maximal conversion of unmodified peptides to the mono-ADP-ribosylated species simultaneously inhibits formation of the poly-ADP-ribosylated species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).</p><p>Our data support PARP2:HPF1 structural implications that mono- and poly-ADPr are mutually exclusive activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suskiewicz et al., 2020</xref>) and demonstrate that structural dynamics are insufficient to accommodate both catalytic mechanisms. More contemporaneous studies show that HPF1 rapidly associates and dissociates from PARP1 to regulate serine-specific mono- and poly-ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Langelier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prokhorova et al., 2021</xref>). This mechanism, together with ARH3- and PARG-dependent ADP-ribosylhydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonfiglio et al., 2020</xref>), are believed to be critical regulators of ADPr at DNA damage sites. Notably, HPF1 and PARP1/2 undergo DNA damage-induced ADPr, which may serve to disrupt the complex and regulate ADP-ribose polymerization. This would explain why we and others observe elongation activity in recombinant assays that include relatively high molar ratios of HPF1 to PARP1; ADPr on one or both complex components decreases the effective PARP1:HPF1 concentration as the reaction progresses. It is also likely that high HPF1 concentration is necessary to ensure rapid re-association with the PARP1:DNA complex based on the ‘rapid association/dissociation’ model described above. Alternatively, we note that the cellular molar ratio of PARP1 to HPF1 (20:1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hein et al., 2015</xref>) is favorable for a mechanism wherein free PARP1 displaces the PARP1/2:HPF1 complex once mono-ADP-ribose seeding has occurred.</p><p>In chromatin remodeling experiments, ALC1 exhibits modest preference for the H2BS6 site and tetra-ADPr despite the observation that all H2BS6ADPr<sub>3,4</sub> and H3S10ADPr<sub>3,4</sub> peptides engage the ALC1 macrodomain with equal affinity. It is therefore likely that each histone modification site requires an ideal ADP-ribose chain length that allows the ATPase domain to progress through the DNA translocation cycle while the macrodomain:histone tail interaction is maintained. There are several factors that may explain why nucleosome serine ADPr more efficient than auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 for ALC1 activation in our assays: (i) robust ALC1 activation by auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP1 may require a specific modification site and ADP-ribose chain length that is only partially represented on our automodified PARP1 constructs, (ii) the PARP1:nucleosome interaction, while necessary for ALC1 recruitment and activation, may also sterically abrogate DNA translocation activity, and (iii) a direct interaction between ALC1 and ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes may be stronger than the ternary complex that is mediated by automodified PARP1, as evidenced from nucleosome pull-down efficiency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>.</p><p>Critical distinctions unique to nucleosome ADPr over other ADP-ribosylated proteins are: (i) the nucleosome-incorporated histones cannot diffuse away from the DNA damage site, and (ii) the stimulatory ADP-ribose chain is not tethered to a DNA-bound protein that may sterically hinder remodeling by ALC1. Therefore, nucleosome ADPr offers a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that robust ALC1-dependent remodeling can persist in the event that automodified PARP1 dissociates from the damage site prior to ALC1 activation. It is also interesting that ALC1 exhibits prolonged retention at DNA damage sites in HPF1-null cells where serine ADPr does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). This is consistent with our observation that aspartate/glutamate-automodified PARP1 is the least potent activator in biochemical assays. It is plausible that serine ADPr, be it tethered to the nucleosome or PARP1, is critical for ALC1 remodeling activity at DNA damage sites in cells. While our technology has allowed us to separate and characterize ALC1 activation by ADPr on nucleosomes or PARP1 in a reconstituted environment, new approaches will be required to specifically control these parameters and analyze their contributions to ALC1-dependent remodeling at damage sites in cells.</p><p>Analyses of remodeling activity in biochemical assays and mammalian cell nuclear extracts show that nucleosome serine ADPr is sufficient to specifically activate ALC1 in the absence of auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP1. We surmise that other PARP1/2-dependent chromatin remodelers are recruited to damage sites via alternative ADPr modification sites or chain lengths, as has been reported for SMARCA5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smeenk et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, these remodelers may not directly interact with ADP-ribose but are rather recruited by alternative PARP1/2-dependent activities, a phenomenon that has been demonstrated for CHD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, our study supports the ‘PAR code’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2020</xref>) as it pertains to chromatin structure at DNA lesions wherein different ADPr sites and chain lengths may orchestrate spaciotemporal control over unique remodeler activities. Notably, dozens of proteins reportedly exhibit PARP1/2-dependent recruitment to DNA damage sites and have been annotated as ADP-ribose ‘readers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ray Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Teloni and Altmeyer, 2016</xref>). With full-length ADP-ribosylated proteins, ADPr-mediated activities can now be reconstituted for rigorous biochemical, biophysical, and structural analysis.</p><p>Beyond protein recruitment, it will now be possible to explore the direct biophysical effects that H2B and H3 ADPr have on poly-nucleosome array structure and compaction. Our modular chemoenzymatic approach can also be expanded to other PARP1/2:HPF1 substrate proteins, wherein one would expect to find ADPr exerts its effects via unique regulatory mechanisms that are tailored to the target protein. As demonstrated here, critical aspects of PARP biological function can be unveiled by reconstituting ADP-ribosylated proteins and related signaling pathway components. A greater understanding of PARP-regulated biological processes, including ALC1 activation, may lead to identification of new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies for PARP inhibitor-sensitive diseases.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Technological limitations</title><p>The method described here is currently limited to installation of ADP-ribose units ~ 4–5 linear units in length. Exceedingly large-scale reactions would be required to prepare peptides modified with longer ADP-ribose chains. Therefore, this method is ideal to study signal transduction events that are mediated by relatively short ADP-ribose chains. Our strategy also requires that a peptide of interest be a substrate for the PARP1:HPF1 complex. Alternative ADP-ribosyltransferases will be required to install ADPr on proteins that are not endogenous targets of this complex using the chemoenzymatic approach presented here. While all histones reported here were prepared via an N-terminal ligation (i.e. ADPr on the amino-terminal protein fragment), C-terminal and sequential ligations are also compatible with our method. As proof of feasibility, an H3S28ADPr<sub>4</sub> peptide construct (amino acids 21–34) was prepared with an N-terminal cysteine and an oxidized C-terminal bis(2-sulfanylethyl)amido (SEA) group. This peptide was then ligated to the H3S10ADPr<sub>4</sub> thioester peptide construct (amino acids 1–20) and the SEA group reduced to generate an H3S10/S28ADPr<sub>4</sub> product (amino acids 1–34) that can be employed in downstream ligations if desired (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp9">Supplementary file 9</xref>). Lastly, our method is still susceptible to restraints that exist throughout the field of protein chemistry.

H2BS6/H3S10ADPr<sub>4</sub> nucleosome data was 0.0120 (95% CI ranging from 1.195 to 3.355) and that for the difference of mean between the unmodified and H2BS6ADPr<sub>4</sub> nucleosome data was 0.0127 (95% CI ranging from 1.000 to 2.918).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Further information and requests for reagents may be directed to and will

ARH3 or PARG was then added to a final concentration of 3 μM or 1 μM, respectively, to 50 μL of the elongated reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 2 hr. Pre- and post-glycohydrolase-treated samples were then analyzed via analytical RP-HPLC on a C18 column using an elution gradient of 0–35% Solvent B over 20 min.

H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were combined at a ratio of 1.2:1.2:1.0:1.0, respectively, and diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL of total histone.

The cassette was placed into fresh Octamer Refolding Buffer at the 4 h and 16 h time-points during the dialysis. Next, the histone octamer solution was purified via gel filtration (Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL; GE Healthcare) that had been pre-equilibrated with Octamer Refolding Buffer.

Around 10 pmol of each nucleosome was incubated in 20 mL REA buffer for 1 h at 30 °C, and then supplemented with 12% sucrose prior to loading. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and imaged on a BioRad ChemiDoc and the nucleosome band migrates around 500 bp. We noted that nucleosome migration is affected by ADP-ribose chain length. If any free 601 DNA was observed on the TBE gel, then a PstI (NEB) restriction digestion was performed to check if the free DNA was present in the nucleosome dialysate or was an artifact of the gel run. To further verify stability of ADPr throughout the histone octamer and nucleosome assembly, 2.5 pmol of nucleosome were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and immuno-blot analysis was performed to detect ADP-ribose, H2B, and H3.

This is required to ensure that free DNA digestion can be assigned as background activity and is not interpreted as enzyme-dependent nucleosome remodeling in data processing. To each reaction, 37.5 μL of Quench Buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 70 mM EDTA, pH 8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol) was added at time points of 0, 3, 6, 18, 36, and 60 min.

Therefore, the total species concentration in each assembled substrate pool is 250 nM (~36 nM per species). The final total nucleosome species concentration used in remodeling assays was 20 nM. ALC1 was used at a concentration of 4 nM for the H2B substrate pool and 8 nM for the H3 substrate pool. Remodeling assays were carried out, quenched at six different time points (0, 3, 6, 18, 36, 60 min) and DNA was isolated as described in the ‘Restriction enzyme accessibility-based nucleosome remodeling assay’ section. Real-time PCR was then performed with each unique primer pair according to manufacturer’s protocols (iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix, BioRad) to quantify undigested (that is, unremodeled) template for each unique species at every time point. Fold-decrease in template quantity from t = 0 to t = x was calculated by determining the ΔΔCt for a species of interest relative to the unmodified nucleosome lacking the PstI site. Note: the template lacking PstI site cannot be digested and thus serves as an internal control for ΔΔCt calculation. Fold-decrease in template quantity was then converted to fraction unremodeled. Each competition assay was performed in triplicate and data points take into account an average of three independent amplifications for each primer pair (see Supplementary Dataset for primer pair:substrate combinations).

Two time points (0 min and 60 min) were collected from the reaction and the fraction unremodeled was calculated by using the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ5"><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>60</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The restriction digestion of the dinucleosome DNA gives rise to two smaller products, which are close in size to the DNA fragments generated from the residual mononucleosomes present in the dinucleosome stock.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and passaged/frozen down according to manufacturer’s protocols (ATCC). Plasmid transfection was accomplished with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacturer’s protocols (Invitrogen).</p><sec id="s4-18-1"><title>Generation of ALC1 knockout cell lines</title><p>CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids (pSpCas9(BB)–2A-Puro (PX459) v2.0; Addgene plasmid #: 62988) targeting the ALC1 gene (for gRNA targeting sequences, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp10">Supplementary file 10</xref>) were transfected into HEK293T cells. Targeting sequences were obtained using the Genetic Perturbation Platform (Broad Institute). After 24 h, 2 μg/mL of puromycin (Sigma) was added to growth medium and cells were selected for 48 hr. Puromycin was then removed, dead cells were washed away, and the adhering live cells were left to recover for 24 h prior to dilution for single colony selection. Clones were screened via western blot for ALC1 and those with no detectable ALC1 were frozen down and stored in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Nuclear extract preparation</title><p>Nuclear extract was prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carey et al., 2009</xref>) with some modifications. The cells were dounced with a B-type pestle (Kontle Glass Co) until they were lysed. Lysis was confirmed by staining with Trypan Blue dye and visualizing under a microscope. The cell number was estimated using a hemocytometer and the volumes of the different buffers were added depending on that. The nuclear lysate was homogenized using pestle B until it was properly resuspended in Buffer C. The crude nuclear lysate was dialyzed into Buffer D in a dialysis tubing (FisherScientific, 6–8 kDa MWCO) at 4 °C, and dialysis was stopped before first signs of precipitation (around 3–4 h).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Nuclear extract nucleosome remodeling assay</title><p>Nucleosome remodeling reactions (25 μL) were carried out in REA Buffer with 1 μL of PstI (NEB, at 100,000 U/mL), 2 mM ATP, and 8 μL of nuclear extract derived from either wild-type or ALC1 knockout HEK293T cells and 20 nM of the desired nucleosome substrate. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C and quenched with Quench Buffer at 0 min and 60 min time points. We note that reactions contain 0.5 mM DTT (carried over from the lysate storage buffer). The 601 DNA was isolated as described in ‘Restriction enzyme accessibility-based nucleosome remodeling assay’ section and analyzed on a 5% TBE gel. Western blot analyses of the ADPr profile of each nucleosome employed in this assay were carried out after incubation with or without either nuclear extract under identical reaction conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Preparation of H3S10/H3S28ADPr<sub>4</sub>-modified C-terminal SEA peptide</title><p>The tetra-ADP-ribosylated species of H3 (1–20) thioester and H3 (21–34, N-terminal thiazolidine, C-terminal SEA) peptides were purified to homogeneity using RP-HPLC and lyophilized. The tetra-ADP-ribosylated H3 (21–34) SEA peptide was resuspended in a degassed buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 8.0% and 5% DMSO to a concentration of 1 mM. This reaction was rotated at room temperature for 16 h and SEA ring oxidation was confirmed by a –2 Da mass change via LC-MS. A stock of 1 M O-Methylhydroxylamine HCl (Combi-Blocks) was prepared in a degassed buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 4.0, and added to the reaction to a final concentration of 200 mM. The pH of the reaction was adjusted to 4.0 and the reaction incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Deprotection of the thiazolidine ring was confirmed by a –12 Da mass shift via LC-MS. The tetra-ADP-ribosylated H3 (1–20) thioester peptide was resuspended in a degassed buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.0 to a concentration of 1 mM and a volume equal to that of the above reaction. The two peptide solutions were combined and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanethiol (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 150 mM. The pH of this reaction was then adjusted to 7.0 and it was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. The ligation product was purified over semi-preparative RP-HPLC and lyophilized. This product was resuspended in a buffer containing 6 M guanidine hydrochloride and 0.1 M sodium phosphate pH 7.0, and TCEP was added to it to a final concentration of 20 mM. The ligated product with a reduced, C-terminal SEA ring was confirmed by a single peak on RP-HPLC and a single mass on LC-MS.

Understanding the biochemical mechanisms underlying such roles has been greatly enabled by the ability to reconstitute chromatin templates with defined modifications. Poly-ADP-ribosylation (poly-ADPr) is a major modification that plays critical roles in DNA damage. However a few features have slowed careful mechanistic dissection of the role of poly-ADP-ribosylation. These features include that (i) the modification is found on multiple proteins such as histones and the PARP enzymes that deposit the modification and (ii) there is heterogeneity in terms of the poly-ADP-ribosylation chain length and the amino-acid location of the modification. Additionally, unlike with other histone modifications such as acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation, generating homogenously modified poly-ADPr chromatin in vitro has been technically challenging. Here the authors generate nucleosomes with homogenously and site-specifically modified poly-ADPr marks through a series of readily separable steps. Using these modified nucleosomes the authors test the impact of the poly-ADPr modifications on the activity of the chromatin remodeler ALC1. Previous work has shown that ALC1 is activated by binding poly-ADPr chains that have 3+ units. However, it has not been clear which modified substrates are being recognized by ALC1. Using their site-specifically modified reagents the authors show clearly that poly-ADP-ribosylation of H2A (and H3) has a much larger effect on stimulating nucleosome remodeling than auto-ADP-ribosylated PARP.</p><p>Overall, the work in this resource article is carefully carried out with several thoughtful controls and provides a highly enabling new method for the chromatin field. What further raises the impact of this work is the use of this new method to make a significant new mechanistic finding about ALC1regulation. I think the work in this resource article will be of much interest to the chromatin community and those studying DNA damage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This interesting manuscript from Liszczak and coworkers highlights the strength of a semisynthetic chemical approach to obtain both monomeric and well-defined polymeric ADP-ribosylated histones H2B and H3. The authors have applied these reagents toward dissecting the role of ADP-ribose in facilitating nucleosome remodeling by the macrodomain-containing remodeler ALC1. Unfortunately, the synthetic novelty is somewhat diminished by a very recent manuscript from Muir and coworkers in JACS reporting the semisynthesis of identical mono-ADP-ribosylated H2B and H3. However, the current manuscript focuses on biochemical roles of ADP-ribosylation that were not addressed by Muir, and also presents the elegant enzymatic extension of semisynthetic mono-ADP ribosylated histones to obtain well-defined polymers of ADP-ribose by using varying ratios of PARP1:HPF1. The rigorous series of experiments and interesting results, that begin to clarify prior hypotheses generated from cellular data, will be of broad interest to the readers of <italic>eLife</italic>. I recommend a few figure/text revisions and the inclusion of two additional experiments, with the reagents on hand, to help increase the clarity of techniques and conclusions presented.</p><p>One key limitation of the work – which the authors clearly state in the methods for assembly of full-length ADP-ribosylated histones – is the requirement for a Cys-containing mutant H2B and H3 in biochemical assays. While there is no doubt, given Muir's recent work and the authors' claims, that the Cys may be effectively desulfurized in future experiments, the current substrates tested did not include this step. Therefore, I would suggest the authors move their statement on desulfurization to the Results in the main text and cite the Muir JACS paper. Accordingly, Figure 4A should clearly show the thiol is present in the histone tail. Finally, given the risk of disulfide-tethering cysteine-containing proteins to this accessible thiol in the H2B/H3 tail, the authors should mention in the discussion if reducing agents were included for all enzymatic assays and whether assay products were analyzed to ensure Cys-containing H2B/H3 remained as monomeric species at the end of the assay period. Particularly when mononucleosomes were subjected to nuclear lysates in remodeling assays.</p><p>In Figure 4. It is surprising that H3 and H2B appear to migrate at the same size prior to ADP-ribosylation despite previous reports of their differing migration (see https://www.epicypher.com/products/nucleosomes/histone-octamer-recombinant-human for one example). The authors should indicate the percentage of polyacrylamide or any changes in gel running conditions from standard SDS-PAGE conditions that led to this result.</p><p>Supplementary Figure 5F. The PARP1-SerADPlong size clearly changes with hydroxylamine treatment (comparing lanes 3 and 4) indicating that a minority of ADP-ribose linkages are not to Ser in PARP1. I would suggest noting this in the main text as potential heterogeneity in the ADP-ribosylated protein being employed in assays. Particularly if the ADP-ribosylated PARP1 tested in biochemical assays was not first treated with hydroxylamine.</p><p>Two important biochemical assays are missing in the manuscript that would help readers understand the specific contributions of nucleosome ADP-ribosylation and PARP1 ADP-ribosylation toward remodeling by ALC1.</p><p>(A) The first assay is to investigate competition of ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes by ADP-ribosylated peptides. This would validate the authors' statement that, &quot;in addition to disrupting an autoinhibited conformation, the modified histone tail:macrodomain interaction is crucial for presenting the ATPase domain to the nucleosome.&quot; If this statement were indeed true and no additional nucleosomal contacts were needed for ALC1 function, then ADP-ribosylated H2B/H3 peptides would be expected to effectively inhibit nucleosome remodeling of the corresponding ADP-ribosylated nucleosome.</p><p>(B) The second assay involves an ALC1-mediated remodeling experiment with ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes in the presence of ADP-ribosylated PARP1. The authors, surprisingly, only test ADP-ribosylated PARP1 with unmodified nucleosomes and the rationale for this is unclear if DNA-damage is indeed accompanied by histone ADP-ribosylation, which is also the focus of this manuscript. Results from an assay with ADP-ribosylated H2B containing nucleosomes would clearly indicate if nucleosome ADP-ribosylation remains relevant when PARP1 is also ADP-ribosylated, and if any additive effects are observed from both species being ADP-ribosylated.</p><p>Finally, the pooled mononucleosome remodeling experiment provides no additional information beyond the initial information gained from individual mononucleosome assays and the fact that a ADP-ribosylated histone peptide does not activate ALC1 on non-ribosylated nucleosomes. The peptide in trans assay result already indicated that ALC1 does not stay active after disengaging the ADP-ribosylated peptide. If the authors' goal was to demonstrate that ribosylated nucleosomes do not stimulate activity of ALC1 on non-ribsoylated nucleosomes, or that ALC1 &quot;immediately turns off&quot; after disengagement from a ADP-ribosylated nucleosome, then this needs to be tested in an asymmetric dinucleosome model wherein the two nucleosomes are tethered in close proximity and not diffusing independently of each other. A mixture of varying ADP-ribosylated mononucleosomes at nM concentrations is unlikely to be an approximation of the chromatin context of ALC1, where varying degrees of ribosylation may exist in close apposition. Hence, I suggest the authors reword the conclusion from the pooled experiment to suggest that ALC1 only acts on polyADP-ribosylated mononucleosomes within a mixture of varying ADP-ribosylation states and avoid speculation of its diffusivity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– While authors show that multiple modified histones can be made by this method (including S28 modified H3), claiming broad applicability to preparation of ADPr proteins is a misnomer for the exact reasons listed in the last paragraph of the discussion. The claims of broad applicability should be revised accordingly.</p><p>– Protein modification community would benefit from better understanding of pros and cons of the polyADP ribosylation method presented here. Given a need for extensive HPLC purification of the mixtures formed in both cases, a side-by-side comparison to experimentally simpler one pot reactions with PARP1:HPF1 would help.</p><p>– It would be important to assess whether ALC1 itself is ADP ribosylated in the remodeling assays where PARP is supplemented together with NAD+. The supplemental figure 5D, while showing PARP1 is autoribosylated based on the band shift, suggests broad ADP ribosylation signal as well. ALC1 autoribosylation might contribute to relief of its autoinhibition, contributing to the slight enhancement in remodeling observed, rather than a direct interaction with autoribosylated PARP1.</p><p>– Remodeling in nuclear extracts: The representative gel results in Figure 6 supplement 1C of remodeling in the presence of nuclear extracts does not support the claim that, with poly ADP ribosylated substrates, remodeling is enhanced compared to that observed with ALC1 knockout extracts. The relative remodeled and unremodeled bands appear similar regardless of the presence of ALC1 in the extract. It appears the specificity of remodeling gained for the ADPr4 substrate in the presence of ALC1 might result from slightly less remodeling of the unmodified substrate in the presence of ALC1 compared to ALC1 knockout extract unmodified substrate remodeling. This point would be apparent if the data was plotted as raw fraction remodeled values or relative remodeled values calculated to the unmodified substrate with WT extract for all experiments in Figure 6E.</p><p>– More rigorous characterization is needed for the poly ADP ribosylated substrates used with nuclear extracts in Figure 6E to support the claim that no hydrolysis is present of the poly ADP ribose chains. The band shifts due to poly ADP ribosylation are less pronounced as shown in Figure 4C-4E and the band shift is decreased upon addition of extract to H2BS6/H3S10ADPr4 substrate, suggesting chain hydrolysis. Authors should test if the polyADP ribose chains are retained after incubation with nuclear extracts. Alternatively, authors could test nuclear extract activity with and without ALC1 in the presence of PARG to assess if the enhancement is abolished.</p><p>– If it still holds, any speculation on attenuation of ALC1 stimulation in nuclear extracts, as opposed to that observed with recombinant components?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71502.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address the individual suggestions and comments made by reviewers 2 and 3.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Histone modifications play diverse roles in regulating DNA based transactions.

This comment, along with a related comment from Reviewer 2 (discussed further below), inspired us to generate asymmetrically ADP-ribosylated dinucleosome substrates for ALC1 remodeling experiments. Our results are presented in a new main text figure (Figure 6) and described in the Results section as follows:</p><p>Lines 489-508:</p><p>“three asymmetrically ADP-ribosylated dinucleosome constructs were prepared wherein: (i) both nucleosome A and B are unmodified (unmod<sup>A</sup>-unmod<sup>B</sup>), (ii) nucleosome A is unmodified and nucleosome B comprises H2BS6ADPr<sub>4</sub> histones (unmod<sup>A</sup>-ADPr<sup>B</sup>), or (iii) nucleosome A comprises H2BS6ADPr<sub>4</sub> histones and nucleosome B is unmodified (ADPr<sup>A</sup>-unmod<sup>B</sup>) (Figure 6D, Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). In all dinucleosome constructs, nucleosome A bears a 45 base pair DNA overhang and is separated from nucleosome B by a 15 base pair DNA linker to allow for remodeling to occur. By removing the PstI site from nucleosome B, we were able to specifically monitor ALC1 remodeling activity on nucleosome A using our REA assay. Following incubation with ALC1, robust nucleosome A remodeling activity was observed (~79% remodeled in 60 min) with the ADPr<sup>A</sup>-unmod<sup>B</sup> construct as expected (Figure 6E, Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). In contrast, relatively modest nucleosome A remodeling activity was observed (~21% remodeled in 60 min) with the unmod<sup>A</sup>-ADPr<sup>B</sup> construct. While these single time-point analyses cannot be directly compared to the mononucleosome remodeling rate constant analyses, the dinucleosome remodeling activity results are consistent with the automodified PARP1 experiments; PARP1 auto-ADPr and adjacent nucleosome ADPr both tether poly-ADP-ribose in close proximity to unmodified nucleosomes but neither is able to fully stimulate ALC1. These experiments demonstrate that ALC1 preferentially remodels binding-competent nucleosome substrates and target disengagement triggers rapid transition back to an inactive conformation. This mechanism likely minimizes the potential for freely diffusing, activated ALC1 to be present in the nuclear milieu.”</p><p>While we have not yet progressed to 12mer nucleosome array substrates, these results strongly indicate that ALC1 preferentially targets ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes even in the context of chromatin arrays. As our technologies mature, it will be interesting to explore if significantly longer histone ADP-ribose chains increase the ALC1 ‘radius of activity’ and stimulate greater activity towards adjacent unmodified substrates. However, the relatively poor ALC1 stimulation by automodified PARP1 constructs (which tether relatively long chains to the nucleosome substrate) suggest this may not be the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, the synthetic novelty is somewhat diminished by a very recent manuscript from Muir and coworkers in JACS reporting the semisynthesis of identical mono-ADP-ribosylated H2B and H3.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that we were unaware of this work until its publication, which occurred after submission of our manuscript to <italic>eLife</italic>. We hope the reader will appreciate that, despite many years of work in this area, there remain no methods to install homogenous poly-ADP-ribose chains onto synthetic peptides. Here we have developed strategies to prepare, purify, and characterize a wide array of poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides, and optimized downstream N- and C-terminal protein ligation protocols. Considering the overwhelming number of reported poly-ADP-ribose reader domains that do not engage mono-ADP-ribose(Teloni and Altmeyer, 2016), and the breadth of poly-ADPr-regulated cellular processes(Gibson and Kraus, 2012; Leung, 2014), we anticipate that our technology will be liberally deployed to better understand ADPr-mediated signaling pathways and mechanisms. Until new synthetic routes are developed to control ADP-ribose polymerization on synthetic peptides, the strategy reported herein is the sole gateway to studying poly-ADPr via protein chemistry. Thus, we believe our work represents a significant and impactful advance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the current manuscript focuses on biochemical roles of ADP-ribosylation that were not addressed by Muir, and also presents the elegant enzymatic extension of semisynthetic mono-ADP ribosylated histones to obtain well-defined polymers of ADP-ribose by using varying ratios of PARP1:HPF1.

We have used standard remodeling assay conditions that are typically used in the field to carry out ATP-dependent remodeling reactions (Dann et al., 2017; He et al., 2006).

This is likely due to the relatively low HPF1:PARP1 ratio that was required to produce long ADP-ribose chains. This was also one of the reasons we elected to prepare two samples (one with relatively short chains but negligible hydroxylamine sensitivity). Additionally, while hydroxylamine treatment is an option to ‘clear off’ Asp/Glu ADPr after the automodification reaction, the ADP-ribosylated Asp/Glu residues become covalently modified with a hydroxamic acid moiety(Zhang et al., 2013). Thus, hydroxylamine treatment introduces a different type of sample heterogeneity and so we elected to forgo this step.</p><p>For clarification, we have now included this note in the main text:</p><p>Lines 424-428:</p><p>“We note that a small amount of hydroxylamine-dependent ADP-ribose chain cleavage was observed in the PARP1 SerADPr<sub>long</sub> sample.

In fact, there are several studies, one of which was published while our work was under review, that identify additional ALC1:nucleosome interaction interfaces(Bacic et al., 2021; Lehmann et al., 2020) (now cited in our manuscript). We have performed the control experiment requested and found that the freely diffusing peptides are unable to inhibit ALC1.

While we do show that ADP-ribosylated peptides do not activate ALC1 towards unmodified nucleosomes, there is no evidence that ALC1 assumes a remodeling-competent conformation at any point during these reactions. Use of pooled nucleosomes allowed us to definitively demonstrate that even in a solution wherein robust ALC1 remodeling activity is observed, substrate selectivity is maintained.

We have added a sentence to our discussion (Lines 574-578) to point out why the two-step process is required to prepare poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides, and have included an additional Supplementary file that directly compares poly-ADP-ribosylated product from a PARP1:HPF1 reaction (from an unmodified H2B substrate) to a PARP1 elongation reaction (from a mono-ADP-ribosylated H2B peptide). This direct comparison employs the lowest HPF1 concentration required for maximum conversion of unmodified peptide. Thus, the products represent the optimal poly-ADP-ribosylated product yields from a single step reaction. The reader will find that, while it may be possible to isolate milligram quantities of the di-ADP-ribosylated product, it is not feasible to prepare appreciable quantities of the tri- and tetra-ADP-ribosylated species.</p><p>Lines 574-578: “The biological two-step ADPr process explains why mono- and poly-ADPr reactions must be separated for scalable preparation of poly-ADP-ribosylated peptides – the high concentrations of HPF1 required for full conversion of unmodified peptides to the mono-ADP-ribosylated species simultaneously inhibits formation of the poly-ADP-ribosylated species (Supplementary file 5).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be important to assess whether ALC1 itself is ADP ribosylated in the remodeling assays where PARP is supplemented together with NAD+. The supplemental figure 5D, while showing PARP1 is autoribosylated based on the band shift, suggests broad ADP ribosylation signal as well. ALC1 autoribosylation might contribute to relief of its autoinhibition, contributing to the slight enhancement in remodeling observed, rather than a direct interaction with autoribosylated PARP1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed an ADP-ribose western blot-based analysis of these remodeling assays and observed partial ADPr of ALC1 (Figure 5—figure supplement 1H, discussed in lines 413-414). We initially cautioned the reader against analyzing the unmodified nucleosomes, ALC1, PARP1, and NAD<sup>+</sup> remodeling reaction (henceforth the <italic>in situ</italic> reaction) because no serine ADPr is present. Therefore, the <italic>in situ</italic> reaction does not appropriately mimic DNA damage-induced ADPr, which predominantly targets serine residues. We performed the <italic>in situ</italic> reaction as described because this precise workflow has been implemented by several previous ALC1 activation studies(Gottschalk et al., 2009; Ooi et al., 2021). Our goal was to provide a direct comparison between the previously employed <italic>in situ</italic> approach and our new analyses. The observation that ALC1 is ADP-ribosylated during this reaction is additional motivation to use extreme caution when evaluating ALC1 activation using the <italic>in situ</italic> workflow.</p><p>Importantly, ALC1 ADPr is not a concern when analyzing ALC1 activation by the PARP1 SerADPr<sub>short</sub> and PARP1 SerADPr<sub>long</sub> constructs, which were separated from NAD<sup>+</sup>, DNA, and HPF1 prior to the remodeling reaction. Using this approach, we were able to specifically compare ALC1 activation by automodified PARP1 and poly-ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes. We would also like to point out that this control further emphasizes the value of a method to install poly-ADPr at specific sites on proteins for mechanistic interrogation. Moving forward, it may be interesting to explore ALC1 ADPr.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Remodeling in nuclear extracts: The representative gel results in Figure 6 supplement 1C of remodeling in the presence of nuclear extracts does not support the claim that, with poly ADP ribosylated substrates, remodeling is enhanced compared to that observed with ALC1 knockout extracts. The relative remodeled and unremodeled bands appear similar regardless of the presence of ALC1 in the extract. It appears the specificity of remodeling gained for the ADPr4 substrate in the presence of ALC1 might result from slightly less remodeling of the unmodified substrate in the presence of ALC1 compared to ALC1 knockout extract unmodified substrate remodeling. This point would be apparent if the data was plotted as raw fraction remodeled values or relative remodeled values calculated to the unmodified substrate with WT extract for all experiments in Figure 6E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have amended the text to more clearly explain our interpretation of the nuclear extract experiment. Indeed, we observe a change in overall remodeling activity (or basal remodeling activity towards the unmodified nucleosome substrate) when comparing wild-type lysate with ALC1-null lysate. This could be a consequence of subtle lysate preparation variables or represent a cellular mechanism to compensate for the loss of ALC1. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions based on total remodeling activity. However, this assay does allow us to analyze changes in substrate selectivity between the two lysates. Using our unmodified nucleosomes as an internal normalization factor, we observed increased remodeling activity with the poly-ADP-ribosylated nucleosome substrates (relative to unmodified nucleosome substrates) in wild-type lysates. In contrast, substrate preference was abolished in the ALC1-null lysates, and equal remodeling activity was observed with all substrates regardless of ADPr status. In the updated manuscript, we have carefully edited the text to discuss our results in terms of substrate selectivity and not overall activity. Considering that normalization to unmodified nucleosome remodeling activity within each individual lysate is a key component of data analysis and substrate selectivity, we think this data is most clearly presented to the reader in Figure 6E as is. However, we have included the raw data as a figure supplement as suggested (Figure 7—figure supplement 1E). We have also added text to point out that increased overall activity was observed in the ALC1-null lysate:</p><p>Lines 555-558: “We also observed an increase in overall remodeling activity towards all substrates in the ALC1-KO lysate, which may be a consequence of subtle lysate preparation variables or represent a cellular mechanism to compensate for loss of ALC1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– More rigorous characterization is needed for the poly ADP ribosylated substrates used with nuclear extracts in Figure 6E to support the claim that no hydrolysis is present of the poly ADP ribose chains. The band shifts due to poly ADP ribosylation are less pronounced as shown in Figure 4C-4E and the band shift is decreased upon addition of extract to H2BS6/H3S10ADPr4 substrate, suggesting chain hydrolysis. Authors should test if the polyADP ribose chains are retained after incubation with nuclear extracts. Alternatively, authors could test nuclear extract activity with and without ALC1 in the presence of PARG to assess if the enhancement is abolished.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree it is important to edit the text to include the alternative explanation put forth by Reviewer 3 as follows:</p><p>Lines 552-555: “Importantly, partial hydrolysis of nucleosome poly-ADPr was detected following the assay, likely due to the presence of ARH3, PARG, and/or other glycohydrolases. Therefore, the remodeler substrate preference in wild-types lysates may actually be even greater than we observed in this assay.”</p><p>In lieu of adding PARG to our assays, we initially designed the lysate experiments to include the H2BS6ADPr<sub>1</sub> nucleosomes (the PARG reaction product), as well as two nucleosomes that we found to be potent ALC1 stimulators (H2BS6ADPr<sub>4</sub>, and H2BS6/H3S10ADPr<sub>4</sub>) in biochemical assays. Our lysate results are highly consistent with our reconstitution data showing that ALC1, but not similar remodelers such as CHD4, preferentially target the poly-ADP-ribosylated nucleosomes. Therefore, we hope all reviewers agree that the lysate data are an appropriate complement to our reconstitution assays and that all possible interpretations have now been discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If it still holds, any speculation on attenuation of ALC1 stimulation in nuclear extracts, as opposed to that observed with recombinant components?</p></disp-quote><p>References</p><p>Bacic, L., Gaullier, G., Sabantsev, A., Lehmann, L.C., Brackmann, K., Dimakou, D., Halic, M., Hewitt, G., Boulton, S., and Deindl, S.
