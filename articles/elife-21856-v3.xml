Unlike Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which fragments and solubilizes total chromatin, CUT&amp;RUN is performed in situ, allowing for both quantitative high-resolution chromatin mapping and probing of the local chromatin environment. When applied to yeast and human nuclei, CUT&amp;RUN yielded precise transcription factor profiles while avoiding crosslinking and solubilization issues. CUT&amp;RUN is simple to perform and is inherently robust, with extremely low backgrounds requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth as ChIP, making CUT&amp;RUN especially cost-effective for transcription factor and chromatin profiling. When used in conjunction with native ChIP-seq and applied to human CTCF, CUT&amp;RUN mapped directional long range contact sites at high resolution. We conclude that in situ mapping of protein-DNA interactions by CUT&amp;RUN is an attractive alternative to ChIP-seq.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21856.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21856.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21856.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The DNA in a person’s skin cell will contain the same genes as the DNA in their muscle or brain cells. However, these cells have different identities because different genes are active in skin, muscle and brain cells. Proteins called transcription factors dictate the patterns of gene activation in the different kinds of cells by binding to DNA and switching nearby genes on or off. Transcription factors interact with other proteins such as histones that help to package DNA into a structure known as chromatin. Together, transcription factors, histones and other chromatin-associated proteins determine whether or not nearby genes are active.</p><p>Sometimes transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins bind to the wrong sites on DNA; this situation can lead to diseases in humans, such as cancer. This is one of the many reasons why researchers are interested in working out where specific DNA-binding proteins are located in different situations. A technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation (or ChIP for short) can be used to achieve this goal, yet despite being one of the most widely used techniques in molecular biology, ChIP is hampered by numerous problems. As such, many researchers are keen to find alternative approaches.</p><p>Skene and Henikoff have now developed a new method, called CUT&amp;RUN (which is short for “Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Release Using Nuclease”) to map specific interactions between protein and DNA in a way that overcomes some of the problems with ChIP. In CUT&amp;RUN, unlike in ChIP, the DNA in the starting cells does not need to be broken up first; this means that protein-DNA interactions are more likely to be maintained in their natural state. With CUT&amp;RUN, as in ChIP, a specific antibody identifies the protein of interest. But in CUT&amp;RUN, this antibody binds to the target protein in intact cells and cuts out the DNA that the protein is bound to, releasing the DNA fragment from the cell. This new strategy allows the DNA fragments to be sequenced and identified more efficiently than is currently possible with ChIP.</p><p>Skene and Henikoff showed that their new method could more accurately identify where transcription factors bind to DNA from yeast and human cells. CUT&amp;RUN also identified a specific histone that is rarely found in yeast chromatin and the technique can be used with a small number of starting cells. Given the advantages that CUT&amp;RUN offers over ChIP, Skene and Henikoff anticipate that the method will be viewed as a cost-effective and versatile alternative to ChIP. In future, the method could be automated so that multiple analyses can be performed at once.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21856.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21856.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>in situ profiling</kwd><kwd>DNA sequencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Henikoff</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skene</surname><given-names>Peter J</given-names></name><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CUT&amp;RUN (Cleavage Under Targets &amp; Release Using Nuclease) profiles antibody-targeted DNA-binding proteins in situ with high resolution and low background, providing a simple, robust and scalable alternative to chromatin immunoprecipitation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The action of transcription factors (TFs) at their binding sites on DNA drives gene expression patterns, and so genome-wide TF mapping has become a central goal both for individual researchers and large-scale infrastructural projects. TF profiling is most commonly carried out using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), a protocol that has changed little since it was first introduced over 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solomon and Varshavsky, 1985</xref>). Cells are crosslinked with formaldehyde, chromatin is fragmented and solubilized, an antibody is added, and the antibody-bound chromatin is recovered for DNA extraction. Successive advances in DNA mapping technologies have revolutionized the use of X-ChIP (formaldehyde crosslinking ChIP), and with ChIP-seq, base-pair resolution mapping of TFs became feasible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Skene and Henikoff, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2015</xref>). Improvements to ChIP-seq retain the crosslinking step to preserve the in vivo pattern while the entire genome is fragmented to create a soluble extract for immunoprecipitation. However, crosslinking can promote epitope masking and can generate false positive binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teytelman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baranello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer and Liu, 2014</xref>).</p><p>ChIP can also be performed without crosslinking, using ionic conditions that do not disrupt electrostatic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>). ‘Native’ ChIP provides a map of direct protein-DNA interactions with sensitivity and specificity trade-offs that compare favorably with X-ChIP methods. Native ChIP also minimizes problems with epitope masking and improves efficiency relative to X-ChIP, making it more amenable to low starting numbers of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">O'Neill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brind'Amour et al., 2015</xref>). But problems remain with incomplete extraction efficiency of protein-DNA complexes and the potential loss of binding.</p><p>The uncertainties caused by systematic biases and artifacts in ChIP emphasize the need for methods based on different principles. An important class of non-ChIP mapping methods involves tethering of an enzyme to a DNA-binding protein by a chimeric fusion and action of the enzyme on DNA in the local vicinity. For example, in DamID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Steensel et al., 2001</xref>) and related methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Southall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hass et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Dam methyltransferase is tethered to the TF and catalyzes N<sup>6</sup>-methylation of adenine at GATC sites in vivo. Sites can be mapped genome-wide using an N<sup>6</sup>-methyl-directed restriction enzyme. However, as the resolution of DamID is limited by the distribution of GATC sites, DamID cannot obtain the high resolution that is potentially attainable using a sequencing read-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aughey and Southall, 2016</xref>). An alternative enzyme tethering method, chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) tethers the endo-exonuclease Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) to the TF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>). In ChEC, MNase is activated by permeabilizing cells and adding calcium for controlled cleavage. We recently applied an Illumina sequencing read-out to ChEC (ChEC-seq), achieving near base-pair resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zentner et al., 2015</xref>). Enzyme tethering methods fundamentally differ from ChIP because they are carried out in vivo (DamID) or in situ (ChEC), with extraction of DNA directly from live or permeabilized cells, thus eliminating the need to solubilize and recover chromatin.</p><p>Both DamID and ChEC require that a different chimeric fusion construct be produced for each TF to be mapped, limiting their transferability, for example to animal models, patient biopsies and post-translational modifications. In the original chromatin immunocleavage (ChIC) method, crude nuclei from crosslinked cells are first treated with a TF-specific antibody, followed by addition of a chimeric fusion between Protein A and MNase (pA-MN) and activation by calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>). Protein A binds specifically to Immunoglobulin G, which obviates the need for a fusion protein. Here we report a major development of ChIC that retains the advantages of enzyme tethering methods, while extending its applicability and ease-of-use to a point that it replaces other existing methodologies. A key feature of our protocol is that in the absence of crosslinking, seconds after calcium-induced MNase cleavage on both sides of the TF, the TF-DNA complex is released into solution, allowing for recovery of pure TF-bound DNA fragments for sequencing simply by centrifugation and DNA extraction. By carrying out the procedure on magnetic beads, our ‘Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease’ (CUT&amp;RUN) technique is simpler than ChIP-seq while retaining the advantages of in situ methods. Targeted digestion by CUT&amp;RUN greatly reduces background relative to complete genomic fragmentation for ChIP, requiring only ~1/10th the sequencing depth of standard ChIP methods. Simple spike-in controls allow accurate quantification of protein binding not possible by other methods. Furthermore, the method allows low starting cell numbers, and robotic automation is possible by performing the reaction on magnetic beads.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of the strategy</title><p>Chromatin Immuno-Cleavage (ChIC) has the advantage of using TF-specific antibodies to tether MNase and cleave only at binding sites. To adapt ChIC for deep sequencing, it was necessary to reduce the representation of background breaks in DNA that otherwise dominate deep sequencing libraries. The CUT&amp;RUN modifications of ChIC were motivated by the observation that light MNase treatment of nuclei liberates mononucleosomes and TF-DNA complexes, leaving behind oligonucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanders, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teves and Henikoff, 2012</xref>). We expected that targeted cleavage on both sides of a TF would release the TF-DNA complex into the supernatant, leaving the remainder of the genome in the pelleted nuclei. By performing brief digestion reactions on ice, we would recover TF-DNA complexes in the supernatant before TF-bound MNase diffuses around the genome and cleaves accessible chromatin.</p><p>Based on this rationale, we developed a simple CUT&amp;RUN protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unfixed nuclei are (1) immobilized on lectin-coated magnetic beads, (2) successively incubated with antibodies and protein A-MNase (pA-MN) followed by minimal washing steps, (3) mixed with Ca<sup>++</sup> on ice to initiate the cleavage reaction then stopped seconds-to-minutes later by chelation, and (4) centrifuged to recover the supernatant containing the released TF-DNA complexes. DNA is then extracted from the supernatant and used directly for sequencing library preparation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21856.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CUT&amp;RUN produces limit digestion TF-DNA complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the CUT&amp;RUN strategy. Nuclei attached to magnetic beads can be treated successively with an antibody (or optionally with a primary and secondary antibody) and Protein A-MNase (pA-MN), which diffuse in through the nuclear pores.

The almost complete correspondence between the presence of a TF motif and occupancy of the TF, and the general absence at sites of a different TF, imply that CUT&amp;RUN is both highly sensitive and specific for TF binding.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21856.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CUT&amp;RUN accuracy and robustness compares favorably with ChIP-seq.</title><p>Abf1 (<bold>A</bold>) and Reb1 (<bold>B</bold>) heat maps of CUT&amp;RUN datasets from a single experiment (20160630), pooling 1” to 32” time-course samples, and separating into ≤120 bp and ≥150 bp size classes (left).

As in our previous comparison of ORGANIC to ChIP-exo and ChIP-chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>), we consider the set of all statistically significant Abf1 and Reb1 motifs as the ‘gold standard’ for judging sensitivity (occupancy of sites by the correct TF) and specificity (exclusion from sites of an incorrect TF). Aligned profiling data were centered and oriented over the motif for the same TF (top) and for the other TF (bottom) for display (removing 81 sites where Abf1 and Reb1 sites were within 50 bp of one another) and were ordered by average pixel density over the −1 kb to +1 kb span of the ≤120 bp datasets using Java Treeview with log<sub>2</sub> scaling and contrast = 5. Ordering was performed independently for CUT&amp;RUN (based on ≤120 bp fragments) and ChIP-seq, in which case the approximate fraction of sites occupied relative to flanking regions becomes evident, and comparison of the top panel (correct TF) to the bottom panel (incorrect TF) reflects the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff for a dataset.

As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>), ORGANIC ChIP-seq detected the large majority of Abf1 true positive motifs and nearly all Reb1 motifs throughout the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, upper middle panels). The best Reb1 data were obtained with 80 mM NaCl extraction, and the best Abf1 data were obtained with 600 mM NaCl, although the dynamic range for Reb1 was always better than that for Abf1 with frequent false positive occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lower middle panels). In contrast, CUT&amp;RUN showed the same dynamic range for both TFs over the same range of digestion time points with ~10 fold fewer paired-end reads, demonstrating that CUT&amp;RUN is more robust than ORGANIC ChIP-seq. Relative to these high-resolution methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>), standard ChIP-seq using crosslinking and sonication showed inferior sensitivity and specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, right panels). Thus, CUT&amp;RUN provides robust TF occupancy maps with improved sensitivity/specificity trade-offs relative to ChIP-seq.</p><p>To estimate the resolution of CUT&amp;RUN, we plotted the ‘footprint’ of each TF as the average density of fragment ends around the motif midpoint. For both Abf1 and Reb1, we observed sharp 20 bp wide footprints, indicating that these transcription factors protect ~20 bp centered over the motif with near base-pair resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, upstream and downstream ‘slopes’ in the cleavage maps show a sawtooth pattern on either side of both Abf1 and Reb1 motifs, with distances between 'teeth' ~10 bp apart over &gt;100 bp, and confirmed by autocorrelation analysis to be independent of base composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Such 10 bp periodic cleavage preferences match the 10 bp/turn periodicity of B-form DNA, which suggests that the DNA on either side of these bound TFs is spatially oriented such that tethered MNase has preferential access to one face of the DNA double helix. Tethering of MNase to a TF constrains it to cleave nearby DNA even on the surface of a nucleosome, suggesting flexibility of the chromatin fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the very rapid kinetics that we observe at 0°C are due to immobilized MNase poised for cleavage near the tethering site.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21856.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>CUT&amp;RUN maps TF binding sites at high resolution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mapping of fragment ends reveals a deep ‘hole’ and steep ‘walls’ for Abf1 and Reb1 CUT&amp;RUN datasets averaged at their oriented and aligned motifs genome-wide, plotting all normalized base-pair counts from combined 1”−32” datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

For CUT&amp;RUN to profile such large chromatin-associated complexes we found it necessary to extract total DNA rather than chromatin solubilized by CUT&amp;RUN in situ, which may be too large to diffuse through nuclear pores. Therefore, we extracted all DNA and preferentially removed large DNA fragments with AMPure beads.

In budding yeast, there is only only one centromeric nucleosome per chromosome, which is only ~1% the molar abundance of Abf1 or Reb1. An additional challenge to studying the centromeric nucleosome, which contains the CenH3 (Cse4) histone variant in place of H3, is that it is part of the multi-megadalton kinetochore complex throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>), which renders it highly insoluble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krassovsky et al., 2012</xref>). To profile the Cse4 nucleosome by CUT&amp;RUN, we split the samples after digestion, extracting just the supernatant from one aliquot, and total DNA from the other. In this way we could compare the recovery of the soluble and the insoluble kinetochore complex. In parallel, we similarly profiled histone H2A. By taking the difference between total and soluble chromatin, we can infer the occupancy of each histone in the insoluble pellet. As expected for the insoluble kinetochore, the highest Cse4 occupancy on the chromosome is seen at the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Strikingly, occupancy of insoluble H2A, which is present in every nucleosome througout the genome, is also maximum at the centromere. Indeed, at all 16 yeast centromeres we observe very similar enrichments of Cse4 and H2A confined to the ~120 bp functional centromere over the digestion time-course, with resolution that is 4-fold better than that of standard X-ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We also extracted total DNA from the bead-bound chromatin derived from cells that had been formaldehyde crosslinked prior to applying CUT&amp;RUN, with similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, crosslinking results in a more distinct profile and the appearance of phased nucleosomes on either side, which we interpret as a reduction in chromatin flexiblity with crosslinking, while demonstrating that the basic strategy can be applied to crosslinked cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21856.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CUT&amp;RUN maps the rare highly insoluble <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> kinetochore complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) After stopping digestion for the indicated times, samples were split in half and both the soluble fraction and total DNA were extracted.

We therefore tested CUT&amp;RUN using Myc and Max which are basic-loop-helix proteins that bind to a short E-box motif and have b residence times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phair et al., 2004</xref>). CUT&amp;RUN successfully mapped both Myc and Max at high resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>). In the case of Max, a quantitative comparison with ENCODE ChIP-seq data is possible as the same antibody was used, and here CUT&amp;RUN had a much higher dynamic range and therefore was able to robustly identify a much larger number of Max binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To bind DNA at E-boxes, Myc forms a heterodimer with Max (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackwood et al., 1991</xref>) but in addition Max has other binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayer and Eisenman, 1993</xref>), As expected, we see very high overlap with Max present at almost all Myc binding sites. In contrast, there is poor overlap between previously identified binding sites by ENCODE X-ChIP-seq for Myc and Max, as 10-fold fewer Max sites were identified. However, when we lined up Max ENCODE X-ChIP-seq data over Max CUT&amp;RUN sites, we saw high occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref>), suggesting that the lower dynamic range of X-ChIP-seq relative to CUT&amp;RUN was responsible for the failure to identify these Max binding sites by X-ChIP-seq.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CUT&amp;RUN maps histone modifications in compacted chromatin</title><p>We also considered the possibility that antibody-tethered MNase may be excluded from highly compacted heterochromatic regions in higher eukaryotes and as such CUT&amp;RUN might be limited to analysis of protein-DNA interactions in euchromatic regions. We therefore performed CUT&amp;RUN for the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. By analyzing 10 million reads from CUT&amp;RUN and ENCODE X-ChIP-seq, we observed similar H3K27me3 landscapes, but at a much higher dynamic range for CUT&amp;RUN, which demonstrates that Protein A-MNase is able to access compacted chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Chromosome-Conformation-Capture (3C) methods, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>), are the preferred techniques for mapping 3D genome-wide contacts. These methods use the same formaldehyde crosslinking protocol as X-ChIP to identify 3D interactions, such as between a TF bound at an enhancer and its contact with a promoter via co-activators. In this example the binding sites for a protein identified by X-ChIP will include both the promoter and the enhancer, even though one of the interactions is via indirect protein-protein interactions crosslinked by formaldehyde. But in both X-ChIP and 3C-based mapping there is no systematic way to distinguish between direct and indirect sites. We therefore attempted to map CTCF binding sites using native ChIP, which we have previously shown results in mapping only direct binding sites containing the TF-specific DNA-binding motif, due to the transient nature of protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>). We developed a new native ChIP protocol (Appendix 1), and achieved near-complete protein extraction with no evidence of protein redistribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Under native conditions, we identified 2298 sites with high motif scores. In contrast, CUT&amp;RUN mapping of CTCF detected ~22,000 sites that were also present in X-ChIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), with a diverse range of motif scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected, all sites identified by native ChIP also were robustly detected by CUT&amp;RUN and X-ChIP, showing a similar signal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). CUT&amp;RUN sites lacking a significant native ChIP signal nevertheless showed a robust footprint in the native ChIP input with a similar cumulative distribution of counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), indicating the presence of unknown bound factors, as would be expected for 3D genomic interactions.

To adapt ChIC into a genome-wide profiling method, we made five critical modifications. First, we immobilize permeabilized cells or crude nuclei to magnetic beads, allowing for rapid and efficient solution changes, so that CUT&amp;RUN is performed in a day and is suitable for automation. Second, we bind antibodies and pA-MNase to native unfixed nuclei, where epitopes are preserved and accessible. Third, as cleavage by immobilized MNase is a zero-order reaction, we performed digestion at ice-cold temperature, which limits diffusion of released fragments, thus reducing background. Fourth, we use native chromatin, which allows us to fractionate cleaved fragments based on solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanders, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teves and Henikoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jahan et al., 2016</xref>) to enrich specifically for the released chromatin complex. We simply remove the insoluble bulk chromatin, and only chromatin fragments with cleavages on both sides of a particle enter the supernatant. Fifth, after DNA extraction we use these soluble fragments for Illumina library preparation and paired-end DNA sequencing. We find that CUT&amp;RUN performs as well as or better than ChIP-seq with respect to simplicity, resolution, robustness, efficiency, data quality, and applicability to highly insoluble complexes. CUT&amp;RUN requires only ~1/10th of the sequencing depth of other high resolution methodologies due to the intrinsically low background achieved by performing the reaction in situ. As nuclei are intact when MNase is activated, CUT&amp;RUN can probe the local environment around the targeted site. Indeed, we find that CUT&amp;RUN recovers sites of 3D contacts with base-pair resolution at relatively low sequencing depth in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CUT&amp;RUN is widely applicable</title><p>Although ChIC was described as a basic mapping method using Southern blotting 12 years ago, we are unaware of a single publication using it. Meanwhile, ChIP-seq alone has been mentioned in ~30,000 publications for profiling almost every type of chromatin component, including histone modifications, transcription factors and chromatin-associated proteins. Like ChIP, CUT&amp;RUN is antibody-based, so that it can be applied to any epitope on chromatin, making it a general method for chromatin profiling that takes advantage of the large antibody production infrastructure developed for ChIP. CUT&amp;RUN provides quantitative occupancy profiles with standard and spike-in normalization options implemented by our custom software for processing and comparing ChIP-seq and CUT&amp;RUN datasets. The only non-standard feature of CUT&amp;RUN is the requirement for the pA-MN fusion protein, which can be produced and purified in a batch from bacterial culture that yields enough pA-MN for profiling &gt;100,000 samples.</p><p>As CUT&amp;RUN is based on different principles from ChIP, it can resolve crosslinking-, sonication- and solubilization-related issues. Backgrounds are low with CUT&amp;RUN, because cleavages occur only around binding sites, whereas ChIP first pulverizes the entire genome, and these fragments contribute to a genome-wide background noise that must still be sequenced. The near absence of detectable background under the brief low-temperature conditions that we used, the lack of preference for accessible or AT-rich DNA, and the recovery of essentially all Abf1 and Reb1 motifs in the yeast genome, suggests that CUT&amp;RUN is not subject to the types of artifacts that sometimes have plagued ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teytelman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baranello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, CUT&amp;RUN antibody binding takes place in an intact nuclear environment resembling conditions for immunofluorescence microscopy, so that it should be successful for antibodies that are validated cytologically, even those that fail in ChIP. As CUT&amp;RUN solubilizes chromatin only after the targeted cleavage reaction, it should be appropriate for extending classical chromatin salt-fractionation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanders, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Teves and Henikoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jahan et al., 2016</xref>) to specific TFs and chromatin complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>CUT&amp;RUN precisely maps long-range contacts</title><p>A consequence of using intact nuclei for CUT&amp;RUN is that the long reach of antibody-tethered MNase can probe the local environment. In yeast, we observed cleavages on one surface of the DNA flanking the TF, gradually decreasing with distance. In human cells, we observed cleavages at sites previously identified as contact sites for CTCF. Recently, Hi-C contact sites have been predicted computationally with a high degree of confidence given sites of CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>). As CUT&amp;RUN maps both CTCF binding sites and interactions, and our native ChIP protocol identifies those sites that are directly TF-bound, it can provide a complete high-resolution 1D map of a genome while enriching its 3D contact map with high-resolution distinctions between direct and indirect TF binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Low background levels reduce sequencing costs</title><p>ChIP-seq analysis typically includes normalization to compensate for different numbers of reads between samples. In ChIP-seq, whole genome fragmentation leads to a constant low density genome-wide background that provides a basis for normalization, for example, in comparing wildtype and knockdown cell lines. Although normalization fails on abundant proteins, this can be corrected by the use of spike-in controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonhoure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orlando et al., 2014</xref>). However, a rigorous spike-in strategy requires the addition of cells from a different species, and quantification is reliant upon antibody cross-reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Orlando et al., 2014</xref>). To normalize between samples despite the low background in CUT&amp;RUN, we find that simply adding a constant low amount of fragmented spike-in DNA from a different species suffices and allows accurate quantification of protein occupancy.</p><p>The low background levels of cleavage with CUT&amp;RUN require fewer reads to crisply define peaks. For example only ~10 million paired-end reads were required for each CTCF time point, similar to the requirement for low-resolution ChIP-seq, and many fewer than for ChIP-exo, which required ~100 million reads for CTCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, in the cases of Max and H3K27me3, 10 million reads for CUT&amp;RUN provided very high dynamic range, but 10 million reads were insufficient for calling peaks from Max ENCODE X-ChIP-seq. This cost-effectiveness makes CUT&amp;RUN attractive as a replacement for ChIP-seq especially where depth of sequencing is limiting. We might attribute the high efficiency of CUT&amp;RUN to fundamental differences between in situ profiling and ChIP: CUT&amp;RUN retains the in vivo 3D conformation, so antibodies access only exposed surfaces in a first-order binding reaction, whereas in ChIP, antibodies interact with the solubilizable genome-wide content of the pulverized cells or nuclei. Furthermore, CUT&amp;RUN cleavage is effectively a zero-order reaction, resulting in steady particle release during the brief low temperature time-course for all bound epitopes in the genome. Accounting for epitope abundances, we estimate that our mapping of ~22,000 direct and indirect CTCF sites with 600,000 cells is comparable to the sensitivity of ultra-low input ChIP-seq protocols that are typically restricted to abundant histone modifications, such as H3K27me3, with ~5000 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brind'Amour et al., 2015</xref>). Whereas ultra-low-input ChIP provides only ~2 kb resolution, CUT&amp;RUN provides near base-pair resolution. The inherent robustness, high information content, low input and sequencing requirements and suitability for automation of our method suggests that CUT&amp;RUN profiling of CTCF and other TFs might be applied to epigenome diagnostics.</p><p>In summary, CUT&amp;RUN has a number of practical advantages over ChIP and its derivatives: with low background resulting in low sequence depth requirements, the ease of use makes it amenable to robotic automation, while allowing accurate quantification with a simple spike-in strategy. We conclude that in all important respects CUT&amp;RUN provides an attractive alternative to ChIP-based strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological</title><p>W1588-4C <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains carrying Flag-tagged H2A (SBY2688), Cse4 (SBY5146), Abf1 and Reb1 under the control of their respective endogenous promoters were previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krassovsky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gelbart et al., 2001</xref>).

The following protocol is provided in step-by-step format (Appendix 2). Nuclei from ~5 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells at OD600 ~0.7 were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Orsi et al., 2015</xref>), divided into 10 600 µL aliquots, snap-frozen and held at −80°C, then thawed on ice before use. Bio-Mag Plus Concanavalin A (lectin) coated beads were equilibrated with HNT (20 mM HEPES pH7.5, 100 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) that was supplemented with 1 mM each MgCl<sub>2</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub> and MnCl<sub>2</sub>. Only Ca<sup>++</sup> and Mn<sup>++</sup> are needed to activate lectins, and omitting MgCl<sub>2</sub> had no effect on binding of permeabilized cells to beads. The beads (300 µL) were rapidly mixed with a thawed nuclei aliquot and held at room temperature (RT) ≥5 min, placed on a magnet stand to clear (&lt;1 min), and decanted on a magnet stand. The beads were then incubated 5 min RT in HNT supplemented with protease inhibitors (Roche Complete tablets) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (=HNT-PPi) containing 3% bovine serum albumen (BSA) and 2 mM EDTA pH 8, then incubated 5’ with HNT-PPi +0.1% BSA (blocking buffer), using the magnet stand to decant. The beads were incubated 2 hr at 4°C with mouse anti-FLAG antibody (1:200–1:350), decanted, washed once in HNT + PMSF, then incubated 1 hr at 4°C with rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200) in blocking buffer. The beads were washed once in HNT + PMSF, then incubated 1 hr at 4°C with pA-MN (600 µg/ml, 1:200) in blocking buffer. The beads were washed twice in HNT + PMSF and once in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl (Digestion buffer), optionally including 10% polyethylene glycol 8000 for Sth1 and Mot1.

After incubating at 37°C for 20 min, the beads were centrifuged 5 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C, the supernatant was removed on a magnet stand and mixed with 3 µL 10% SDS and 2 µL Proteinase K (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, Catalog #25530049), incubated at 70°C 10 min, then extracted at room temperature once with buffered phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, Sigma P2069), transferred to a phase-lock tube (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany, Catalog #129046), re-extracted with one vol CHCl<sub>3</sub>, transferred to a fresh tube containing 2 µL 2 mg/ml glycogen, precipitated by addition of 2–2.5 vol ethanol, chilled in ice and centrifuged 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4°C.

CUT&amp;RUN was performed using a centrifugation-based protocol. Ten million cells were harvested by centrifugation (600 g, 3 min in a swinging bucket rotor) and washed in ice cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Nuclei were isolated by hypotonic lysis in 1 ml NE1 (20 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9; 10 mM KCl; 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 0.1% Triton X-100; 20% Glycerol) for 5 min on ice followed by centrifugation as above. (We have found that nucleases in some cells cause Mg<sup>++</sup>-dependent degradation of DNA, in which case 0.5 mM spermidine can be substituted for 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.) Nuclei were briefly washed in 1.5 ml Buffer 1 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 2 mM EDTA; 0.5 mM Spermidine; 0.1% BSA) and then washed in 1.5 ml Buffer 2 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 0.5 mM Spermidine; 0.1% BSA). Nuclei were resuspended in 500 µl Buffer 2 and 10 µl antibody was added and incubated at 4°C for 2 hr. Nuclei were washed 3 x in 1 ml Buffer 2 to remove unbound antibody. Nuclei were resupended in 300 µl Buffer 2 and 5 µl pA-MN added and incubated at 4°C for 1 hr. Nuclei were washed 3 x in 0.5 ml Buffer 2 to remove unbound pA-MN. Tubes were placed in a metal block in ice-water and quickly mixed with 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to a final concentration of 2 mM. The reaction was quenched by the addition of EDTA and EGTA to a final concentration of 10 mM and 20 mM respectively and 1 ng of mononucleosome-sized DNA fragments from Drosophila DNA added as a spike-in. Cleaved fragments were liberated into the supernatant by incubating the nuclei at 4°C for 1 hr, and nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation as above. DNA fragments were extracted from the supernatant and used for the construction of sequencing libraries. We have also adapted this protocol for use with magnetic beads (Appendix 3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Spike-in normalization</title><p>Genome-wide background in TF ChIP-seq datasets is typically sufficiently high to provide a constant background level for normalization to compensate for variations between samples in library preparation and sequencing. For standard normalization, the number of fragment ends corresponding to each base position in the genome was divided by the total number of read ends mapped. However, the inherently low background levels of CUT&amp;RUN necessitate a spike-in control for quantitative comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). For spike-in normalization of human CUT&amp;RUN, we added a low constant amount of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> DNA to each reaction. We mapped the paired-end reads to both human and fly genomes, normalizing human profiles to the number of fly reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Using internal normalization, we observed no increase in cleavages over a digestion time-course. However, by normalizing to the fly spike-in DNA, we observed an ~4 fold increase in cleavage level over time. As such, CUT&amp;RUN is amenable to accurate quantification of protein-DNA interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Library preparation, sequencing and data processing</title><p>Sequencing libraries were prepared from DNA fragments as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henikoff et al., 2011</xref>) but without size-selection, following the KAPA DNA polymerase library preparation kit protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.kapabiosystems.com/product-applications/products/next-generation-sequencing-2/dna-library-preparation/kapa-hyper-prep-kits/">https://www.kapabiosystems.com/product-applications/products/next-generation-sequencing-2/dna-library-preparation/kapa-hyper-prep-kits/</ext-link>) and amplifying for eight or more cycles. To deplete total DNA samples of large fragments originating from insoluble chromatin, samples were mixed with ½ volume of Agencourt AMPure XP beads, held 5–10 min, placed on a magnet stand, and the supernatant was retained, discarding the beads. To reduce the representation of the remaining large fragments, the number of PCR cycles using the KAPA polymerase library preparation method was increased to 14 cycles and adapter concentrations were increased accordingly: Increasing the number of PCR cycles favors exponential amplification of shorter fragments over linear amplification of fragments that are too long for polymerase to completely transit. Libraries were sequenced for 25 cycles in paired-end mode on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Genomics Shared Resource. Paired-end fragments were mapped to the sacCer3/V64 genome and build and to release r5.51 (May 2013) of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genomic sequence obtained from FlyBase using Novoalign (Novocraft) as described to generate SAM files.

This identified 1899 Abf1 sites and 1413 Reb1 sites. Following previous studies, we use correspondence of a yeast TF binding site to the motif for that TF to be the ‘gold-standard’ for a true-positive call (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhee and Pugh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zentner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ganapathi et al., 2011</xref>). MEME was used to construct log-odds PSSMs from peaks called using the threshold method of Kasinathan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kasinathan et al., 2014</xref>). Peak-calling cut-off was the 99.5th percentile of normalized counts for pooled 1 s−32 s ≤120 bp Abf1 and Reb1 datasets, where the interpeak distance = 100, minimum peak width = 50, and maximum peak width = 1000.

A limitation/concern is that the method was used to analyze the binding of CTCF (and the centromeric histone variant CenH3). We request that the authors analyze another factor with limited binding sites in the genome such as a pioneer factor that binds to inaccessible, thus regions resistant to light MNAse treatment. Additionally, an explanation as to how the authors can tell direct from indirect cuts due to topology is necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Skene and Henikoff, the authors developed Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT &amp; RUN), a chromatin immunocleavage (ChIC) based genome-wide mapping strategy. Compared with conventional ChIP-seq, this new method results in higher resolution, lower background, and greater versatility. In this method, native nuclei were immobilized and incubated with antibody against the protein of interest, and treated with protein A-MNase fusion protein for a very short time at 4o C. DNA released from MNase digestion was subjected to deep-sequencing. The authors tested this method with transcription factors including CTCF and with centromeric histone variant CenH3, and reported data with high resolution and sensitivity. Subsequent long-range interaction mapping by this method showed near base-pair resolution. Overall, the study provided a useful option for genome-wide mapping. There are few points that need to be addressed:</p><p>1) It could be problematic to use budding yeast to study insoluble DNA-binding protein complexes. Yeast is a relatively simple model system, and more importantly, most of the yeast genome is actively transcribed, which is very different from the mammalian genome. The mammalian genome is more complex and has large regions of heterochromatin. It is not clear if those regions are accessible to the CUT &amp; RUN methodology. The authors should test the applicability of their methodology to mammalian cells. At the very least, the authors must state in the text the potential limitations of this new methodology.</p><p>2) It is unclear if the method can be used to probe chromatin states, including a variety of histone modifications. These features are very topical in the field of chromatin biology. Most current genome-wide profiling approaches can provide useful information on chromatin modifications. It would be useful for the authors to test if CUT &amp; RUN can provide data on genome-wide histone modifications. If not, the authors should discuss this deficiency.</p><p>3) In the second paragraph of the subsection CUT&amp;RUN robustly maps yeast TF binding sites in situ at high resolution”, how did the authors define &quot;true positives for both TFs&quot;?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors describe a technique for quantitative genome-wide mapping of chromatin-bound factors using antibodies and MNase in nucleo, without requiring fixation or sonication. They show efficient and accurate mapping of two yeast transcription factors at high resolution, precise mapping of the centromeric nucleosome, which is rare in abundance and trapped in an insoluble complex, and mapping of CTCF in human cells, including direct binding sites as well as indirect 3D contact points.</p><p>The technique is ingenious and the study is very well presented. I particularly want to applaud the authors for including clear and detailed supplementary protocols, which is rarely seen. If the technology worked as well as claimed and were a true alternative for ChIP-seq, I would highly recommend this manuscript for publication. However, I have a major concern about the ability of CUT&amp;RUN to distinguish direct from indirect contacts and additional worries about specificity and versatility that would need to be addressed experimentally.</p><p>A) 3D contacts: the authors present the ability of CUT&amp;RUN to identify distal indirect contacts of CTCF as an asset, but to me it appears to be a major limitation. If I understand correctly, of the ~20k sites identified by CUT&amp;RUN, only those showing native ChIP signal (~10%) are direct binding sites; the others are indirect. That would imply that native ChIP must be performed in parallel to CUT&amp;RUN to identify direct binding sites. That seem a major limitation that disqualifies the technique as a full replacement for ChIP-seq. Is this limited to CTCF or they see evidence of indirect sites also in their yeast data? Are these indirect contacts captured by conventional X-ChIP? Is there any way to distinguish direct from indirect bioinformatically or by modifications to the CUT&amp;RUN protocol?</p><p>B) Specificity: the authors show convincingly that CUT&amp;RUN is as sensitive or more sensitive than IP methods. They also show that the background noise is lower (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) than in ChIP-seq. However, this is a relatively innocuous type of background as it is uniformly low. A more important question is if CUT&amp;RUN identifies false positive peaks in accessible chromatin regions, as some of the CTCF data seems to suggest. The authors partially deal with this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, but I believe that it is crucial to address this more thoroughly. Specifically I suggest that:</p><p>B1) the authors perform CUT&amp;RUN experiments in cells lacking the targeted protein.</p><p>B2) the authors perform detailed analyses to determine false positive rates, including calling peaks for Abf1 and Reb1 and showing that the majority of the top peaks are within motifs.</p><p>B3) the authors analyze enrichment over DNaseI hypersensitive sites for all the CUT&amp;RUN experiments and compare it with enrichment in native ChIP and X-ChIP as a measure of false positive rate.</p><p>C) Versatility: to claim that CUT&amp;RUN is a &quot;suitable replacement&quot; (Abstract) or even just &quot;an attractive alternative&quot; (Discussion) to ChIP, the authors should show that it can be applied to a similarly broad array of chromatin-binding proteins. Specifically, my concern is that CUT&amp;RUN works best when the targeted protein resides in a nucleosome free region, and the three proteins targeted here belong to that category. The experiment on Cse4 helps but a more broadly distributed heterochromatic protein would be more convincing.</p><p>D) Scales: in several points it is hard to follow the comparisons because scales are omitted or vague (e.g. &quot;low&quot; to &quot;high&quot;) in genome browser snapshots and heatmaps. They must be included for all plots and the values represented fully described in the text or legends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors build on their previously developed method to dig deeper into the possibilities offered by ChIP variants to precisely map the genomic location of DNA binding proteins. The technique has the potential to be scalable and transferable and thus impactful.</p><p>As the authors point out, the preferred method to analyze genomic occupancy is ChIP-seq because of its relatively simplicity and adaptability to different proteins. Other methods that tag specific enzymes to binding sites are inherently more tedious to apply to multiple proteins because they require the construction of protein fusions. Additionally, they sometimes lack resolution or depth. However, they have the advantage of working in native conditions or even in vivo. The presented method has the advantages of ChIP-seq since it requires only an antibody to the protein of interest without the need of generating a transgenic cell lines. Thus, it can be complemented and compared directly to ChIP-seq. It also gains in resolution over conventional ChIP-seq by relying on an enzymatic digestion of the DNA under native conditions. Additionally, by releasing MNase accessible regions, the method reduced background reads. Finally, it allows the investigation of the local accessibility state. Thus, with minor controls it can be a valuable method for the large community studying how specific proteins interact with the genome.</p><p>The described robust performance across digestions time is a very positive attribute of this protocol. Other protocols that require MNase digestion are extremely sensitive to its activity and thus very hard to set up. The overlap on size distribution of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> demonstrate that fragments are of the same size but it is not conclusive for further applications in terms of identity of these fragments. If the size distribution is similar but globally these fragments map to different locations in the genome, the timing on digestion is an extremely important parameter. Although <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> attempts to map it, a global mapping and overlap quantification of the data represented for a region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> would benefit the understanding of the digestion time importance or lack of it.</p><p>The authors compare Cut&amp;Run with ORGANIC ChIP-seq, a previous generation method from their latest improved method. How does this method compare to their latest method to map TF binding at single base-pair resolution published last year?</p><p>Cut&amp;Run relies on MNase digestion. How does Cut&amp;Run perform for pioneer transcription factors that bind to inaccessible, thus resistant regions to light MNAse treatment? Thus, should be discussed and perhaps tested (see below).</p><p>Related, and in light of this comment &quot;When aligned to CTCF motifs found within DNaseI hypersensitive 245 sites, CUT&amp;RUN and X-ChIP-seq CTCF heat maps show strong concordance&quot;: How does it compare to whole genome ChIP-seq? How does the &gt;150bs run compares to an accessibility experiments? Would a MNase experiment be a better background model for peak calling? If true, then the impact of this method should be reworded.</p><p>CTCF is an atypical TFs in terms of its ability to ChIP. Few novel protocols have been established and tested with CTCF but fail when repeated with other TFs. Thus, I highly recommend to perform and report a Cut&amp;Run experiment with another TF such as homeodomain. This to me is an important and the only wet experiment the authors should perform. The rest of my comments could be addressed by re-analysis of the data.</p><p>The claim about recovering 3D interactions is weak and to me there is not enough support to include this claim in the manuscript. First, it needs the MNase background model. The MNase is not covalently bound to CTCF, thus some of the release fragments could be released at similar frequencies in both conditions, while CTCF-interacting elements will be resealed at higher frequencies. Secondly, no technique is perfect, but discussion about transient binding and its implications for the digestion of certain regions should be suggested. Finally, the most important information from 3C techniques is that they identify the binding partners. Cut&amp;Run even in the best case scenario will identify regions that could be in contact with one of the many CTCF binding sites in the genome.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21856.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The method described is interesting and compared with conventional ChIP-seq results in higher resolution, lower background, and greater versatility, where mapping of long range interaction showed near base-pair resolution.

The evidence for this is presented in the heat maps in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, where essentially all of the CUT&amp;RUN calls have ENCODE calls. However, we had failed to make this point clear in the text, and we thank reviewer 2 for pointing out this important omission. To clarify this point we have now discussed this correspondence where we describe the indirect sites (“CUT&amp;RUN maps long-range genomic contacts”). To further emphasize the fact that all X-ChIP methods capture both direct and indirect sites, we have added a heat map for our published CTCF MNase X-ChIP-seq sites, which also shows that X-ChIP-seq peaks and CUT&amp;RUN peaks correspond closely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As for our yeast data, by using the consensus motif as a gold standard to distinguish true positives from false positives, the very low level of false positive calls we see for Abf1 and Reb1 using both CUT&amp;RUN and ORGANIC argues that strong indirect sites for these TFs are rare at best.</p><p><italic>Is there any way to distinguish direct from indirect bioinformatically or by modifications to the CUT&amp;RUN protocol?</italic> </p><p>We have not found an experimental way to separate the long-range cleavages from those nearby, as they occur nearly simultaneously during the digestion time-course.</p><p><italic>B) Specificity: the authors show convincingly that CUT&amp;RUN is as sensitive or more sensitive than IP methods.

Nearly all of the proteins that we profiled in this study are essential, so this exact control is problematic at best. However, the underlying concern raised is that accessible chromatin regions might be a source of false positive peaks, and we address this issue with a rigorous negative control: In our yeast experiments we leave out the primary anti-FLAG antibody thus identically treating an aliquot of the same nuclei with IgG (rabbit anti-mouse) and pA-MN in parallel. After maximum digestion time for an experiment, we recover low levels of background cleavage fragments from throughout the genome. In this way, the cells are not disrupted, and the single negative control serves for all yeast proteins in the study. We now include representative negative control tracks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>, which show only noise. To directly address the question of background at accessible chromatin regions, we now show that our no primary antibody control gives a flat line through the nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) of yeast genes lined up over the +1 nucleosome, without a hint of any DNA accessibility preference (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> panel B). We now also make this point in the new subsection describing the new set of chromatin remodeler experiments (“CUT&amp;RUN precisely maps chromatin-associated complexes”) and the new paragraph describing the Myc and Max CUT&amp;RUN experiments (subsection “CUT&amp;RUN maps human transcription factor binding sites at high resolution”, last paragraph). For human K562 cells, a no antibody control also shows that there are no preferential cleavages over NDRs found at TF binding sites (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>B2) the authors perform detailed analyses to determine false positive rates, including calling peaks for Abf1 and Reb1 and showing that the majority of the top peaks are within motifs.</italic></p><p>We have now performed this analysis for Abf1 and Reb1. To compare CUT&amp;RUN and ORGANIC motif recovery, peak-call thresholds were adjusted to report similar numbers of peaks. We find that the majority of peaks called using a threshold algorithm have a significant motif for both CUT&amp;RUN and ORGANIC, and the relative performance is similar for both a stringent threshold (~650 peaks called) and a relaxed threshold (~1100 peaks called). By calling peaks using a simple threshold algorithm that makes no assumptions concerning peak features, and varying the threshold for high and low stringency, we believe that this performance comparison is robust. Indeed, consistent with the differences in sensitivity and specificity seen in the occupancy heat maps displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, peak-calling performance was somewhat better for CUT&amp;RUN than ORGANIC for Abf1, and vice versa for Reb1 (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref> and subsection “CUT&amp;RUN robustly maps yeast TF binding sites in situ at high resolution”).</p><p><italic>B3) the authors analyze enrichment over DNaseI hypersensitive sites for all the CUT&amp;RUN experiments and compare it with enrichment in native ChIP and X-ChIP as a measure of false positive rate.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out above, the concern about accessible DNA is addressed with our no primary antibody negative controls both for yeast and for human. As for detection of false positives that might arise for any reason, we find that a sensitive criterion is to ask whether an Abf1 peak is found at a Reb1 site and vice-versa, such as is shown graphically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and now quantified as described in response to point B2. For yeast, the true positive rate is best determined by motif analysis as described above, and this has been the gold standard, at least for yeast, where we consider sites of binding without a motif to be putative false positives.</p><p><italic>C) Versatility: to claim that CUT&amp;RUN is a &quot;suitable replacement&quot; (Abstract) or even just &quot;an attractive alternative&quot; (Discussion) to ChIP, the authors should show that it can be applied to a similarly broad array of chromatin-binding proteins. Specifically, my concern is that CUT&amp;RUN works best when the targeted protein resides in a nucleosome free region, and the three proteins targeted here belong to that category. The experiment on Cse4 helps but a more broadly distributed heterochromatic protein would be more convincing.</italic> </p><p>We agree that it is important to demonstrate versatility beyond transcription factors and nucleosomes, and we have addressed this in two ways. First, as described in response to reviewer 1, our addition of H3K27me3 shows that CUT&amp;RUN outperforms ChIP-seq for heterochromatin. Second, we now address the question of whether CUT&amp;RUN can profile dynamic components of the chromatin landscape. Myc and Max are considered to be especially dynamic TFs, and as explained below and shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, we obtain high-resolution Myc and Max CUT&amp;RUN profiles with higher dynamic range than obtained by ENCODE. ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are especially challenging for ChIP because of their mobility and large size. Despite these issues, we have found that this class of chromatin-associated proteins can be mapped precisely and efficiently by CUT&amp;RUN, described in a new subsection (“CUT&amp;RUN precisely maps chromatin-associated complexes”) and new figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Data are presented for two remodelers: Mot1, the DNA translocase that evicts TATA-binding protein (TBP) from the upstream side, and RSC, the 17-subunit ~1 megadalton complex that slides nucleosomes to create nucleosome depleted regions. We find that a slightly modified CUT&amp;RUN protocol (subsection “CUT&amp;RUN precisely maps chromatin-associated complexes”) provides results that are similar to ORGANIC profiling of these mobile components of the chromatin landscape with only ~15% of the number of paired-end reads.</p><p><italic>D) Scales: in several points it is hard to follow the comparisons because scales are omitted or vague (e.g. &quot;low&quot; to &quot;high&quot;) in genome browser snapshots and heatmaps.

Thus, with minor controls it can be a valuable method for the large community studying how specific proteins interact with the genome.</italic> </p><p>We thank reviewer 3 for these positive comments, but there appears to be a misunderstanding concerning the supposed use of our method to investigate local accessibility states. Here and below, reviewer 3 seems to be assuming that tethered MNase will have the same biases as free MNase, but our data show that this is not the case at all. This was a point that we made in describing how yeast kinetochores, the cores of which are the most AT-rich regions in the genome, remain fully intact in our Cse4 and H2A CUT&amp;RUN profiles. However, the well-known preference for cleaving AT-rich DNA (e.g. McGhee &amp; Felsenfeld, “Another potential artifact in the study of nucleosome phasing by chromatin digestion with micrococcal nuclease”, Cell 1983, PMID: 6301684) has led to the understandable assumption that tethered MNase would have the same DNA accessibility artifact. In stark contrast to this expectation, our study shows that CUT&amp;RUN has remarkably little bias either for or against accessible or inaccessible regions genome-wide. We now demonstrate this fact more directly by showing that our No Antibody negative controls show no difference between NDRs and flanking nucleosomes for both yeast (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and human (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, our new H3K27me3 CUT&amp;RUN profiling data also indicate that local accessibility is not a factor when the MNase is tethered. This is in contrast to freely diffusing MNase, which has such a strong preference for linker DNA that it has been used for 40 years to define linker accessibility (e.g. Reeves &amp; Jones, Science 1976, PMID:1264202). As targeting MNase is the key feature that distinguishes CUT&amp;RUN from Native ChIP-seq, MNase-seq, DNAse-seq, ATAC-seq and other popular nuclease-based methods we have modified the title to better emphasize that the MNase is <italic>targeted</italic>.</p><p><italic>The described robust performance across digestions time is a very positive attribute of this protocol.

Thus, should be discussed and perhaps tested (see below).</italic> </p><p>Applying CUT&amp;RUN to a designated pioneer transcription factor is not a suitable way to test whether tethered MNase can “break through” inaccessible chromatin for at least three reasons: 1) By definition the pioneer factors open chromatin when they bind, and so any site that is bound by a pioneer factor when the antibody is added to the nuclei is already opened up. 2) Using ChIP-seq, CTCF binding was shown to inhibit binding of the classical pioneer factor, FoxA1 (PMID: 21151129); this finding implies that CTCF is more penetrant than pioneer factors in breaking through inaccessible chromatin. 3) In the December 1, 2016 issue of Cell, CTCF binding sites were shown to be directly centered over sites of nucleosome occupancy mapped using chemical cleavage, and the authors went on to argue that CTCF is itself a pioneer factor (PMID:27889238).</p><p>To address the question of whether CUT&amp;RUN applies to inaccessible regions, we profiled heterochromatin that is marked with H3K27me3. As described in response to reviewer 1, we find that CUT&amp;RUN provides excellent profiles of H3K27me3 that correspond closely to H3K27me3 ChIP but with better dynamic range for the same number of reads (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), definitively excluding the possibility that such regions are inaccessible to tethered MNase.</p><p><italic>Related, and in light of this comment &quot;When aligned to CTCF motifs found within DNaseI hypersensitive 245 sites, CUT&amp;RUN and X-ChIP-seq CTCF heat maps show strong concordance&quot;: How does it compare to whole genome ChIP-seq?</italic> </p><p>We now present a direct comparison between CUT&amp;RUN and ENCODE ChIP-seq at all previously identified ENCODE CTCF peaks (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>How does the &gt;150bs run compares to an accessibility experiments?</italic> </p><p>This question seems to arise from the misunderstanding concerning targeted versus free MNase referred to above. That is, CUT&amp;RUN does not provide accessibility measurements. Being tethered, MNase specifically releases neighboring nucleosomes. In contrast, MNase-seq gives DNA accessibility, TF occupancy and nucleosome positions in a single experiment. To illustrate this distinction, we now compare CUT&amp;RUN size fractions to MNase-seq data at Abf1 and Reb1 sites (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> top and bottom rows of panels). In the bottom panels, we show MNase-seq heat maps over an 8-fold digestion range, where it can be seen that the dynamic range of ≤120-bp and ≥150-bp CUT&amp;RUN signals is much higher than for our previously published MNase-seq signals for both low and high levels of MNase-seq digestion.</p><p><italic>Would a MNase experiment be a better background model for peak calling? If true, then the impact of this method should be reworded.</italic> </p><p>No. This question seems to assume that tethered MNase should be cleaving preferentially within accessible regions, whereas in our no-antibody controls, we show that there is no such preference. Again, perhaps what has been confusing is the fact that <italic>free</italic> MNase has a strong AT-rich cleavage bias, but from the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we see that there is no CUT&amp;RUN digestion of AT-rich yeast centromeres. Therefore, an MNase-seq background would actually <italic>introduce</italic> an AT-bias into CUT&amp;RUN profiles where no such bias exists. Also, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, the dynamic range of MNase-seq is much lower than that of CUT&amp;RUN, and so using MNase-seq as background would have little effect on peak calling.</p><p><italic>CTCF is an atypical TFs in terms of its ability to ChIP. Few novel protocols have been established and tested with CTCF but fail when repeated with other TFs. Thus, I highly recommend to perform and report a Cut&amp;Run experiment with another TF such as homeodomain. This to me is an important and the only wet experiment the authors should perform. The rest of my comments could be addressed by re-analysis of the data.</italic> </p><p>To address this concern, we have now added CUT&amp;RUN data for c-Myc and Max transcription factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) which have very different properties from those of CTCF, Abf1 or Reb1. Homeodomain proteins are especially sequence non-specific, and so we would not have a gold standard that would allow us to compare performance of CUT&amp;RUN to standard ChIP-seq. Rather, we chose Myc and Max because unlike most other mammalian TFs, Max is the obligate dimerization partner of Myc and therefore, all bona fide Myc sites should have Max occupancy. Based on this rigorous criterion, we find that CUT&amp;RUN performs much better than ENCODE ChIP-seq for Myc and Max in K562 cells (subsection “Low background levels reduce sequencing costs”).</p><p><italic>The claim about recovering 3D interactions is weak and to me there is not enough support to include this claim in the manuscript. First, it needs the MNase background model. The MNase is not covalently bound to CTCF, thus some of the release fragments could be released at similar frequencies in both conditions, while CTCF-interacting elements will be resealed at higher frequencies. Secondly, no technique is perfect, but discussion about transient binding and its implications for the digestion of certain regions should be suggested. Finally, the most important information from 3C techniques is that they identify the binding partners. Cut&amp;Run even in the best case scenario will identify regions that could be in contact with one of the many CTCF binding sites in the genome.</italic> </p><p>There is no question about the reality of the two classes of sites, as &gt;90% of all high-scoring CTCF ChIA-PET sites have high-scoring CUT&amp;RUN sites. This correspondence to 3D interaction maps was an unexpected discovery that can explain the nature of the sites that are not seen using Native ChIP, but are also seen using X-ChIP (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Regardless of what exact mechanism is responsible, or what potential utility these sites might have in characterizing 3D interactions, the high-resolution profiling of contact sites is a feature inherent to our data that potential users of the method need to be made aware of. Further work beyond the scope of this study will be required to decide whether or not this aspect of CUT&amp;RUN will have practical utility.</p></body></sub-article></article>
