Red cell transfusion therapy for anemia in MDS results in iron overload, correlating with reduced overall survival. Whether the treatment of iron overload benefits MDS patients remains controversial. We evaluate underlying iron-related pathophysiology and the effect of iron chelation using deferiprone on erythropoiesis in NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic mice, a highly penetrant well-established MDS mouse model. Our results characterize an iron overload phenotype with aberrant erythropoiesis in these mice which was reversed by deferiprone-treatment. Serum erythropoietin levels decreased while erythroblast erythropoietin receptor expression increased in deferiprone-treated MDS mice. We demonstrate, for the first time, normalized expression of the iron chaperones <italic>Pcbp1</italic> and <italic>Ncoa4</italic> and increased ferritin stores in late-stage erythroblasts from deferiprone-treated MDS mice, evidence of aberrant iron trafficking in MDS erythroblasts. Importantly, erythroblast ferritin is increased in response to deferiprone, correlating with decreased erythroblast ROS. Finally, we confirmed increased expression of genes involved in iron uptake, sensing, and trafficking in stem and progenitor cells from MDS patients. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that erythroblast-specific iron metabolism is a novel potential therapeutic target to reverse ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>myelodysplastic dyndrome</kwd><kwd>deferiprone</kwd><kwd>ineffective erythropoiesis</kwd><kwd>iron trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100020218</institution-id><institution>Chiesi USA</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ApoPharma Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ginzburg</surname><given-names>Yelena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dysregulated erythroblast-specific iron trafficking and regulation of iron metabolism provides evidence of a novel potential therapeutic target to reverse ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>MDS is a heterogeneous group of bone marrow stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis leading to blood cytopenias and increased incidence of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haferlach, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janssen et al., 1989</xref>). In the United States, MDS affects approximately 100,000 people with a median age of 65 years at diagnosis and an incidence of 40/100,000 per year thereafter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rollison et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). Most MDS patients suffer from the accumulating consequences of marrow failure compounded by other age-related diseases. Several categories of MDS patients are low-risk subtypes according to the revised International Prognostic Scoring System and have a longer median survival with the lowest rate of progression to AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arber et al., 2016</xref>). Low-risk MDS patients account for approximately two-thirds of all MDS patients with 30–50% requiring regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dayyani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kröger, 2019</xref>). The main goals of therapy in low-risk MDS patients are to alleviate cytopenias and their associated symptoms and thereby improve quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hellström-Lindberg, 2005</xref>). RBC transfusions remain the mainstay of therapy in low-risk MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oliva et al., 2010</xref>) and are the main source of progressive iron overload and consequent end-organ damage in transfusion-dependent patients. Because of the low rates of progression to AML in low-risk MDS patients, these patients have a substantial life expectancy and theoretically warrant screening for transfusional iron overload, known to increase morbidity and mortality in chronic RBC transfusion-dependent anemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schafer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greenberg et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, although it is generally accepted that transfusional iron overload develops in low-risk transfusion-dependent MDS patients and methods to diagnose and treat iron overload are available, the risk-benefit ratio of treating iron overload in MDS patients remains controversial.</p><p>A correlation between iron overload and reduced survival has been demonstrated mostly by retrospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Malcovati et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Malcovati et al., 2011</xref>). RBC transfusion-dependence correlates strongly with decreased survival in MDS patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia-Manero et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Malcovati et al., 2005</xref>), and MDS patients with elevated serum ferritin have significantly fewer Burst Forming Units (BFU-Es) but normal Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Forming Units (CFU-GM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartmann et al., 2013</xref>). Iron overload has been shown to inhibit BFU-E colony formation and erythroblast differentiation in both murine and human hematopoietic progenitors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taoka et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, cells exposed to excess iron exhibit dysplastic changes with increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taoka et al., 2012</xref>), and the addition of iron to MDS patients’ peripheral blood mononuclear cells resulted in increased ROS and DNA damage, triggering apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fibach and Rachmilewitz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pan et al., 1999</xref>). These data suggest that iron overload may lead to a deleterious effect on hematopoiesis, worsening disease in MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camaschella et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Along these lines, more recent studies demonstrate the potential benefit of iron chelation therapy on the overall survival in low-risk MDS patients. Iron chelation is associated with improved hemoglobin (Hb) and reduced RBC transfusion requirements in some patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oliva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badawi et al., 2010</xref>). Most recently, the TELESTO trial demonstrated prolonged event-free survival in iron overloaded lower risk MDS patients treated with iron chelation (i.e. deferasirox) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelucci et al., 2020</xref>). However, no clear improvement in Hb or reduction in RBC transfusions and no effect on overall survival was observed in deferasirox-treated MDS patients. We anticipate that the lack of effect of deferasirox on erythropoiesis is a consequence of the specific iron chelator selected. Alternatively, unlike other commercially available iron chelators, deferiprone (DFP) has a lower iron binding affinity relative to transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sohn et al., 2008</xref>). As a consequence, the DFP iron chelating effect enables iron transfer from parenchymal cells to increase transferrin saturation which results in increase hepcidin expression in the liver in response to systemic iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casu et al., 2016</xref>). The physiologic effect of increased hepcidin responsiveness in turn prevents further iron absorption and recycling, decreasing iron availability for erythropoiesis. On the foundation of this knowledge, we hypothesize that in addition to decreasing the progression of systemic iron overload, DFP could also ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS. A direct beneficial effect of DFP on erythropoiesis in MDS has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>Here, we evaluate the effect of iron chelation on erythropoiesis in NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic (NHD13) mice as a well-established in vivo model of MDS. We use NHD13 mice because they replicate alterations in gene expression identified in MDS patients and are the most commonly used transgenic mouse models of MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). More specifically, NHD13 mice are characterized by abortive erythroblast maturation and consequent ineffective erythropoiesis and are, therefore, of target interest in our search for a mechanistic understanding of ineffective erythropoiesis to target its amelioration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Slape et al., 2008</xref>). Lastly, NHD13 mice have been successfully used in pre-clinical studies to investigate the effects of an activin receptor II ligand trap on reversing ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suragani et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results demonstrate that NHD13 mice exhibits anemia, increased serum erythropoietin (EPO), expanded erythropoiesis in the bone marrow and spleen, and parenchymal iron overload, consistent with a low-risk MDS phenotype in patients. In addition, we demonstrate decreased EPO-responsiveness, decreased erythroblast differentiation, and impaired enucleation in bone marrow erythroblasts from MDS mice. Furthermore, iron chelation with DFP, in addition to decreasing parenchymal iron deposition, restores hepdicin:iron responsiveness, partially reverses anemia, and normalizes serum EPO concentration in MDS mice. DFP-treated MDS mice also exhibit normalized erythroblast differentiation, expression of <italic>Gata1</italic> and <italic>Epor</italic> (EPO receptor) as well as that of iron chaperones <italic>Pcbp1</italic> and <italic>Ncoa4</italic>, and increased erythroblast ferritin concentration in bone marrow erythroblasts. Finally, we demonstrate aberrant expression of genes involved in iron uptake, sensing, and trafficking in MDS patient bone marrow stem and progenitor cells. Taken together, our data for the first time provides in vivo evidence that ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS mice is responsive to iron chelation with DFP, normalizing erythroblast iron trafficking and restoring EPO responsiveness to reverse anemia in MDS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MDS mice exhibit elevated mcv anemia with expanded erythropoiesis and iron overload, appropriate as a model of low-risk MDS</title><p>To establish the expected MDS phenotype, mice were sacrificed at 6 months of age and demonstrate significantly reduced RBC counts and Hb concentration, increased MCV, and no difference in reticulocyte count relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Furthermore, how iron regulates erythropoiesis is incompletely understood and next to nothing is known about whether and how dysregulated iron metabolism contributes to the pathophysiology of ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS. The well-known, timely, abundant, and coordinated delivery of sufficient iron to erythroid precursors is accomplished via TFR1 to enable Hb production. TFR1 is both regulated by iron and enhanced by EPO-mediated signaling, evidence of the iron dependency in erythropoiesis. Furthermore, prior studies demonstrate that iron delivery to ferritin is absolutely required for normal erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ryu et al., 2017</xref>) and cytosolic chaperones PCBP1 and PCBP2 were recently identified as central to ferritin iron delivery in erythroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leidgens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ryu et al., 2017</xref>).

Taken together, the movement of iron within erythroblasts is a complex multi-step process to handle a redox-active compound that is also required for the central task of erythropoiesis, i.e., Hb synthesis.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that iron trafficking is abnormal in MDS erythroblasts and restored in response to DFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Specifically, increased TFR1 in MDS erythroblasts is expected to deliver more iron to erythroblast ferritin stores via increased PCBPs; more NCOA4 is expected to extract more iron from ferritin and more TFR2 to deliver more iron to mitochondria for Hb synthesis. Increased iron uptake by erythroblasts leads to a relatively normal amount of iron in the circulation despite systemic and parenchymal iron overload in MDS mice. Interestingly, erythroblast ferritin does not increase in MDS relative to WT mice; we speculate that this results from increased NCOA4-mediated iron release from ferritin and leads to an increase in iron’s redox activity and higher erythroblast ROS. Our findings suggest that, although regulation of late-stage erythropoiesis remains incompletely understood, redox-active iron accumulation may lead to a feedback downregulation in iron trafficking genes during erythroblast differentiation, consequently resulting in ineffective erythropoiesis.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Putative function of erythroblast iron trafficking in health and in MDS before and after DFP treatment.</title><p>Erythroblast iron uptake is mediated by TFR1 via endocytosis of clathrin-coated pits. In addition, erythroblast ferritin iron delivery is an obligatory step in erythropoiesis, and chaperones, i.e., PCBP1 and PCBP2, deliver iron to ferritin while NCOA4 enable iron extraction from ferritin, leading to iron utilization for hemoglobin synthesis in the mitochondria (<bold>A</bold>). In conditions of expanded erythropoiesis, such as MDS (<bold>B</bold>), more TFR1 results in increased iron uptake, resulting in decreased PCBP1 and NCOA4; yet no change in ferritin storage.

Patient samples correlate with early-stage erythroblasts in MDS mice in which <italic>Tfrc</italic>, <italic>Epor</italic>, TFR2, and NCOA4 expression is increased, providing validation that altered iron trafficking is a relevant pathophysiological component in MDS patients. In further support, AML patients for example exhibit increased bone marrow TFR2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Veneri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kollia et al., 2003</xref>), and expression in blasts correlates with serum ferritin and overall prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nakamaki et al., 2004</xref>). Based on these findings, we propose that targeting iron trafficking in erythroblasts may be a viable therapeutic strategy in iron-loading anemias, increasing erythroblast ferritin iron sequestration to protect later-stage erythropoiesis from redox-active effects of more labile forms of iron. For example, while NCOA4 is fundamental for iron supply during erythropoiesis, when iron is abundant, such as in MDS, other compensatory mechanisms are activated to prevent anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nai et al., 2021</xref>), providing a rationale for targeting NCOA4 suppression to reverse ineffective erythropoiesis.</p><p>Lastly, although clearly, increased ROS levels result in cellular damage, emerging evidence suggests that ROS is required for normal hematopoiesis, influencing stem cell migration, differentiation, cell cycle status, and self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ludin et al., 2014</xref>) such that hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal potential is associated with low ROS states while high ROS states are associated with differentiating hematopoietic stem cells. Further increased ROS leads to senescence and decreased ROS restores differentiation in those conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ludin et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, ROS can activate JAK/STAT pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tibaldi et al., 2020</xref>) and, therefore, EPO-EPOR mediated cell growth and survival. Recent evidence indicates that EPO and iron are required for ROS generation in erythroblasts, and that ROS are necessary for terminal erythropoiesis [44] while unchecked ROS accumulation results in anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hebbel, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neumann et al., 2003</xref>). Taken together, ROS generation is both critical and potentially toxic, requiring significant coordination during erythropoiesis with particular importance for mitigating increased ROS in conditions of ineffective erythropoiesis as in MDS. However, whether increased ROS resulting in apoptosis as the cause of ineffective erythropoiesis has never been definitely confirmed. We and others previously demonstrated that EPO downstream mechanisms are potent anti-apoptotic compensatory mechanisms and that reversal of apoptosis does not ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis in β-thalassemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feola et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Menon et al., 2022</xref>). Our current results demonstrate borderline increased erythroblast apoptosis while ROS is significantly enhanced in MDS mice and no change in apoptosis while ROS is significantly decreased in DFP-treated MDS mice. These results uncouple apoptosis from ROS as the underlying cause of ineffective erythropoiesis.</p><p>In conclusion, despite FDA approval of iron chelators for use in iron-overloaded MDS patients, they remain underutilized due to a lack of biological insights into the deleterious effects of iron overload on disease pathophysiology in MDS. Our results demonstrate that DFP partially ameliorates ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS mice not only by reducing systemic iron overload, but also by altering iron trafficking within erythroblast and the sensitivity of erythroblasts to EPO, enhancing erythroblast differentiation. We further identify similar alterations in iron trafficking genes also in MDS patient bone marrow samples, validating our findings in MDS mice and anticipating a potential for translating these results. An important caveat to consider is whether a mouse model of transfusion-independent MDS such as NHD13 mice applies also to transfusion-dependent patients. The main focus of the current work is to evaluate the effect of DFP on ineffective erythropoiesis. As a consequence, using transfused NHD13 mice is impossible as transfusion itself suppresses the very ineffective erythropoiesis we aim to study.</p><p>In addition, with an eye toward its translation, the use of DFP has been associated with the occurrence of severe neutropenia/agranulocytosis defined as an absolute neutrophil count below 0.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L. A recent report from the US safety registry of DFP indicates a potentially higher incidence of agranulocytosis in 115 patients with MDS, all resolved with dose interruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeidan et al., 2022</xref>). The report concludes that the safety profile of DFP in MDS is potentially consistent with that of other iron-loading anemias with no new safety concerns or unexpected adverse events. However, it remains to be determined whether agranulocytosis occurs at a higher frequency than with other iron chelating agents in MDS, is a specific consequence unique to the patients’ primary disease, or resulted from the relatively small sample size in this registry. Thus, although additional evidence is needed to ascertain the mechanism(s) and clinical relevance of DFP-induced agranulocytosis in MDS patients in anticipation of its translation, no change in white blood cell count was observed in mice and potential benefits may ultimately be found to outweigh the risks. Taken together, the main purpose of the current study is to provide a rationale for targeting erythroblast-specific iron sensing and trafficking to ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS either with already available (e.g. DFP) or novel therapies currently in development for diseases of ineffective erythropoiesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and treatment</title><p>C57BL/6 (WT) and C57BL/6-Tg(Vav1-NUP98/HOXD13)G2Apla/J (NHD13) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2005</xref>) were originally purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA).

As a consequence, we used age and gender-matched 5-month-old mice, at least five mice per group, treated with deferiprone (DFP; trade name Ferriprox; chemical name 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one) at a concentration of 1.25 mg/mL in the drinking water for 4 weeks. DFP is an orally active iron chelator that binds iron in a 3:1 (DFP:iron) complex and undergoes renal clearance. Mice were euthanized for analysis at 6 months of age, as mice were analyzed previously to study the effects of ineffective erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suragani et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, all endpoints of interest were analyzed to compare DFP-treated MDS mice after 1 month of treatment with untreated MDS mice and WT controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Peripheral blood analyses</title><p>Mice peripheral blood cell counting was analyzed by ProCyte Dx Hematology Analyzer. Serum mouse EPO (Quantikine, R&amp;D Systems) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Integra 800 Automated Clinical Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) was used to measure serum iron to transferrin iron-binding capacity (TIBC); serum transferrin saturation was measured as a ratio of serum iron to TIBC. Serum DFP and its metabolite DFP-glucuronide (DFP-G) concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, validated in accordance with the FDA Bioanalytical Method Validation Guidance. The lower limit of quantifiable values for the method was 0.10 µM for DFP and 0.050 µM for DFP-Glu in mouse serum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemical staining was performed using anti-TER119 antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Briefly, specimens were digested overnight in an acid solution at 65 °C. A mixture of chromogen solution with acid extraction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm by spectrophotometer (CLARIOstar plate reader, BMG Labtech).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>We prepared RNA from sorted bone marrow and liver samples using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Twenty mg of heat–denatured protein was loaded onto a 10% gel, run, and transferred onto a 0.4 mm nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Scientific). After blocking with 5% BSA in Tris–buffered saline with 1% Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies to signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>) overnight at 4 °C, washed, and incubated with the corresponding HRP–conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature. Proteins were visualized using the ImageQuant LAS 4010 and quantified using Image J.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometric analysis and sorting</title><p>Bone marrow cells were processed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2013</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, the cells were mechanically dissociated, blocked with rat anti–mouse CD16/CD32 (Fcγ III/II Receptor), incubated with anti-CD45 magnetic beads (Mylteni), and underwent magnetic separation using LS columns according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Miltenyi Biotec). Erythroid lineage-enriched CD45 negative cells were collected for further staining. Non-erythroid and necrotic cells were excluded using anti-CD45 (BD Pharmigen), anti-CD11b, and anti-Gr1 (APC-Cy7) (Tonbo, Biosciences) antibodies. Cells were incubated with anti-mouse TER119 PE-Cy7 (BioLegend) and CD44-APC (Tonbo, Biosciences) to identify and delineate progressive stages of erythroblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). Once erythroblasts were delineated by TER119, CD44, and forward scatter, CD71-PE (BioLegend) was used to evaluate changes in erythroblast membrane TFR1. ROS quantification in erythroblasts was performed using immunostaining for ROS (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. To evaluate apoptosis, cells were stained for activated caspase 3/7 kit (Invitrogen); 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD, BD Pharmingen) was added to exclude dead cells. Cells were analyzed within 1 hr of staining using BD FACSDiva Version 6.1.2 software on a FACSCanto flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). The gating strategy was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Erythroid differentiation was quantified by analyzing the fraction of each stage of terminal erythropoiesis relative to all erythroblasts in each bone marrow sample. In addition, to individually evaluate gene expression in erythroblasts at different maturation stages, bone marrow cells underwent sorting on a BD FACSAria III (BD Biosciences). Finally, enucleation was assessed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An and Chen, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene expression in MDS patient database</title><p>Gene expression data from 183 MDS CD34 + samples and 17 controls were obtained from GEO (GSE19429) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pellagatti et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data are reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Yongliang Yang as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Caigang Liu as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide solid evidence and elaborate on the choice of mouse model. The NUP98-HOXD13 mouse model of MDS recapitulates spontaneous (non-transfusion related) iron overload seen in some subtypes of MDS.</p><p>2) The authors should clarify the rationale for the choice of deferiprone as the iron chelator.</p><p>3) There are also substantial technical concerns and some aspects that need to be updated to current standards.</p><p>4) It would be important to present representative gating from all 3 animal groups: WT, MDS, and MDS+DFP mice.</p><p>5) In the Statistical analysis section, the authors state that all comparisons were done with 2-tailed student paired t test, which would not be appropriate for comparisons being made between independent animals groups.</p><p>6) All the referees raised concerns about Figure 10.

The authors should elaborate in a separate paragraph in the Discussion section to justify their choice of NUP98-HOXD13 mice as representative of low-risk MDS for their experiments. In particular, the authors should carefully explain and comment such that the reader could understand the appropriateness and preclinical potential of NUP98-HOXD13 mice model for the study of low-risk MDS.

The rationale for the choice of deferiprone as the iron chelator is weak, since most of the clinical data were reported with deferasirox. It would be better to do an initial comparison of the two agents to document if they affect anemia and ineffective erythropoiesis differentially (along the lines of Figure 2 and 3E). This would put the DFP data in the paper in a more appropriate context.</p><p>2. The graph style needs to be updated to change bar graphs to scatterplots with error bars.

We use NUP98-HOXD13 transgenic (NHD13) mice for several reasons: (1) NHD13 mice were generated by transgenic expression of the NUP98/ HOXD13 fusion protein found in human MDS and acute myeloid leukemia, making them mechanistically meaningful as a model of MDS.

(3) NHD13 mice were successfully used in pre-clinical investigation of an activin receptor II ligand trap, reversing ineffective erythropoiesis, work that provided valuable pre-clinical proof-of-principle, leading to successful clinical trials and now FDA approval of this agent for MDS patients.

We are, however, not looking to demonstrate DFP-mediated reversal of systemic iron overload at all; we show the expected effects of DFP on reversal of systemic iron overload only as validation, using this known effect as an expected outcome (Figure 1). The main focus of the current work is on the effects of DFP on ineffective erythropoiesis. As a consequence, we cannot use transfused NHD13 mice as transfusion itself effectively suppresses ineffective erythropoiesis, preventing its evaluation in response to DFP.</p><p>Toward addressing this comment, we have expanded our description of these mice in the Introduction and added text to the Discussion regarding the use of this mouse model in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should clarify the rationale for the choice of deferiprone as the iron chelator.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the editor and reviewers for this request for clarification. The rationale for choosing DFP as the iron chelator for these studies involves several known elements: 1) DFP has a lower iron binding affinity relative to transferrin (Sohn et al., 2008); 2) DFP results in iron transfer from parenchymal cells to increase serum iron, transferrin saturation, and hepcidin responsiveness to iron (Figure 1); and 3) increased hepcidin responsiveness prevents further iron absorption and recycling (Schmidt et al., 2015; Casu et al., 2016). On the foundation of this knowledge, we hypothesize that in addition to decreasing progression of systemic iron overload, DFP could also ameliorate ineffective erythropoiesis in MDS. We anticipate that the specific mechanism is reliant on the ability of DFP to donate iron to transferrin, altering the balance between different transferrin moieties in circulation, resulting in altered iron trafficking within erythroblasts and enhancing erythroblast differentiation.</p><p>To clarify our rationale for choosing DFP, we have expanded this part of the Introduction in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are also substantial technical concerns and some aspects that need to be updated to current standards.</p></disp-quote><p>We anticipate that this general comment is in reference to the specific technical elements raised by Reviewer #2.

A recent report from the US safety registry of DFP indicates a potentially higher incidence of agranulocytosis in 115 patients with MDS, all resolved with dose interruption (Zeidan et al., 2022). The report concludes that the safety profile of DFP in MDS is potentially consistent with that of other iron-loading anemias with no new safety concerns or unexpected adverse events. However, it remains to be determined whether agranulocytosis occurs at higher frequency than with other iron chelating agents in MDS, is a specific consequence unique to the patients’ primary disease, or resulted from the relatively small sample size in this registry. Thus, although additional evidence is needed to ascertain the mechanism(s) and clinical relevance of DFP-induced agranulocytosis in MDS patients in anticipation of its translation, no change in white blood cell count was observed in mice and potential benefits may ultimately be found to outweigh the risks. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
