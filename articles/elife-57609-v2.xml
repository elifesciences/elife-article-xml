As the community develops, cells can present specialization of function, which allows the community as a whole to perform various tasks including the acquisition of food, defense against competing microorganisms, or more efficient growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Newman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niklas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). This division of labor allows breakdown of complex biological processes into simpler steps, eliminating the need for individual cells to perform several tasks simultaneously, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency with which cells in the community function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rueffler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Gestel et al., 2015</xref>). Due to these advantages, division of labor is widely prevalent across diverse microbial communities and can be found at different levels of biological organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gordon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kirk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tarnita et al., 2013</xref>). However, the underlying rules that enable division of labor within cell populations remain to be deciphered.</p><p>In particular, microbial community development is commonly triggered by nutrient limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoehler and JÃ¸rgensen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). Clearly, an optimal allocation of resources is critical for maximizing overall fitness within a microbial community, especially when the availability of nutrients is limiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Litchman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wessely et al., 2011</xref>). One strategy by which the community can manage the requirement of different resources is by sharing metabolic products, and this is employed by many microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Since resources can often be insufficient, the sharing of such resources might incur a cost to the cell. Hence, different cells of the community exhibit metabolic interdependencies, presumably to balance out trade-offs arising from resource sharing. While this concept has been demonstrated for example, in synthetically engineered systems, where required metabolic dependencies are created between non-isogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>), this has been exceptionally challenging to demonstrate within a clonal community of cells. We recently discovered that metabolic constraints are sufficient to enable the emergence and maintenance of cells in specialized biochemical states within a clonal <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). Remarkably, this occurs through a simple, self-organized biochemical system. In yeast growing in low glucose, cells are predominantly gluconeogenic. As the colony matures, groups of cells exhibiting glycolytic metabolism emerge with spatial organization. Strikingly, this occurs through the production (via gluconeogenesis) and accumulation of a limiting metabolic resource, trehalose. As this resource builds up, some cells spontaneously switch to utilizing trehalose for carbon, which then drives a glycolytic state. This also depletes the resource, and therefore a self-organized system of trehalose producers and utilizers establish themselves, enabling structured phenotypic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>This observation raises a deeper question, of how such groups of heterogeneous cells can sustain themselves in this self-organized biochemical system. In particular, is it sufficient to only have the build-up of this limiting, controlling resource? How are carbon and nitrogen requirements balanced within the cells in the heterogeneous states? In this study, we uncover how a non-limiting resource with plasticity in function can control the organization of this entire system. We find that the amino acid aspartate, through distinct use of its carbon or nitrogen backbone, enables the emergence and organization of heterogeneous cells. In gluconeogenic cells, aspartate is utilized in order to produce the limiting carbon resource, trehalose, which in turn is utilized by other cells that switch to and stabilize in a glycolytic state. Combining biochemical, computational modeling and analytical approaches, we find that aspartate is differentially utilized by the oppositely specialized cells of the community as a carbon or a nitrogen source to sustain different metabolism. This carbon/nitrogen budgeting of aspartate is crucial for the emergence of distinct cell states in this isogenic community. Through this, cell groups show complete division of labor, and each specialized state provides distinct proliferation and survival advantages to the colony. Collectively, we show how the carbon/nitrogen economy of a cell community enables a self-organizing system based on non-limiting and limiting resources, and this allows organized phenotypic heterogeneity in cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amino acid driven gluconeogenesis is critical for emergence of metabolic heterogeneity</title><p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>), we discovered that trehalose controls the emergence of spatially organized, metabolically heterogeneous groups of cells within a <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> colony growing in low glucose. Within this colony were cells with high gluconeogenic activity, and other cells showing high glycolytic/pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The high glycolytic/PPP activity cells could be distinguished as âlightâ cells, and the highly gluconeogenic cells as âdarkâ, based purely on optical density as observed by brightfield microscopy, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). In this system, cells start in a gluconeogenic state, and these cells (dark) produce trehalose. When a threshold concentration of external trehalose is reached, a subpopulation of cells switch to trehalose consumption that drives a glycolytic state, and these cells continue to proliferate as light cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Trehalose is a limiting resource since it is not freely available in the glucose limited external environment, and must be synthesized via gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">FranÃ§ois et al., 1991</xref>). We therefore first asked how the loss of gluconeogenesis affects the emergence of metabolically specialized light cells. For this, we genetically generated mutants that lack two key gluconeogenic enzymes (PCK1 and FBP1). These gluconeogenic mutants (<italic>Îpck1</italic> and <italic>Îfbp1</italic>) expectedly formed smooth colonies completely lacking structured morphology (which correlates with the absence of metabolic heterogeneity;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Further, these mutants had essentially undetectable cells with high PPP activity (light cells), based on the fluorescence-signal of a PPP reporter, as compared to a wild-type colony, although the total number of viable cells in all the colonies were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

This two-state community of cells requires a continuous supply of trehalose to sustain itself. Therefore, in order to address how dark cells maintained threshold concentrations of trehalose, we asked how this resource itself is produced. Notably, the media conditions under which these colonies develop essentially have non-limiting amounts of amino acid resources (2% yeast extract and 2% peptone). We therefore hypothesized that amino acids (available in non-limiting levels) could act as carbon sources (via possible anaplerotic processes) to fuel trehalose production in dark cells. We tested this by growing wild-type cells in media devoid of free amino acids, but with sufficient ammonium sulfate (Minimal medium). Wild-type colonies failed to develop structured colonies (which correlates with the lack of metabolic heterogeneity) in the absence of free amino acids, and this could be rescued by adding back amino acids to this media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Expectedly, this amino acid dependent rescue of colony morphology depended on gluconeogenesis, since a <italic>Îpck1</italic> strain failed to develop morphology even after the addition of amino acids to the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This shows that non-limiting amino acids promote the development of structured colonies exhibiting metabolic heterogeneity, in a gluconeogenesis dependent manner. Interestingly this amino acid dependent effect is specific. In add-back experiments in minimal medium, amongst all amino acids tested, aspartate supplementation strongly promoted the development of structured colonies exhibiting metabolic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This ârescueâ by aspartate was stronger than that seen with the addition of any other amino acids individually or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). This was further validated via experiments wherein wild-type colonies that developed in minimal medium, supplemented either with all amino acids, or only aspartate alone, exhibited spatially restricted metabolic heterogeneity comparable to the wild-type colonies grown in rich media. The light cell population was estimated using the fluorescent PPP reporter, which serves as an excellent proxy for light cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Collectively, these results reveal that aspartate is sufficient for the development of metabolically specialized colonies in a gluconeogenesis-dependent manner. The addition of other amino acids (particularly glutamine/glutamate) only show a delayed, weaker emergence of light cells. This would be consistent with their eventual, steady conversion to aspartate, which will not result in a build-up of excess amounts of this amino acid.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aspartate promotes light cell emergence by directly fueling trehalose synthesis</title><p>In contrast to their canonical roles as nitrogen sources, amino acids can also act as carbon donors for several metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyle, 2005</xref>). While many amino acids can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle <italic>via</italic> anaplerosis, and TCA intermediates in turn can enter gluconeogenesis, aspartate is unique. It is the only amino acid that can directly enter gluconeogenesis, without entering into the TCA cycle. This is via the conversion of aspartate into oxaloacetate directly in the cytosol through the activity of aspartate transaminase. In this cytosolic process, aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate combine to give one molecule each of oxaloacetate and glutamate. All the other amino acids have to be first transported to the mitochondria and enter the TCA cycle, and these TCA intermediates must then be transported back to the cytosol to enter gluconeogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brunengraber and Roe, 2006</xref>). Since the addition of aspartate alone to minimal media was sufficient for light cells to emerge, we tested if aspartate is a direct carbon source required for trehalose production within the colony, since trehalose is a pre-requisite for light cell emergence. Wild-type colonies were grown in minimal media supplemented with all amino acids, or aspartate alone, or all amino acids without aspartate (aspartate dropout) and total trehalose levels in the 7 day old colonies were measured. As controls, trehalose levels in the <italic>Îpck1</italic> colonies (gluconeogenesis defective) and <italic>Îtps1</italic> colonies (trehalose synthesis defective) were measured. Compared to colonies grown in minimal medium, colonies grown in minimal medium supplemented with all amino acids, or aspartate alone, had significantly higher amounts of trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, the level of trehalose in wild-type colonies grown in aspartate dropout minimal medium was significantly lower compared to colonies grown in minimal media supplemented with all amino acids or just aspartate, demonstrating that aspartate can be the primary carbon contributor towards trehalose synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, <italic>Îpck1</italic> colonies (gluconeogenesis defective) and <italic>Îtps1</italic> (trehalose synthesis defective) had background levels of trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, colonies grown on aspartate dropout medium had fewer light cells (quantified using the PPP reporter activity) compared to colonies grown in minimal media supplemented with all amino acids or just aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This shows that aspartate enables trehalose production, which in turn controls the emergence of metabolic heterogeneity in these clonal colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To demonstrate that aspartate directly provides the carbon backbone of trehalose, we grew colonies in minimal medium (low glucose) supplemented with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled aspartate, and measured intracellular levels of <sup>13</sup>Câlabeled gluconeogenic intermediates or end-products directly by targeted mass spectrometric methods described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vengayil et al., 2019</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Synthesis of the nucleotide backbone requires an assimilation of carbon (typically from glucose derived metabolites, notably pentose sugars from the PPP), as well as nitrogen that comes from amino acids (primarily glutamine and aspartate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyle, 2005</xref>). Indeed, this donation of nitrogen by aspartate towards nucleotide synthesis is considered a primary role of this amino acid. Interestingly, within the dark cells of the colony, aspartate is also being used as a carbon source for the synthesis of trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This raises the central idea of molecular budgeting: how is the utilization of aspartate as a carbon/nitrogen source managed in different types of cells? To theoretically address this question, we refined our originally coarse-grained mathematical model from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>. In the original model that simulates the development of the colony with dark and light cells, the resource driving the emergence of light cells was featureless and could only be used to drive hypothetically opposite metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). In our new model, we now build-in molecule specificity. Based on experimental data, we incorporate aspartate utilization for the emergence of metabolic subpopulations, and self-organization within the colony. The processes now included in the model are explained below (See Materials and methods for a detailed description):</p><p>Both dark and light cells utilize externally available resources to synthesize and accumulate the metabolites needed for growth. We can now assign two specific categories for these accumulating metabolites: carbon (C) and nitrogen (N). The dark cells utilize a single resource, aspartate, to serve both C and N requirements. Aspartate itself is a molecule that is in excess in the environment (non-limiting). We propose that the dark cells budget the aspartate flux for both these requirements, and some of the accumulated C (as trehalose) becomes available in the extracellular environment. From our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>), we know that the extracellular trehalose controls when some dark cells switch to being light cells. The light cells utilize the available trehalose for their C needs (driving glycolysis and the PPP). However, aspartate remains readily available for their N requirements, which includes nucleotide synthesis (this is illustrated in the model schematic and sample colony in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We now implement this revised model as an agent-based simulation, and monitor colony growth with these new assumptions of aspartate utilization. The specific modifications from the original model and the new parameters are introduced below:</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>An agent-based model for carbon-nitrogen budgeting reveals principles of metabolic heterogeneity via self-organization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model schematic based on an experimental understanding of aspartate utilization by the two cell types in the system.

Note: the axes values are not on a linear or logarithmic scale but are chosen for representative purposes to show parametric trends. Increasing AspU increases the rate of aspartate influx into the system. Overall, this generates larger colonies. Since dark cell blocks are not limited by the trehalose production, they divide at about the same rate as light cell blocks. This is contrary to experimental observations where dark cells grow slower than light cells. With the parameter f, extremely low values allocate too little of the metabolic budget to nitrogen reserves. This results in slow growing colonies which have a higher fraction of light cell blocks. On the other hand, higher values allocate too much of the budget to nitrogen reserves. This slows down the rate of trehalose production, thereby slowing down the emergence of light cells and their proliferation and gives us smaller overall colonies. Thus, increasing both AspU and f together leads to realistic looking colonies as observed along the top diagonal elements in this figure.

We assume that dark and light cell [blocks] need the same minimum amount of C, normalized to a value of 1.0 units. However, experimental observations show that light cells have a higher rate of nucleotide synthesis, corresponding with faster growth rates and nitrogen consumption compared to dark cells (as observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, while the dark cell blocks have a minimum N requirement normalized to 1.0, the light cells need <bold>ExN</bold>*1.0.

See Table 2 for values of these parameters and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref> for a comparison of the division rate of the dark and light cells. Our first aim here is simply to show that adding a simple carbon-nitrogen budgeting to our previous model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>) does not destroy the spatial patterns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows that this model is sufficient to produce spatial patterns of dark and light cells that are similar to what we observe experimentally. Having established the sufficiency of the model, a second aim was to understand, within this framework, how the carbon-nitrogen budgeting could be set up to be consistent with the patterns. In essence, we ask what constraints from the carbon-nitrogen budgeting are necessary to produce the spatial patterns observed.</p></list-item></list><p>By varying the two main parameters in this study, the model makes the following predictions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>More of the aspartate taken up by dark cells is allocated for carbon metabolism and trehalose synthesisÂ We vary the fraction of the aspartate flux allocated to nitrogen, <bold>f</bold>, from 0.0 to 1.0 (0%â100%) only in the dark cells. The colonies formed from some selected values are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> to show the general trend. Low values of âfâ generate virtual colonies which are similar to experimental ones. As the value of f increases, enough resources cannot be allocated to fulfil carbon requirements for light cells to divide.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Aspartate uptake rate by both types of cells is higher than the rate of uptake of trehalose by light cellsÂ The parameter <bold>AspU</bold> dictates the relative rate of aspartate uptake compared to trehalose uptake rate by light cells. Dark cells take up aspartate at the same rate as light cells. However, in dark cells, aspartate is responsible for carbon metabolism and trehalose generated in the system. Varying this parameter as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, we see that if the rate of uptake for aspartate is the same as the uptake rate for trehalose (AspUÂ =Â 1.0), the colonies cannot grow like the wild-type colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This can be attributed to the fact that 4 molecules of aspartate are required for the synthesis of 1 molecule of trehalose. Hence it will be impossible for cells to synthesize sufficient amounts of trehalose required for the emergence of light cells, if the uptake rate of aspartate by dark cells is equal to the uptake of trehalose by light cells. Therefore, in simple simulations, a higher value of AspU (=4.0) provides enough carbon for the dark cells despite budgeting, to synthesize trehalose (C for light cells in the model) that is required for the proliferation of light cells. Since aspartate drives the growth of both dark and light cells in a direct and indirect manner, larger values of AspU give larger colonies and vice versa, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>.

We therefore hypothesized that distinct cells in the colony might differentially utilize aspartate predominantly as either a carbon or a nitrogen source. We previously showed that light cells exhibit high PPP activity and nucleotide biosynthesis, using carbon precursors derived from the trehalose, provided by the dark cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). As mentioned earlier, aspartate serves as a nitrogen donor in the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, but can also serve as a gluconeogenic substrate, providing the carbon backbone for the synthesis of trehalose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jones, 1980</xref>). Based both on theory and our model simulations, can we now experimentally test if aspartate predominantly serves as a carbon source in dark cells to fuel trehalose production, while primarily providing nitrogen for nucleotide biosynthesis in light cells? Note that this will not be absolute: all cells will make some nucleotides, and so aspartate will provide nitrogen in both dark and light cells. An expectation would be a relative difference in flux, which is the essence of this idea of differential carbon/nitrogen budgeting.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Aspartate is differentially utilized as a carbon or nitrogen currency in light and dark cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Metabolic fates of aspartate: The carbon of aspartate (green) can be used for synthesis of molecules like trehalose <italic>via</italic> gluconeogenesis (green boxed).

Collectively, these results reveal how plasticity in the use of a non-limiting resource, aspartate, enables the development of metabolically heterogeneous colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dark and light cells exhibit division of labor, with distinct survival and collective growth advantages</title><p>What can this type of formation of specialized states, derived from biochemically self-organizing systems, mean for such a community of cells? Non-genetic heterogeneity can be beneficial for cell populations. Due to heterogeneity, some individual cells can survive environmental changes, which thereby allow genotypes to persist in ever-changing environments. Further, division of labor between individuals of a community can enhance collective community growth, development, and the efficiency of the functions that they perform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giri et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Gestel et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore wondered if the distinct metabolic states within the yeast colony conferred a collective growth or survival advantage. Yeast cells routinely encounter environmental fluctuations like desiccation and freezing/thawing regularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasch, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gasch and Werner-Washburne, 2002</xref>). Here, trehalose particularly enables the survival of yeast cells when faced with such environmental insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Amore et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erkut et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiemken, 1990</xref>). Since dark (gluconeogenic) cells accumulate high amounts of trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>), we suspected that these cells might better survive extreme conditions like desiccation and freezing/thawing. To test this, we isolated light and dark cells fromÂ ~7 day old colonies and subjected them to repeated freeze/thaw cycles or severe desiccation (7 and 14 days). We used yeast cells grown in glycolytic or gluconeogenic liquid medium as controls, and measured cell survival either by spotting the cells on a fresh plate (for a freeze/thaw tolerance) or counting the percentage of surviving cells (for desiccation tolerance). Dark cells showed markedly higher survival rates post freeze/thaw treatment (similar to the gluconeogenic control) compared to light cells (which phenocopied cells grown in high glucose) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similarly, dark cells survived complete desiccation better than light cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Finally, we looked at the role of dark cells in the long-term survivability of the wild-type colony as a whole. To dissect this, we used cells lacking the trehalase enzyme (<italic>Înth1</italic>) as a control, since colonies from these cells produce but cannot utilize trehalose to fuel glycolysis, and lack light cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). We also compared these to the long-term survivability of <italic>Îpck1</italic> cells (gluconeogenesis-defective), since these colonies lack both light and dark cells. Although we did not see a difference in the number of viable cells in the 7 day old colonies, in mature (21 day) colonies the percentage of viable cells were significantly lower in the <italic>Îpck1</italic> colonies compared to the wild-type and <italic>Înth1</italic> colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We previously observed that light cells enable efficient colony expansion, and colonies with only dark cells (<italic>Înth1</italic> trehalase mutants) cannot expand as efficiently as a wild-type colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>).

To test this, wild-type, <italic>ânth1</italic> and <italic>âpck1</italic> were spotted as colonies and colony expansion was monitored over time (7 days and 21 days). At 21 days, the <italic>Înth1</italic> and <italic>Îpck1</italic> colonies had significantly reduced expansion compared to wild-type colonies. This reiterates that the light cells are important for the effective long-term expansion of the colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). This also suggests the possibility that colonies lacking light cells may not be able to expand towards suitable nutrients. To contextualize this with the localized availability of high-quality nutrients, we designed an experiment where an external source of glucose was added to the plate at some distance from the colony, and the expansion of colonies towards this glucose source was estimated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Strikingly, the light cells from wild-type colonies showed rapid, directional proliferation towards the glucose source. Notably, both the <italic>Înth1</italic> cells (trehalose-breakdown deficient, no light cells), and the <italic>Îpck1</italic> cells (no trehalose production) showed markedly reduced directional movement towards the glucose source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This was quantified using an expansion factor (the ratio of the colony area of the half of the colony growing towards the glucose source/colony area of the other half of the colony) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These data conclusively show that light cells are essential for the outward expansion and foraging response of the colony. Together, the presence of dark and light cells allows greater colony survival, resistance to stress, and the ability to expand towards preferred nutrient sources. This can collectively provide the colony with the ability to persist and thrive in varying environments, and is further discussed below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present data illustrating how plasticity in the use of a non-limiting resource, aspartate, is sufficient for the emergence and maintenance of spatially organized, distinct metabolic states of groups of cells. Aspartate is required for gluconeogenic cells to achieve threshold concentrations of a limiting resource, trehalose, which in turn drives specialization in these clonal microbial communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In low glucose conditions, cells expectedly perform gluconeogenesis to replenish glucose reserves. During this process, cells utilize aspartate predominantly as a carbon source that drives gluconeogenesis, via its conversion to oxaloacetate. One eventual metabolic outcome of gluconeogenesis is trehalose synthesis, and cells accumulate synthesized trehalose. Trehalose also directly benefits gluconeogenic cells, allowing them to survive environmental stresses including desiccation and repeated freeze/thaw cycles. As trehalose builds-up and threshold concentrations of externally available trehalose are reached, some cells stochastically take up and consume trehalose, breaking it down to glucose. This uptake and consumption of trehalose switches the metabolic state of these cells to that of high PPP/Glycolysis. In this complimentary metabolic state, cells now utilize aspartate as a nitrogen source. The combination of available glucose (from trehalose) combined with the use of aspartate as a nitrogen source allows light cells to synthesize end point molecules like nucleotides, which enable rapid proliferation, and efficient expansion and foraging for nutrients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model: Metabolite plasticity allowing differential carbon/nitrogen resource budgeting of aspartate drives metabolic specialization resulting in division of labor.</title><p>Cells in low glucose perform gluconeogenesis (Dark cells), as would be required in low glucose medium. During this process, dark cells predominantly budget aspartate for their carbon needs to synthesize trehalose. The accumulated trehalose reserves in the dark cells allow them to survive environmental challenges including desiccation and repeated freeze/thaw cycles. Trehalose also accumulates externally, and once threshold levels of external trehalose are reached, some cells stochastically switch to the light state and utilize this trehalose to fuel their high glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activity. Cells that switch to the light cell state predominantly use aspartate as a ânitrogenâ source to synthesize nucleotides via PPP, while utilizing trehalose for their carbon needs. This makes light cells primed for proliferation, which in turn results in increased or directional colony expansion. This metabolic specialization and division of labor between the light and dark cells creates a cross-feeding system (built around trehalose), and allows the colony as a whole to survive unfavorable conditions and forage efficiently even in nutrient limiting conditions.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57609-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Key to understanding this self-organized system of cells existing in specialized states, with cells in one state dependent on the functioning of the other, is the idea of distinct carbon-nitrogen budgeting which depends on a metabolically plastic resource. This can function as both a carbon and nitrogen source. Previously we showed how trehalose availability can create a self-organized system, where some cells will switch a new (glycolytic) metabolic state, and these cells will themselves be sustained by the cells in the original (gluconeogenic) metabolic state that produce trehalose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). In this system, trehalose is a limiting metabolite. It is minimal in the cells that seed the colony, and builds up over time due to gluconeogenesis, which is the required metabolic state in low glucose conditions. Only when trehalose builds up, some cells switch to a glycolytic state. Such an idea of threshold amounts of sentinel metabolites that can control cell states is an emerging area of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cai and Tu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishna and Laxman, 2018</xref>). In this study, we take a step back to discover that the underpinnings of this system, which lead to the formation of this limiting resource (trehalose) lies in a metabolic economy where carbon and nitrogen need to be âbudgetedâ distinctly. This requires a metabolically plastic resource available in sufficient (ânon-limitingâ) quantities. In order for cells to achieve threshold levels of the limiting resource, trehalose, cells utilize a non-limiting resource (aspartate) to fuel trehalose biosynthesis. Conventionally, aspartate is thought of as a ânitrogenâ source since it is required for nucleotide metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyle, 2005</xref>). However, as we also observe in this study, aspartate serves as an effective carbon source to synthesize trehalose via gluconeogenesis in dark cells. In light cells, carbon is no longer limiting (since these cells can utilize the built-up trehalose). In these cells, aspartate can go back to predominantly satisfy its âconventionalâ role as a nitrogen donor for nucleotide synthesis. This differential use of a single metabolite to meet distinct carbon and nitrogen demands of cells in opposite metabolic states is a remarkable example of metabolic budgeting within spatially organized cells. This plastic ability of aspartate, combined with non-limiting amounts at which it is available makes it the driver of phenotypic heterogeneity in this system. Cross-feeding systems, where groups of cells produce resources that another group of cells utilize are widely prevalent in microbial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D'Souza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doebeli, 2002</xref>). Typically, this involves multi-species communities, or dependent auxotrophs. Here one group of cells cannot efficiently carry out a specific metabolic task, and obtain required precursors from other cells that produce it (and <italic>vice versa</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wintermute and Silver, 2010</xref>). Contrastingly, studies of organized, interdependent specialization of function in cell groups within spatially restricted, clonal microbial communities are relatively uncommon. Our study in a clonal yeast colony illustrates how simpler, self-organized biochemical networks, built on differential metabolic budgeting, and driven by mass-action based flux towards the production/utilization of specific resources, are sufficient to enable sustainable cross-feeding systems without a requirement for metabolic auxotrophies or metabolic deficiencies.</p><p>In these contexts, our coarse-grained and more refined agent-based models can be instructive in revealing the range of possible scenarios that can enable such metabolic networks in cross-feeding systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laxman and Krishna, 2020</xref>). Our original model only showed how a build-up of a resource, and its subsequent consumption, would create a specific type of patterning/organization of cells (with resource âusersâ and âproducersâ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>). With this improved, agent-based model, we can now bring context and dissect out what the consequences of differential carbon/nitrogen budgeting, with the use of non-limiting resources, and the production and use of limiting resources, might entail. Note that such models only demonstrate that the mechanisms they include are <italic>sufficient</italic> to explain observed phenomena; they do not demonstrate the necessity of these mechanisms. However, showing sufficiency is useful as a consistency check on our biological understanding of the mechanisms at play, and in providing a framework within which to explore constraints on the mechanisms that we believe are biologically important. Our model suggested that, with the mechanisms included, the experimentally observed spatial patterns only arose when aspartate was predominantly used as a carbon source in gluconeogenic cells, which we then confirmed experimentally. Importantly, such models also show how such processes require spatial structure and organization to sustain themselves, and suggest entirely different requirements for well-mixed populations of cells. For example, well-mixed yeast cultures in glucose limitation undergo well studied metabolic cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laxman and Tu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kudlicki et al., 2005</xref>), coincident with a fraction of the population committing to growth and proliferation while other cells remain quiescent. In this context, distinct models, based on the formation of relaxation oscillators, explain how threshold amounts of metabolites control cell state switching and heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burnetti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishna and Laxman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laxman and Krishna, 2020</xref>).</p><p>This population of clonal yeast cells existing as a cross-feeding population exhibits many features that are consistent with a colony level bet-hedging strategy. The dark cells (which are a majority of the population) are highly gluconeogenic, and exhibit general features of a starvation state. When glucose is limited, cells will shift to gluconeogenesis, and in these conditions, mass action dependent metabolic flux is extremely high towards trehalose synthesis, making the production of this resource an unavoidable, âdefaultâ outcome. Since aspartate is available in non-limiting amounts for these developing colonies, dark cells have no shortage of carbon precursors required for the synthesis of trehalose. Trehalose is a versatile metabolite, that enables dark cells to survive and persist through extreme environments that yeast cells come across naturally (such as surviving water loss [desiccation], or freeze-thaw cycles etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Amore et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erkut et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wiemken, 1990</xref>]). In contrast, the light cells are glycolytic, with high pentose phosphate activity. This is a metabolic signature of a âgrowth stateâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van den Brink et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wiebe et al., 2008</xref>), and these cells achieve this state because they can take up and breakdown the available trehalose to fuel glycolysis. Importantly, cells in both states are required, for the colony as a whole to collectively, successfully expand and forage for nutrients (as shown here, and previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>]). Foraging for nutrients is an important strategy used by microbial communities to tackle nutrient limitation. The presence of cells in both metabolic states allows the following: each state is primed for a different nutrient condition. The dark cells will easily transition to quiescence and survive extreme stress. The light cells are poised to rapidly grow when the colony reaches a more favorable (glucose replete) nutrient environment by foraging. It therefore appears that the benefits of trehalose production and utilization by the dark and light cells (for different purposes, via the differential budgeting of carbon and nitrogen coming from aspartate) are considerable, in contrast to the minimal biochemical costs of production.</p><p>The principles emerging from this two-state system in a yeast colony are pertinent to the emergence of complexity from relatively simple processes. In an elegant theoretical framework, Cornish-Bowden and Cardenas formulated how in a living system, self-organizing processes can maintain themselves indefinitely, and how they can be modified across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornish-Bowden and CÃ¡rdenas, 2008</xref>). In their study, they extend the original idea of <italic>âmetabolism-replacement systemsâ</italic> (M-R systems), and the importance of metabolic closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rosen, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosen, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosen, 1965</xref>). A living M-R system, as conceptualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornish-Bowden and CÃ¡rdenas, 2008</xref>), requires a few specific properties: (1) some molecules are available in unlimited quantities from the environment, (2) a partition must be present to separate the system from its environment, (3) these molecules can enter in and out of the partition, (4) the chemistry of these molecules enable them to participate in biochemical cycles, (5) these molecules/reactions will not participate in processes that interfere with these biochemical cycles, and (6) the thermodynamics of these reactions are sufficiently favorable. By these definitions, this yeast colony where the combination of aspartate in (practically) non-limiting amounts, as well as the build-up and use of a limiting resource (trehalose), along with the separation of compartments (and cells) for different biochemical processes where these molecules are used, largely works as a <italic>M-R</italic> system that enables the stable emergence and maintenance of phenotypically heterogeneous states. This system, with biochemical specialization and division of (metabolic) labor is also a demonstration of both the importance of specific enzymes (eg. trehalase), and metabolic control analysis, leading to the distribution of tasks via the differential budgeting of carbon and nitrogen. This is the essence of a cellular or multi-cellular economy where metabolic supply and demand must be balanced, and which depends on the combination of resources available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hofmeyr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hofmeyr and Cornish-Bowden, 2000</xref>).</p><p>The result of this self-organized system are groups of clonal cells, spatially organized into groups that exhibit division of labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">van Gestel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">West and Cooper, 2016</xref>). Dividing tasks between lower units (such as groups of cells) can allow tremendous enhancements in efficiency of processes. By enforcing division of labor, microbial communities effectively achieve what multicellular organisms do within tissues, and aid in the development of the whole community. While division of labor has often been used loosely, more stringent definitions of division of labor require (1) functional complementarity, (2) synergistic advantages, (3) negative frequency-dependent selection, and (4) positive assortment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giri et al., 2019</xref>). This yeast colony, with its self-organized system of cells in opposite metabolic states, appears to satisfy these criteria for division of labor. The result is a community of clonal cells where each metabolic/phenotypic state has individual advantages (greater survival or greater proliferation), enables the colony to adapt to fluctuating nutrient environments and survive environmental adversities, and also provides an increased growth advantage and capability to forage for new nutrients.</p><p>Summarizing, we demonstrate how efficient carbon/nitrogen resource budgeting and metabolic plasticity of a non-limiting resource are sufficient to control the emergence of spatially separated cells in specialized states. This division of labor, resulting in an interdependent cross-feeding system of cells provides collective advantages to the population to survive environmental challenges and expand towards new resources, in a manner reminiscent of multicellular organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Our purpose here is simply to show that this model is <italic>sufficient</italic> to produce spatial patterns similar to what we observe experimentally, not to do a detailed fitting of parameter values to data. However we outline the biological reasoning behind some of the choices below:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The parameter â<bold>f</bold>â is the fraction of aspartate that a dark cell block allocates towards nitrogen needs. Its default value is 0.125. Biologically, there is no reason to assume any restriction on this parameter, so f could take any value between 0 and 1, and we explore this range.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The parameter â<bold>AspU</bold>â controls the relative influx of aspartate compared to the influx of trehalose. Both light and dark cell blocks take up aspartate at this same rate. Its default value is 4.0. Since aspartate is at saturating levels, we assume that this parameter should be larger than 1. The upper limit, due to physiological constraints on the uptake, is undetermined, so we explored a range a little under one order of magnitude.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Conversion of aspartate to carbon necessitates a yield factor, â<bold>Y</bold>â. We use a value of 0.31 as it gives us a better pattern. Since aspartate is used as a carbon source (gluconeogenesis and nucleotide synthesis), nitrogen source (nucleotide synthesis and other functions), and protein synthesis, we must assume this parameter is less than 1.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This model links aspartate consumption to trehalose production. The aspartate is converted and adds to a growing internal C pool. A small fraction of this pool is secreted/leaked into the extracellular environment. This fraction â<bold>Pf</bold>â is 0.049. Experimentally, we find that the ratio of external to internal trehalose is approximately 1:10, which sets an upper limit for <bold>Pf</bold>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In addition, we put an upper limit on the absolute amount of trehalose secreted by a dark cell block in a time step. This is set at 0.12 units. This was inserted to prevent a large amount of trehalose being secreted by a dark cell block if it had not divided for several time steps. However, in our simulations, we find that only a negligible fraction of the cell blocks are operating at this limit (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>)</p></list-item><list-item><p>We used a scaling parameter â<bold>ExNâ</bold> to account for the difference in nitrogen requirement for light vs dark cells. Light cells are observed to have higher rates of nucleotide synthesis; therefore we expect this parameter to be larger than 1. We set the default value of this parameter to 4.0, which is in the range of experimental measurements of nucleotide synthesis rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varahan et al., 2019</xref>).</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Code availability</title><p>We implemented the model using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

division of labor in a clonal community&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Maliheh Mehrshad (Reviewer #1); Gabriel Leventhal (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that your work is interesting because it shows how differentiation and cross-feeding can develop in a clonal population, and provides some level of mechanistic insight into this phenomenon. The reviewers also agreed that the experimental part is really the central pillar of the study. By contrast, the mathematical model seems to contribute only little and may suffer a few shortcomings. Our advice would therefore be to delete the model from the text.</p><p>Major technical points and questions regarding the model:</p><p>The model is just an attempt to recreate the observed patterning using simulations, rather than to investigate whether some set of first principles might be responsible for the phenotypes. The authors themselves state that many of the parameters are chosen just to best recreate the patterns. It is always possible to devise an arbitrary simulation to reproduce some pattern. Rather, the model distracts from the experimental narrative of the paper.</p><p>The interaction model the authors invoke does not require spatial structuring per se. The spatial expansion might facilitate the visualization of the two phenotypes, but whether heterogeneity in trehalose and/or aspartate is the basis for the phenotypic bistability is less convincing.

This model is in fact not contrived, and is a clearer extension of the original model made in the previous study, with some clarity on metabolic flow. We did not impose too many parameters to simulate patterns. Indeed, the model was in fact of conceptual utility to us because it suggested that the patterns depended on gluconeogenic dark cells utilizing the aspartate <italic>predominantly</italic> as a carbon source while allocating only a smaller fraction for the synthesis of nucleotides. In contrast, the light cells should utilize the same aspartate <italic>predominantly</italic> as a nitrogen source for nucleotide synthesis, relying on the shared/produced trehalose to meet their carbon requirements. This qualitative prediction from the model is what led us to make measurements of the differential allocation of aspartate towards carbon and nitrogen requirements in dark and light cells.</p><p>Our model also provided an important check that adding a carbon-nitrogen budgeting to our previously published model (Varahan et al., 2019) in fact established the spatial patterns we observed. Thus, we only claim that our model is <italic>sufficient</italic> to explain the patterns. Claims on the <italic>necessity</italic> of the mechanisms included in the model arise from our experimental observations and biological intuition, and not from the model. We have thoroughly revised the text to make this clearer (subsection âAn agent-based model suggests how differential aspartate utilization drives the emergence of self-organized, metabolically heterogeneous statesâ and Discussion). Within this framework, we asked how the carbon-nitrogen budgeting could be set up to be consistent with the patterns observed, which helped conceptualize the experiments we then performed (as part of this manuscript, Figure 4). For these reasons, we believe the model has been an important part of this work and would like to retain it in the manuscript. However, we have revised the text to make clearer our aims in constructing such a model, and what it does and does not tell us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The interaction model the authors invoke does not require spatial structuring per se.

The purpose of the model here was not to examine what produces the bistability. We were interested in the emergence of the second state as well as the spatial self-organization of cells in the colony. Experimental evidence hinted that the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of extracellular trehalose might be a causal factor in the observed self-organization. This was more clearly discussed previously in Varahan et al., 2019 (as a major part of Figure 6 in that study). Here, our aim was to examine the role of carbon-nitrogen budgeting in producing the spatial organization, therefore we did not study a well-mixed version of the present model. Some of the authors of this study have studied the question of bistability in a well-mixed system in more generality in a recent book chapter (Laxman and Krishna, 2020), as well as during yeast metabolic cycles (Krishna and Laxman, 2018). Experimentally, we note that a different bistability â the coexistence of a quiescent and a proliferating state â is observed when yeast is grown in a well-mixed chemostat, and this comes from an inherent relaxation oscillator. This has been experimentally studied and modelled extensively by us in (Krishna and Laxman, 2018). We have also added a section in the Discussion to address and clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The increased growth rate/ nucleotide synthesis rate in the light phenotype need not imply that those cells require more nitrogen per division.

We want to clarify that aspartate is not used <italic>only</italic> as a nitrogen or a carbon source.</p><p>We find that aspartate is <italic>predominantly</italic> (and not exclusively) used as a carbon source for fuelling gluconeogenesis in the dark cells. However, aspartate is also an integral part of nucleotide biosynthesis in all cells. Even though dark cells have lesser nucleotide demands compared to light cells, it is still an essential process for dark cells. Hence the nitrogen of aspartate will also be used by dark cells for nucleotide biosynthesis albeit at lower levels compared to light cells. This is also indicated by the data, which shows relative levels of new nucleotide synthesis.</p><p>Similarly, the light cells predominantly use aspartate as a nitrogen source to meet their nucleotide biosynthesis demands while they satisfy their carbon demands via the breakdown of trehalose obtained from the dark cells. However, the carbon of aspartate can be used for multiple other biochemical processes including synthesis of other amino acids, TCA cycle, etc.</p><p>To summarize, aspartate is âpredominantlyâ used as a carbon source by the dark cells for gluconeogenesis while it is âpredominantlyâ used as a nitrogen source by light cells to meet the nucleotide demands.</p><p>We have made several appropriate clarifications in the text, in the Abstract, Results section and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In more than one instance the authors state that asparate, rather than any other amino acid, is necessary or essential for the stability of the two phenotypes (at the end of the subsection âAmino acid driven gluconeogenesis is critical for emergence of metabolic heterogeneityâ and in the first paragraph of the Discussion ). In my view, the authors only show that it is sufficient. In fact, I think the data rather show that other amino acids might also produce this effect, albeit less strongly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><p>As evident from Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C, we systematically tested the effect of <italic>all</italic> amino acid groups, with respect to their ability to rescue colony morphology. We did this by âadd backâ experiments in minimal medium, supplementing specific amino acids individually. We saw the strongest rescue when aspartate was added back (Figure 1D). The addition of glutamate or aliphatic amino acids showed a very weak colony morphology rescue at 7 days compared to add back of all amino acids, or aspartate alone. The addition of aromatic amino acids or sulphur amino acids showed no morphology rescue at 7 days (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). These data strongly suggest that aspartate is <italic>sufficient</italic> to meet the amino acids demands of the colony. Notably, the level of trehalose (the resource that controls the switch to the glycolytic state), in wild-type colonies grown in aspartate dropout minimal medium was also significantly lower compared to colonies grown in minimal media supplemented with all amino acids or just aspartate, demonstrating that aspartate can be the primary carbon contributor towards trehalose synthesis (Figure 2A). This is further strengthened by the <sup>13</sup>C aspartate flux labelling data in Figure 2C, which unambiguously show that aspartate is converted to trehalose. Similarly, the amount of light cells (which indicates a fully developed complex colony, with cells in two states) in wild-type colonies grown in aspartate dropout minimal medium was significantly lower compared to colonies grown in minimal media supplemented with all amino acids or just aspartate suggesting that aspartate is sufficient for the proliferation and expansion of light cells (Figure 2B and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). Of course, as the reviewer has pointed out, we entirely agree that other amino acids will play some role in these processes. Glutamate and glutamine will be converted into aspartate (at some rate), but under normal flux, this process cannot produce a large excess (ânon-limitingâ amounts) of aspartate. The excess of aspartate is required to easily convert to oxaloacetate and enter gluconeogenesis (in order to make trehalose). Our data therefore collectively illustrate how there is a hierarchy of use, even for amino acids, i.e. all amino acids are not the same, precisely because of the range of chemical outcomes each amino acid allows.</p><p>We have replaced âessentialâ and âcriticalâ to âsufficientâ in the main text of the revised manuscript. We also have now added several sections in the Discussion to explain this point better, and more clearly discuss the idea of differential carbon/nitrogen budgeting, emerging from a metabolically plastic resource.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors do show differential survival and expansion between the two phenotypes, but I don't think the data go as far to make the statement that this is a colony level bet-hedging strategy. For this, I think you need to have a better characterization of what the benefits and costs of trehalose overproduction are for the dark cells: why are they secreting trehalose and what is the benefit to themselves?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Without any overstatement, we think we can now make a better argument explaining why our data is <italic>consistent</italic> with a colony level bet-hedging strategy, and provide a nuanced explanation below.</p><p>The dark cells are primarily gluconeogenic. This metabolic state by default results in the production of trehalose, which gives the dark cells an ability to survive and persist through extreme environments that yeast cells come across naturally. This includes surviving water loss (desiccation), or freeze-thaw cycles, etc. This is primarily attributed to the presence of trehalose in the dark cells. However, the light cells (which are highly glycolytic) are not suited for this. Gluconeogenic cells synthesize extraordinary amounts of trehalose and it has been reported that trehalose makes up to 30% of the biomass of gluconeogenic cells. Additionally, the gluconeogenic state itself is a hallmark of a âstarvationâ state, with the shift towards gluconeogenesis marking a first transition towards more quiescent states (Shi et al., 2010; FranÃ§ois et al.; FranÃ§ois and Parrou, 2001). In effect, everything about a gluconeogenic state is for a cell to prepare for eventual starvation.</p><p>In contrast, the light cells are glycolytic, with high pentose phosphate activity. This is a signature of a cell in a âgrowth stateâ (Van Den Brink et al., 2008; Wiebe et al., 2008). This is achieved because these cells can take up and breakdown the extracellular, available trehalose to fuel glycolysis. Effectively, these cells now no longer are in âcarbon starvationâ, because of the steady supply of trehalose from the cells that remain gluconeogenic (this process itself is shown in greater detail in the previous study upon which this study is built, [Varahan et al., 2019]). In order to achieve this âcarbon independenceâ, these cells require plentiful amounts of a metabolically plastic resource, aspartate. Aspartate is not limiting in the conditions of our study. Aspartate is used as a carbon source in gluconeogenic cells but now becomes a nitrogen source in these cells. The important aspect of these light cells is that they can proliferate rapidly (compared to the dark cells). But cells in <italic>both</italic> states are required, for the colony as a whole to collectively, successfully expand and forage for nutrients (as shown here, and in our previous study [Varahan et al., 2019]). Foraging for nutrients is an important strategy used by microbial communities to tackle nutrient limitation. The presence of both states, therefore, allows the following: each state is primed for a different nutrient condition. The dark cells will easily shift to quiescence and survive extreme stress. The light cells are best poised to rapidly grow when the colony reaches a more favourable (glucose replete) nutrient environment by foraging. Functionally, the colony has therefore achieved a bet-hedging survival strategy.</p><p>The reviewer however makes a very important point about the costs of secretion/production of trehalose, which would be the appropriate way to definitively demonstrate bet-hedging. Currently, we only point out that when glucose is limited, cells will have a default shift to gluconeogenesis, and in these conditions, mass action dependent metabolic flux will be extremely high towards trehalose, making the build-up of this resource an inevitable outcome. Effectively, this is a default resource that will be made by cells, with no âadditionalâ or imposed energetic cost. This resource therefore becomes easily available. When some cells switch to using this resource that is now available, they switch to the âlightâ glycolytic state. This exact molecular mechanism for the switch is not known, but several studies show that trehalose will be a fuel to switch cells to glycolysis/exit quiescence (FranÃ§ois and Parrou, 2001; Shi et al., 2010), and indeed this is the essence of the model (in relation to trehalose) that we proposed in the previous study. The benefit though is not only to the light glycolytic cells, but to the clonal colony as a whole, since the light cells cannot survive/exist without the gluconeogenic cells putting out trehalose, and the colony as a whole cannot forage or grow very well if it lacks the light cells (as shown in Figure 5 of this manuscript).</p><p>Instead of making any strong argument for colony level bet-hedging, we now revise the text completely. We do not use this term in the Results section. Instead, we include a paragraph in the Discussion, suggesting that this phenomenon exhibits many features <italic>consistent</italic> with a bet-hedging strategy. This paragraph follows the section describing the carbon/nitrogen budgeting.</p><p>Note: As a clarification, at this stage, we cannot address if trehalose is <italic>secreted</italic> or actively transported out by dark cells since there are no known exporters of trehalose in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. However, considerable amounts of trehalose are present in the external environment in these mature colonies (as we show here, as well as in the previous study (Varahan et al., 2019)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Rather, I think there's an interesting statement to be made about being both carbon and nitrogen limited, and then receiving carbon and nitrogen in the same molecule that might lead to metabolic differentiation of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that the media conditions in which the colonies develop have a very limited supply of only glucose. Since the media has high amounts of yeast extract and peptone (2% peptone, 2% tryptone), it essentially has non-limiting amounts of nitrogen in the form of peptides/amino acids. This we emphasize in the text (subsection âAmino acid driven gluconeogenesis is critical for emergence of metabolic heterogeneityâ). However, the light cells are limited for carbon (in the form of glucose) that is required to maintain their high glycolysis/PPP state and depend on the carbon coming from trehalose breakdown which they acquire from the external environment. Essentially, in dark cells, aspartate (which is non-limiting) is used as a carbon precursor to drive the production of trehalose. Trehalose itself is originally limiting in these growth conditions (and only builds up over time). The light cells use this trehalose directly as a carbon source. Contrastingly aspartate is used as a nitrogen source by both light and dark cells for nucleotide biosynthesis. However, light cells now require aspartate <italic>only</italic> for nucleotide synthesis (which in a highly glycolytic cell is higher than in a gluconeogenic cell). The dark cells in contrast must use aspartate for both carbon as well as nitrogen, and therefore have to deal with a very distinct, challenging C/N budgeting. We have tried to bring out this point in the Discussion a little more elaborately.</p><p>References:</p><p>FranÃ§ois, J., and Parrou, J. L. (2001).
