Like most bacteria, these organisms surround their cytoplasmic membrane with an essential cell wall matrix made of the heteropolymer peptidoglycan (PG). However, they uniquely modify the PG layer with an additional polysaccharide made of arabinan and galactan chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderwick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daffé and Marrakchi, 2019</xref>). This arabinogalactan (AG) layer is further modified by glycolipids called mycolic acids, forming a second membrane that is thought to function analogously to the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kieser and Rubin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderwick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daffé and Marrakchi, 2019</xref>). The overall envelope architecture of these bacteria is referred to as the mycolata cell envelope, and compounds that target its biogenesis are important components of current drug cocktails used to treat <italic>Mtb</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alderwick et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, enhancing our understanding of the assembly mechanisms that construct the mycolata envelope has practical implications for anti-mycobacterial therapeutic discovery in addition to addressing a fundamental problem in microbiology.</p><p>Like all other Actinobacteria analyzed thus far, members of the Corynebacterineae grow by inserting new envelope material at their cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flärdh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daniel and Errington, 2003</xref>). The mechanisms that govern tip growth in these organisms are ill-defined, but the DivIVA (Wag31) protein has long been known to play a key role in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flärdh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Letek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nguyen et al., 2007</xref>). This protein is thought to assemble into a cytoskeletal-like matrix lining the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane at the cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edwards and Errington, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramamurthi and Losick, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lenarcic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oliva et al., 2010</xref>). Similar to FtsZ polymers that underly the cytokinetic ring, these DivIVA assemblies are believed to function by promoting the recruitment of cell envelope synthases to the pole where they can promote surface elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Melzer et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, both known classes of PG synthases have been found to localize to growing poles in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valbuena et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sieger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sieger and Bramkamp, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kieser et al., 2015a</xref>). These synthases include the bifunctional class A penicillin-binding proteins (aPBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sauvage et al., 2008</xref>) and the relatively recently characterized synthases composed of complexes formed between SEDS proteins and their class B PBP (bPBP) partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>). Beyond a presumed DivIVA-requirement, it remains unclear how these PG synthases are recruited to the poles or how their activities are controlled and balanced with synthases involved in constructing the other envelope layers. Factors that mediate these important activities are likely to be encoded by genes of currently unknown function that are conserved among the Corynebacterineae.</p><p>Phenotypic profiling has proven to be a useful strategy to identify phenotypes for genes of unknown function to help uncover their biological activity. The method originally took advantage of the ordered knockout collections of yeast and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nichols et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hillenmeyer et al., 2008</xref>). Profiles were generated by replica-plating the libraries on agar containing different drugs or other stresses and the fitness of each mutant under each condition was assessed based on measurements of colony size. Similar approaches utilizing transposon-sequencing have recently been employed to generate profiles for several bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Price et al., 2018</xref>), but an extensive analysis has not yet been carried out in the Corynebacterineae. Therefore, to better understand cell envelope assembly and polar growth in these organisms, we performed a global phenotypic profiling analysis of the model bacterium <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> (<italic>Cglu</italic>). For the analysis, we used our recently generated high-density transposon mutant library of <italic>Cglu</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lim et al., 2019</xref>) and challenged it with a panel of antibiotics and other stresses. The fitness of mutants in each gene under each condition was then assessed by comparing the change in the proportion of mapped transposon insertions within a gene following ten generations of growth under a given condition. Clustering of the resulting phenotypic fingerprints for each gene revealed a role in surface biogenesis for several genes of previously unknown function. Further analysis of one such gene identified CofA (Cgp_0016) as a specific interaction partner of an aPBP-type PG synthase called PBP1a. CofA was shown localize to the cell pole and to be required for PBP1a to stably accumulate at these sites. Furthermore, we found that cognate CofA-PBP proteins from <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and a pathogenic corynebacterium also participate in specific interactions. Thus, our overall results identify a conserved new component of the polar growth machinery within the Corynebacterineae and highlight the utility of our phenotypic profiling dataset for uncovering common principles of morphogenesis for this important group of bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phenotypic profiling of a high-density <italic>Cglu</italic> transposon library</title><p>To generate phenotypic profiles, a <italic>Cglu</italic> transposon library of approximately 200,000 unique insertions was grown for eleven generations in the presence of drug or under a stress condition. For drug treatments, initial trials revealed that the best transposon-sequencing results were obtained when a drug concentration yielding a mild but observable decrease in growth rate was used. Typically these concentrations were 1/4 to 1/2 the measured minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for each drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Based on the results, a fitness score for mutants in each gene, referred for simplicity as gene fitness, was calculated by comparing the proportion of transposon reads mapped in the gene following one generation of growth in the absence of treatment relative to those mapped after eleven generations of growth in the treatment condition (see Materials and methods). Scores below 1.0 indicate reduced fitness relative to the population, whereas scores greater than 1.0 indicate greater fitness. Replicates of untreated cultures resulted in highly correlated fitness scores for each gene, with most genes yielding a fitness score near 1.0 as expected for such a comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall, approximately 40% of all non-essential genes were found to have a moderate phenotype in at least one condition tested, indicated by a fitness score below 0.9 or above 1.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), with the vast majority of phenotypes observed being fitness defects.</p><p>Hierarchical clustering of the phenotypic profiles generated from the analysis was used to identify sets of genes with similar fingerprints that may function together in the same biological pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). As an indication that the clustering was accurately identifying factors with similar functions, genes encoding components of several characterized protein complexes were found to have highly correlated phenotypic signatures. For example, genes encoding the two cytochrome d oxidase subunits (<italic>cydA</italic> and <italic>cydB</italic>) and cytochrome transporter (<italic>cydC</italic> and <italic>cydD</italic>) cluster tightly together, primarily due to their hypersensitivity to the benzothiazinone BTZ043 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

For example, genes in the putative <italic>cgp_3163–3168</italic> operon clustered into two distinct groups. Mutants in four of these genes (<italic>cgp_3163, cgp_3165, cgp_3166,</italic> and <italic>cgp_3168</italic>) have been associated with defects in trehalose mycolate transport across the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamaryo-Botte et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, they were all found to cluster together in the profiling analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Gene <italic>cgp_3164</italic> from this locus, on the other hand, was previously implicated in a different function. Mutants in this gene along with the unlinked <italic>mptA</italic> (<italic>cgp_2385</italic>) gene were found to have a defect in the elongation of the mannan backbone of membrane glycolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cashmore et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this finding, <italic>cgp_3164</italic> clusters with <italic>mptA</italic> (<italic>cgp_2385</italic>) in our analysis and has a phenotypic profile distinct from its neighboring genes in the <italic>cgp_3163–3168</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, the profiling and clustering results are not simply identifying functional groupings based on operonic organization.</p><p>In addition to properly correlating the function of factors known to work together within the same complex or pathway, the profiling data also identified possible roles in cell surface biogenesis for genes of previously unknown function. For example, the putative <italic>cgp_3012–3020</italic> operon stood out due to the specific hypersensitivity to bacitracin and vancomycin displayed by mutants in all of its genes except for <italic>cgp_3015</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). This hypersensitivity was confirmed by deletion of the entire locus or individual genes (<italic>cgp_3018</italic> or <italic>cgp_3019</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Also consistent with the phenotypic screen, these strains have a slight growth advantage on meropenem, but are not altered in their susceptibility to other drugs like ampicillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Vancomycin acts by directly binding the lipid II precursor for PG synthesis, which consists of the lipid carrier undecaprenol pyrophosphate (Und-PP) linked with the dissacharide pentapeptide monomeric unit of PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reynolds, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider and Sahl, 2010</xref>). Bacitracin similarly targets the lipid stage of PG biogenesis by blocking the dephosphorylation of Und-PP products of PG glycan polymerases such that Und-P is not regenerated for use in the synthesis of lipid II, causing PG synthesis to be inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schneider and Sahl, 2010</xref>). Thus, the specific hypersensitivity of mutants in the <italic>cgp_3012–3020</italic> locus to drugs that interfere with lipid II biogenesis suggests that this large uncharacterized cluster of genes may be involved in undecaprenol synthesis or utilization to facilitate proper cell surface assembly in <italic>Cglu</italic>.

Cofactors of aPBPs have been described in the Proteobacteria and Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenton et al., 2018</xref>). However, no such cofactors have been identified as important for PG synthesis in the Corynebacterineae or other Actinobacteria. Given the critical roles played by these cofactors in the activation and/or control of PG synthesis by the aPBPs in other organisms, we decided to further investigate the connection between CofA and PBP1a in <italic>Cglu</italic>.</p><p>To validate the profiling results, deletions of <italic>ponA</italic> and <italic>cofA</italic> were constructed and the sensitivity of the resulting mutants to antibiotics was assessed. As expected, Δ<italic>ponA</italic> cells displayed hypersensitivity to ampicillin and meropenam relative to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Cells deleted for <italic>cofA</italic> showed a similar sensitivity to these drugs, but in both cases the sensitivity defect was less severe than that of Δ<italic>ponA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Double Δ<italic>ponA</italic> Δ<italic>cofA</italic> mutants displayed a drug sensitivity phenotype identical to the single Δ<italic>ponA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the mutant phenotypes of cells inactivated for PBP1a and CofA are indeed similar. However, the reduced severity of the phenotypes for CofA inactivation relative to PBP1a inactivation suggests that PBP1a retains some residual function in the absence of CofA. This phenotypic disparity is consistent with a model in which CofA promotes normal PBP1a function but is not absolutely required for its activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CofA is required for the stable accumulation of PBP1a</title><p>PBP1a has been shown to localize to the cell pole where it is likely participating in polar surface growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valbuena et al., 2007</xref>). We reasoned that one potential function of CofA might be the recruitment of PBP1a to the growing pole. To investigate this possibility, we constructed N-terminal fusions of the red-fluorescent protein mScarlet (mScar) to both PBP1a and CofA. Both fusions were functional as they complemented the ampicillin hypersensitivity phenotype of the corresponding deletion allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected based on prior results, mScar-PBP1a displayed a prominent polar localization pattern with additional signal at developing division septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This localization pattern did not require PBP1a activity as mutant fusions inactivated for polymerase (GTase), crosslinking (TPase), or both activities retained their polar recruitment signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). mScar-CofA showed a very similar localization pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, the polar localization pattern of mScar-CofA was lost in Δ<italic>ponA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The fusion instead displayed a peripheral localization signal typical of a delocalized membrane protein. In stark contrast, when mScar-PBP1a localization was assessed in Δ<italic>cofA</italic> cells, the fluorescent signal observed was dramatically reduced relative to cells producing CofA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This result suggested that PBP1a may not stably accumulate in the absence of CofA. To investigate this possibility, we used the fluorescent penicillin derivative called Bocillin to monitor PBP1a levels in wild-type and Δ<italic>cofA</italic> cells.</p><p>Like all beta-lactams, Bocillin covalently modifies the TP active site of PBPs. It can therefore be used label cellular PBPs to track their abundance in membrane extracts following protein denaturation, and separation by SDS-PAGE. Labeling of wild-type cells yielded three bands of high-intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The top band was identified as PBP1a due to its absence in the profile of labeled Δ<italic>ponA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As expected from the fluorescent microscopy analysis, the intensity of the PBP1a band was dramatically reduced in samples from Δ<italic>cofA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Similarly, when Δ<italic>ponA</italic> cells expressing the mScar-PBP1a fusion were labeled, the PBP1a band was shifted to a higher molecular weight corresponding to the fusion, and this band was significantly reduced in intensity when CofA was inactivated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Given that the fusion protein was produced from a heterologous promoter, the effect of CofA is unlikely to be at the level of <italic>ponA</italic> transcription.

Additionally, biochemical studies indicate that the <italic><sup>Ec</sup></italic>LpoA cofactor primarily stimulates the crosslinking activity of its <italic><sup>Ec</sup></italic>PBP1a partner, whereas the glycan polymerase activity of <italic><sup>Ec</sup></italic>PBP1b is activated by its cofactor <italic><sup>Ec</sup></italic>LpoB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paradis-Bleau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lupoli et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic studies in related Gram-negative bacteria indicate that their aPBPs also require similar outer membrane lipoproteins for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dörr et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). The exception is <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and its relatives where a LpoB ortholog is missing and <sup>Pa</sup>PBP1b instead relies on the unrelated membrane lipoprotein LpoP for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greene et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, aPBP cofactors are diverse and are thought to have evolved relatively recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Typas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Typas et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, studies of the Gram-positive pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, which lacks an outer membrane, have identified distinct set of aPBP partners that are thought to promote proper PG synthesis. The polytopic membrane protein CozE was identified as a factor that is essential for controlling the subcellular localization of <italic><sup>Sp</sup></italic>PBP1a, whereas the bitopic membrane protein MacP was found to be required for <italic><sup>Sp</sup></italic>PBP2a in a manner that requires phosphorylation by the Ser-Thr kinase StkP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fenton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fenton et al., 2017</xref>). The effect of these <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> factors on the biochemical activities of their cognate aPBP remains to be determined.</p><p>To our knowledge, cofactors for aPBPs in the Actinobacteria have not been previously described. CofA has many of the expected hallmarks of such a cofactor. Its loss of function phenocopies the inactivation its cognate aPBP, and it interacts specifically with this synthase. What is unique about CofA compared to other aPBP cofactors characterized previously is that it is required for the stable accumulation of its partner enzyme. Because the accumulation defect of PBP1a in the absence of CofA is observed when the synthase gene is expressed from a heterologous promoter, it is unlikely to be due to problems with transcription of the <italic>ponA</italic> gene. Additionally, it is difficult to imagine how a small bitopic membrane protein would be required for the proper translation of the <italic>ponA</italic> reading frame. Instead, because components of membrane protein complexes are commonly found to depend on their partner proteins for stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taura et al., 1993</xref>), the most likely explanation for the CofA-dependence for PBP1a accumulation is that the synthase is subject to proteolytic degradation in the absence of its interaction partner. Whether CofA has additional roles in PBP1a function is not clear, but the observation that stabilized PBP1a variants that fail to interact with CofA also do not localize to the cell pole suggests a role for CofA in the recruitment of PBP1a to the polar growth zones. Further work will be required to determine how the CofA-PBP1a complex is localized to the poles, whether it includes additional proteins, and if CofA or other associated factors modulate the PG synthase activities of PBP1a. It also remains to be determined whether the other <italic>Cglu</italic> aPBP, PBP1b, also requires a cofactor for its function. No candidates were identified in the profiling analysis, but this absence of possible partners in the dataset may be because of redundancy in cofactor function or because the putative cofactor has additional activities beyond PBP1b activation that confound the phenotypic clustering.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the function of CofA as an aPBP cofactor is conserved among the Corynebacterineae and possibly among the Actinobacteria in general. Paralogs of CofA are found throughout the Actinobacteria with the corresponding gene located in a similar genetic context near the replication origin and downstream of a gene encoding a DNA gyrase. Furthermore, the POLAR two-hybrid analysis indicates that CofA proteins from both <italic>Mtb</italic> and <italic>C. jeikium</italic> also specifically interact with the PBP1a paralogs from their corresponding organism. Additional support for a conserved function for CofA is also found in high-throughput genetic datasets performed in <italic>Mtb</italic>. A Tn-seq analysis found that <italic><sup>Mtb</sup></italic>CofA (Rv0007) became less dispensable in cells inactivated for its non-cognate aPBP, PonA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kieser et al., 2015b</xref>). Given the synthetic lethal relationship between PonA1 and PonA2 in <italic>Mtb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kieser et al., 2015b</xref>), this result is consistent with CofA being required for PonA2 function. Similarly, a different Tn-Seq study found inactivation of <italic><sup>Mtb</sup></italic>CofA and PonA2 to both have suppressive genetic interactions with <italic>rv1565c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeJesus et al., 2017</xref>), and a small scale phenotypic profiling screen in <italic>Mtb</italic> found that the phenotypes of <italic><sup>Mtb</sup></italic>CofA inactivation correlated with the inactivation of PonA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, several lines of evidence indicate that <italic><sup>Mtb</sup></italic>CofA is likely to function as an aPBP cofactor in <italic>Mtb</italic>. Notably, <italic><sup>Mtb</sup></italic>CofA has a large N-terminal extension (190 a.a.) relative to the <italic>Cglu</italic> protein, and this domain has been found to be a target for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verma et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, removal of the N-terminal extension enhanced the interaction signal between <italic><sup>Mtb</sup></italic>CofA with the transmembrane domain of PonA2 observed in the POLAR assay. Therefore, PonA2 activity in <italic>Mtb</italic> might be controlled by phosphorylation of its cofactor just as PonA1 activity is thought to be modulated by direct phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kieser et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified a new cofactor required for the activity of an aPBP-type PG synthase that is conserved among the Actinobacteria. The localization of this factor along with its cognate aPBP at the cell pole suggests that these proteins form part of the cell elongation machinery in this important group of organisms. Further mining of the phenotypic profiling data provided in this study promises to reveal additional insights into the unique growth and division mechanism of these bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Images were cropped and adjusted using FIJI software.</p><p>Micrographs were obtained using a Nikon Ti inverted microscope outfitted with a Nikon motorized stage with an OkoLab gas incubator with a slide insert attachment, an Andor Zyla 4.2 Plus sCMOS camera, Lumencore SpectraX LED Illumination, Plan Apo lambda 100x/1.45 Oil Ph3 DM objective lens, and Nikon Elements 4.30 acquisition software. Images in the green and red channels were taken using Chroma 49002 and 49008 filter cubes, respectively. The microscope was maintained at 30°C using a custom-made environmental control chamber.</p><p>For the demographs, a custom-written MATLAB code, cells were arranged from top to bottom according to their cell lengths. Additionally, each cell was oriented such that the cell pole with the higher bait intensity are located on the right. The demograph of the prey signal was plotted using this same cell orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Phylogenetic tree generation</title><p>To generate the phylogenetic tree showing the distribution of DUF 3556 containing proteins in a diverse set of bacterial taxa, the amino acid sequences of CofA was submitted to the NCBI conserved domain search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marchler-Bauer et al., 2017</xref>). NCBI reported 13104 proteins that contain the DUF 3556 (found using RPS BLAST), which were utilized for the phylogenetic tree. We used a complex and diverse set of 1773 bacterial taxa called ‘Representative Genomes’ that is available on NCBI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/">ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/</ext-link>, Representative_Genomes.00.tar.gz). The phylogenetic tree was constructed using PhyloT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phylot.biobyte.de/">http://phylot.biobyte.de/</ext-link>) and BLASTp results were plotted against the tree. The tree was visualized and annotated using iToL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://itol.embl.de/">http://itol.embl.de/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Letunic and Bork, 2016</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge all members of the Bernhardt and Rudner labs for advice and helpful discussions as well as the microscopy services provided by Paula Montero Llopis and her team at the Microscopy Resources on the North Quad (MicRoN) core facility at HMS.

development of new antimicrobial agents with novel modes of action. These pathways have been well studied in model gram positive and gram negative organisms, but remain poorly understood in actinobacteria and other atypical bacteria. This study uses global phenotypic profiling of a high density transposon library of <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic> to identify CofA, a small transmembrane protein that is required for stable polar localization of Pbp1a. The work represents an important advance in the understanding of how the cell wall biosynthetic machinery is coordinated and stabilized in actinobacteria. The resulting hits from the transposon screen conducted in the presence of antibiotics represent an important resource for the field and will assist in advancing this important area of research.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Global phenotypic profiling identifies a conserved actinobacterial cofactor for a bifunctional cell wall synthase&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Neeraj Dhar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that bacterial elongation, cytokinesis and cell separation in actinobacteria are distinct from other well-studied model organisms. Elongation of cells by incorporation of new cell wall subunits at the cell tip in mycobacteria has been reported to occur through the activity of a tropomyosin like protein, DivIVA. It has been demonstrated that the phosphorylation state of DivIVA is important for protein-interactions however, further mechanistic insight on how this protein co-ordinates the recruitment of other biosynthetic enzymes/machineries is lacking. Further, there is a relative paucity of information on the identity of other protein complexes, if any, that assemble at the cell tip during elongation. In this study, the authors use a transposon library in another actinobacterial species, Corynebacterium glutamicum, exposed to various antibiotics to identify genes required for cell wall assembly and cell tip growth.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) The authors grew a transposon mutant library of C. glutamicum in the presence of antibiotics that target different processes and measured fitness scores of mutants by comparing prevalence of DNA when bacteria are grown with and without antibiotic. They report that genes with similar function, or those that function together in the cell (or have similar responses to antibiotic), cluster together as expected. They were also able to ascribe new functions to some genes that cluster together with other known functional classes.</p><p>2) Whilst numerous interesting hits emerged from the screen, the authors decided to focus further effort on a transmembrane protein, CofA (co-factor of PBP1a), which displayed a similar phenoprint to ponA (PBP1a), a high molecular weight penicillin binding protein. Deletion of cofA resulted in increased sensitivity to ampicillin and meropenem.</p><p>3) The authors demonstrate that CofA is required for stabilization of PBP1a using fluorescent fusions of both proteins and bocillin.</p><p>4) Using their previously reported PopZ-Linked Apical Recruitment two-hybrid assay, the authors report that CofA interacts with PBP1a via its transmembrane domain and is also able to interact with itself.</p><p>5) Domain swapping of the transmembrane domain of C. glutamicum PBP1A and with that of <italic>E. coli</italic> abrogated dependency of PBP1a on CofA for stabilization. However, recruitment of PBP1a to the cell tip and interaction with CofA was affected suggesting that the transmembrane domain is required for CofA interaction and stable polar localization of PBP1a</p><p>6) Using CofA paralogs from Corynebacterium jekium and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the authors confirm that a similar phenomenon may be occurring in other actinobacteria. The <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> CofA-PBP1a complex required deletion of an extended N-terminal component.</p><p>This is an important description of a conserved actinobacterial PBP interacting protein that modulates PBP function/localization.

In the micrographs in Figure 3D there does seem to be a slight residual signal of mScar-PBP1a at the septa of ΔcofA cells. However, this may simply be due to the double membrane at septa that slightly raises the signal of the membrane protein fusion above background. No significant signal was observed in the demographs provided. As requested, the fold change for the relevant bands was quantified and added in the legends for Figure 3E and Figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors make the statement, &quot;Furthermore, the reduced severity of the phenotypes for CofA inactivation relative to PBP1a is consistent with a model in which CofA is required to promote PBP1a activity but that PBP1a retains some residual function in the absence of CofA.&quot; The evidence base for this is unclear, please explain further.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement was revised to read, “However, the reduced severity of the phenotypes for CofA inactivation relative to PBP1a inactivation suggests that PBP1a retains some residual function in the absence of CofA.
