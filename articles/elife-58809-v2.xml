task-dependent manner, for example adjusting to errors that result from unpredicted environmental changes but ignoring errors that result from environmental stochasticity. Where and how the brain represents errors in a task-dependent manner and uses them to guide behavior are not well understood. We imaged the brains of human participants performing a predictive-inference task with two conditions that had different sources of errors. Their performance was sensitive to this difference, including more choice switches after fundamental changes versus stochastic fluctuations in reward contingencies. Using multi-voxel pattern classification, we identified task-dependent representations of error magnitude and past errors in posterior parietal cortex. These representations were distinct from representations of the resulting behavioral adjustments in dorsomedial frontal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex. The results provide new insights into how the human brain represents errors in a task-dependent manner and guides subsequent adaptive behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptive learning</kwd><kwd>posterior parietal cortex</kwd><kwd>frontal cortex</kwd><kwd>error encoding</kwd><kwd>behavioral change</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH098899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gold</surname><given-names>Joshua I</given-names></name><name><surname>Kable</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1533623</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gold</surname><given-names>Joshua I</given-names></name><name><surname>Kable</surname><given-names>Joseph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Posterior parietal cortex encodes errors in a task-dependent manner while a large array of frontal regions predict subsequent behavioral changes in response to ambiguous errors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Errors often drive adaptive adjustments in beliefs that inform behaviors that maximize positive outcomes and minimize negative ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>). A major challenge to error-driven learning in uncertain and dynamic environments is that errors can arise from different sources that have different implications for learning. For example, a bad experience at a restaurant that recently hired a new chef might lead you to update your belief about the quality of the restaurant, whereas a similar experience at a well-known restaurant with a chef that has long been your favorite might be written off as a one-time bad night. That is, the same errors should be interpreted differently in different contexts. In general, errors that represent fundamental changes in the environment or that occur during periods of uncertainty should probably lead you to update your beliefs and change your behavior, whereas those that result from environmental stochasticity are likely better ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">d'Acremont and Bossaerts, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nassar et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Neural representations of key features of these kinds of dynamic, error-driven learning processes have been identified in several brain regions. For example, several studies focused on variables derived from normative models that describe the degree to which individuals should dynamically adjust their beliefs in response to error feedback under different task conditions, including the probability that a fundamental change in the environment just occurred (change-point probability, or CPP, which is a form of surprise) and the reducible uncertainty associated with estimates of environmental features (relative uncertainty, or RU). Correlates of these variables have been identified in dorsomedial frontal (DMFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPFC) cortex and medial and lateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nassar et al., 2019a</xref>). These and other studies also suggest specific roles for these different brain regions in error-driving learning, including representations of surprise induced by either state changes or outliers (irrelevant to state changes) in the PPC that suggest a role in error monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nassar et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>), and representations of variables more closely related to belief and behavior updating in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). However, these previous studies, which typically used continuous rather than discrete feedback, were not designed to identify neural signals related to a key aspect of flexible learning in uncertain and dynamic environments: responding to the same kinds of errors differently in different conditions.</p><p>To identify such task-dependent neural responses to errors, we adapted a paradigm from our previous single-unit recording study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In this paradigm, we generated two different dynamic environments by varying the amount of noise and the frequency that change-points occur (i.e. hazard rate; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glaze et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>). In one environment, noise was absent and the hazard rate was high, and thus errors unambiguously signaled a change in state. We refer to this high-hazard/low-noise condition as the <italic>unstable</italic> environment, because most errors can be attributed to volatility. In another environment, noise was high and the hazard rate was low, and thus small errors were ambiguous and could indicate either a change in state or noise. We refer to this low-hazard/high-noise condition as the <italic>noisy</italic> environment, because most errors can be attributed to stochasticity. Thus, effective learning requires treating errors in the two conditions differently, including adjusting immediately to errors in the unstable environment but using the size of errors and recent error history as cues to aid interpretation of ambiguous errors in the noisy environment.</p><p>In our previous study, we found many single neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) or posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) that responded to errors or the current condition, but we found little evidence that single neurons in these regions combined this information in a task-dependent manner to discriminate the source of errors or drive behavior. In the current study, we used whole-brain fMRI and multi-voxel pattern classification to identify task-dependent neural responses to errors and activity predictive of behavioral updating in the human brain. The results show task-dependent encoding of error magnitude and past errors in PPC and encoding of behavioral shifts in frontal regions including ACC, DMFC, DLPFC and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), which provide new insights into the distinct roles these brain regions play in representing errors in a task-dependent manner and using errors to guide adaptive behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Sixteen human participants performed a predictive-inference task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) while fMRI was used to measure their blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) brain activity. The task required them to predict the location of a single rewarded target from a circular array of ten targets. The location of the rewarded target was sampled from a distribution based on the location of the current best target and the noise level in the current condition. In addition, the location of the best target could change according to a particular, fixed hazard rate (<italic>H</italic>). Two conditions with different noise levels and hazard rates were conducted in separate runs. In the noisy condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), the rewarded target would appear in one of the five locations relative to the location of the current best target, and the hazard rate was low (<italic>H</italic> = 0.02). In the unstable condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>), the rewarded target always appeared at the location of the best target, and the hazard rate was high (<italic>H</italic> = 0.35). On each trial, participants made a prediction by looking at a particular target, and then were given explicit, visual feedback about their chosen target and the rewarded target. Effective performance required them to use this feedback in a flexible and task-dependent manner, including typically ignoring small errors in the noisy condition but responding to small errors in the unstable condition by updating their beliefs about the best-target location.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of task and experimental design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sequence of the task. At the start of the trial, participants look at a cross in the center of the screen and maintain fixation for 0.5 s to initialize the trial. After the cross disappears, participants choose one of 10 targets (red) by looking at it within 1.5 s and then holding fixation on the chosen target for 0.3 s. During the outcome phase (1 s), a green dot inside the target indicates the participants’ choice. The rewarded target is shown in purple or cyan to indicate the number of earnable points as 10 or 20, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Probability distribution of the rewarded target location in the noisy condition. Target location is relative to the location of the state (generative mean).

On average, they learned the location of the best target after a change in its location more quickly and reliably in the unstable than the noisy condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This flexible learning process had two key signatures. First, target switches (i.e. predicting a different target than on the previous trial) tended to follow errors of any magnitude in the unstable condition but only errors of high magnitude (i.e. when the chosen target was 3, 4, or five targets away from the rewarded target) in the noisy condition (sign test for <italic>H<sub>0</sub></italic>: equal probability of switching for the two conditions; error magnitude of 1: median = −0.35, interquartile range (IQR) = [−0.62,–0.25], p&lt;0.001; error magnitude of 2: median = −0.30, IQR = [−0.70,–0.11], p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). Second, target switches depended on error history only for low-magnitude errors (i.e. when the chosen target was 1 or two targets away from the rewarded target) in the noisy condition but not otherwise (sign test for <italic>H<sub>0</sub></italic>: switching was unaffected when recent history contained fewer errors; error magnitude of 1: median = −0.29, IQR = [−0.42,–0.10], p=0.004; error magnitude of 2: median = −0.25, IQR = [−0.38,–0.14], p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavioral results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Probability of choosing the best target after change-points.

This model provides a framework to interpret and use errors differently according to the current task conditions, as defined by hazard rate and noise level. The decision-maker’s trial-by-trial updates are governed by ongoing estimates of the probability that the best target changed (change-point probability, or CPP) and reducible uncertainty about the best target’s location (relative uncertainty, or RU). Both quantities are influenced by the two free parameters in the model, subjective estimates of the task hazard rate and noise level, which were fitted separately in each condition for each participant.

RU increases on the next trial after the participant makes an error and does so more strongly in the noisy condition because of the lower hazard rate. These dynamics lead to a greater probability of target switches when the last trial was an error, which is most prominent for small errors in the noisy condition.

Participants were required to learn in two different dynamic environments. In the unstable condition (high-hazard rate and low noise), errors unambiguously indicated a change in the state of the environment, and participants reliably updated their behavior in response to errors. In contrast, in the noisy condition (low-hazard rate and high noise), small errors were ambiguous, and participants used both the current error magnitude and recent error history to distinguish between those errors that likely signal change-points and those likely arising from environmental noise. Using MVPA, we showed complementary roles of PPC and prefrontal regions (including motor cortex, OFC, ACC, DMFC and DLPFC) in the outcome-monitoring and action-selection processes underlying these flexible, task-dependent behavioral responses to errors. Neural patterns in PPC encoded the magnitude of errors and past errors, more strongly in the noisy than the unstable condition. These task-dependent neural responses to errors in PPC were not reliably linked to subsequent changes in behavior.

In this condition, participants had to distinguish true change-points from environmental noise, and they used error magnitude and recent error history as a cue for whether the state had recently changed or not.

These same regions of PPC have been shown previously to represent errors, error magnitudes, surprise and salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer and Ullsperger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gläscher et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nassar et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nassar et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Payzan-LeNestour et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, these regions have been shown to integrate recent outcome or stimulus history in human fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">FitzGerald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Furl and Averbeck, 2011</xref>) and in animal single neuron recording studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akrami et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brody and Hanks, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hayden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2017</xref>). Our results extend on these past findings by demonstrating that the neural encoding of error magnitude and error history in PPC is modulated across different conditions in precisely the manner that could drive adaptive behavior.</p><p>These whole-brain fMRI results complement our previous results recording from single neurons in ACC and PCC in the same task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In that study, we identified single neurons in both ACC and PCC that encoded information relevant to interpreting errors, such as the magnitude of the error or the current condition. However, we did not find any neurons that combined this information in a manner that could drive adaptive behavioral adjustments. Our whole-brain fMRI results suggest that PPC would be a good place to look for task-dependent error representations in single neurons, including a region of medial parietal cortex slightly dorsal to the PCC area we recorded from previously.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Neural representations of behavioral updating</title><p>Also advancing beyond previous work, we identified neural activity predictive of behavioral updates across the frontal cortex, including DLPFC. In the noisy condition, small errors provided ambiguous feedback that could reflect either a change in state or environmental noise. Accordingly, after small errors in the noisy condition, participants exhibited variability across trials in whether they switched from their current choice on the subsequent trial or not. In these ambiguous situations, the multivariate neural pattern in large cluster in frontal cortex, including motor cortex, OFC, ACC, DMFC and DLPFC, predicted whether people switched or stayed on the subsequent trial. These results extend previous findings that the multivariate pattern in frontal cortex, particularly ACC and medial PFC, can decode subsequent switching versus staying in a reversal learning task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hampton and O'doherty, 2007</xref>). These results suggest a dissociation between PPC regions that monitor error information in a task-dependent manner and frontal regions that may use this information to update beliefs and select subsequent actions.</p><p>This ability to decode subsequent choices might arise from different kinds of representations in different areas of frontal cortex. Whereas motor and premotor regions may reflect the change in action plans, other frontal regions might reflect changes in abstract representations of belief states. Medial PFC is involved in performance monitoring, distinguishing errors from different sources such as actions and feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ullsperger et al., 2014</xref>), registering a hierarchy of prediction errors from those due to environmental noise to those due to a change in the environmental state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Brown, 2015</xref>), and interacting with lateral PFC to guide subsequent behavioral adjustments in response to errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Brown, 2015</xref>). Consistent with this role, activity in DMFC also reflects the extent of belief updating in dynamic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrens et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Reilly et al., 2013</xref>). OFC and DMFC encode the identity of the current latent state in a mental model of the task environment and neural representations in these regions changes as the state changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karlsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nassar et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). Activity in inferior frontal junction reflects the updating of task representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brass and von Cramon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derrfuss et al., 2005</xref>). Neural activity in frontopolar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daw et al., 2006</xref>) and DMFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchard and Gershman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kolling et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muller et al., 2019</xref>) increases during exploratory choices, which occur more frequently during periods of uncertainty about the most beneficial option. In a recent study, we identified distinct representations of latent states, uncertainty, and behavioral policy in distinct areas of frontal cortex during learning in a dynamic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nassar et al., 2019b</xref>). Our results extend these past findings and demonstrate the role of these frontal regions in adjusting behavior in response to ambiguous errors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Caveats</title><p>A few caveats should be considered when interpreting our results. First, we had relatively small number of participants in this study (n = 16). Although we control the false-positive rates through permutation tests that have been validated empirically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eklund et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that we lacked the statistical power to detect some effects, and so null results should be interpreted with caution. Second, in this study, we created two qualitatively different task conditions by manipulating both the noise levels and hazard rates. Thus, we cannot attribute any behavioral or neural differences across conditions specifically to changes in either noise levels or hazard rates alone, but rather to how the combinations of these two variables affect the interpretation and use of small errors. Future studies can manipulate hazard rate and noise independently to examine their independent contributions to adaptive learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>People adapt their behavior in response to errors in a task-dependent manner, distinguishing between errors that indicate change-points in the environment versus noise. Here we used MVPA to identify two distinct kinds of neural signals contributing to these adaptive behavioral adjustments. In PPC, neural patterns encoded error information in a task-dependent manner, depending on error magnitude and past errors only under conditions where these were informative of the source of error. In contrast, activity in frontal cortex could predict subsequent choices that could be based on this information. These findings suggest a broad distinction between outcome monitoring in parietal regions and action selection in frontal regions when learning in dynamic and uncertain environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>All procedures were approved by University of Pennsylvania Internal Review Board. We analyzed data from sixteen participants (nine females, seven males, mean age = 23.5, SD = 4.3, range = 18–33 years) recruited for the current study. One additional participant was excluded from analyses because of large head movements during MRI scanning (&gt;10% of timepoint-to-timepoint displacements were &gt;0.5 mm). All participants provided informed consent before the experiment. Participants received a participation fee of $15, as well as extra incentives based on their performance (mean = $15.09, SD = $2.26, range = $8.5–17.5).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Task</title><p>Participants performed a predictive-inference task during MRI scanning. On each trial, participants saw a noisy observation sampled from an unobserved state. The participants’ goal was to predict the location of the noisy observation. To perform this task well, however, they should infer the location of the current state.</p><p>In this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>), there were 10 targets aligned in a circle on the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At the start of each trial, participants had to fixate a central cross for 0.5 s to initialize the trial. After the cross disappeared, participants could choose one of 10 targets (red) by looking at it within 1.5 s and keeping fixation on the chosen target for 0.3 s. Then, an outcome would be shown for 1 s. During the outcome phase, a green dot indicated the chosen target. A purple or cyan target indicated the rewarded target, with color denoting 10 or 20 points of reward value, respectively. At the end of experiment, every 75 points were converted to $0.25 as participants’ extra incentives.</p><p>Participants performed this task in two dynamic conditions separated into two different runs: a high-noise/low-hazard (‘noisy’) condition and an low-noise/high-hazard (‘unstable’) condition. In the noisy condition, the rewarded target could be one of five targets, given the underlying state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The rewarded target probabilities for the relative locations ([−2,–1, 0, 1, 2]) of the current state were [0.05, 0.15, 0.6, 0.15, 0.05]. Thus, the location of the current state was most likely rewarded, but nearby targets could also be rewarded. Occasionally, the state would change its location with a hazard rate of 0.02 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When a change-point happens, the new state would be selected among the ten targets based on a uniform distribution. In the unstable condition, there was no noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). That is, the location of the state would be always rewarded. However, the state was unstable, as the hazard rate in this condition was 0.35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). There were 300 trials in each run.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavior analysis</title><p>We investigated how participants used error feedback flexibly across different conditions. Before the behavioral analysis, we removed two different kinds of trials. First, we removed trials in which participants did not make a choice within the time limit (Unstable: median number of trials = 10.5, range = 1–83; Noisy: median = 10, range = 2–88). Second, we also removed trials in which the location of the chosen target was not on the shortest distance between the previously chosen and previously rewarded targets (Unstable: median = 3, range = 0–24; Noisy: median = 17, range = 5–37). All of the belief-updating models we tested predict that participants’ choice should be along the shortest distance between the previously chosen target and the previously rewarded target. That is, participants should update in a clockwise direction, if the shortest distance to rewarded target was clockwise of the chosen target. Otherwise, they should update in a counterclockwise direction. We removed trials where participants’ update was in the opposite direction of the rewarded target (which would correspond to a learning rate &lt;0) and trials where participants’ update was beyond the location of the rewarded target (which would correspond to a learning rate &gt;1), as this behavior cannot be captured by any of the belief-updating models we tested. Further, this behavior might suggest that participants had lost track of the most recently chosen or rewarded targets. The analysis codes were written in MATLAB and are available at Github (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kao, 2020</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/changhaokao/mvpa_changepoint_fmri">https://github.com/changhaokao/mvpa_changepoint_fmri</ext-link>).</p><p>First, we investigated how fast participants learned the location of the current state. For each condition and participant, we binned trials from trial 0 to trial 20 after change-points. Then, we calculated the probability of choosing the location of the current state for each bin.</p><p>Second, we examined how different magnitudes of errors lead to shifts in behavior. For each condition and participant, we binned trials based on the current error magnitude (from 0 to 5). Then, for each bin, we calculated the probability that participants switch their choice to another target on the subsequent trial. We hypothesized participants would have a lower probability of switching after small error magnitudes (1 or 2) in the noisy condition than in the unstable condition since such errors could be due to environment noise in the noisy condition but would signal a state change in the unstable condition.</p><p>Third, we further investigated how error history influenced participants’ behavioral shifts. Similarly, we binned trials based on the current error magnitude and the error history of the last three trials. Here, we used four bins of error magnitudes (0, 1, 2, 3+). Based on the outcome of correct or error on the last three trials, there were 8 types of error history. For each error magnitude, we calculated the probability of switching for each type of error history. We hypothesized that participants in the noisy condition would tend to switch their choice after small errors more if they had made more errors recently. To test this hypothesis, we ordered the 8 types of error history based on the number of recent errors and calculated the slope of probability of switching against the order of error history. A negative slope means that participants tend to switch as they receive more recent errors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavior modeling</title><p>We fit several different computational models to participants’ choices to evaluate which ones could best account for their behavior in the task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Reduced Bayesian (RB) model</title><p>Previous studies have shown that a reduced Bayesian model, which approximates the full Bayesian ideal observer, could account well for participants’ behavior in dynamic environments similar to the current task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nassar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nassar et al., 2010</xref>).

Before the task, we acquired a T1-weighted MPRAGE structural image (0.9375 × 0.9375 × 1 mm voxels, 192 × 256 matrix, 160 axial slices, TI = 1,100 ms, TR = 1,810 ms, TE = 3.45 ms, flip angle = 9°). During each run of the task, we acquired functional data using a multiband gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence (1.9592 × 1.9592 × 2 mm voxels, 98 × 98 matrix, 72 axial slices tilted 30° from the AC-PC plane, TR = 1,500 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 45°, multiband factor = 4). The scanning time (mean = 24.14 min, SD = 1.47, range = 21.85–30.00) for each run was dependent on the participants’ pace. After the task, fieldmap images (TR = 1,270 ms, TE = 5 ms and 7.46 ms, flip angle = 60°) were acquired.</p><p>Data were preprocessed using FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jenkinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smith et al., 2004</xref>).

In addition, the structural image was normalized to the MNI space (FLIRT). Then, these two transformations were applied to the functional data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>fMRI analysis: univariate activity correlated with CPP and RU</title><p>Using similar procedures to our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>), we examined the effects of CPP and RU on univariate activity. Both the current study and the previous study investigate the computational process and neural mechanisms during learning in dynamic environments. The underlying task structures (which involved noisy observations and sudden change-points) are similar between the two studies, but the two studies used very different visual stimuli and motor demands. We specifically focused on the noisy condition in the current study because it was more similar to the underlying structure, in terms of noisy observations and hazard rate of change-points, to our previous study.</p><p>We investigated the factors of CPP, RU, reward values and residual updates. The trial-by-trial CPP and RU were either estimated from the RB model with subjective estimates of hazard rate and noise (as this was the best-fitting model in the current study, analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) or from the RB model with true estimates of hazard rate and noise (as this corresponds to how correlates of CPP and RU were identified in our previous study, analyses presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Here we further smoothed the preprocessed fMRI data with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. We included several trial-by-trial regressors of interest in the GLM: onsets of outcome, CPP, RU, reward value, and residual update. Six motion parameters were also included as confounds. To control false-positive rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eklund et al., 2016</xref>), statistical testing was implemented through one-sample cluster-mass permutation tests with 5000 iterations. The cluster-forming threshold was uncorrected voxel p&lt;0.01. Statistical testing was then based on the corrected cluster <italic>p</italic> value. For the conjunction analyses, we used the same procedure as the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>). We kept regions that passed the corrected threshold and showed the same sign of effects. For these conjunction tests, we only kept regions that have at least 10 contiguous voxels.</p><p>Because the number of participants was fewer in this study (n = 16) than in the previous study (n = 32), we might have lower power to detect effects in the whole-brain analyses. Thus, we also implemented ROI analyses. We selected seven ROIs that showed the conjunction effects of CPP, RU and reward value in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>) and tested the effects of CPP and RU in these ROIs.</p><p>We found previously that for a similar task, the presence or absence of reward on a given trial influenced both belief-updating behavior and some aspects of its neural representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McGuire et al., 2014</xref>). To further examine those effects, here we included two different earnable values (10 versus 20 points). However, we did not find any significant effects of earnable values on either belief updating (β<sub>4</sub> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ13">Equation 13</xref> was not significantly different than zero) or neural activity (for the contrast of high versus low earnable value). We therefore do not further consider the effects of this manipulation in the current report. We speculate that this lack of an effect contrasts from our earlier finding because here we used high versus low earnable values, whereas in that study we used the presence versus absence of earnable value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>fMRI analysis: multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA)</title><p>We implemented MVPA to understand the neural representation of error signals and subsequent choices. Our analyses focus on the multi-voxel pattern when participants received an outcome. Before implementing MVPA, we estimated trial-by-trial beta values using the unsmoothed preprocessed fMRI data. We used the general linear model (GLM) to estimate the beta weights for each trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mumford et al., 2012</xref>). In each GLM, the first regressor is the trial of interest and the second combines the rest of trials in the same condition. These two regressors were then convolved with a gamma hemodynamic response function. In addition, six motion parameters were included as control regressors. We repeated this process (one GLM per trial) to estimate trial-by-trial beta values for all the trials in the two conditions. We then used these beta values as observations for MVPA. A whole-brain searchlight was implemented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kriegeskorte et al., 2006</xref>). In each searchlight, a sphere with the diameter of 5 voxels (10 mm) was formed, and the pattern of activity across the voxels within the sphere were used to run MVPA.</p><p>A support vector machine (SVM) with a linear kernel was used to decode different error signals and choices in our whole-brain searchlight analysis. We implemented SVM through the LIBSVM toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>). To avoid overfitting, we used 3-fold cross-validation, with one fold used as testing data and the other two as training data. Training data were used to train the classifier and then this classifier was used on testing data to examine the classification accuracy. In linear SVM, a free parameter <italic>c</italic> regularizes the trade-off between decreasing training error and increasing generalization. Thus, during the training of classifier, the training data were further split into 3-folds to select the optimal value of the parameter <italic>c</italic> through cross-validation. We pick the optimal value for <italic>c</italic> from [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000] and this optimal parameter should maximize the cross-validation accuracy. Then, we used the optimal parameter <italic>c</italic> to train the model again based on the entire training data and calculated the classification accuracy on the testing data. We repeated this procedure with each of the three folds held out as testing data and calculated the average of the classification accuracy. To minimize the influence of different number of trials for each category on the classification accuracy, we used balanced accuracy. For balanced accuracy, we first calculated the classification accuracy within each category, and then averaged the accuracies across all categories. The baseline balanced accuracy was also validated via permutations with 5000 iterations. For each permutation, each trial was randomly assigned one category with a probability proportional to the number of trials in that category among all the trials. We then used the average of balanced accuracy across these iterations as the baseline accuracy. The baseline accuracy for two categories was 50% and for three categories was 33%.</p><p>We first examined how the multi-voxel neural pattern on the current trial could discriminate correct versus error on the current trial or error magnitudes on error trials. For the analysis of error magnitudes, we split trials into three bins of error magnitude: 1, 2, and 3+.</p><p>We next examined how the multi-voxel neural pattern on the current trial could discriminate whether the previous trial was an error or not. We also investigated how the classification of past errors differs conditional on the type of the current trial. We classified trial <italic>t-1</italic> as correct or error separately for four different types of current trials: correct trials, error trials, trials with error magnitudes of 0 or 3+ and trials with error magnitudes of 1 or 2. We differentiated between trials with error magnitudes of 0 or 3+ and trials with error magnitudes of 1 or two because error magnitudes of 0 or 3+ provide unambiguous evidence regarding a change of state in the noisy condition while error magnitudes of 1 or two provide ambiguous evidence about a change of the state in the noisy condition.</p><p>Lastly, we examined how the multi-voxel neural pattern on the current trial could classify the choice on the next trial. In this analysis, we focused only on the trials with error magnitudes of 1 or two in the noisy condition, because only under these conditions were participants similarly likely to switch versus stay. For these trials, we examined whether the multi-voxel pattern on the current trial predicted whether the participant stayed or switched on the next trial.</p><p>After obtaining the classification accuracy for each participant, we subtracted the baseline accuracy from the classification accuracy. Before conducting a group-level test, we smoothed these individual accuracy maps with a 6 mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. To control false-positive rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eklund et al., 2016</xref>), statistical testing was implemented through one-sample cluster-mass permutation tests with 5000 iterations. We used uncorrected voxel p&lt;0.01 to form a cluster and estimated the corrected cluster <italic>p</italic> value for each cluster. For comparison, we report our results using other cluster-forming procedures in supplemental analyses. For the conjunction analyses, we used the same procedure described above.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from National Institute of Mental Health (R01-MH098899 to JIG and JWK) and National Science Foundation (1533623 to J.I.G. and J.W.K.).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript reports an fMRI study examining error processing in a predictive inference task. The task involves different conditions/contexts defined by their level of noise and volatility. Using MVPA, the authors identified differences in the neural representations of error magnitude and error history in posterior parietal cortex between these conditions. Moreover, behavioral adjustments could be decoded from activity in dorsomedial frontal, anterior cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this is an interesting study addressing a timely question on adaptive behavior, and that the manuscript will be informative to readers interested in decision making, learning, and cognitive control. They further found the experimental design and the general approach convincing, and the results robust. However, there were several concerns regarding analysis and interpretation that need to be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Results in Figure 6 are interesting as they show that behavioral adjustments can be predicted from brain activity, replicating the findings by Hampton and O'Doherty, 2007. However, it is not clear that they can be considered &quot;context-dependent&quot;. This analysis is based on one condition only, and it is therefore not clear whether or not these signals are context-dependent. The reviewers understand that because there are no ambiguous errors in the unstable context the behavioral adjustment analysis is not possible in this context, and thus, no comparisons across contexts can be performed. The authors can choose to keep these results in the paper, but they should not refer to them as &quot;context-dependent&quot; anywhere in the manuscript, including the title and Abstract.</p><p>2) The experimental design uses noise level and volatility to define contexts. This is potentially problematic. First, we do not know whether differences between conditions are driven by noise levels, hazard rate, or both. This needs to be discussed. Second, and more importantly, because the noise level is zero in one condition, one context is deterministic whereas the other is probabilistic. This fundamentally changes the meaning of errors and error magnitude between the contexts, such that there is no meaning to error magnitude in the unstable condition (in the sense that larger errors would be any different from smaller errors). Instead, it is a nominal signal that informs subjects of what the new target is, such that an error of 1 carries the same information as an error of 6. Why would such a signal be encoded in a ordinal or linear fashion as in the high-noise condition, where the magnitude of the error is meaningful? Thus, given that contexts are defined by whether or not error magnitude is meaningful, is it really surprising that the brain responds differently to error magnitude? Would the authors expect to find the same results if context was defined by a variable that does not directly affect the meaning of error magnitude (e.g. learning about target locations in different environments)? This boils down to the question of whether these are context-dependent errors, or just fundamentally different errors. Given these issues, reviewers felt that describing the results as &quot;context-dependent&quot; is slightly misleading. To be clear, reviewers feel that the findings are important and interesting, but they agreed that this interpretation needs to be revised throughout the paper (including title and Abstract).</p><p>3) There were several methodological/statistical concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>3.1) The low number of subjects (N = 16 – 1 = 15) may call into question the generalizability of the findings. It is relieving that the univariate analysis largely replicates McGuire et al., 2014, but the MVPA analyses are novel and it is hard to assess their generalizability and the potential of false- positive findings. At the very least, this need to be acknowledged in the Discussion.</p><p>3.2) The second condition under which trials were removed from analysis is unclear (subsection “Behavior analysis”). What was the exact criterion to identify these trials? Which error magnitude was still acceptable? Did this mean that, after trial removal, large error magnitudes were always and only associated with change points, and does this bias the results in favor of the author's hypothesis?</p><p>3.3) The uncorrected threshold of p &lt; 0.005 is prone to false positives (Eklund et al., 2016), and the authors should use p &lt; 0.001 to define clusters, as suggested in that paper.</p><p>3.4) Please clearly describe how &quot;balanced accuracy&quot; was computed, and perform random permutations to determine empirical chance levels and use those as baselines.</p><p>4) It was unclear why the RB model was used in this study that need to be addressed.</p><p>4.1) The two factors in the experimental design do not seem to map directly onto hazard rate (H) and noise level (K). Indeed, H and K appear to be correlated: in a fast change environment, H should be high by definition, K also needs to be high in order to account for frequent changes of reward target.</p><p>4.2) Figure 3—figure supplement 1B: The RU values in the unstable condition is lower than those in the high-noise condition. This is opposite to what is shown in Figure 3B. In other words, this result shows a discrepancy between behavioral data-derived model output and output from true model parameters, which may suggest that the model does not account for the behavior as expected.</p><p>4.3) The current model-based behavioral results do not support a direct relationship between model parameters and behavior; instead, the authors just show that both model parameters and behavior change as a function of experimental conditions.</p><p>4.4) The model-based fMRI results are mostly replications of previous studies and are not linked to the key results (e.g. Figures 4-6).

We have changed “context-dependent” to “task-dependent” throughout the paper and have substantially revised our interpretations of these findings. For example:</p><p>“Second, in this study, we created two qualitatively different task conditions by manipulating both the noise levels and hazard rates. […] Future studies can manipulate hazard rate and noise independently to examine their independent contributions to adaptive learning.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There were several methodological/statistical concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>3.1) The low number of subjects (N = 16 – 1 = 15) may call into question the generalizability of the findings.

What was the exact criterion to identify these trials? Which error magnitude was still acceptable? Did this mean that, after trial removal, large error magnitudes were always and only associated with change points, and does this bias the results in favor of the author's hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following clarification:</p><p>“All of the belief updating models we tested predict that participants’ choice should be along the shortest distance between the previously chosen target and the previously rewarded target. […] Further, this behavior might suggest that participants had lost track of the most recently chosen or rewarded targets.”</p><p>Because so few trials were removed, this procedure had little or no influence on the current results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.3) The uncorrected threshold of p &lt; 0.005 is prone to false positives (Eklund et al., 2016), and the authors should use p &lt; 0.001 to define clusters, as suggested in that paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Eklund et al., 2016, show that non-parametric permutation tests empirically control the false positive rates at nominal levels, and this is true for both of the cluster-defining thresholds they examined (uncorrected voxel <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 and uncorrected voxel <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Note that we have corrected in the revised manuscript that the threshold we used of <italic>t</italic>=2.6 corresponds to an uncorrected voxel <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01. As the Abstract of Eklund et al., 2016, states, “By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference.” See also their Figure 1. That is, they do not find that a lower cluster-forming threshold is prone to false positives when combined with non-parametric methods of cluster-wise inference, in contrast to their findings for parametric methods of cluster-wise inference.</p><p>In response to this comment, though, we did examine how the cluster-forming approach impacted our results, and we report these findings in Figure 5—figure supplement 1. We evaluated two alternative approaches to thresholding: threshold-free cluster enhancement and a cluster-forming threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001. Note that in both cases we use non-parametric cluster-wise inference through permutation testing to control the false-positive rates. These two methods yield clusters that are larger (threshold-free cluster enhancement) or smaller (cluster-forming threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) than the approach we use in the main manuscript (cluster-forming threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). Given that the appropriate interpretation of observing a significant cluster is that there is a significant effect somewhere within that cluster, these two methods therefore yield greater (cluster-forming threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) or lesser (threshold-free cluster enhancement) spatial specificity than the approach in the main manuscript. In general, both methods yield similar main results, with a loss of spatial specificity when using threshold-free cluster enhancement and some loss of sensitivity (one of three effects does not remain significant) when using a cluster-forming threshold of <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001. We further stress that, based on the results of Eklund et al., 2016, none of these three methods is more or less conservative than the others, because they all control the cluster-wise false positive rate at <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. Where they differ is in their spatial sensitivity/specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.4) Please clearly describe how &quot;balanced accuracy&quot; was computed, and perform random permutations to determine empirical chance levels and use those as baselines.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following sentences to clarify balanced accuracy:</p><p>“For balanced accuracy, we first calculated the classification accuracy within each category, and then averaged the accuracies across all categories. […] The baseline accuracy for two categories was 50% and for three categories was 33%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It was unclear why the RB model was used in this study that need to be addressed.</p><p>4.1) The two factors in the experimental design do not seem to map directly onto hazard rate (H) and noise level (K). Indeed, H and K appear to be correlated: in a fast change environment, H should be high by definition, K also needs to be high in order to account for frequent changes of reward target.</p></disp-quote><p>We manipulated these two factors, hazard rate and noise level, to create two qualitatively different conditions where participants should use small errors differently. In the reduced Bayesian model, the parameters <italic>H</italic> and <italic>K</italic> represent a participant’s subjective estimates of the hazard rate and noise level in a given condition, respectively. Fits of the reduced Bayesian model indicated that participants differentiated between hazard rates but not noise levels across the two conditions. Though <italic>K</italic> is higher than its objective value in low noise/high hazard condition, it did not need to be so in order to account for the frequent changes of reward target. Both <italic>H</italic> and <italic>K</italic> influence both CPP and RU values, which in turn influence choices to switch targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.2) Figure 3—figure supplement 1B: The RU values in the unstable condition is lower than those in the high-noise condition. This is opposite to what is shown in Figure 3B. In other words, this result shows a discrepancy between behavioral data-derived model output and output from true model parameters, which may suggest that the model does not account for the behavior as expected.</p></disp-quote><p>The “behavioral data-derived model output” was based on fits to the behavioral data, with subjective estimates of noise level and hazard rate determined by free parameters. This model thus was fully capable of accounting for behavior of subjects using the true, objective values (i.e. the free parameters could have settled on those values). However, consistent with our earlier results (e.g. Nassar et al., 2010; Li et al., 2019), that is not what we found here. Instead, behavior tended to follow principles of the normative model but based on subjective estimates of those parameters that tended to differ from their objective values (using formal model selection, models with both free parameters were superior to models using objective values for both hazard rate and noise level, and to models using just objective values for noise level and just hazard rate as a free parameter).</p><p>Note that, consistent with the suggestions below, both of these figures are now provided (behavioral predictions and neural activations using subjective estimates in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and true values in Figure 2—figure supplement 4) and the corresponding section of the text has been shortened.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.3) The current model-based behavioral results do not support a direct relationship between model parameters and behavior; instead, the authors just show that both model parameters and behavior change as a function of experimental conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>It is not true that we “just show that both model parameters and behavior change as a function of experimental conditions.” The model was fit directly to behavioral data. Based on these fits, we show that the fitted reduced Bayesian model accounts for participants’ behavior well across different conditions. We also used formal model-selection procedures (BIC) to show that the reduced Bayesian model accounted for behavior better than: 1) an approximately ideal observer that uses the true values of noise level and hazard rate; 2) a model that assumes a fixed learning rate in each condition; and 3) models that supplement the reduced Bayesian model with other features. The contribution of what is now Figure 2—figure supplement 3 is to describe how the reduced Bayesian model accounts for task-dependent behavioral responses to errors (i.e. the influence of error magnitude and error history in the noisy condition), by showing how the key internal representations that govern the behavior of the model (CPP and RU) change as a function of experimental conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.4) The model-based fMRI results are mostly replications of previous studies and are not linked to the key results (e.g. Figures 4-6). That is, it is unclear what the model really adds to the conclusions of this paper.</p><p>4.5) Given these concerns, reviewers suggested to move model-related results to the supplementary materials.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the primary value of the model-based fMRI results is to demonstrate that we replicate activations we observed in a previous study with the new task used in this study. Though we think reporting such replication is important, we do not want to distract from the key results of this paper. We therefore have moved the model-based fMRI results to Figure 2—figure supplements 3 and 4.</p></body></sub-article></article>
