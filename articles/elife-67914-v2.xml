By one hypothesis, [Ca2+]o screens surface charge, reducing voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) activation and by another [Ca2+]o activates Calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) closing the sodium-leak channel (NALCN). Here we report that neocortical neurons from CaSR-deficient (Casr-/-) mice had more negative resting potentials and did not fire spontaneously in reduced divalent-containing solution (T0.2) in contrast with wild-type (WT). However, after setting membrane potential to −70 mV, T0.2 application similarly depolarized and increased action potential firing in Casr-/- and WT neurons. Enhanced activation of VGSCs was the dominant contributor to the depolarization and increase in excitability by T0.2 and occurred due to hyperpolarizing shifts in VGSC window currents. CaSR deletion depolarized VGSC window currents but did not affect NALCN activation. Regulation of VGSC gating by external divalents is the key mechanism mediating divalent-dependent changes in neocortical neuron excitability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>surface charge</kwd><kwd>VGSC</kwd><kwd>NALCN</kwd><kwd>CaSR</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX002547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM134110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Stephen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IK6BX004835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Wenhan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX003453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Wenhan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>External calcium regulates neuronal excitability via its actions on voltage-gated sodium channels but not by regulating NALCN via the calcium-sensing receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Excitable tissues are strongly regulated by extracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jackman and Regehr, 2017</xref>). Movement of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, through voltage-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VACC), to the intracellular space is central to many of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nanou and Catterall, 2018</xref>). However, a distinct, extracellular mechanism that is independent of synaptic transmission also contributes to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent regulation of nerve and muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrian and Gelfan, 1933</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weidmann, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frankenhaeuser, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>). Decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> substantially facilitate spontaneous and evoked action potential generation which represents increased intrinsic excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weidmann, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frankenhaeuser, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>). In the brain, physiological neuronal activity decreases [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicholson et al., 1978</xref>) leading to further increases in action potential firing in neighboring neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>). The firing patterns and computational properties of local circuits are impacted substantially by this positive feedback leading to changes in brain behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Titley et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, under pathological conditions, larger decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> occur, resulting in even greater changes in circuit activity, and implicating [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability in the pathogenesis of brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayata and Lauritzen, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Classical studies proposed that the mechanism underlying [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability centers on voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) sensitivity to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was proposed to shift the effective voltage-dependent gating of the sodium conductance in the hyperpolarizing direction by reducing the screening of local negative charges on the extracellular face of the membrane or channel by external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hille, 1968</xref>). This surface potential screening model accounted for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability in nerves and muscle without a need for additional molecular players and was widely accepted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hille, 2001</xref>), although direct binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the VGSC was also proposed as contributing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong and Cota, 1991</xref>). However, this theory was challenged by new data demonstrating that activation of the sodium leak channel (NALCN), a non-selective cation channel, by the intracellular proteins, UNC79 and UNC80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>) was necessary for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability to occur in hippocampal neurons. Following the deletion of NALCN or UNC79, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability was completely lost suggesting the increased excitability resulted from the activation of the non-rectifying NALCN which depolarized neurons and increased the likelihood of action potential generation <italic>independent</italic> of changes in VGSC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), was hypothesized to detect and transduce the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> changes and signal to the downstream multistep pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). CaSR is well-positioned as a candidate [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> detector because at nerve terminals it detects [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and regulates a non-selective cation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2010</xref>) and because it transduces changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> into NALCN activity following heterologous co-expression of CaSR, NALCN, UNC79, and UNC80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). Interest in the UNC79-UNC80-NALCN pathway has also risen, due to its essential role in the maintenance of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2007</xref>), the regulation of circadian rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lear et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flourakis et al., 2015</xref>), and because mutations of UNC80 and NALCN cause neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by development delay and hypotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sayed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we address the question of whether the G-protein mediated NALCN pathway or VGSCs transduce the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent effects on excitability. We test if CaSR is a modulator of neuronal excitability via its action on a nonselective cation channel, determine the impact of CaSR expression on factors of intrinsic neuronal excitability, and examine the relative contributions of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-regulated changes on VGSC and NALCN gating. In recordings from neocortical neurons, isolated by pharmacological block of excitatory and inhibitory inputs, we determine that neuronal firing is increased by decreasing external divalent concentrations and that this is almost entirely attributable to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent shifts in VGSC gating. Surprisingly, CaSR deletion substantially shifted VGSC gating, but had no effect on NALCN sensitivity to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. Taken together our experiments indicate that acute [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent increases in neuronal excitability result from changes in VGSC and NALCN gating and that CaSR contributes by an, as yet, uncharacterized action on VGSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CaSR and divalent-dependent neuronal excitability</title><p>Increased excitability following the reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability) was eliminated by deletion of UNC79 or NALCN in neurons, challenging the long-standing hypothesis that local or diffuse surface charge screening of VGSCs mediated these effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). But how were changes in external divalent ion concentrations transduced to UNC79 and NALCN? We tested if CaSR provided the link, by comparing excitability in wild-type (WT) and nestin Cre-recombinase expressing CaSR null-mutant (Nes<sup>Cre</sup>Casr<sup>fl/fl</sup> abbreviated as <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) neurons that were genotyped by PCR (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2008</xref>). Quantification by RT-qPCR indicated &gt;98% reduction in the <italic>Casr</italic> expression levels in neocortical cultures produced from <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to Cre-positive WT (<italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Current clamp recordings were performed to measure the intrinsic, spontaneous action potential firing rate from cultured, neocortical neurons. The cells were also pharmacologically isolated to prevent the confounding influence on action potential firing of changes in synaptic transmission following alterations of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (glutamatergic and GABAergic activity blocked by 10 µM CNQX, 50 µM APV, and 10 µM Gabazine). After establishing the whole-cell configuration, we measured the spontaneous action potential firing rates of conventional WT (conWT), <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic>, and <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons in physiological Tyrode solution (T<sub>1.1</sub>; containing 1.1 mM) at the resting membrane potential (RMP) and then in reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-containing Tyrode (T<sub>0.2</sub>; containing 0.2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]). CaSR and sodium conductance gating are both sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> being two to three times more potent in both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1993</xref>). Consequently, we modified the concentrations of both divalents to utilize a greater fraction of the dynamic range of the phenomenon under study. The reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> caused an increase in spontaneous action potential firing in both types of WT (conventional and <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic>) neurons within 15 s of the solution change that was substantially attenuated in the <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle row). This divalent-dependent neuronal excitability was reversed within 10 s by changing the bath solution back to physiological external divalent concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower row). The pooled data from repeat experiments indicated that on average the conWT and <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> neurons were equally sensitive to decreased extracellular divalent concentration and had similarly low spontaneous basal levels of activity (&lt;0.1 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Two-way repeated measures (RM) ANOVA confirmed a significant interaction indicating the response to changes of external divalent concentration were dependent on genotype (F (2,54)=3.193, p=0.049, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Post-hoc tests confirmed that the reduction in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> substantially increased action potential frequency in conWT and <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> but not <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons (Sidak compensated for multiple comparisons here and in all later tests, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, p=0.0009,&lt;0.0001, and = 0.6697, respectively). Having confirmed that the conWT and <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> neurons responded quantitatively the same to decreases in external divalents we used <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> neurons alone as controls in subsequent experiments examining CaSR function. These data indicate that CaSR deletion substantially attenuates the increase in spontaneous firing at the RMP produced by reductions in external divalent concentrations in neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CaSR deletion reduces divalent-dependent excitability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spontaneous voltage traces at RMP following the application of solutions with different divalent concentrations (T<sub>1</sub>.<sub>1</sub> (upper traces), T<sub>0.2</sub> (middle), and T<sub>1.1</sub> recovery (lower)) recorded in three individual neurons with or without CaSR (conWT (black), <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (blue) and <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (red)).

To address the first of these questions, we compared the response of <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> and <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons to changes in extracellular divalent concentrations after removing the confounding variation in RMP. After establishing a stable current-clamp recording in T<sub>1.1</sub> we injected a standing current (I<sub>a</sub>) until the resting membrane potential was −70 mV. We then recorded for 50 s before switching the bath solution to T<sub>0.2</sub>. As before, there was a small depolarization followed by an increase in action potential frequency in <italic>Nes<sup>Cre</sup></italic> neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). To test if this increase in excitability was fully attributable to divalent-dependent depolarization we adjusted the standing current (I<sub>b</sub>) until the membrane potential was −70 mV and then measured the action potential frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the exemplar, action potential firing was reduced by the hyperpolarization but remained higher in T<sub>0.2</sub> at −70 mV than in T<sub>1.1</sub> at −70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>) confirming CaSR-mediated depolarization was not acting alone to increase the excitability. The <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons responded similarly to T<sub>0.2</sub> and hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>) indicating the effect was not mediated by CaSR.

However, in some neurons, T<sub>1.1</sub> elicited an outward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>), whereas in others there was an inward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>) indicating the presence of two types of TTX resistant divalent-sensitive pathways. Presumably, NALCN was contributing to the divalent-dependent TTX-resistant effect observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. Co-application of Gd<sup>3+</sup> (10 µM) following block of VGSCs with TTX, resulted in a small inward deflection of the average basal current in solution T<sub>1.1</sub> and largely inhibited sensitivity to concomitant decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). The reduced sensitivity of neurons to the reduction of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in the presence of TTX, suggests that VGSCs are a major contributor to the depolarizing current elicited by low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o.</sub> Using serial subtraction of the basal currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we compared the size of the TTX-sensitive (−28.2 ± 5.3 pA), Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive (−5.7 ± 3.4 pA) and remaining (3.4 ± 2.0 pA) divalent-dependent currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; RM-ANOVA, F (1.495, 17.94)=13.30, p=0.0007, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table13">Table 13</xref>).

We examined the voltage-dependence of the contributions of VGSCs, NALCN, and this second divalent-dependent TTX-resistant current to better characterize divalent-dependent excitability. We used 50 ms voltage steps between −100 and −50 mV and averaged the current over the last 5 ms of the step. Three additional major effects are illustrated by the exemplar current traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). First, in the absence of blockers, the switch from T<sub>1.1</sub> to T<sub>0.2</sub> substantially increased the number of large, rapidly inactivating inward currents even at −70 mV following hyperpolarizing steps. Second, in TTX, low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> increased the linear inward and rectifying outward currents. Third, in the presence of TTX and Gd<sup>3+</sup> changing between T<sub>1.1</sub> and T<sub>0.2</sub> had little effect suggesting Gd<sup>3+</sup> is blocking both NALCN and the second divalent-dependent TTX-resistant current. These observations were confirmed in the average current-voltage plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) where it is clear that at −80 to −100 mV the major divalent-dependent currents are inward and resistant to TTX and sensitive to Gd<sup>3+</sup>, whereas at −70 to −50 mV the largest divalent-dependent currents are TTX-sensitive. The divalent-dependent effects were calculated by subtracting the currents recorded in T<sub>1.1</sub> from those in T<sub>0.2</sub> under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, broken red), in the presence of TTX (broken blue) and TTX plus Gd<sup>3+</sup> (solid green). The TTX-sensitive (solid red) and Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive (solid blue) divalent-dependent currents were obtained by additional subtraction (broken red minus broken blue and broken blue minus green). The average divalent-dependent current carried by VGSCs only became evident once the neurons were depolarized above −80 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). The time course of deactivation of the persistent divalent-dependent VGSC currents was observed following hyperpolarization from −70 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, middle). At more negative potentials, the Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive current accounted for all the divalent-dependent current and traces showed an ohmic voltage dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). However, the Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive current reversed at −60 mV and outward currents were elicited by steps to −60 and −50 mV that exhibited a voltage-dependent activation and inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>, right-hand). This is consistent with the Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive current consisting of the sum of NALCN and an outward voltage-dependent current. Assuming conservatively that all of the Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive current at −100 mV could be attributed to NALCN and employing the channel’s linear voltage-dependence and zero mV reversal potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>), then the amplitude of NALCN currents could be estimated over the voltage range −100 to 0 mV (broken black line, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). By interpolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, inset), the contribution of NALCN and VGSCs to divalent-dependent currents were equal at −77 mV with the contribution from VGSCs increasing with depolarization. A similar analysis of divalent-dependent currents in <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons indicated that the contribution of VGSCs was greater than that of NALCN once membrane potentials were depolarized beyond −72 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data indicate that divalent-dependent currents around the resting membrane that contribute to divalent-dependent excitability are mainly attributable to VGSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Changes in resting potential resulting from lowered divalents are mediated mainly by VGSCs</title><p>The complex architecture of neocortical neurons restricted our ability to clamp the membrane potential following the activation of large, rapid VGSC currents. Thus, we re-examined the contribution of VGSCs and NALCN to the depolarizations that mediate divalent-dependent excitability in current clamp recordings from conWT neurons. Consistent with earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), switching from T<sub>1.1</sub> to T<sub>0.2</sub> depolarized the membrane potential from −70 mV by 7.2 ± 1.5 mV (n = 12) and increased spontaneous action potential firing in pharmacologically isolated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). We used TTX and Gd<sup>3+</sup> to measure the contributions of VGSCs and NALCN respectively to these divalent-dependent depolarizations. TTX blocked action potential generation, as expected, but also hyperpolarized the membrane potential indicating that VGSCs were open in T<sub>0.2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A1</xref>) and T<sub>1.1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A2</xref>). The switch from T<sub>0.2</sub> to T<sub>1.1</sub> in TTX resulted in a hyperpolarization, consistent with divalent-dependent NALCN closure, in some neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> 1 lower trace and B). Other neurons depolarized with the switch to T<sub>1.1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> 2 lower trace and B) consistent with a divalent-dependent outward current similar to that observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>.

The VGSC currents were the major contributor to divalent-dependent currents over the −77 to −30 mV voltage range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). These findings indicate that VGSCs are the predominant contributor to the depolarizations that lead to action potential generation at lower external divalent concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, gray bar).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Extracellular calcium concentration regulates both synaptic transmission and intrinsic neuronal excitability, thereby strongly affecting the probability of action potential generation. Consequently, physiological and pathological changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> will impact neuronal computation in a complex manner. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying divalent-dependent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability and tested if CaSR is transducing decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> into NALCN-mediated depolarizations to trigger action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). We found no evidence that this specific mechanism was active in neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Instead, we determined that the vast majority of divalent-dependent neuronal excitability was mediated via VGSCs in three ways. Decreasing the concentration of external divalents activated VGSCs at the resting membrane potential and depolarized the membrane toward the action potential threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This occurred because the decreased divalent concentration hyperpolarized the VGSC window current toward the membrane potential increasing sodium currents and the likelihood of action potential generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Unexpectedly the deletion of CaSR modulated VGSC gating, decreasing the sensitivity of current activation to depolarization via an unidentified mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Deletion of CaSR also indirectly affected action potential generation by modestly hyperpolarizing the membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While the actions of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> on VGSCs were responsible for the vast majority of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent neuronal excitability, using Gd<sup>3+</sup> we isolated small divalent-dependent inward currents in about half of the neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive currents presumably reflected activation of NALCN, and were unaffected by CaSR deletion, but their relatively small size compared to TTX-sensitive divalent-dependent inward currents indicate that they would be minor contributors to divalent-dependent excitability compared to VGSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).</p><p>The fractions of the divalent-dependent currents and depolarizations that were sensitive to TTX were surprisingly large compared to those that were Gd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>) indicating the relative importance of VGSC- and NALCN-mediated contributions to divalent-dependent excitability respectively. The resistance of NALCN to TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Swayne et al., 2009</xref>) reassures that the relatively large TTX-sensitive component is due to selective block of VGSC currents. Persistent subthreshold VGSC currents have been shown to determine spiking rates in other central neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taddese and Bean, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorelova and Seamans, 2015</xref>) and so the increased VGSC currents we observed in T<sub>0.2</sub> are well-positioned to explain the increased action potential frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We are unable to determine from these experiments which neuronal compartment is most affected by the change in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorelova and Seamans, 2015</xref>). However, the physiological impact of VGSC-mediated divalent-dependent excitability may be enormous overall because of the dynamic nature of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>in vivo where it decreases from basal (1.1–1.2 mM) by 30–80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nicholson et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pietrobon and Moskowitz, 2014</xref>). The overall computational effects of physiological decrements in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> will be complex because the increased action potential generation due to changes on VGSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) will be confounded by the impact of reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through VACCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hess et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Williams et al., 2012</xref>), reduced excitatory synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vyleta and Smith, 2011</xref>), and altered CaSR-mediated signaling at the nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Phillips et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vyleta and Smith, 2011</xref>).</p><p>It remains unclear why NALCN was the dominant effector of divalent-dependent excitability in hippocampal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>) but not neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Could our use of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> rather than [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> alone be responsible? We changed divalents simultaneously to provide a strong stimulus to CaSR-signaling and VGSC gating, both of which are sensitive to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [Mg<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1993</xref>). Consequently, the same pathways were expected to respond to changes in divalents or [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> alone, since the potentially confounding effects on synaptic transmission were blocked in our experiments. Another difference is that we counted spontaneous action potentials as the main measure of excitability whereas others have focused on action potentials elicited by direct injection. We used spontaneous activity to allow us to isolate the depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) that was hypothesized to arise from NALCN activation and trigger action potentials following the reduction of external divalent concentration changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Spontaneous and depolarization-elicited action potentials have been recognized as forms of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability for &gt;60 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957</xref>) and both types of activity were increased here when external divalent concentrations were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Because we observed increased excitability, despite the injection of a current to bring the steady state membrane potential back to that recorded in T<sub>1.1</sub>, mechanisms other than a voltage-independent non-selective cation channel, like NALCN, must have been active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similarly, the increased spikes elicited by transient current injections in low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in hippocampal neurons occurred after the steady state membrane potential was set to −80 mV using a longer current injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). The long injection would have reversed the NALCN-mediated depolarization in low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and so the mechanism by which the increased excitability occurred is unclear. One possible explanation is that at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> NALCN could have been further activated by shorter depolarizing current injections; however, this is at odds with the lack of voltage-dependence of NALCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). Could NALCN be operating via a different mechanism? One possibility is that NALCN activation is enhancing excitability measured at the soma by enhancing calcium entry into nerve terminals (directly or modifying the action potential waveform and VACC activation) and strengthening excitatory synaptic transmission onto the neuron under study. This would require that the enhancement of synaptic transmission by NALCN be greater than the reduction due to reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neher and Sakaba, 2008</xref>) but could be addressed by recording directly from terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ritzau-Jost et al., 2021</xref>) or by determining if NALCN deletion has the same effect after blocking glutamatergic transmission. However, the loss of NALCN could be contributing to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent changes in excitability independent of a depolarization based on other reports. A number of mechanisms have been postulated to explain how a persistent sodium leak into excitable cells at rest can affect excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sokolov et al., 2007</xref>). Such mechanisms or other compensatory changes in neuronal function, as observed with null-mutant animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jun et al., 1999</xref>), could arise from the loss of NALCN and possibly contribute to the reduced sensitivity of hippocampal neurons to decreased [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>). Lastly, the apparent difference between the studies could reflect different properties of hippocampal and neocortical neurons. While possible it still remains unclear why the deletion of NALCN or UNC-79 completely ablated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-dependent excitability in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lu et al., 2010</xref>) since these neurons contain VGSCs that retain sensitivity to changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isaev et al., 2012</xref>). However, if the UNC79-UNC80-NALCN pathway modulates VGSC function this could explain how loss of NALCN or UNC-79 could delete acute divalent-dependent changes in VGSC function and excitability. NALCN appears to transduce [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>- and G-protein-dependent excitability in other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Philippart and Khaliq, 2018</xref>) but GPCRs other than CaSR may be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tabata and Kano, 2004</xref>) and under certain conditions Ca<sup>2+</sup> directly blocks NALCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chua et al., 2020</xref>). Further characterization of the UNC79-UNC80-NALCN signaling pathway is essential given the major changes in neurological function that have been described following mutations of NALCN or upstream co-molecules such as UNC79 and UNC80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stray-Pedersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourque et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuptanon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In a small fraction of the neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) there was a modest inward current or depolarization with the lowering of extracellular divalent concentration once VGSCs had been blocked. In a few cases, they were sensitive to 10 µM Gd<sup>3+</sup> consistent with a NALCN-mediated effect and those that were resistant were consistent with other divalent-dependent non-selective cation channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ma et al., 2012b</xref>). However, deletion of CaSR did not decrease divalent-dependent depolarizations and after membrane potential matching did not impact divalent-dependent excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). While CaSR-NALCN signaling did not contribute to divalent-dependent excitability in neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) it was clear that Casr<sup>-/-</sup> neurons were substantially less sensitive to changes [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> sensitivity in these neurons is attributable to the combination of altered VGSC gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>) and the hyperpolarized RMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Although CaSR did not affect the amplitude of the shift in V<sub>0.5</sub> following the switch to T<sub>0.2</sub>, the gating characteristics of VGSC activation was depolarized by loss of CaSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3EF</xref>). Could CaSR stimulation activate G-proteins and regulate the V<sub>0.5</sub> for VGSC currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>)? In neocortical neurons, G-protein activation hyperpolarized VGSC gating and this was blocked by GDPβS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mattheisen et al., 2018</xref>) which is inconsistent with the effect we observed here. Other possible explanations are that CaSR could regulate VGSC subunit expression or post translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cantrell et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), and this may represent a compensatory mechanism similar to that observed with other mutant mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jun et al., 1999</xref>). Loss of CaSR also hyperpolarized the neocortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and this may have been due to decreased function of depolarizing components or stimulation of hyperpolarizing elements. There are a number of candidate channels and pumps that have been shown to regulate the RMP in cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tavalin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Talley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bean, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harnett et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu and Bean, 2018</xref>). The changes in VGSC gating and RMP in <italic>Casr<sup>-/-</sup></italic> neurons may be attributable to homeostatic mechanisms that compensate for perturbations in network activity and have been observed in central and peripheral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Turrigiano, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our studies indicate that divalent-dependent excitability in neurons is largely attributable to actions of extracellular calcium on the VGSC function. Given the dynamic nature of brain extracellular calcium, this mechanism is likely to impact neuronal signaling greatly under physiological and pathological conditions. CaSR-dependent reduction of VGSC sensitivity to membrane potential adds further complexity to extracellular calcium signaling and identifies another potential mechanism by which CaSR stimulation may influence neuronal death following stroke and traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannan et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Casr</td><td valign="top">GenBank</td><td valign="top">Casr</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mouse wild-type strain C57BL/6J × 129×1</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5652742">MGI:5652742</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mouse expressing Nestin-cre mutation</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory as used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2018</xref></td><td valign="top">Stock No. 003771</td><td valign="top">C57/BL6J and 129S4 background strain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mouse with Lox mutation to delete exon 7 of Casr</td><td valign="top">Laboratory of Dr. Wenhan Chang, UCSF <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Casr</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup></td><td valign="top">C57/BL6J and 129S4 background strain</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Casr</td><td valign="top">Applied Biosystems</td><td valign="top">Mm00443377_m1</td><td valign="top">Quantitative PCR Mouse probe set</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Actb</td><td valign="top">Applied Biosystems</td><td valign="top">Mm04394036_g1</td><td valign="top">Quantitative PCR Mouse probe set</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Nes-Cre1 primer</td><td valign="top">IDT</td><td valign="top">GCAAAACAGGCTCTAGCGTTCG</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Nes-Cre2 primer</td><td valign="top">IDT</td><td valign="top">CTGTTTCACTATCCAGGTTACGG</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">P3U primer</td><td valign="top">IDT</td><td valign="top">TGTGACGGAAAACATACTGC</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Lox R primer</td><td valign="top">IDT</td><td valign="top">GCGTTTTTAGAGGGAAGCAG</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genotyping and CaSR mutant mice</title><p>ConWT animals were obtained from an established colony consisting of a stable strain of C57BL/6J and 129 × 1 mice.

reduction of external divalent ions enhances the intrinsic excitability of cortical neurons. The authors test the idea that the effect of reducing external calcium to increase neuronal excitability is due to enhancement of sodium leak channel (NALCN) current via a pathway initiated by calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein-coupled receptor. The authors conclude that in cultured cortical neurons, the major effects of reducing divalent ions on excitability are not mediated by CaSR-mediated changes in NALCN current but rather by altered voltage-dependence of voltage-dependent sodium current. While contrary to expectations, these key conclusions are nonetheless in agreement with the classical view. A better understanding of how neuronal excitability is affected by changes in extracellular calcium is crucial given that large changes in extracellular calcium are thought to drive circuit and behavioral changes under pathological conditions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

Recording from cultured neocortical neurons, contrary to the previously reported role for CaSR in hippocampal neurons, the authors find that robust extracellular calcium-dependent changes in excitability remains in CaSR knockout neurons specifically after correcting for the hyperpolarized membrane potential in CaSR KO neurons. Moreover, a switch to bath solution containing reduced divalents depolarizes both WT and Casr-/- neurons, where VGSC gating is shifted. Interestingly, the shift in VGSC gating observed in Casr-/- neurons is not accompanied by changes in NALCN sensitivity to extracellular calcium. It is concluded that extracellular calcium-dependence of membrane excitability is largely attributed to changes in VGSC gating rather than being mediated via NALCN through CaSR. While the topic is important, the study touches on a controversial mechanism. Therefore, to deliver a compelling conclusion, there are a number of issues that require careful consideration.</p><p>1. One should directly confirm by immunostaining or western blots that the expression of CaSR protein is actually lost in Casr-/- neurons used for recordings.</p><p>2. Figure 3. While it is appreciated that the voltage clamp is difficult in older neurons, it is highly questionable that the expression of channels and regulatory proteins of relevance are comparable between DIV 2-3 neurons vs. DIV 14-28 neurons. Although not definitive, at the least, the authors should provide experimental support for similar levels of protein expression of VGSC, CaSR, NALCN and VGPC in cortical neurons at two different culture time points.</p><p>3.

By what basis control WT neurons used here are not those expressing Cre that have been used in the previous figures? Figure 1A-C suggests that the expression of Cre may cause subtle non-specific effects. Thus the interchangeable use of conWT and creWT is a source of concern.</p><p>5. Figure 5A-D. It would be informative to reverse the order of addition of VGSC and NALCN blockers – Gd<sup>3+</sup> first, followed by TTX, to confirm that the minimal contribution of NALCN to extracellular Ca-dependent depolarization is not dependent on prior blockade of VGSC.</p><p>6.

Which WT neurons were used as controls here?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes that changing the extracellular Ca modulates activation of Ca-sensing receptors (CaSRs) and changes the voltage-dependence of voltage gated Na channels. This is in contrast to the previous postulate that Ca-sensing receptors modulate leak currents. The results are interesting and important, but there are several issues in this study. Also, the papers are a bit difficult to read, because of the way of presentation.</p><p>1. Although there is an effect of the CaSR KO neurons, the effect of extracellular Ca itself on Na channel activation seems more drastic. Is it possible that the surface charge screening effects are more dominant?</p><p>2. Although voltage clamp of Na channels is difficult, some of the traces (Figure 5) seem to indicate that voltage clamp is not sufficient. Is it possible to use TTX to reduce the current amplitudes and improve the clamp for Figure 3?</p><p>3. I do not see the difference between WT and CaSR KO in Figure 1A, which seems to suggest that CaSRs are not really important for the excitability. Perhaps, show the individual data in Figure 1D?</p><p>4. Intracellular mechanisms connecting between CaSRs and Na channels are unclear.</p><p>5. Overall there are many superimposed traces in the figures, which makes me difficult to understand (Figure 5, for example). Also, it is helpful if the authors draw some scheme at the end of the paper for readability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This well written manuscripts describes electrophysiological recordings from cultured neocortical neurons to examine in control and knockout animals (Casr -/-) the mechanism(s) underlying the augmentation of action potential firing rate by altering the extracellular cation concentration. The topic is of general interest. The manuscript supplies novel and interesting new data. Methodologically the approach taken by the authors is generally sound. The conclusions that the authors make from their data also is logical and justified. I was particularly taken by the observation that the sodium window current plays a significant role in the enhancement of action potential firing. Judging the first two figures of the paper, there seems to be striking differences in the waveforms of action potentials recorded from Casr positive and negative neurons. Do the authors have an explanation for this, does for example Casr influence the developmental trajectory of neurons in culture, in terms of maturation of the expression of voltage gated ion channels? I think the manuscript would benefit from analysis that indicates at given stages of culture that current densities are equivalent etc, which would allow clearer comments to be made by the authors. My main problem with the work lies in the voltage-clamp analysis. The authors indicate in mature cultures that inward currents cannot be voltage-controlled. They therefore turn to analysis of neurons that have been cultured for only a few days. I am not sure that this is the right thing to do – as alluded to above. I would suggest that the authors consider employing recording approaches, such as nucleated patch, that would allow near perfect voltage control. This would allow analysis at the same developmental stage, and also if made from various ages in culture the charting of the developmental profile.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;CaSR modulates sodium channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> -dependent excitability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>As indicated in the public comments, the authors need to systematically reword the presentation, starting with the title, to reflect the fact that all their experiments examined effects of reducing both Ca and Mg, and it is therefore incorrect to state the changes reflect &quot;[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent&quot; effects as is done throughout. There were also many places where the wording (and sometimes the order of presentation) seemed unnecessarily convoluted, which made it difficult to understand exactly what the authors meant by a particular sentence. The data in the paper are very interesting and the ability of the reader to digest the results and their meaning would be improved if the presentation were clearer in some places.</p><p>Following points in particular require careful consideration:</p><p>Title: &quot;CaSR modulates sodium channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent excitability&quot;. The title is misleading in two ways. First, the main point of the paper is that the most important effects of reducing divalents are NOT mediated by CaSR receptors. Whatever effects on excitability are seen in the CaSR-/- neurons probably reflect homeostatic changes rather than direct function of CaSR receptors, so even the statement that CaSR might &quot;modulate&quot; effects is questionable. In any case, such modulation is a very much secondary point of the paper, not the main one. Second, as already pointed out, the authors looked at changes in response to changing both Ca and Mg and can't say any of the key phenomena examined in the paper are &quot;Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent&quot;. Something like &quot;Enhanced excitability of cultured cortical neurons in low-divalent solutions is mediated mainly by altered voltage-dependence of voltage-dependent sodium channels&quot; would better capture the content and conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Abstract: Abstract was not understandable until after reading the paper. The authors summarize the key results as follows &quot; Here we report that action potential (AP) firing rates increased in wild-type (WT), but not CaSR null mutant (Casr-/-) neocortical neurons, following the switch from physiological to reduced Ca <sup>2+</sup>-containing Tyrode. However, after membrane potential correction, action potential firing increased similarly in both genotypes inconsistent with CaSR regulation of NALCN.&quot; It was completely unclear whether the authors were saying that reduction of calcium did or did not enhance excitability in the CaSR-/- cells, the central question of the paper. The first sentence says &quot;no&quot; and the second sentence says &quot;yes&quot;, but only after a &quot;membrane potential correction&quot; that is completely undefined. It is also completely unclear until after reading the paper that &quot;action potential firing&quot; refers to spontaneous firing at the resting potential. As it turns out, a clearer description of the results would be something along the lines of: &quot;CaSR-/- neurons had more negative resting potentials than control neurons and unlike control neurons did not fire spontaneously either in normal or reduced calcium solutions. However action potential firing in response to depolarizing current injections was enhanced in CaSR-/- neurons by reduction of divalent cations to a similar degree as in control neurons.&quot;</p><p>p. 3 &quot;Classical studies proposed that the mechanism underlying [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o-dependent excitability centers on voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) sensitivity to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. External Ca<sup>2+</sup> was proposed to interact with local negative charges on the extracellular face of the membrane or ion channels thereby increasing the potential field experienced by VGSCs and reducing the likelihood of VGSC activation at the resting membrane potential (Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957; Hille, 1968)&quot;. Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin only looked at shifts of Na channel gating in voltage clamp experiments and did not report firing of the cells at the resting potential, as the reader might conclude from this. In fact in their discussion they conclude because of the shift in inactivation, axons in low Ca would be inexcitable. A more accurate summary might be something like &quot;Reduced external Ca<sup>2+</sup> was proposed to shift the effective voltage-dependent gating of the sodium conductance in the hyperpolarizing direction by reducing the screening of local negative charges on the extracellular face of the membrane by external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957; Hille, 1968)&quot;.</p><p>p. 11: &quot;[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o reduction and CaSR hyperpolarized this region of overlap towards the RMP (Figure 3 F,G insets) increasing the likelihood that persistent VGSC currents were activated at resting membrane potential and therefore contributing to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o-dependent excitability.&quot;</p><p>The rationale for saying that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o reduction (or really divalent reduction) hyperpolarized the region of overlap is clear. However, the rationale connecting the experimental results with saying that &quot;CaSR hyperpolarized the region of overlap&quot; is very vague.</p><p>p. 14 paragraph heading &quot;VGSCs are the dominant contributor to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o-dependent excitability&quot;. This statement seems almost meaningless. There is no excitability of any kind without VGSCs. The meaning of &quot;[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o-dependent excitability&quot; here (and it is used many other times) is not clear. Perhaps the authors mean &quot;changes in excitability produced by changes in divalent concentrations&quot;. In any case, the paragraphs to follow are focused mainly on how changes in resting potential are mediated, not really on excitability. So the meaning is something like &quot;Changes in resting potential resulting from lowered divalents are mediated mainly by VGSCs&quot;.</p><p>p. 16: &quot;We have investigated the mechanisms underlying [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o-dependent changes in intrinsic neuronal excitability and tested if CaSR is transducing decreases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o into NALCN-mediated depolarizations to trigger action potentials (Lu et al., 2010; Philippart and Khaliq, 2018). We found no evidence that this specific mechanism was active in neocortical neurons (Figure 2).&quot;</p><p>Nothing in the Philippart and Khaliq paper examined whether or not CaSRs were involved in control of NALCN by divalents. Their paper concerned a completely different regulation of NALCN current by GABAB and dopamine receptors.</p><p>p. 16 &quot;CaSR also indirectly affected action potential generation by modestly depolarizing the membrane potential (Figure 1).&quot; The authors have no evidence that stimulating CaSRs depolarizes the resting potential. What they mean is that CaSR-/- neurons have hyperpolarized resting potentials compared to WT neurons. They have no evidence of whether this reflects a loss of a normal depolarizing effect of CaSR stimulation or a homeostatic effect of development of the neurons without CaSRs.</p><p>p. 21 &quot;Voltages have been corrected for liquid junction potentials.&quot; The value used for the corrections should be given, as the exact membrane potentials are quite important for the effects that are shown (especially the firing at the resting potential).</p><p>The switch from the use of CreWT to ControlWT lacking the expression of Cre recombinase still remains to be justified. The authors reason that the switch has been made to ControlWT given that they have shown that calcium-dependence of excitability is not mediated by CaSR-modulation of NALCN but by VGSC, and also in order to avoid any confounds presented by the exogenous expression of Cre. Nevertheless, the logic is not clear. The conclusion of the apparent lack of contribution of CaSR-modulation of NALCN has been reached by the use of Cre expressing neurons. The authors should explicitly state whether or not there were any differences in the electrophysiological properties of conWT and creWT neurons and if so, explain what they are, perhaps in the methods.</p><p>There were many typos in the paper.</p><p>Throughout the text, there seemed to be a global replacement of &quot;T1.1&quot; by a space, which made a lot of sentences hard to read.

However, in some neurons elicited an outward current (Figure 5A,C) whereas in others there was an inward current (Figure 5B,C)…&quot; It is assumed that there are two missing &quot;T1.1&quot;'s.</p><p>p.11 D,E).

The experiments described in Figures 5 and 6 were performed to examine the relative contribution of VGSC and NALCN. We expected to see a contribution by NALCN that was independent of CaSR and chose the conventional WT as we hoped to avoid the small potential confounder that the cre mutation was interfering with calcium-dependent excitability. The <italic>Casr<sup>-/</sup><sup>-</sup> </italic>experiments were performed because we were surprised (because of the work by the Ren Lab) to see no obvious sign of NALCN contributing in the WT neurons and hoped to find some explanation here. I have modified Figure 5 in attempt to make the rationale for the experimental design more clear.

Unfortunately, Gd<sup>3+</sup> blocks VGSCs and so the application of Gd<sup>3+</sup> alone is expected to block both VGSCs and NALCN. We have edited the manuscript to make this clear (P. 12, Since NALCN is resistant to the VGSC blocker tetrodotoxin (TTX) (Lu et al., 2007; Swayne et al., 2009) but Gd<sup>3+</sup> (10 µM) inhibits NALCN and VGSCs (Elinder and Arhem, 1994; Li and Baumgarten, 2001; Lu et al., 2009)). However, we also performed the requested experiments to check if Gd<sup>3+</sup> was selective under our experimental conditions. Using a similar experimental design to that in Figure 5, Gd<sup>3+</sup> application inhibited the baseline [Ca<sup>2+</sup> ]<sub>o</sub>-dependent current by a substantial amount if it was applied in the absence of TTX . Gd<sup>3+</sup> also reversibly reduced the probability of VGSC activation. Given the valence of Gd<sup>3+</sup> and the sensitivity of VGSC to charged particles this is unsurprising.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 5F, G.

The topic is of general interest. The manuscript supplies novel and interesting new data. Methodologically the approach taken by the authors is generally sound. The conclusions that the authors make from their data also is logical and justified. I was particularly taken by the observation that the sodium window current plays a significant role in the enhancement of action potential firing. Judging the first two figures of the paper, there seems to be striking differences in the waveforms of action potentials recorded from Casr positive and negative neurons. Do the authors have an explanation for this, does for example Casr influence the developmental trajectory of neurons in culture, in terms of maturation of the expression of voltage gated ion channels? I think the manuscript would benefit from analysis that indicates at given stages of culture that current densities are equivalent etc, which would allow clearer comments to be made by the authors. My main problem with the work lies in the voltage-clamp analysis. The authors indicate in mature cultures that inward currents cannot be voltage-controlled. They therefore turn to analysis of neurons that have been cultured for only a few days. I am not sure that this is the right thing to do – as alluded to above. I would suggest that the authors consider employing recording approaches, such as nucleated patch, that would allow near perfect voltage control. This would allow analysis at the same developmental stage, and also if made from various ages in culture the charting of the developmental profile.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the suggested new experiments using nucleated patches from neurons after &gt;14 days in culture (Figure 3). These experiments address the concerns about VGSC currents being examined in neurons of different ages to those examined in other parts of the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>As indicated in the public comments, the authors need to systematically reword the presentation, starting with the title, to reflect the fact that all their experiments examined effects of reducing both Ca and Mg, and it is therefore incorrect to state the changes reflect &quot;[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent&quot; effects as is done throughout. There were also many places where the wording (and sometimes the order of presentation) seemed unnecessarily convoluted, which made it difficult to understand exactly what the authors meant by a particular sentence. The data in the paper are very interesting and the ability of the reader to digest the results and their meaning would be improved if the presentation were clearer in some places.</p><p>Following points in particular require careful consideration:</p><p>Title: &quot;CaSR modulates sodium channel-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent excitability&quot;. The title is misleading in two ways. First, the main point of the paper is that the most important effects of reducing divalents are NOT mediated by CaSR receptors. Whatever effects on excitability are seen in the CaSR-/- neurons probably reflect homeostatic changes rather than direct function of CaSR receptors, so even the statement that CaSR might &quot;modulate&quot; effects is questionable. In any case, such modulation is a very much secondary point of the paper, not the main one. Second, as already pointed out, the authors looked at changes in response to changing both Ca and Mg and can't say any of the key phenomena examined in the paper are &quot;Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent&quot;. Something like &quot;Enhanced excitability of cultured cortical neurons in low-divalent solutions is mediated mainly by altered voltage-dependence of voltage-dependent sodium channels&quot; would better capture the content and conclusions of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the title to better represent the papers major findings.

The authors summarize the key results as follows &quot; Here we report that action potential (AP) firing rates increased in wild-type (WT), but not CaSR null mutant (Casr-/-) neocortical neurons, following the switch from physiological to reduced Ca <sup>2+</sup>-containing Tyrode. However, after membrane potential correction, action potential firing increased similarly in both genotypes inconsistent with CaSR regulation of NALCN.&quot; It was completely unclear whether the authors were saying that reduction of calcium did or did not enhance excitability in the CaSR-/- cells, the central question of the paper. The first sentence says &quot;no&quot; and the second sentence says &quot;yes&quot;, but only after a &quot;membrane potential correction&quot; that is completely undefined. It is also completely unclear until after reading the paper that &quot;action potential firing&quot; refers to spontaneous firing at the resting potential. As it turns out, a clearer description of the results would be something along the lines of: &quot;CaSR-/- neurons had more negative resting potentials than control neurons and unlike control neurons did not fire spontaneously either in normal or reduced calcium solutions. However action potential firing in response to depolarizing current injections was enhanced in CaSR-/- neurons by reduction of divalent cations to a similar degree as in control neurons.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the abstract was unclear.

External Ca<sup>2+</sup> was proposed to interact with local negative charges on the extracellular face of the membrane or ion channels thereby increasing the potential field experienced by VGSCs and reducing the likelihood of VGSC activation at the resting membrane potential (Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957; Hille, 1968)&quot;. Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin only looked at shifts of Na channel gating in voltage clamp experiments and did not report firing of the cells at the resting potential, as the reader might conclude from this. In fact in their discussion they conclude because of the shift in inactivation, axons in low Ca would be inexcitable. A more accurate summary might be something like &quot;Reduced external Ca<sup>2+</sup> was proposed to shift the effective voltage-dependent gating of the sodium conductance in the hyperpolarizing direction by reducing the screening of local negative charges on the extracellular face of the membrane by external Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin, 1957; Hille, 1968)&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Our approach was taken to try and emphasize the action of calcium rather than the effect of removing calcium but we agree the reviewers’ version is clearer and have changed the text. We have attempted to clarify what we mean by excitability and have drawn on the work of Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin. In their introduction, Frankenhaeuser and Hodgkin point out that they investigated the mechanism responsible for excitability including spontaneous firing. ”Physiologists have been interested in the action of calcium on excitable tissues since the days of Ringer (1883). Some of the main facts established (see Brink,1954) are that increasing the external calcium concentration raises the threshold, increases membrane resistance (Cole, 1949) and accelerates accommodation. Reducing the calcium concentration has the converse effects, and frequently leads to spontaneous oscillations or repetitive activity (e.g. Adrian &amp; Gelfan, 1933; Arvanitaki, 1939).” While their approach focused on the voltage clamp method they did describe how low calcium increased excitability “Another advantage of using anodal polarization was that it stopped the fibre firing repetitively in low calcium solutions.” As far as we can determine they reported that reduced excitability was only seen after prolonged exposure to zero calcium conditions and this is generally presumed to reflect a different mechanism, “Unpublished experiments with a conventional type of internal electrode indicate that although there may be little change in resting potential, squid fibres become inexcitable in zero calcium within 5-20 min.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 11: &quot;[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o reduction and CaSR hyperpolarized this region of overlap towards the RMP (Figure 3 F,G insets) increasing the likelihood that persistent VGSC currents were activated at resting membrane potential and therefore contributing to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o-dependent excitability.&quot;</p><p>The rationale for saying that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]o reduction (or really divalent reduction) hyperpolarized the region of overlap is clear.

Nevertheless, the logic is not clear. The conclusion of the apparent lack of contribution of CaSR-modulation of NALCN has been reached by the use of Cre expressing neurons.

Deletion of Casr changed sensitivity to divalents because of its impact on RMP and VGSC activation (V<sub>0.5</sub>). This comparison avoided possible confounding due to cre. Since we had determined that CaSR did not regulate NALCN and that the changes in excitability produced by changes in divalent concentrations were the same in cre and conWT neurons we switched back to conventional neurons. The new question we addressed was, what is the relative contribution of NALCN and VGSC to the depolarizations that occurred after switching to T<sub>0.2</sub> and caused increased action potential firing? Since this question did not include the CaSR we used the conventional WT to ensure the results were generalizable.
