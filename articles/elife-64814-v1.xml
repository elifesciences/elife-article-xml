In primates, visually guided eye movements are among the most frequently occurring sensorimotor transformations. Saccadic eye movements occur approximately four to five times each second and require the integration of myriad visual features (e.g., motion and shape) into discrete movements that position visual targets onto the fovea. Furthermore, each movement decision reflects not only visual input, but also information held in WM, such as the behavioral relevance of particular objects and features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bichot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hollingworth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hollingworth and Luck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wolfe and Horowitz, 2004</xref>). How sensory input and WM are integrated in neural circuits to shape behavioral output remains unclear. Studies across multiple species have revealed evidence that WM functions are often associated with networks involved in sensorimotor transformations, including visual-saccadic transformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Curtis and D'Esposito, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gnadt and Andersen, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knudsen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knudsen and Knudsen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kojima et al., 1996</xref>). In these networks, neurons, individually or collectively, often exhibit persistent signaling of information needed to successfully carry out subsequent behaviors. The prevalence of WM-related activity in sensorimotor networks suggests that this may be where WM exerts its influence on sensorimotor transformations. However, the exact mechanism and specific neural circuitry by which WM influences visually guided behaviors are still unknown.</p><p>Within primate neocortex, the output of feature-selective neurons in visual cortical areas converges retinotopically onto neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schall et al., 1995</xref>), the prefrontal area mostly directly involved in the control of saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robinson and Fuchs, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schiller et al., 1979</xref>). Neurons within the FEF exhibit functional properties spanning the visual-motor spectrum and also include a substantial portion of neurons with persistent, WM-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce and Goldberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence et al., 2005</xref>). These characteristics make the FEF a likely place to observe an influence of WM on incoming visual signals, particularly given that the FEF transmits a predominantly WM signal to visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merrikhi et al., 2017</xref>). Although much is understood about the role of FEF neurons in the control of visually guided saccades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schiller et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schlag-Rey et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tehovnik et al., 2000</xref>), and in the control of visual spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahmani et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gregoriou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore and Fallah, 2001</xref>), very little is known about how visual, motor, and memory signals are combined within the FEF. Models of FEF microcircuitry generally predict that visual cortical inputs synapse predominantly onto purely visual FEF neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinzle et al., 2007</xref>), yet even this is not known. Furthermore, it is also not known how those visual inputs interact with the current content of WM.</p><p>We examined the influence of WM on the efficacy of visual cortical input to the FEF in behaving monkeys. First, we identified FEF neurons with direct input from visual cortex using orthodromic stimulation from extrastriate area V4. Despite the common assumption of visual inputs synapsing onto purely visual FEF neurons, our results revealed that visual cortical input to the FEF instead preferentially targets neurons with both visual and motor properties. Next, we measured the effect of spatial WM on orthodromic activation of FEF neurons and found that the efficacy of visual inputs was enhanced by the memory of spatially corresponding locations. Specifically, the activity evoked in the FEF from visual cortex was larger in magnitude, more synchronous, and more rapid when V4 input matched the location held in WM. These results demonstrate how the content of WM can influence visuomotor transformations in the primate brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We measured the influence of WM on the efficacy of visual cortical inputs to prefrontal cortex in behaving monkeys. Monkeys performed a spatial WM task classically used to characterize FEF neuronal properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce and Goldberg, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lawrence et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows the activity of an example FEF neuron when a monkey remembered a location either inside or outside of the response field (RF; <italic>In</italic> and <italic>Out</italic> conditions, respectively). The neuron responded strongly to a visual cue appearing in the RF and exhibited elevated activity in the delay period when the remembered location coincided with the RF. Prior to saccades to the RF, the neuron also exhibited a burst of motor activity. In primates, direct visual cortical input to prefrontal cortex arrives primarily in the FEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Markov et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungerleider et al., 2008</xref>). We orthodromically activated FEF neurons from retinotopically corresponding sites in extrastriate area V4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) ('MaterialsÂ andÂ methods'). We targeted overlapping FEF-V4 RFs to maximize the likelihood of finding FEF neurons with input from V4, given the evidence of discrete, retinotopic projections from the latter to the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schall et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungerleider et al., 2008</xref>).

We measured the activity of FEF neurons while monkeys performed a spatial WM task that temporally dissociates visual, memory, and motor components of neuronal responses ('MaterialsÂ andÂ methods'). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> shows the activity of an example visual-recipient FEF neuron when the monkey remembered a location either inside or outside of the RF. This neuron responded strongly to a visual cue appearing in the RF but exhibited minimal activity in the delay period, and it was not selective for the remembered location. Prior to saccades to the RF, the neuron exhibited a burst of motor activity. Thus, this neuron exhibited visual and motor, not memory-related, activity. We compared the proportions of neurons with significant visual, memory, and motor activity between the visual-recipient and non-activated neuronal populations. Each component of activity was measured as the significant response enhancement in the corresponding behavioral epoch during the In condition (see 'MaterialsÂ andÂ methods'). We found that visual-recipient FEF neurons exhibited greater proportions of visual (Ï<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 9.42, pÂ =Â 0.002) and motor activity (Ï<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 10.71, pÂ =Â 0.001) than non-activated neurons.

Next, we asked whether the greater proportion of neurons with visual and motor activity among visual-recipient neurons corresponded to a larger proportion of visuomotor neurons. To test that, we compared the proportion of visuomotor neurons between the visual-recipient and non-activated neurons with significant selectivity between the In and Out conditions during the visual and/or motor epochs (see 'Materials and methods') (n =Â 74, non-activated; nÂ =Â 59, visual-recipient).

Thus, we measured the magnitude of motor activity (selectivity to In vs Out) across varying amounts of visual activity in the two populations of neurons ('MaterialsÂ andÂ methods') (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>,Â left). This comparison revealed that for a given level of visual activity, visual-recipient neurons exhibited a larger component of motor activity than non-activated neurons (ANCOVA, FÂ =Â 10.15, pÂ =Â 0.002).

Thus, whereas memory signals among visual-recipient FEF neurons were equal to those of non-activated neurons, motor signals were significantly overrepresented (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). It should be noted, however, that in spite of the anatomical evidence of retinotopic projections from V4 to FEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schall et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungerleider et al., 2008</xref>), one cannot rule out the possibility that non-activated FEF neurons receive inputs from V4 neurons with non-overlapping RFs. Those inputs could be distributed onto FEF neurons differently from those arriving retinotopically. Nonetheless, our results show that FEF neurons receiving retinotopic inputs from V4 exhibit stronger motor activity than those without such inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>WM alters efficacy of V4 input to FEF</title><p>In contrast to the disproportionate prevalence of motor signals among neurons receiving input from visual cortex, reciprocal projections of the FEF to visual cortex originate disproportionately from neurons with memory-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merrikhi et al., 2017</xref>). This implicates the FEF as a possible source of the observed memory-dependent modulation in visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahmani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">SupÃ¨r et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Kerkoerle et al., 2017</xref>). It also suggests that memory-related signals may interact with the efficacy of visual inputs arriving in prefrontal cortex. To test this possibility, we compared the efficacy of orthodromic activation of FEF neurons from area V4 between WM for different spatial locations. Previous studies haveÂ shown that the efficacy of orthodromic activation of primary visual cortex neurons from the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2013</xref>), and of extrastriate cortex from primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruff and Cohen, 2016</xref>), are both altered during spatial attention. Using a similar approach, we compared the activity evoked from visual cortex by orthodromic stimulation during the delay period of the MGS task when monkeys remembered different cue locations.</p><p>We examined the influence of WM across the full population of 96 visual-recipient neurons. On average, the proportion of stimulation-evoked spikes increased by 19% when monkeys remembered locations inside the RF, compared to outside (Spike count<sub>In</sub>Â =Â 0.22Â Â±Â 0.005, Spike count<sub>Out</sub>Â =Â 0.18Â Â±Â 0.004; p&lt;10<sup>â6</sup>)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For each neuron, we measured the evoked response magnitude to quantify the efficacy of stimulation (see 'MaterialsÂ andÂ methods') and compared the magnitude between trials with different memory locations. The magnitude of evoked responses was significantly greater when monkeys remembered cue locations inside the RF, compared to outside (Response magnitude<sub>In</sub>Â =Â 0.77Â Â±Â 0.04, Response magnitude<sub>Out</sub>Â =Â 0.68Â Â±Â 0.03; p&lt;10<sup>â10</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The increase in efficacy was independent of the delay period selectivity of FEF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>; rÂ =Â 0.12, pÂ =Â 0.235, Pearson correlation). Thus, the efficacy of visual input to the FEF depended on the content of WM. In addition, we found that the latency of evoked spikes was slightly reduced when monkeys remembered locations inside, compared to outside, the RF (Latency<sub>In</sub>Â =Â 7.88, Latency<sub>Out</sub>Â =Â 8.04; p&lt;10<sup>â10</sup>)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> shows the spikes evoked from two example FEF neurons in response to V4 stimulation during the memory period. Evoked spikes from one neuron increased byÂ ~30% during memory of locations inside, compared to outside the RF. The number of evoked spikes from a second, simultaneously recorded, neuron was similar in the two RF conditions, but spike onset appeared more rapid during the In condition, consistent with the latency effects. As a consequence, when combined, the evoked spikes of the two neurons were more synchronous during memory of locations inside of the RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) ('Materials and methods'). We compared the proportion of joint spikes in all simultaneously recorded pairs of visual-recipient neurons (nÂ =Â 509) across the different memory locations. Overall, we found that the proportion of joint spiking, when controlled for firing rate (see 'MaterialsÂ andÂ methods'), increased by nearly 60% during memory of locations inside, compared to outside the RF (Prob<sub>In</sub>Â =Â 0.103Â Â±Â 0.002, Prob<sub>Out</sub>Â =Â 0.065Â Â±Â 0.001;, p&lt;10<sup>â63</sup>)Â (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Thus, activity evoked in the FEF from visual cortex was larger, more synchronous, and more rapid when monkeys engaged WM at RF locations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Increased efficacy of visual input to the FEF during WM.</title><p>(a) Magnitude of orthodromically evoked FEF responses and (b) latency of orthodromically evoked spikes during the delay period of the WM task, for memory of locations inside vs outside of the RF, for all visual-recipient FEF neurons. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> shows the average spike counts for In vs Out, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref> shows the relationship between change in efficacy and delay selectivity.

Rather than exhibiting purely visual properties, as might be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sato and Schall, 2003</xref>), visual-recipient FEF neurons also signaled the direction of impending eye movements. Although surprising, this result seems consistent with the pattern of visual cortical connections with the FEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barone et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Markov et al., 2014b</xref>). V4 inputs terminate in all layers of the FEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ungerleider et al., 2008</xref>), thus potentially distributing inputs across different functional classes of neurons. The bias in those inputs toward visuomotor neurons indicates that rather than being integrated at a subsequent processing stage within the FEF, as proposed by models of FEF microcircuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heinzle et al., 2007</xref>), sensory and motor signals are combined at the interface between visual and prefrontal cortex. Moreover, this result is consistent with the observation of equal visual latencies between visuomotor and visual FEF neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schall, 1991</xref>), and the finding that visuomotor neurons exhibit greater visual discrimination than visual neurons during certain saccade tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costello et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>More importantly, we found that the engagement of WM at RF locations increased the efficacy of visual input to FEF neurons. When monkeys remembered RF locations, activity evoked in the FEF from visual cortex was larger in magnitude, more synchronous, and more rapid. The increased efficacy of visual input to the FEF was independent of delay period activity, andÂ it was observed whether or not neurons exhibited WM-related activity. Given that visual cortical inputs appear to drive neurons across functional classes, this result suggests that those inputs interact constructively with WM-related signals within the FEF. Similarly, previous work has shown that the deployment of attention increases the input efficacy of thalamocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2013</xref>) and corticocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ruff and Cohen, 2016</xref>) connections, and, thus, our results indicate that attention and WM exert analogous influences on visual input across multiple levels of the visual hierarchy. In both cases, the cellular-level mechanisms of the observed enhancement remain to be determined, as they could result either from a pre-synaptic or fromÂ aÂ post-synaptic facilitative mechanism, or both. Moreover, those mechanisms may differ in important ways between attention and WM.</p><p>Evidence from multiple species suggests that top-down attention arises from biases in the selection of sensory input based on the content of WM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desimone and Duncan, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knudsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Soto et al., 2010</xref>). A recent study indicates that FEF neurons with WM-related activity disproportionately provide input to neurons in area V4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merrikhi et al., 2017</xref>) and thus underlie the FEFâs contribution to the modulation of visual cortical activity classically observed during spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ekstrom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gregoriou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moore and Armstrong, 2003</xref>). In contrast to visual cortical projections from the FEF, inputs to the FEF did not preferentially target memory-related neurons, but instead neurons with visuomotor properties. This suggests that interactions between the FEF and visual cortex are not strictly recurrent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knudsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Noudoost et al., 2014</xref>) and that memory activity within the FEF, rather than reinforcing its own content, may instead facilitate the transformation of visual inputs into motor commands. Combined, our results suggest a basis for the well-documented interdependence of attention, WM, and gaze control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ikkai and Curtis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonikaitis and Moore, 2019</xref>), which at the circuit level remains an important puzzle to solve.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Two adult male rhesus monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) were used in this study.

Two craniotomies were performed on each animal, allowing access to dorsal V4, on the prelunate gyrus, and FEF, on the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus. Eye position monitoring was performed via the scleral search coil and was digitized at 500 Hz (CNC Engineering). Eye monitoring, stimulus presentation, data acquisition, and behavioral monitoring were controlled by the CORTEX system. Visual stimuli presented to estimate V4 RFs were 1.2â1.9Â°Ã0.2â0.4Â° bar stimuli appearing at four possible orientations (0, 45, 90, and 135Â°).

Neural activity was recorded extracellularly with varnish-coated tungsten microelectrodes (FHC) of 0.2â1.0 MÎ© impedance (measured at 1 kHz) in V4, and via linear electrode array (v-probe,Â Plexon) in FEF. Extracellular waveforms were digitized and classified as single neurons using both template-matching and windowÂ discrimination techniques (FHC, Plexon). Area V4 was identified based on stereotaxic location, position relative to nearby sulci, patterns of gray and white matter, and response properties of units encountered; the FEF was identified based on these factors and the ability to evoke fixed-vector eye movements with low-current electrical stimulation.

Responses from the recording site were monitored audibly and visually by the experimenter, and the approximate boundaries of the RF were noted for the positioning of stimuli in subsequent behavioral tasks. To establish that the electrode was positioned within the FEF and to estimate the FEF RF location, microstimulation was delivered randomly on 50% of trials while the animal performed a passive fixation task. Microstimulation consisted of trains (50â100 ms) of biphasic current pulses (â¤50 Î¼A; 250 Hz; 0.25 ms duration). On no-stimulation trials, the monkey was rewarded for maintaining fixation; on stimulation trials, the monkey was rewarded whether fixation was maintained or not following microstimulation. The ability to evoke saccades with low stimulation currents (â¤50 Î¼A) confirmed that the electrode was in the FEF; the end point of the stimulation-evoked saccades provided an estimate of the RF center for the FEF site.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>MGS task</title><p>The FEF visual, motor, and delay activity were characterized in an MGS task.

The animal then had 500 ms to shift its gaze to aÂ Â±4Â d.v.a. window around the previous cue location and remain fixating there for 200 ms to receive a reward.

Stimulation times were 500 ms after initiating fixation (fixation), 500 ms after visual cue onset (visual), 500 ms after cue offset (delay), or 150 ms after the go cue (saccade). Data from the visual, delay, and saccade stimulation periods were used to identify orthodromically activated FEF neurons; data from stimulation during the delay period were used to measure the impact of WM on visual input efficacy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Latency of stimulation-evoked spikes</title><p>The probability of firing in each 1 ms bin following V4 stimulation was measured for stimulation trials and compared to the probability of firing in a time-matched window from non-stimulation trials.

This test identifies antidromically activated neurons: when V4 stimulation was delivered within a few milliseconds of a spontaneously generated spike from a recorded FEF neuron, spikes artificially evoked from that neuron by V4 microstimulation were eliminated. Orthodromically activated neurons will still have an evoked spike in this period following a spontaneously generated spike.

All responses were measured within the 5â9 ms post-stimulation period, to stay consistent with the latency of visual-recipient neurons as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>. To focus on stimulation-evoked spikes, rather than spontaneous spiking activity, all measures were adjusted by subtracting the same measure (firing rate, spike count, or probability) observed during the same time period on non-stimulated trials. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and d</xref> shows adjusted values, following subtraction of the same measure during the non-stimulated trials. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> (neuronal latency) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> (spiking activity of an example neuronal pair) are raw, non-adjusted values. The evoked response magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) was calculated based on the log ratio of spike counts before vs after stimulation, and subtracting the same measure during non-stimulation trials: log<sub>10</sub>(resp after/resp before)<sub>STIM</sub> -log<sub>10</sub>(resp after/resp before)<sub>NONSTIM</sub>. The proportion of joint spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) was measured as the proportion of trials in which spikes from both neurons in a pair occurred within 1 ms and was averaged between 5Â andÂ 9 ms post-stimulation. Higher firing rates will increase the probability of joint spiking. To control for firing rate, we subtracted off the proportion of joint spikes occurring in trials shuffled within each condition from that measured during non-shuffled trials. Similar to other measures, this value in non-stimulated trails was also subtracted from thatÂ inÂ the stimulated trials. Thus, the reported joint proportions are controlled for changes in firing rate due to both stimulation and WM, and measures only the change in synchronous firing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Characterizing FEF response properties</title><p>The visual, motor, and delay period activity of FEF neurons was measured using the MGS task described above. The visual period included activity 100â1000 ms after stimulus onset. Delay period activity was measured from 300 to 1000 ms after stimulus offset. Motor activity was quantified in the presaccadic window 125 ms before the saccade onset. These time windows were also used to quantify the different types of activity using a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to measure selectivity, as described below. When determining whether a neuron exhibited significant visual or delay activity, activity in the visual and delay periods of the In condition was compared to the activity of the same neuron during fixation (300 ms before stimulus onset), using the Wilcoxon sign-rank test (p&lt;0.05). When determining whether a neuron had significant motor activity, saccade-aligned activity in the In condition was compared to saccade-aligned activity earlier in the trial (450â250 ms before saccade onset), using the sign-rank test (p&lt;0.05).</p><p>The strength of visual, memory, and motor activity was measured as the selectivity of neurons to the In and Out conditions during the visual, delay, and motor epochs, respectively, and was quantified using an ROC analysis. This method compared the distributions of firing rates for trials in which the memory cue appeared inside versus outside the neuron's RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>). The areas under ROC curves were used as a measure of selectivity for cue location and were calculated as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armstrong and Moore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britten et al., 1992</xref>). Specifically, we computed the average firing rate in the visual, delay, and saccade windows defined above, for In and Out trials. We then computed the probability that the firing rate in each stimulus condition exceeded a criterion. The criterion was incremented from 0 to the maximum firing rate, and the probability of exceeding each criterion was computed. Thus, a single point on the ROC curve is produced for each increment in the criterion, and the entire ROC curve is generated from all of the criteria. The area under the ROC curve is a normalized measure of the separation between the two firing-rate distributions obtained when the WM cue appeared inside versus outside the neuronal RF and provides a measure of how well the neuronal response discriminates between the two conditions.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by

in the frontal eye field (FEF), a cortical brain area traditionally thought to receive visual input and transform that input into motor commands. The authors used extracellular recordings and electrical microstimulation in behaving non-human primates (NHPs) to add to this view by showing that visual input to FEF from visual area V4 appears to be gated by working -memory activity in FEF. This kind of circuit-breaking is rare and valuable in NHPs and provides new insights into mechanisms that subserve the flexible, context-dependent flow of information in the primate brain.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Working Memory Gates Visual Input to Primate Prefrontal Neurons&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Orthodromic activation of FEF neurons via V4 stimulation increases the percentage of FEF events that lead to spikes and decreases their latency during working memory. Such an effect appears expectable if FEF neurons are at a higher level of when a stimulus in their receptive field is held in memory compared to a stimulus out of their receptive field. Are the authors suggesting something special about working memory? Would the same outcome not be expected during fixation or smooth pursuit for FEF neurons that are activated by these states? It was not clear that efficacy of transmission itself improves by working memory, just the likelihood that the spiking threshold would be reached. This was considered a major concern.</p><p>2. It would strengthen the authors thesis to discuss the existing functional evidence (in addition to anatomical evidence) that motor FEF neurons receive visual input and can plan movements accordingly.

The authors match the receptive location of FEF and V4 neurons to maximize the chances of identifying monosynaptically connected neurons between the two areas.

These findings are interesting and important to our understanding about how our brain acts during daily WM-related activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a very interesting study, examining the properties of different types of neurons in the primate Frontal Eye Fields. It is commonly assumed that a serial processing of information takes place in the frontal lobe, from visual representation, to working memory maintenance, to motor output. However, some evidence to the contrary has also been reported, creating a debate in the field. The authors have characterized meticulously FEF neurons receiving V4 projections, by means of orthodromic stimulation. They report two main findings: that visual-input recipient neurons in FEF exhibit substantial motor activity and that working memory alters the efficacy of V4 input to FEF. The paper provides an important addition to our understanding of FEF processing. Although the first result is unambiguous, and goes against the traditional view of the FEF, the interpretation of the second is less straightforward and would need to be qualified further.</p><p>1.

This was considered a major concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point worth addressing more clearly. Thus, we clarify in the revised paper in several ways that the observation of enhanced efficacy of orthodromic activation of FEF neurons is not necessarily expected. First, as described in the methods, and clarified further in the revision, evoked spiking responses are always measured as the change from the non-stimulation condition during the same time period. So response magnitude is normalized to this non-stimulation baseline, and thus one could have reasonably expected there to be no change in the evoked activity between the IN and OUT conditions if the combined (stimulation and endogenous) inputs are added linearly. Second, as we clarify in the revised paper, the enhancement effect is observed in neurons whether or not they exhibit delay activity. Indeed, neurons with equal spike rates in the IN and OUT conditions exhibit equally large enhancement effects. To make this point clearer, we have added a supplemental analysis and figure (Figure 3, Supplement 2) that is similar to that used previously in studies demonstrating similar increased efficacy with attention (see Supplementary Figure 1d from Briggs et al., 2013). This analysis shows no relationship between the change in efficacy and delay selectivity (i.e. difference in firing rate between IN and OUT conditions). So, whether or not changes in efficacy are also present during changes in âstatesâ other than WM (it appears so for attention, and could also be so during smooth pursuit), it is clear that the observed change is not merely due to âa higher levelâ of activity in the FEF neurons. Note also that, on the contrary, we do not argue that WM is special (in the discussion). Instead, we draw parallels with the effects seen during attention and note other evidence of similar underlying mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Some discussion is warranted on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the wording in the results (pages 5 and 8) to clarify that we targeted overlapping FEF-V4 receptive fields based on the fact that projections from V4 to FEF appear to be retinotopic and discrete (Schall et al., 1995; Ungerleider et al., 2008). We now also note that to the extent that there are non-retinotopic projections they could indeed be distributed differently onto the functional subtypes of FEF neurons than the retinotopic projections (page 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In classical working memory tasks, the task periods usually consist of fixation, cue, delay and then response period. The neural activity during delay period is considered as working memory related signal. However, in current study, the authors didn't point out whether only delay period activity was included in analysis when they compared synaptic efficacy between stimulation and non-stimulation trials, in Figure 4a. Because the differences of neuronal response during fixation period cannot be viewed as relevant to information held in working memory, it may be better if only neuronal activity in delay period was included in their analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>This analysis of efficacy was indeed limited to the delay period. We regret that this important aspect of the results was not clear, and we have added language to the results (page 9), methods (page 17), and the figure 3 caption to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, did all of the 96 visual-recipient FEF neurons show working memory-related activity in the memory-guided saccade task? The example neuron in Figure 3a didn't show a significant difference between In and Out trials during delay period. If the visual-recipient neuron didn't show working memory-related activity, what is the basis for the claim that enhanced synaptic efficacy from V4 to FEF was caused by working memory?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point of clarification and we thank the reviewer for bringing it up. Indeed, a majority of the visual-recipient neurons did not exhibit elevated delay period activity. As shown in the bar plots in Figure 2b, ~30% of visual-recipient FEF neurons have significant delay activity (no different from the proportion of the non-activated FEF neuronal population). In addition, as mentioned above, we have added an analysis of the relationship between delay-period selectivity and the change in efficacy with WM (Figure 3 Supplement 2). This figure and analysis demonstrates that differences in firing rates between the IN and OUT conditions do not correlate with the change in efficacy.</p><p>As for the basis for the claim that enhanced efficacy is a result of WM, that is due to the fact that the location of WM is the only thing that varies between the two behavioral (experimental) conditions between which efficacy is being compared. That is a conclusion that quite reasonably follows from the observed differences in orthodromic efficacy between the two behavioral conditions; the magnitude, latency and synchrony of evoked activity all depend on the location the monkey must remember. Note that we do not claim that efficacy increased specifically in WM-related neurons. On the contrary, in the discussion, we suggest that the increased input to what are preferentially visuomotor neurons (Figure 2) might âfacilitate the transformation of visual inputs into motor commands.â This is an important point, but it hardly detracts from the fact that WM deployment (defined behaviorally) clearly alters the efficacy of visual inputs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors mentioned in Method that Figure 4 showed adjusted values, but it may not be applicable for raster plot in Figure 4c. It may be helpful that using adjusted values show stimulation effects on evoked spike counts during memory In and Out trials.</p></disp-quote><p>Note that the raster plots in 3c (formerly 4c) are necessarily unaltered data, as the adjustment procedure does not operate on individual spikes, and the calculation of joint spiking takes into account the relative timing of those individual spikes. We now clarify this in the methods (page 18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Did the authors find some FEF cells showing elevated firing during delay period in outside-RF trials compared with baseline firing? These elevated firings would not be caused by the RF cue and thus could more readily be interpreted as a working memory signal.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good question. Indeed, it has previously been shown that some FEF neurons exhibit visual, motor and delay properties that are not aligned in space (Bruce and Goldberg, 1985; Lawrence et al., 2005). Consistent with this, we found that some neurons exhibited more delay activity when the cue was presented outside of their visual receptive field (values below 0.5 in the plot shown in new Figure 3 Supplement 2)âalthough the magnitude of their delay selectivity is lower on average than those with elevated firing rates for the IN condition. Importantly, the enhanced efficacy of orthodromic activation occurs in these neurons as well (Î response magnitude = 0.08Â±0.01, p&lt;10<sup>-4</sup>, n=26); overall there was no correlation between FEF neuronsâ delay selectivity and their change in input efficacy (r = 0.12, p = 0.235, Pearson correlation).</p><p>However, the suggestion that elevated activity in the OUT condition is more easily interpreted as reflecting working memory is not correct, in our opinion. One could still argue that such elevated activity is cue induced, e.g. resulting from a release of inhibition. The question of whether delay activity in the FEF, which has been studied and described for decades, is a result of the visual cue vs. memory has been addressed in many ways in previous studies, and we donât attempt to litigate that issue in the current paper. For example, delay activity often occurs in neurons with no visual response to the cue (e.g. see Figure 4A. in Armstrong et al., 2009), and of course the visual responses of FEF neurons do not persist for the 1 second duration of the delay period (e.g. Sommer and Wurtz, 2001). (We have revised the paper to clarify the duration of the delay period which may have been ambiguous in the original version.)</p><p>Importantly, as stated above, the interpretation that the increased efficacy during the delay period results from differences in WM is based solely on the fact that we are comparing efficacy between memory locations during the delay period (e.g., the time during which the monkey must remember the cued location), not because individual FEF neurons display delay activity (or not). Again, the difference in efficacy is independent of the amount of delay activity (Figure 3 Supplement 2). Indeed, the interpretation doesnât even depend on any presumed role of FEF delay activity in the control of WM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

It would be useful to indicate the electrical stimulus protocol in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved the stimulation technique, previously shown in Figure 2, into Figure 1, and further details of stimulation timing are now illustrated in Figure 1 supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a very interesting study, examining the properties of different types of neurons in the primate Frontal Eye Fields. It is commonly assumed that a serial processing of information takes place in the frontal lobe, from visual representation, to working memory maintenance, to motor output. However, some evidence to the contrary has also been reported, creating a debate in the field. The authors have characterized meticulously FEF neurons receiving V4 projections, by means of orthodromic stimulation. They report two main findings: that visual-input recipient neurons in FEF exhibit substantial motor activity and that working memory alters the efficacy of V4 input to FEF. The paper provides an important addition to our understanding of FEF processing. Although the first result is unambiguous, and goes against the traditional view of the FEF, the interpretation of the second is less straightforward and would need to be qualified further.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the revised manuscript provides a clearer picture regarding the significance and interpretation of the second part of the paper. Clarifications and qualifying statements have been added based on reviewer feedback (see responses to points 1-3 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Orthodromic activation of FEF neurons via V4 stimulation increases the percentage of FEF events that lead to spikes and decreases their latency during working memory. Such an effect appears expectable if FEF neurons are at a higher level of when a stimulus in their receptive field is held in memory compared to a stimulus out of their receptive field. Are the authors suggesting something special about working memory? Would the same outcome not be expected during fixation or smooth pursuit for FEF neurons that are activated by these states? It was not clear that efficacy of transmission itself improves by working memory, just the likelihood that the spiking threshold would be reached.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revision #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It would strengthen the authors thesis to discuss the existing functional evidence (in addition to anatomical evidence) that motor FEF neurons receive visual input and can plan movements accordingly. See for example Costello et al. J. Neurosci 2013, 33(41):16394-408.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revision #2 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors match the receptive location of FEF and V4 neurons to maximize the chances of identifying monosynaptically connected neurons between the two areas. However, a negative finding of no effects of orthodromic activation does not entirely rule out that the FEF neuron under study receive V4 input, from another site. Some discussion is warranted on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to essential revision #3 above.</p><p>References:</p><p>Armstrong, K. M., Chang, M. H., and Moore, T. (2009).
