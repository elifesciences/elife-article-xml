merozoites involves formation of a parasitophorous vacuole into which the parasite moves. The vacuole membrane seals and pinches off behind the parasite through an unknown mechanism, enclosing the parasite within the RBC. During invasion, several parasite surface proteins are shed by a membrane-bound protease called SUB2. Here we show that genetic depletion of SUB2 abolishes shedding of a range of parasite proteins, identifying previously unrecognized SUB2 substrates. Interaction of SUB2-null merozoites with RBCs leads to either abortive invasion with rapid RBC lysis, or successful entry but developmental arrest. Selective failure to shed the most abundant SUB2 substrate, MSP1, reduces intracellular replication, whilst conditional ablation of the substrate AMA1 produces host RBC lysis. We conclude that SUB2 activity is critical for host RBC membrane sealing following parasite internalisation and for correct functioning of merozoite surface proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria kills or disables hundreds of millions of people across the world, especially in developing economies. The most severe form of the disease is caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, a single-cell parasite which, once inside a human host, forces its way into red blood cells to feed on a protein called haemoglobin. This invasion relies on <italic>P. falciparum</italic> being engulfed by the membrane of the red blood cell, which then seals off to form a compartment inside the cell where the parasite can feed and multiply. Invasion takes less than 30 seconds, and it involves <italic>P. falciparum</italic> losing the coat of proteins that covers its surface. An enzyme calls SUB2 cleaves or cuts off these proteins, but exactly why and how the shedding takes place during infection is still unclear.</p><p>To investigate, Collins, Hackett et al. deactivated the gene which codes for SUB2, and examined how mutant <italic>P. falciparum</italic> would survive and multiply. Without the enzyme, the parasites failed to shed many of their proteins, including some that were not previously known to be removed by SUB2. The majority of the genetically modified parasites also failed to invade red blood cells. In particular, most of the host cells ruptured, suggesting that the protein coat needs to be discarded for the engulfing process to be completed properly. When the enzyme-free mutants did manage to make their way into a red blood cell, they starved to death because they could not digest haemoglobin. SUB2 and surface coat shedding therefore appears to be essential for the parasite to survive.</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> is fast becoming resistant to the many drugs that exist to fight malaria. New treatments that target SUB2 may therefore help in combatting this deadly disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>plasmodium</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>sheddase</kwd><kwd>protease</kwd><kwd>erythrocyte</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Christine R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hackett</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name><name><surname>Snijders</surname><given-names>Ambrosius P</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Matthew Robert Geoffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackman</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Christine R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hackett</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name><name><surname>Snijders</surname><given-names>Ambrosius P</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Matthew Robert Geoffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackman</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001043</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Christine R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hackett</surname><given-names>Fiona</given-names></name><name><surname>Howell</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name><name><surname>Snijders</surname><given-names>Ambrosius P</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>Matthew Robert Geoffrey</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name><name><surname>Blackman</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ISSF2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blackman</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic analysis identifies an enzyme of the malaria parasite that is required to seal its host red blood cell membrane upon invasion, a key requirement of this important intracellular pathogen.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The phylum Apicomplexa comprises a diverse group of protozoan organisms, many of which are obligate intracellular parasites of clinical or veterinary importance. A feature of these parasites is their possession of invasive forms that actively penetrate host cells. In the asexual blood stages of infection by malaria parasites (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> species), merozoites invade red blood cells (RBCs), replicating intracellularly to produce merozoites that egress to invade fresh RBCs. Invasion is a rapid, multi-step process that includes binding, merozoite reorientation, discharge of secretory organelles called rhoptries and micronemes, formation of an electron-dense ‘tight junction’ (TJ) between the merozoite apical end and the RBC membrane, and actinomyosin-powered entry into the RBC through this structure, with concurrent formation of a membrane-bound parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within which the parasite develops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dvorak et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 1975</xref>). Invasion ends with sealing of the RBC behind the intracellular parasite, concomitant with pinching off of the nascent PV membrane (PVM) in a membrane scission event such that the PVM is eventually non-contiguous with and internal to the RBC membrane. Invasion is typically followed by transformation of the host RBC into a shrunken ‘spiky’ state called echinocytosis, which typically resolves within minutes. The parasite rapidly transforms into an amoeboid ‘ring’ form. Whilst many advances have been made over recent decades in understanding invasion, particularly in the most lethal malaria species <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium knowlesi</italic>, as well as in the related apicomplexan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, the mechanisms underlying PV formation are obscure and nothing is known of the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for host cell membrane sealing.</p><p>Early electron microscopic (EM) studies showed that invading merozoites shed a ‘fuzzy coat’ of ~20 nm-long bristle-like fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 1975</xref>). These are likely composed predominantly of the major glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored surface protein MSP1, which is synthesised as an abundant, ~200 kDa precursor at the plasma membrane of developing parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holder et al., 1992</xref>). Minutes before egress, MSP1 is proteolytically cleaved into several fragments by a parasite protease called SUB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koussis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yeoh et al., 2007</xref>). These fragments form a noncovalent complex on the merozoite surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McBride and Heidrich, 1987</xref>) where, together with several partner proteins, it facilitates membrane rupture at egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Das et al., 2015</xref>). During invasion the bulk of the MSP1 complex is shed from the merozoite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blackman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blackman et al., 1991</xref>) as a result of a single further cleavage catalysed by a second, membrane-bound protease called SUB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hackett et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barale et al., 1999</xref>). SUB2 also mediates shedding of two merozoite surface integral membrane proteins called PTRAMP and AMA1, which are released from micronemes at around egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Howell et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Green et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). PTRAMP acts as an RBC binding ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>) whilst AMA1 plays a central role in TJ formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harvey et al., 2014</xref>). To access its substrates, SUB2 is also released from micronemes onto the merozoite surface, where it translocates to the posterior pole of the parasite just before or during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Riglar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris et al., 2005</xref>). Despite evidence that SUB2 is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Uzureau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bushell et al., 2017</xref>) and that shedding of MSP1 and AMA1 is important and can aid evasion of invasion-inhibitory antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olivieri et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guevara Patiño et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lazarou et al., 2009</xref>), the molecular function of SUB2-mediated shedding is unknown.</p><p>Here, we used genetic modification of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> SUB2 and two of its substrates to examine the essentiality and function of SUB2 in the erythrocytic lifecycle. We show that SUB2 depletion results in defects in merozoite surface protein shedding and sealing of the host RBC upon invasion, leading to either abortive invasion with loss of host RBC haemoglobin, or developmental arrest of the intracellular parasite. Our findings highlight SUB2 as a key mediator of parasite viability and host RBC membrane integrity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efficient conditional ablation of SUB2 expression</title><p>The <italic>P. falciparum sub2</italic> gene encodes a type I integral membrane protein with a large ectodomain incorporating a subtilisin-like protease module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hackett et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barale et al., 1999</xref>).

To explore this, mature cycle 0 schizonts of DMSO- or RAP-treated SUB2HA3:loxP parasites were incubated with fresh RBCs for 4 hr to allow egress and invasion. Levels of Hb in culture supernatants were then quantified by spectrophotometry and SDS-PAGE, and the cells examined by microscopy and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). As previously noted, ring production from the ΔSUB2 schizonts was reduced compared to controls. Despite this, higher levels of extracellular Hb appeared in the ΔSUB2 culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This did not derive from schizont rupture per se, as incubation of similar numbers of schizonts without addition of RBCs resulted in low levels of Hb release that did not differ between ΔSUB2 and control schizonts. Moreover, Hb release required extensive interaction between released merozoites and the host cells, since it did not occur in the presence of cytochalasin D (cytD), an actin-binding drug that blocks invasion downstream of TJ formation by disrupting the parasite actinomyosin motor that drives invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conjectured that those ΔSUB2 merozoites unable to invade instead interacted with target RBCs in an abortive manner that led to lysis. To investigate this, following co-incubation of schizonts with RBCs, cultures were supplemented with fluorescent phalloidin, a membrane-impermeable peptide that binds the F-actin of the RBC cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glushakova et al., 2010</xref>), then immediately examined by live fluorescence microscopy.

The dimensions of these cells, their low buoyant density (shown by a tendency to ‘float’ above intact RBCs) and their accessibility to phalloidin, suggested that they were ‘ghosts’ derived from lysis of RBCs.

Initial interactions with ΔSUB2 merozoites appeared normal, with RBC deformation often followed by parasite entry and echinocytosis.

In other cases lysis took longer and was visualised by images captured over 30–60 min. However, washing and re-culture of the cycle one rings forms resulted in no further Hb release, indicating that lysis was usually rapid. Attempts to fix ΔSUB2 merozoites in the act of invasion for analysis by EM were unsuccessful, possibly due to its transient nature.

These results suggested that inhibition of AMA1 shedding per se was not responsible for the invasion and lysis phenotype observed in the ΔSUB2 mutants.</p><p>Given the role of AMA1 in TJ formation, we examined whether the ΔSUB2 phenotype might in part reflect loss of AMA1 function. We generated a parasite line (iΔAMA1) in which DiCre-mediated excision ablated AMA1 expression by severely truncating the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). In a control line (iAMA1_C), excision reconstituted a functional full-length gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). RAP treatment of the parasites produced the expected genomic modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), with loss of AMA1 expression in mature cycle 0 schizonts of the iΔAMA1 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). This led to complete loss of ring formation and proliferation following rupture of RAP-treated iΔAMA1 schizonts at the end of cycle 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>), confirming AMA1 essentiality. Despite the lack of invasion, levels of Hb released into the culture media were much higher in RAP-treated iΔAMA1 schizonts incubated with RBCs than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). To determine the source of the Hb, we used microscopy to visualise interactions between ΔAMA1 merozoites and RBCs. This confirmed the loss of invasion, whilst showing that interaction of ΔAMA1 merozoites with target RBCs produced extensive RBC echinocytosis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). We did not observe rapid RBC lysis; however, target RBCs often transformed to a rounded form, remaining in this state for some time before losing Hb content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

Our most important conclusion is that SUB2-mediated protein shedding is essential for parasite survival. Our primary mechanistic explanation for this is that shedding is required for resealing of the RBC membrane at invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of merozoite-RBC interactions following disruption of SUB2 or AMA1, or selective ablation of MSP1 shedding (MSP1<sub>PP</sub>).</title><p>Following the initial merozoite-RBC interaction, reorientation (<bold>a</bold>) brings the merozoite apical prominence into contact with the RBC surface. Rhoptry neck proteins are discharged into the RBC membrane (<bold>b</bold>), inducing echinocytosis. AMA1 is released from micronemes to interact with the RON complex, forming the TJ through which the merozoite begins to enter the nascent PV (<bold>c</bold>). During entry, several protein components of the merozoite surface coat are shed by SUB2 (<bold>d</bold>). As the merozoite is internalised the RBC membranes are drawn together at the posterior end by the TJ (<bold>e</bold>). The opposed membranes finally seal and undergo scission, fully encapsulating the parasite within the cell (<bold>f</bold>). In the absence of AMA1 (ΔAMA1), insertion of the RON complex results in echinocytosis but without formation of the TJ. The RBC membrane remains destabilised, leading to RBC lysis. Loss of SUB2 expression (ΔSUB2) leads to a plug of unshed surface proteins that prevent RBC membrane sealing, leading to abortive entry and RBC lysis. Some ΔSUB2 parasites manage to enter fully but subsequently fail to develop beyond ring stage, perhaps due to a defect in DV biogenesis because of an accumulation of multiple unshed proteins (or one or more critical proteins) on the plasma membrane of the internalised parasite. A similar but less severe intracellular growth phenotype results from selective loss of MSP1 shedding in the MSP1<sub>PP</sub> mutant.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61121-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Using IFA, western blot and mass spectrometry to compare SUB2-expressing and ΔSUB2 parasite cultures, we confirmed that SUB2 is required for shedding of MSP1, AMA1 and PTRAMP. We also identified several putative new SUB2 substrates not known to associate with any of the three previously known substrates. Some of the most prominent of these, including MSP2, MSP4, MSP5 and Pf92, belong to a group of merozoite surface proteins known or predicted to possess GPI anchors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanders et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Marshall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marshall et al., 1997</xref>). Since GPI-anchored proteins cannot be shed by rhomboid cleavage (which occurs within TMDs), it is likely that shedding of each is independently catalysed by SUB2. The other newly identified SUB2 substrate, MSRP2, likely has no GPI anchor (so could be peripherally associated with one of the GPI-anchored substrates) but does undergo proteolytic cleavage around egress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kadekoppala et al., 2010</xref>). This wide range of SUB2 substrates was unexpected; indeed earlier work that did not benefit from access to mutants concluded that MSP2 and MSP4 are not shed at invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyle et al., 2014</xref>). Previous extensive mutagenesis analysis of the AMA1 SUB2 cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olivieri et al., 2011</xref>) indicated that SUB2 has a rather promiscuous substrate recognition profile, cleaving its membrane-bound substrates at a roughly similar distance from the membrane rather than at a specific amino acid sequence. Our new mass spectrometric evidence revealing a diverse range of additional putative SUB2 substrates supports that model and underlines the potential for multiple consequences of SUB2 inhibition. It was interesting to note that SUB2 depletion resulted in significantly <italic>upregulated</italic> levels in culture supernatants of a number of merozoite proteins, particularly prominent examples including a conserved protein of unknown function (PF3D7_0520800), an inner membrane complex protein (PF3D7_1003600), and the myosin A tail interacting protein PF3D7_1246400 (MTIP), a component of the merozoite actinomyosin contractile system that drives invasion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> and the left-hand side of the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Whilst we were initially puzzled by this, we suspect that these proteins might simply be derived from degradation of merozoites that failed to invade in the ΔSUB2 cultures; these merozoites would accumulate extracellularly and eventually disintegrate, likely leading to increased supernatant levels of merozoite proteins unrelated to the activity of SUB2.</p><p>Despite the reduction in merozoite surface protein shedding, ΔSUB2 parasites formed new rings at the end of cycle 0, albeit at ~50% reduced efficiency. These uniformly arrested, and growth assays supported by genetic complementation proved that SUB2 is indispensable for parasite survival. To dissect the phenotype, we generated lines in which shedding of the most abundant SUB2 substrate, the MSP1 complex, was selectively inhibited. These mutants invaded with wild type efficiency but displayed a developmental defect similar to – if somewhat less severe than - that of the ΔSUB2 mutants. Given the technical difficulties in determining causality upon intracellular arrest in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, we can only speculate on the underlying defect(s). The MSP1<sub>19</sub> species remaining on the merozoite surface following SUB2-mediated shedding has been shown to be a highly stable constituent of the post-invasion membrane rearrangements involved in formation of the acidic digestive vacuole (DV) that is the site of haemoglobin catabolism during intraerythrocytic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dluzewski et al., 2008</xref>). Formation of the DV appears to arise through endocytosis of plasma membrane constituents (including MSP1<sub>19</sub>), forming a number of small endocytic vesicles that eventually fuse to form the single DV. As a result, MSP1<sub>19</sub> is the earliest known marker for the DV in the developing ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dluzewski et al., 2008</xref>). We speculate that in the absence of SUB2-mediated shedding, the bulky MSP1 complex remaining on the plasma membrane of the internalised parasite, likely together with other unshed SUB2 substrates, interferes with DV biogenesis, inhibiting haemoglobin digestion and stalling growth. The lack of haemozoin in both the cycle 1 ΔSUB2 parasites and many arrested iMSP1<sub>PP</sub> mutants is consistent with this model. We suggest that the intracellular death phenotype of the ΔSUB2 mutant was more severe than that of the RAP-treated iMSP1<sub>PP</sub> mutant due to the fact that in the case of the ΔSUB2 mutant none of the multiple SUB2 substrates are shed, leading to a much more pronounced effect on DV biogenesis than that caused by lack of shedding of the MSP1 complex alone.</p><p>The most dramatic phenotype associated with loss of SUB2 was extensive lysis of targeted RBCs. What could underlie this? The mechanisms regulating PVM formation, resealing and scission during invasion by apicomplexan parasites are not understood. Numerous EM studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aikawa et al., 1978</xref>) indicate that, topologically, invasion resembles induced invagination of the RBC membrane, so that the host RBC cytosol is never exposed to the extracellular milieu. Conflicting with this is recent evidence that successful RBC invasion by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> merozoites involves the formation of a transient discontinuity in the host cell membrane, allowing Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux into the RBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Volz et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, an elegant time-resolved patch-clamp study in the related apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> detected a spike in host cell membrane conductance upon apical attachment of the parasite, again consistent with pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suss-Toby et al., 1996</xref>). Near the end of invasion, as the parasite posterior enters the nascent PVM, it seems likely that a membrane scission event seals the shrinking TJ aperture, and evidence for this too was found in the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Suss-Toby et al., 1996</xref>). Recent work in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> suggests that PVM scission is aided by rotation of the parasite along its apical-posterior axis immediately following entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pavlou et al., 2018</xref>), and malaria merozoites have also been observed to spin post invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dvorak et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yahata et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Given these models of pore formation early in invasion and a membrane scission event at the end of the process, it seems plausible that a defect in either could cause a localised loss of host cell membrane integrity sufficiently catastrophic to result in lysis. RBC lysis associated with defective or delayed entry has been previously documented even in wild type <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dvorak et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yahata et al., 2012</xref>), and indeed we noticed phalloidin-labelled RBC ghosts at low frequency in our control cultures, so the process is clearly sensitive to perturbation. We suggest that RBC lysis associated with loss of SUB2 is at least in part due to an accumulation of unshed merozoite surface proteins at the narrowing TJ aperture, preventing sealing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). That lysis does not occur in the presence of cytD, which blocks invasion at the point of TJ assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miller et al., 1979</xref>), is consistent with this. Our MSP1 mutagenesis results show that inhibition of MSP1 shedding is not alone sufficient to cause lysis, but since MSP1 is just one of many SUB2 substrates this mutant cannot recapitulate the entire ΔSUB2 phenotype, where multiple proteins remain unshed from the invading parasite surface. It is similarly possible that, among the many substrates of SUB2, there is one that captures the entire phenotype. Genetic analysis of each of the new substrates identified here would be required to resolve that question.</p><p>While we favour the above model, alternative scenarios cannot be ruled out. Disruption of the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> rhomboid protease TgROM4, which sheds several key parasite adhesins, resulted in ‘hyper adhesive’ parasites that bound to host cells with enhanced avidity but displayed a defect in entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buguliskis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rugarabamu et al., 2015</xref>). This was likely due to excessive adhesion and the absence of release of points of contact with the host cell membrane, creating a physical obstacle to entry into the nascent PV. A similar phenomenon, leading to high levels of adhesive traction on the RBC membrane, could potentially underlie the RBC lysis induced by the ΔSUB2 mutants. SUB2 depletion could also conceivably result in a defect in rhoptry discharge, although we consider this unlikely since the ΔSUB2 merozoites induced extensive RBC echinocytosis, a phenomenon associated with normal rhoptry function in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ΔSUB2 phenotype may be magnified by the fact that the SUB2 substrate AMA1 is a core component of the TJ, bridging the parasite to the RBC through interactions with RON2, a member of a complex of rhoptry neck proteins inserted into the host cell membrane early in the invasion pathway, perhaps at pore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Srinivasan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lamarque et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tyler and Boothroyd, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamarque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Collins et al., 2009</xref>). The AMA1-RON2 interaction may play a role in drawing the TJ orifice closed as the parasite posterior enters the PV. If so, an attractive concept is that SUB2-mediated release of the AMA1 ectodomain may facilitate pinching off of the PVM, and so we initially considered that loss of AMA1 shedding might be primarily responsible for the ΔSUB2 lysis phenotype. We were therefore surprised to find that selective inhibition of AMA1 shedding had no impact on invasion or viability. By contrast, disruption of AMA1 expression <italic>did</italic> produce a lysis phenotype, as well as the expected loss of invasion. We reconcile these disparate observations by speculating that lysis occurs upon loss of AMA1 because the RBC membrane is compromised early in invasion by insertion of the RON complex (which occurs independently of the presence of AMA1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamarque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giovannini et al., 2011</xref>) but subsequent stabilisation of the TJ cannot occur. We suspect that, whilst superficially similar, the mechanism underlying RBC lysis by ΔAMA merozoites is therefore distinct from that induced by the ΔSUB2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>A role for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> AMA1 in RBC sealing has been postulated previously, based on work using a less efficient conditional mutagenesis strategy which led to variable levels of AMA1 depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yap et al., 2014</xref>). In that study many parasites that invaded failed to develop, leading the authors to suggest that even a partial sealing defect could stall development. We concur, and although we detected no membrane defects in the ΔSUB2 cycle one rings, the developmental arrest we observed in the ΔSUB2 and MSP1 cleavage site mutants might also stem from a sealing defect insufficiently severe to cause lysis. Interestingly, neither the Yap et al. study nor other studies of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> or <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> AMA1-null mutants noted widespread host cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giovannini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mital et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bargieri et al., 2013</xref>). We suspect three likely reasons for this. First, our conditional gene disruption system is highly efficient, with close to 100% conversion in a single erythrocytic cycle. Second, in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> disruption of AMA1 can lead to upregulation of AMA1 paralogues absent in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamarque et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2016</xref>).

Our work identifies SUB2 as a critical mediator of host RBC integrity and parasite viability.

The number of phalloidin-labelled ghosts per image was counted manually for each treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Haemoglobin release assay</title><p>DMSO- or RAP-treated mature SUB2HA3:loxP schizonts were Percoll-enriched and resuspended in fresh RPMI 1640-Albumax. Schizont suspensions were mixed with an equal volume of either RPMI 1640-Albumax (control; schizonts only) or RBCs at a 2% haematocrit in RPMI 1640-Albumax (co-culture; schizonts plus RBCs). Two additional control samples were set up comprising a similar volume of only RBCs (2% haematocrit) in RPMI 1640-Albumax mixed with an equal volume of RPMI 1640-Albumax (RBC controls). RBCs from one of these samples were immediately pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant removed and 200 μl water added to obtain hypotonic lysis of the RBCs. Complete lysis was ensured by subjecting the sample to repeated freeze thawing. RPMI 1640-Albumax was then added to return the sample to the original volume. This sample acted as total RBC lysate control.</p><p>The schizont only control samples, the co-culture samples and the second RBC control sample were incubated with gentle shaking for 4–6 hr at 37°C to allow egress and/or invasion. In some experiments the medium was supplemented with cytochalasin D (10 μM) or 0.5% DMSO (vehicle only) as a control. All samples were then clarified by centrifugation and the culture medium filtered through a 2 μm filter. The samples of culture medium were then subjected to serial 2-fold dilutions in RPMI 1640-Albumax, and the haemoglobin content relative to that of the total RBC lysate determined by absorbance at 405 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Snell and Marini, 1988</xref>) using a Spectramax M multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices). The pelleted cells from the schizont-containing samples were centrifuged over Percoll cushions to remove residual schizonts and the newly-invaded rings returned to culture. Samples of these were taken immediately as well as 18 hr and 24 hr later for flow cytometry and microscopic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Time-lapse DIC video microscopy of egress and invasion</title><p>Visualisation of egress was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thomas et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, mature schizonts were Percoll-enriched then returned to culture for 4 hr in RPMI 1640-Albumax supplemented with compound 2 (4-[7-[(dimethylamino)methyl]−2-(4-fluorphenyl)imidazo[1,2-<italic>α</italic>]pyridine-3-yl]pyrimidin-2-amine, C2; 1 μM) to arrest and synchronise the schizonts in a highly mature, pre-egress stage. The parasites were then pelleted, washed twice in pre-warmed, gassed RPMI 1640-Albumax medium without C2, then finally pelleted at 1800 x g for 1 min and immediately resuspended at ~1×10<sup>7</sup> cells/μl in pre-warmed gassed medium without C2. The parasites were introduced by capillary flow into a pre-warmed viewing chamber, made by adhering a 22 × 64 mm borosilicate glass coverslip to a microscope slide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Collins et al., 2013b</xref>), then at once imaged on a 37°C heated stage on a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 microscope, using a EC Plan-Neofluar 1006/1.3 oil immersion DIC objective fitted with an AxioCam MRm camera. Images were collected at 5 s intervals for 30 mins, annotated and exported as QuickTime movies using Axiovision 3.1.</p><p>To image invasion, Percoll-enriched, highly synchronous mature schizonts from RAP- or DMSO-treated cultures were added to fresh RBCs at a 2% haematocrit in pre-warmed, gassed RPMI 1640-Albumax to achieve a parasitaemia of ~10%. The cells were introduced into a pre-warmed viewing chamber, transferred to the heated stage (maintained at 37°C) of a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E wide field microscope and imaged with a Hamamatsu C11440 digital camera using a Nikon N Plan Apo 100 × 1.45 NA oil immersion objective. DIC images were acquired at 1 s intervals for 30 min, exported as ND2 files and annotated using Fiji (Image J version 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Proteomic analysis</title><p>Supernatants of DMSO-and RAP-treated SUB2HA3:loxP schizonts samples following egress and invasion in Albumax-free RPMI 1640 medium were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 16.5% Mini-PROTEIN Tris-Tricine gels (BioRad). Reduced and alkylated proteins from band slices excised from the entire separation profile were in-gel digested at 37°C overnight with 100 ng trypsin (modified sequencing grade, Promega). Supernatants were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 0.1% TFA. Peptides were loaded onto an Ultimate 3000 nanoRSLC HPLC (Thermo Scientific) coupled to a 2 mm x 0.3 mm Acclaim Pepmap C18 trap column (Thermo Scientific) at 15 μl/min prior to elution at 0.25 μl/min through a 50 cm x 75 μm EasySpray C18 column into an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). A gradient of 2–32% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid over 45 min was used, prior to washing (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) and re-equilibration. The Orbitrap was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with a survey scan at a resolution of 120,000 from m/z 300–1500, followed by MS/MS in TopS mode. Dynamic exclusion was used with a time window of 20 s. The Orbitrap charge capacity was set to a maximum of 1 x e<sup>6</sup> ions in 10 ms, whilst the LTQ was set to 1 x e<sup>4</sup> ions in 100 ms. Raw files were processed using Maxquant 1.3.0.5 and Perseus 1.4.0.11. A decoy database of reversed sequences was used to filter false positives, at a peptide false detection rate of 1%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Serial block-face scanning EM (SBF-SEM) and transmission EM (TEM)</title><p>Mature schizonts enriched from DMSO- and RAP-treated SUB2HA3:loxP cultures were incubated with fresh RBCs for 4 hr to allow invasion, then newly-invaded rings isolated as described. Either immediately or following further culture for 20 hr, the parasites were washed, fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), then further washed in 0.2 M phosphate buffer (PB), embedded in 4% low gelling temperature agarose and cut into 1 mm<sup>3</sup> blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hanssen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>For TEM, sample blocks were washed 4 × 15 min in PB and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 hr at 4°C. After further washes in PB at room temperature, the blocks were stained in 1% tannic acid for 45 min and quenched in 1% sodium sulphate for 5 min. The blocks were then washed 4 × 5 min in distilled water and dehydrated through an ethanol series (70–100%, 2 × 10 min each). Finally, the sample blocks were embedded by incubating in propylene oxide (PO) for 10 min, then overnight in a 1:1 PO:Epon 812 (TAAB) resin mixture, followed by 3 changes of pure Epon resin over 2 d, and baking at 60°C for 24 hr. For TEM image collection, 80 nm sections were stained with lead citrate and imaged in a Tecnai Spirit BioTwin (Thermofisher Scientific) transmission electron microscope.</p><p>For SBF-SEM, samples were embedded in agarose as above, then processed using a protocol adapted from the NCMIR protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ncmir.ucsd.edu/sbem-protocol">https://ncmir.ucsd.edu/sbem-protocol</ext-link>). Briefly, the sample blocks were washed 4 × 15 min in 0.1 M PB and post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide/1.5% potassium ferrocyanide for 1 hr at 4°C, washed 5 × 3 min in water (also after the following steps up to the dehydration), incubated in 1% w/v thiocarbohydrazide for 20 min before a second staining with 2% osmium tetroxide for 30 min, followed by incubation overnight in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate at 4°C. The sample blocks were then stained with Walton’s lead aspartate for 30 min at 60°C and dehydrated through an ethanol series on ice (25–100%, 10 min each). Finally, the sample blocks were embedded as above, except Durcupan (TAAB) resin was used and the baking step was for 48 hr. Embedded samples were trimmed and mounted on pins using conductive epoxy glue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Russell et al., 2017</xref>). SBF-SEM images were collected using a 3View 2XP system (Gatan Inc), mounted on a Sigma VP scanning electron microscope (Zeiss). Images were collected at 1.9 kV, with a 30 μm aperture, at 6 Pa chamber pressure, and a 2 μs dwell time. The datasets were 69.63 × 69.63×13 μm, and 69.63 × 69.63×12.6 μm in xyz, consisting of 260 and 252 serial images of 50 nm thickness and a pixel size of 8.5 × 8.5 nm. The total volume of the datasets was ~63,028 μm<sup>3</sup> and ~61,089 μm<sup>3</sup>. SBF-SEM movies were processed in Fiji to adjust brightness and contrast, binned to 4096 × 4,096 pixels, and then converted to AVI, before exporting from Quicktime Pro as 950 × 950 pixel H.264 movies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>All graphs of experimental data and statistical analysis were generated using GraphPad Prism 8.0.

Central to these events is the interaction between parasite adhesins and the host cell membrane. The present study uses elegant genetics and a collection of analytical approaches to investigate the function of a parasite protease, SUB2, previously shown to mediate proteolysis of several key adhesins. The authors conclusively demonstrate that SUB2 is essential for parasite viability. Using conditional mutagenesis the authors provide precise insight into the timing and character of defects associated with SUB2 loss, including abortive invasion events that lead to host cell lysis or developmental arrest. Using mass spectrometry, the authors also confirm a role of SUB2 in shedding of MSP1, AMA1 and PTRAMP and uncover additional potential SUB2 substrates. By generating uncleavable MSP1 substrate they partially recapitulate the SUB2 phenotype, whilst the uncleavable form of AMA1 has no phenotype, suggesting that the lethal consequences of SUB2 disruption likely result from the combined effects of multiple substrates. They also present the phenotype of an AMA1 mutant using an efficient conditional strategy that shows its essential role for invasion. The present study addresses a critical gap in our understanding of apicomplexan invasion: how the host membrane is resealed following invasion. The experiments are accurately performed and well-presented but some conclusions require clarification and a more nuanced interpretation that acknowledges experimental limitations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Differences between the mutants need to be more carefully considered. There is no evidence that the phenotype of SUB2 is linked to interference with AMA1 function, as proposed in the last paragraph of the Discussion. It is true that SUB2 and AMA1 mutants induce host cell lysis, but lysis seems to be the consequence of two different defects in the two mutants. In AMA1 mutants, that do not invade, the host cell lysis is likely due to injection of rhoptry proteins without stabilization of TJ, as proposed. By contrast, data suggest that lysis in SUB2 reflects a post-invasion failure, such as PVM scission defect and/or a host membrane repair defect. The narrative is too forceful in trying to reconcile what may be two separate phenotypes. The data on the AMA1 knockout could be removed without affecting the overall thrust of the story; alternatively, the results of the AMA1 knockout must be adequately contextualized. The authors should also more carefully discuss the differences between MSP1(PP) and SUB2 KO phenotypes noting that the delay in development appears very different (compare Figure 6D to Figure 4G). It is perhaps expected that a protease with many substrates would have pleiotropic effects that are not captured by individual substrates; however, formally speaking, the authors cannot rule out that there exists, among the other substrates of SUB2, one that captures the entire phenotype.</p><p>2) The data implicating SUB2 in membrane 'sealing' are indirect and alternative models should be discussed. Can the authors formally distinguish between adhesion, invasion, and membrane scission? For example, SUB2 knockout parasites may be hyper adhesive and enter cells through passive association rather than productive invasion. In other settings, such as sporozoite transmigration, parasites might be found inside of host cells without having secreted rhoptries, and such events would still be dependent on gliding motility, could elicit leakage and lysis of host cells, but would not appropriately establish a replicative niche. Have the authors examined rhoptry secretion in the context of SUB2 loss? If the SUB2 mutant is defective in sealing, one would expect the parasite to remain accessible to antibodies in the absence of RBC permeabilization. Albeit challenging, it might be worthwhile to determine whether surface proteins like AMA1 and MSP1 remain accessible to antibodies at the site of resealing in the absence of permeabilization (shortly after invasion). A time course experiment could help clarify whether lysis predominantly follows invasion, e.g. using phalloidin and Hoechst staining to enumerate infected and lysed cells after 15min, 1h, and 4h, similarly to what was done in Figure 5D. Incomplete shedding of MSP1 might also induce transient host cell damage that would affect the progression of growth, which could be tested by quantifying hemoglobin release and phalloidin staining. Excessive adhesion could create a physical obstacle to membrane resealing without SUB2 directly participating in the process. Similarly, host cell lysis could be a product of excessive traction on the membrane as the parasite moves against the host plasma membrane without releasing any points of contact-again explaining the observations without direct involvement of SUB2 in membrane resealing. The authors should consider the title of the manuscript in addressing these concerns and possibly modify their terminology (i.e. 'invasion defect' is used to describe the defect of the SUB2 when a defect in sealing but not internalization is proposed).</p><p>3) The authors conclude that Hb release does not occur in the presence of CytD, whilst there is a significant increase (p-value **). The same increase is observed in the SUB2 mutant. Is it linked to the addition of CytD on RBCs alone or a real effect of blocking parasite invasion at an early step? A control of RBCs with CytD without infection seems a necessary control for this experiment.</p><p>4) The mass spec experiment in Figure 3 is very interesting and should be analyzed in greater detail. E.g. what are proteins with a low score, there are two IMC associate proteins in this sample, is there an explanation? Naturally, there is much noise in mass spec so interpretations should be performed carefully. Figure 3 could be colored by all of the proteins expected to be secreted or on the surface, and additional controls (not expected to be shed). Figure 3—source data 1 should list razor and unique peptides separately, since several proteins are identified with a single peptide. Raw proteomics data should be deposited in an open archive.</p><p>5) The last paragraph of the Discussion proposes that the arrested post-invasion development of the SUB2 mutant is likely due to inhibition of DV biogenesis; however, there is no clear experimental evidence showing that MSP1-19 plays an active role in the biogenesis and function of the food vacuole during the intra-erythrocytic phase.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61121.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Differences between the mutants need to be more carefully considered.

We accept all these points, and have now attempted to modify our revised text at the appropriate points in the manuscript in order to accommodate these concepts. We hope these changes are satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data implicating SUB2 in membrane 'sealing' are indirect and alternative models should be discussed.

In this case, our conclusions implicating SUB2 activity in RBC membrane sealing are primarily based on: (1) the major phenotype (RBC lysis); and (2) our visual examination of the interactions between SUB2-null merozoites and target RBCs. We did our best to test the role of individual SUB2 substrates by the production of cleavage-resistance or null mutants but – as the reviewer points out above – our capacity to fully dissect the phenotype was ultimately hindered by the sheer range of different substrates affected by loss of SUB2. Given these experimental limitations, we acknowledge that there is a need to discuss alternative models, including effects on parasite adhesion. We have now included suitable text within the relevant sections of the revised Discussion. We maintain that the title of the manuscript is completely justified given the RBC lysis phenotype, which to our knowledge is unprecedented.</p><p>With regard to the specific experimental questions raised by the reviewer, we used target RBC echinocytosis as a proxy read-out for rhoptry discharge, since previous data from us and others (cited in the text) has convincingly linked rhoptry secretion to echinocytosis. We used EM to investigate the sealing defect, rather than investigating access of the intracellular parasite to antibodies. Regarding whether lysis can occur at extended time points following invasion by the ~50% of SUB2-null merozoites that could successfully establish rings, the time-course experiment suggested would likely not provide unambiguous results due to ongoing continued egress and invasion events in the cultures, which would continue anyway to increase the numbers of phalloidin positive cells in a time-dependent manner. However, In our own experiments, we found no evidence for further release of haemoglobin upon washing and reculturing cycle 1 rings produced by SUB2-null parasites. This suggests that following successful entry there was no further ‘leakage’ of haemoglobin. This is now referred to briefly in the relevant section of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors conclude that Hb release does not occur in the presence of CytD, while there is a significant increase (p-value **). The same increase is observed in the SUB2 mutant. Is it linked to the addition of CytD on RBCs alone or a real effect of blocking parasite invasion at an early step? A control of RBCs with CytD without infection seems a necessary control for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a well-observed point, and refers to the data shown in Figure 5. We have now carried out the recommended control experiment, evaluating the effects of cytD or vehicle alone on Hb release from uninfected RBCs. Consistent with the data shown in Figure 5C, this showed that cytD treatment indeed induces a small but significant release of Hb from uninfected RBCs. Importantly, these findings do not alter our central conclusions from the experiments shown in Figure 5. Rather than modifying Figure 5. in the revised manuscript, the new control data are simply referred to in the revised Figure 5 legend and are presented as an additional supplementary figure (now Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The mass spec experiment in Figure 3 is very interesting and should be analyzed in greater detail.

However we fully agree with the reviewer that the mass spec data are very interesting and warrant additional discussion. So for our revised submission we have followed the reviewers’ recommendations, expanding the relevant section of the Discussion section. We have also colour-coded Figure 3, modified Figure 3—source data 1 as suggested, and deposited the raw proteomic data with the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The last paragraph of the Discussion proposes that the arrested post-invasion development of the SUB2 mutant is likely due to inhibition of DV biogenesis; however, there is no clear experimental evidence showing that MSP1-19 plays an active role in the biogenesis and function of the food vacuole during the intra-erythrocytic phase.</p></disp-quote><p>We entirely accept that there is no experimental evidence implicating MSP1-19 in DV biogenesis; the available evidence (see Dluzewski et al., 2008) simply shows that MSP1-19 is the first known marker for the developing DV membrane, indicating that plasma membrane constituents of the newly-invaded parasite are involved in biogenesis of the DV membrane. However, our speculative suggestion to explain the phenotype of the uncleavable MSP1 mutants is not that MSP1-19 is required for DV formation, but that a lack of MSP1 shedding interferes with DV biogenesis, due to the bulky surface coat components remaining on the plasma membrane of the intracellular merozoite. The distinction is subtle but key, and we believe this speculation is completely justified. Given this, we have now slightly modified and expanded our text in the earlier part of the Discussion to clarify our thinking on this point. We hope this is acceptable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
