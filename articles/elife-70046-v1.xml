NAD<sup>+</sup> has been shown to impact multiple processes that are dysregulated in cancer; however, anti-cancer therapies targeting NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis have had limited success due to insufficient mechanistic understanding. Here, we adapted a <italic>Drosophila</italic> glial neoplasia model and discovered the genetic requirement for NAD<sup>+</sup> synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) in glioma progression in vivo and in human glioma cells. Overexpressing enzymatically active NMNAT significantly promotes glial neoplasia growth and reduces animal viability. Mechanistic analysis suggests that NMNAT interferes with DNA damage-p53-caspase-3 apoptosis signaling pathway by enhancing NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent posttranslational modifications (PTMs) poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and deacetylation of p53. Since PARylation and deacetylation reduce p53 pro-apoptotic activity, modulating p53 PTMs could be a key mechanism by which NMNAT promotes glioma growth. Our findings reveal a novel tumorigenic mechanism involving protein complex formation of p53 with NAD<sup>+</sup> synthetic enzyme NMNAT and NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PTM enzymes that regulates glioma growth.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One of the most common types of brain cancer, glioma, emerges when harmful mutations take place in the ‘glial’ cells tasked with supporting neurons. When these genetically damaged cells are not fixed or eliminated, they can go on to multiply uncontrollability. A protein known as p53 can help to repress emerging tumors by stopping mutated cells in their tracks.</p><p>Glioma is a highly deadly cancer, and treatments are often ineffective. Some of these approaches have focused on a protein involved in the creation of the coenzyme NAD+, which is essential to the life processes of all cells. However, these drugs have had poor outcomes.</p><p>Instead, Liu et al. focused on NMNAT, the enzyme that participates in the final stage of the creation of NAD+. NMNAT is known to protect neurons, but it is unclear how it involved in cancer. Experiments in fruit flies which were then validated in human glioma cells showed that increased NMNAT activity allowed glial cells with harmful mutations to survive and multiply. Detailed molecular analysis showed that NMNAT orchestrates chemical modifications that inactivate p53. It does so by working with other molecular actors to direct NAD+ to add and remove chemical groups that control the activity of p53.</p><p>Taken together, these results show how NMNAT can participate in the emergence of brain cancers. They also highlight the need for further research on whether drugs that inhibit this enzyme could help to suppress tumors before they become deadly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RAS</kwd><kwd>PARP</kwd><kwd>NAD</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd><kwd>glial cell</kwd><kwd>deacetylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82073888</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hongbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and technology support program for youth innovation in universities of Shandong</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019KJM009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hongbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhai</surname><given-names>Rong Grace</given-names></name><name><surname>Rai</surname><given-names>Priyamvada</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bohai Rim Advanced Research Institute for Drug Discovery (LX211011)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Hongbo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>NMNAT is genetically required for glioma development and promotes glioma growth by allowing a higher tolerance to DNA damage and inhibiting DNA damage-p53-caspase-3 apoptosis signaling pathway by enhancing NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent posttranslational modifications (PTMs) poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) and deacetylation of p53.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glioma is the most common intrinsic tumor of the central nervous system (CNS) and derives from the neoplastic glial cells or neuroglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodenberger and Jenkins, 2012</xref>). Based on pathological criteria, gliomas are classified from WHO grade I to IV, among which the high-grade gliomas generally have a much poorer prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wesseling and Capper, 2018</xref>). Several major cellular signaling pathways associated with glioma have been well studied, including RTK/Ras/PI3K, p53, and RB signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2008</xref>). In addition, metabolism factors, such as IDH1/2, were found to play important roles in glioma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2009</xref>). IDH1 is an enzyme of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in glucose metabolism and the main producer of NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Molenaar et al., 2014</xref>). However, drugs targeting these pathways showed a limited clinical response, indicating a critical need for the mechanistic understanding of the metabolic requirement for glioma tumorigenesis.</p><p>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) is an essential signaling cofactor that regulates cancer metabolism through its co-enzymatic function for many bioenergetic pathways, including glycolysis, TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>). Multiple processes associated with NAD<sup>+</sup> signaling are dysregulated in cancer, including DNA repair, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiarugi et al., 2012</xref>). Inherited polymorphisms and epigenetic repression of DNA damage repair genes are significantly correlated with the risk of gliomas, indicating that abnormal DNA damage repair plays important roles in glioma formation and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). One of the key initiation events of DNA damage response is poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-mediated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), the main process that consumes nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amé et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent SIRTs-mediated deacetylation regulates many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks and Gu, 2009</xref>). Consistently, a high level of NAD<sup>+</sup> is observed in gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tso et al., 2006</xref>), and 90% of gliomas are susceptible to NAD<sup>+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tateishi et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is critical for rapidly proliferating glioma cells to replenish the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool for survival.</p><p>In the past years, targeting NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism has been considered for cancer therapy, and most efforts have been focused on nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage pathway, whose expression is increased in multiple types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lucena-Cacace et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohanna et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pylaeva et al., 2019</xref>). Disappointingly, several clinical trials of NAMPT inhibitors have failed due to low efficacy and high toxicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sampath et al., 2015</xref>), which demands the urgent consideration of an alternative target in the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic pathway. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT), the last enzyme in the NAD<sup>+</sup> salvage synthetic pathway, has recently emerged as a potential candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiarugi et al., 2012</xref>). NMNAT has three isoforms in mammals with distinct subcellular localizations: NMNAT1, in the nucleus; NMNAT2, in the cytosol; and NMNAT3, in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2005</xref>). Dysregulations of both NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 have been implicated in cancer. For example, NMNAT1 is considered a poor prognostic marker for renal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Uhlen et al., 2017</xref>). Decreased NMNAT1 expression leads to epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henderson et al., 2017</xref>). Inhibition of NMNAT1 delays DNA repair and increases rRNA transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Song et al., 2013</xref>). In colorectal cancer, NMNAT2 upregulation correlates with the cancer invasive depth and TNM stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qi et al., 2018</xref>). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NMNAT2 enzymatic activity is upregulated by SIRT3-mediated deacetylation process or p53 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pan et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, the depletion of NMNAT2 inhibits cell growth indirectly by reducing glucose availability in neuroblastoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>). These observations indicate the regulatory link between compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis and cellular metabolism and rapid cancer cell growth, and further underscore the potential of NMNAT as a viable alternative target in NAD<sup>+</sup> synthetic pathway, given their aberrant regulation and critical role in cancer metabolism.</p><p>In this report, to address the knowledge gap regarding the role of NMNAT in glioma, we adapted an in vivo glial neoplasia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Read et al., 2009</xref>) and discovered a genetic requirement for NMNAT in glioma growth. Combined with human glioma cell culture models, we characterized the mechanism of NMNAT in gliomagenesis. Our results identified the upregulation of enzymatically active NMNAT as an essential metabolic regulator for promoting gliomagenesis and revealed that NMNAT-sustained PARylation and deacetylation of p53 results in suppression of apoptosis, a key tumor-inhibitory response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NMNAT is upregulated in oncogenic <italic>Ras<sup>v12</sup></italic> induced glial neoplasia</title><p>The Ras/Raf/ERK signaling cascade is one of the most conserved pathways both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human, and a major component of the MAP kinase signaling stress-response network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morrison, 2012</xref>). <italic>RAS</italic> mutations are the most commonly found oncogenic alteration in human cancers, most frequently observed in <italic>KRAS</italic> (85%), and to a lesser degree in <italic>NRAS</italic> (12%) and <italic>HRAS</italic> (3%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Simanshu et al., 2017</xref>).

PFT-α is reported to inhibit translocation of p53 and affect p53-related transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Komarov et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murphy et al., 2004</xref>). We analyzed glial neoplasia tissue volume with GFP and DAPI staining in the CNS of flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The glial neoplasia volume was significantly increased in PFT-α-treated flies compared to that in DMSO-treated flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The increase in glial neoplasia volume was accompanied by a decrease in survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and the reduced cleaved caspase-3 intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest p53 is critical for inhibiting glial neoplastic growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and p53 inhibition phenocopies NMNAT overexpression in glial neoplasia growth. p53 depletion rescues NMNAT knockdown induced caspase-3 activation.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>p53 inhibitor increases glial neoplasia volume in CNS and larvae lethality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flies expressing Ras<sup>v12</sup> and CD8GFP were treated with DMSO or p53 inhibitor, respectively, stained with cleaved caspase-3 (red) and DAPI (blue).

After p53 depletion, we carried out siNMNAT-mediated knockdown and probed for cleaved caspase-3 to examine the activation of apoptosis in both T98G and U87MG cells.

Maintaining functional DNA repair is critical for cancer cells to survive during rapid cell proliferation and the accompanying constant need for DNA replication. In response to DNA damage, PARP1 catalyzes NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARylation of a large number of proteins (including p53), a process that is one of the largest NAD<sup>+</sup> consumers in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2005</xref>). It has been shown that PARylated p53 has reduced stability and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simbulan-Rosenthal et al., 1999</xref>). We hypothesize that NMNAT regulates PARylation in glioma cells. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the level of protein PARylation under NMNAT overexpression, and using dot blot analysis, we found that protein PARylation level was significantly increased in NMNAT1 or NMNAT2 overexpressing cells and significantly reduced with siRNA knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Furthermore, although total p53 levels were not significantly affected by NMNAT expression, the level of PARP1 immunoprecipitated with p53 was increased with NMNAT overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). We observed consistent results in U87MG cells that NMNAT interacts with p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>).

A strong negative correlation between NMNAT1 expression and survival can be seen in patients with brain lower grade glioma (LGG), with elevated NMNAT1 expression significantly associated with a lower disease-free survival rate, both when comparing survival in the median high-low tumor expression patient groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>) and in the highest and lowest 10% expression groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>).

We found that NMNAT promotes glioma growth by allowing a higher tolerance to DNA damage and inhibiting p53/caspase-mediated apoptosis. Mechanistically, upregulation of enzymatically active NMNAT promotes the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PTMs of p53. Specifically, we detected upregulation of protein PARylation and the presence of a p53-NMNAT-PARP1 trimeric complex as well as decreased acetylation of p53 accompanied with increased SIRT1. Our findings support a tumorigenesis model where NMNAT proteins promote glioma growth through regulating NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PTM of p53, and driving cellular pools of p53 toward PARylated-p53 (inactive p53) and away from acetyl-p53 (active p53) to ameliorate DNA damage-triggered cell death under oncogenic stresses associated with tumor development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The advantages and potential of an in vivo <italic>Drosophila</italic> glial neoplasia</title><p>We adapted a glial neoplasia model in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using the <italic>UAS-Ras85D<sup>v12</sup></italic> and repo-GAL4 driver system that induces overgrowth of glial cells to mimic glial neoplasia formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Read et al., 2009</xref>).

It will be an important future direction to establish <italic>Drosophila</italic> models using other high-frequency glioma drivers. Since all <italic>Drosophila</italic> glia express Repo, we can easily monitor the formation of <italic>Ras<sup>v12</sup></italic>-driven glial neoplasia in the brain by GFP reporter, Repo, and F-actin labeling. In fluorescence imaging, normal brains typically have two to three layers of Repo-positive cells visible in each section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, any tissue mass consisting of more than three layers of glia would be atypical and potentially tumor-like. We analyzed glial neoplasia with three key criteria: cell type (Repo-positive), cell number (more than three layers with at least 400), and tissue size (volume of at least 12.4×10<sup>3</sup> μm<sup>3</sup>). Combined with our high-resolution imaging capability, these criteria allow us to distinguish tumor from non-glial neoplasia tissue with high confidence and to analyze glial neoplasia in the most robust and reproducible manner. In <italic>Ras<sup>v12</sup></italic> expressing flies, we observed glial neoplasia occurred extensively in the brain and VNC.</p><p>In addition to the morphological phenotypes, we found that glial neoplasia reduced the animal survival rate. Specifically, the total volume of glial neoplasia tissue is positively correlated with the severity of reduced animal survival rate. Such correlation allows the use of high-resolution in vivo morphological imaging as a strong predictor of pathological outcome and a powerful tool to identify genetic modulators of tumorigenesis as we have done in this study, and potential pharmacological modulators for cancer therapy in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>NMNAT-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis promotes glioma growth</title><p>Our results show that NMNAT expression promotes glioma growth but is likely dispensable for its initiation, as NMNAT overexpression alone did not trigger tumorigenesis. Our results showed that the enzymatic function of NMNAT is required for glioma growth. This finding is not surprising given the fundamental role of NAD<sup>+</sup> as a signaling cofactor that regulates cancer metabolism through its coenzymatic function in the redox reactions underlying essential bioenergetic pathways, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000</xref>). While NAMPT is the rate-limiting enzyme, NMNAT is downstream of NAMPT and directly regulates the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> by catalyzing the reversible reaction of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis. The direction of the reaction, forward (NAD<sup>+</sup> production) or reverse (NAD<sup>+</sup> breakdown), is dependent upon the availability of subtracts. Therefore, NMNAT functions as a cellular metabolic sensor and maintains the homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> pools.</p><p>NAD<sup>+</sup> is highly compartmentalized, with each subcellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pool differentially regulated and preferentially involved in distinct NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signaling or metabolic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Compartment-localized NMNAT isoforms contribute to the maintenance of subcellular NAD<sup>+</sup> pools. In mammals, NMNAT1 is nuclear and NMNAT2 is cytoplasm-localized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2005</xref>). Our analysis of the public glioma cancer data set GEPIA identified a strong negative correlation between NMNAT1 expression and disease-free survival in patients with brain LGG as well as the progressive GBM. These findings have several implications. First, the critical requirement for nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming events in tumor growth demands a constant supply of nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> pool by nuclear-localized NMNAT. Indeed, as our results show, NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARylation and deacetylation of proteins including p53 underlies the mechanism of tumorigenesis. Second, the difference in the tumor-promoting effects of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic NMNAT isoforms may inform cellular metabolic needs and genotoxic load. Interestingly, the CBio portal databases show NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 genes appear to be amplified in distinct cancer types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s2">2</xref>). Future work is required to identify the specific roles of NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 in different cancer types.</p><p>During the submission of this manuscript, two groups reported the distinct roles of NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 in acute myeloid leukemia and ovarian cancer respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shi et al., 2021</xref> showed that NMNAT1-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism regulates p53 acetylation and enables acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to evade apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shi et al., 2021</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2021</xref> showed that NMNAT2-mediated cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis regulates ribosome ADP-ribosylation to maintain protein homeostasis in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2021</xref>). It is important to note that in mammalian cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic NMNATs can regulate each other’s activity, likely through feedback from dynamic pool of substrates NMN and ATP, as overexpressing cytoplasmic NMNAT may exhaust the supply of NMN therefore repress nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, altering the nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> pool may regulate gene transcription and influence cell differentiation or proliferation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>). Our observation of the specific upregulation of endogenous nuclear NMNAT upon oncogenic RAS-expression further supports the hypothesis that nuclear and cytoplasmic NMNAT react differently in stress conditions and likely be important in different stages of tumor growth.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>NAD<sup>+</sup>-mediated posttranslational modifications of P53: a balancing act</title><p>PARylation, phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination are PTMs that have been shown to regulate the stability and activity of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bode and Dong, 2004</xref>). Among the most common PTMs of p53, PARylation and acetylation are both NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming processes mediated by NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes, PARPs, and SIRTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vaziri et al., 2001</xref>). When PARP1 activity is induced in the DNA damage response process, extensive protein PARylation occurs and many proteins including p53 and DNA repair machinery components are PARylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amé et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischbach et al., 2018</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that PARylation of p53 may inhibit p53-mediated function, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kanai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simbulan-Rosenthal et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Simbulan-Rosenthal et al., 2001</xref>). With abundant NAD<sup>+</sup> supply, PARylation is an efficient way to repair DNA damage and ensure cell survival; whereas under conditions of insufficient NAD<sup>+</sup> supply, apoptosis is induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herceg and Wang, 2001</xref>). In response to DNA damage, the activity of p53 is also modulated by acetylation. Acetyl-p53 is resistant to degradation by ubiquitination and has higher stability, and therefore can exert longer effects of growth arrest, senescence, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2002</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARylation and acetylation have the opposite effects on p53 activity, where PARylation inhibits p53 activity and acetylation prolongs p53 activity. NAD<sup>+</sup> thus plays a critical role in balancing the pro-apoptotic activity of p53. NMNAT1 regulates functions of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes such as SIRT1 and PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, our results identified a trimeric complex of NMNAT-PARP1-p53 and increased PARP1 and SIRT1, which supports the model that NMNAT recruits NAD<sup>+</sup>-utilizing enzymes, including PARP1 and SIRT1, together with protein substrates, and locally supply NAD<sup>+</sup> for NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein modification. Such an NMNAT-PTM modifying enzyme-protein substrate trimeric protein complex will not only sustain the local supply of NAD<sup>+</sup> but also facilitate and expedite the modification process.</p><p>It is important to note that p53 is not the only target for PARylation and deacetylation regulation. The role of NMNAT in PARylation of other target proteins has also been indicated. For example, it has been shown that decreased NMNAT1 expression caused nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> deficiency and subsequently reduced PARylation of multifunctional nuclear protein CCCTC-binding factor, leading to epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henderson et al., 2017</xref>). As noted above, the most recent study showed increased NMNAT2 mediated cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis activity supports mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation (MARylation) through PARP-16 in ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Challa et al., 2021</xref>). These reports together with our findings support a specific role of NAD<sup>+</sup> in modulating tumorigenesis through regulating PTMs, including PARylation and deacetylation. Our findings in both in vivo and in vitro models highlight NMNAT’s roles in promoting glioma development. Specifically, the direct interaction we identified among p53, NMNAT, and PARP1 has important implications regarding the utility of NMNAT as a potential target for glioma therapy. Because the protein-protein interaction interface of NMNAT-PARP1-p53 could provide allosteric targeting of NMNAT, in addition to its enzyme pocket, this may open new possibilities for alternative inhibitors of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent pathway with less toxicity.</p><p>It should be noted that although T98G cells carry a gain-of-function p53 mutation (M237I) in the DNA binding domain, this mutation does not affect the sites of PARylation and acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamamoto and Iwakuma, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, prior studies support the ability of cells harboring this p53 mutant to undergo apoptosis, which can be abrogated by p53 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enns et al., 2004</xref>). Our findings that NMNAT similarly affects p53 modification in either wild-type (U87MG) or mutant p53 (T98G) cells suggest NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARylation or deacetylation of p53 is independent of the p53 [M237I] mutation. Indeed recent studies have shown that mutant p53 proteins retain the ability to induce apoptosis despite losing tumor-suppressive transactivation functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Timofeev et al., 2019</xref>). Further studies will be required to fully understand the effects of NMNAT on p53 transcription factor function.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies have identified NMNAT as an NAD<sup>+</sup> synthase that plays an essential role in regulating the function and activation of p53 during DNA damage-induced apoptosis in glioma cells. These results support the development of specific NMNAT inhibitors as potentially efficacious therapeutic agents in cancers with upregulated NMNAT levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and culture</title><p>Flies were maintained at 25°C room temperature with standard medium.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yun Fan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work in its current form will not be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, the reviewers did find the work interesting and raised a number of substantial issues that I have summarised below. If you are able to address the issues in full, we would be happy to consider a much revised version of your paper as a new submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by the Zhai lab shows that NMNAT is necessary and sufficient for glioma growth in an in vivo fly model and in an in vitro cell culture model. The most exciting aspect of this work is the mechanistic insight showing that NMNAT is responsible for the parylation and acetylation of the tumor suppressor p53. The paper concludes that this action of NMNAT inhibits p53/caspase-mediated apoptosis and thus promotes glioma growth. This is new and of interest, but at the moment also too preliminary. The reviewers recommend a number of essential experiments. The full reviews are also included below and we welcome any additional (non-essential) work you believe you can add as well as textual and figure changes in response to their questions:</p><p>Essential issues:</p><p>1) Increase the quality of the parylation and acetylation blots by 'cleaning up' the bots, quantifying them and showing specificity:</p><p>The most mechanistic and exciting finding in this manuscript is the demonstration that overexpression of NMNAT led to increased parylation and decreased acetylation of p53. Both of these manipulations would inhibit p53-induced apoptosis. This is the most important result in the paper, but unfortunately the data are not convincing. There is no quantification of this effect. Worse yet, a single lane of each is shown, and is not even obvious by eye. First, the band that is claimed to be PAR-p53 is faint and is near the huge IgG band (get some beads with antibody covalently attached so you don't have this band). Second, this blot is full of bands-what is the proof that this band is PAR-p53? Finally, once the band is validated, then it must be repeated multiple times and quantified. The acetyl-p53 blot is also unconvincing. There are many bands, with no validation that the band labeled as acetyl-p53 is actually acetyl-p53. Again, a single blot is shown, and nothing is quantified. Indeed, even by eye it is not clear that NMNAT1 has any effect.</p><p>2) The biochemistry should also be done under conditions of NMNAT loss of function (in Figure 7):</p><p>There is a second issue with figure 7. Unlike the other studies in the manuscript, these experiments are only done with overexpression. The authors should test knockdown of the NMNATs in these paradigms.

Of course, all of these experiments will require quantification.</p><p>3) To provide more direct evidence for the role of p53 and caspases in glioma development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; both issues can be tested using <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics:</p><p>a) Does apoptosis play a critical role to restrict RasV12-induced glioma development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>? Notably, the cleaved Caspase-3 antibody indicates the activity of Dronc, the initiator caspase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which has non-apoptotic functions. Also, a recent paper actually suggests that expression of RasV12 blocks activation of apoptosis in epithelial tissues (Perez et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017, 6: e26747). It is therefore important to show whether blocking apoptosis or caspase activity enhances glioma progression.</p><p>b) Test if is p53 required for activation of caspases in RasV12-induced glioma and in response to loss-of-NMNAT (Figure 4B)?</p><p>4) Properly discuss the limitations of the fly model (as indicated by the third reviewer), both the use of a Ras model in flies that is a model of only 2% of glioma and second to use the term glial neoplasia instead of glioma (or use glioma model).</p><p>5) Look in to TCGA or other databases (Human Protein Atlas, Ivy Foundation Atlas, Gliovis, etc) to check if NMNAT is upregulated in human tumors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study investigates the role of the NAD biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT in glioma growth. While prior studies have highlighted the important role of the NAD biosynthetic pathway in glioma, this is the first to investigate NMNAT. Using both an in vivo fly model and in vitro cell culture model, the authors find that knockdown of NMNAT inhibits and overexpression of NMNAT promotes glioma growth. Since a role for NAD synthesis is expected, this is not a surprising finding. Indeed, I raise a number of issues below about the specificity of the findings. However, the authors go on to do a potentially interesting mechanistic analysis, claiming that NMNAT overexpression regulates the parylation and acetylation of p53. If these findings are validated (see #4 and #5 below), I think this will be an important and exciting contribution to the field.</p><p>1) In figure 2A the authors claim that the &quot;increase in NMNAT&quot; is required for glioma growth, but their experiment is to knockdown NMNAT. They don't make clear if this is back to wild type levels, or well below wild type levels. If well below, then they cannot conclude that it is the &quot;increase&quot; of NMNAT that matters-instead it just might be that you need NMNAT for a glioma to grow. Testing if a NMNAT heterozygote suppresses could test their hypotheses better, or carefully quantifying the effect of knockdown compared to wild types could also help.</p><p>2) More broadly, it is not surprising that you need NMNAT for glioma growth as you likely need many essential metabolic enzymes for fast growing cells to grow. It would be helpful to test the specificity of these findings. This should be done in two ways. First, is NMNAT necessary for healthy cells to grow. This could be checked by using the same RNAi in clones in imaginal discs-is growth inhibited? The second question to address is whether there is anything selective about NMNAT loss. Do other genes in the NAD biosynthetic pathway also block glioma growth?</p><p>3) Figure 3 addresses the same issue of NMNAT dependence in a human glioma cell line model. Specificity issues again apply. Why does knockdown of either of two NMNAT genes give the same strong phenotype? The authors make a big point about compartmentalization of NAD biosynthesis, and yet here they get the same phenotype from the nuclear and cytoplasmic variants of NMNAT. What are the effects of each of these manipulations on the level of NAD? Does an equivalent drop in NAD induced by inhibiting the pathway via other means (using Nampt inhibitors) give the same phenotype?</p><p>4) The most mechanistic and exciting finding in this manuscript is the demonstration that overexpression of NMNAT led to increased parylation and decreased acetylation of p53. Both of these manipulations would inhibit p53-induced apoptosis. This is the most important result in the paper, but unfortunately the data are not convincing. There is no quantification of this effect. Worse yet, a single lane of each is shown, and is not even obvious by eye. First, the band that is claimed to be PAR-p53 is faint and is near the huge IgG band (get some beads with antibody covalently attached so you don't have this band). Second, this blot is full of bands-what is the proof that this band is PAR-p53? Finally, once the band is validated, then it must be repeated multiple times and quantified. The acetyl-p53 blot is also unconvincing. There are many bands, with no validation that the band labeled as acetyl-p53 is actually acetyl-p53. Again, a single blot is shown, and nothing is quantified. Indeed, even by eye it is not clear that NMNAT1 has any effect.</p><p>5) There is a second issue with figure 7. Unlike the other studies in the manuscript, these experiments are only done with overexpression. The authors should test knockdown of the NMNATs in these paradigms. Since they have demonstrated that knockdown and overexpression of NMNATs have opposite effects on glioma cell growth, then if this is the mechanism, they should also have opposite effects on p53 posttranslational modifications. Of course, all of these experiments will require quantification.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript addressed an important knowledge gap in the field – roles of the Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) in promoting glioma progression, by using both <italic>Drosophila</italic> in vivo models and cultured human glioma cells.</p><p>The authors first determined that NMNAT is upregulated in glioma induced by activated Ras (RasV12) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Further loss- and gain-of-function analyses showed that NMNAT, particularly its nuclear isoform, inhibits nuclear expression of Caspases, the proteases activating apoptosis, and p53, the key mediator of DNA damage responses, therefore promotes glioma development. From these, the authors conclude that NMNAT accelerates glioma progression by inhibiting p53/caspase-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, although not exactly same in my view, similar principles underlying functions of NMNAT apply to human glioma cells. The authors convincingly showed that, in these cells, NMNAT suppresses the nuclear enrichment of Caspase-3 and activation of apoptosis. Interestingly, NMNAT regulates activity of p53 via posttranslational modifications including PARylation and acetylation, but not the total level of p53. Overall, these findings are novel and are of interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>However, direct evidence showing roles of p53 and caspases in glioma development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is missing in the manuscript. To my knowledge, these have not been characterized in the field hence are critical to support the conclusions made.</p><p>Along this line, my concerns are as follows:</p><p>1) Does apoptosis play a critical role to restrict RasV12-induced glioma development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>? Notably, the cleaved Caspase-3 antibody indicates the activity of Dronc, the initiator caspase in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which has non-apoptotic functions. Also, a recent paper actually suggests that expression of RasV12 blocks activation of apoptosis in epithelial tissues (Perez et al., <italic>eLife</italic> 2017, 6: e26747). It is therefore important to show whether blocking apoptosis or caspase activity enhances glioma progression.</p><p>2) Is p53 required for activation of caspases in RasV12-induced glioma and in response to loss-of-NMNAT (Figure 4B)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>NMNAT promotes glioma growth through enhancing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of p53 to inhibit apoptosis – Paper Review Using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> glioma model and follow-up studies in human glioma cell lines, Liu et al. uncovered the requirement of NMNAT in glioma progression.</p><p>One concern is the genetics of the model system chosen. This manuscript focuses on Ras using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. However, mutations in Ras proteins, such as HRAS, are limited in human glioma tumors. In omic studies such as TCGA, there are very few genomic alterations in human glioma (2% or less in HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS). This is likely because driver alterations affecting the RAS pathway lie upstream of RAS itself, and this is different than other solid tumors, as the authors cite in the manuscript. This significantly limits the scope and impact of the findings and should be addressed in some way.</p><p>Another concern is the authors use of glioma nomenclature. <italic>Drosophila</italic> models do not get true &quot;gliomas&quot; as defined by neuropathological criteria for humans and other animals, so the language in the paper describing their glioma model should change to &quot;neoplastic glia,&quot; &quot;glial neoplasia&quot; or add the qualifier &quot;model&quot; in their sentences to better distinguish between human and fly biology for this disease. Flies can only model certain aspects of gliomas, such as the genetic basis of neoplastic glial transformation.</p><p>Is NMNAT upregulated in tumor specimens from human glioma patients? The authors could query TCGA or other databases (Human Protein Atlas, Ivy Foundation Atlas, Gliovis, etc) to compare the expression levels of NMNAT mRNA and protein between gliomas of different grade and between gliomas with and without mutations in Ras pathway components. These databases are publicly available and this analysis could be done without any benchwork. Or, if they are able to do benchwork, they could compare protein levels in normal human neural stem cells or astrocytes vs glioma cell lines.</p><p>This study may benefit from additional studies on DNA damage such as a comet assay or even looking at whether there are cell cycle changes as a result of modified p53 function.</p><p>Figure 2E – Manuscript states that Nmnat-PC increased lethality, but the graph is for survival at different life stages. This is confusing, particularly because some of the samples exceed 100% with the way the error bars are presented. This graph should be reformatted to show % lethal broken down by lethal stage.</p><p>Figure 3 – Colony formation assays are not sufficient to demonstrate growth defects in the glioma cells. Additional independent methods that support these results should be shown. FACS profiling would be appropriate. Also, at least one other glioma cell line that is Ras-dependent should be tested and results from those cells should be shown as well. Why were T98G cells chosen? What is the rationale for using those cells? Were there any other cells tested that yielded negative results? If so, results from those cells may be informative if they are P53 null (many glioma cell lines are P53 null).</p><p>Figure 5B – this is an unusual way to quantify cell death in glioma cells. A more representative way would be to quantify the percentage of caspase-positive cells rather than the intensity of caspase staining per cell, which is a much more transient and variable thing. Perhaps the authors already have this data and can change the parameters of their data analysis?</p><p>Figure 7A – I would argue only NMNAT2 overexpression is the only condition that increases p53 PARylation. Band intensity could be quantified to better support the author's conclusions.</p><p>Figure S1: There is no criteria set forth to define pre-tumor vs. glioma areas. Are there molecular markers for these regions? Are those markers conserved between human and flies? The presence of excess cells in some regions of the brain is not really sufficient to distinguish between pre-neoplastic and neoplastic cells in the fly brain.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review.

We are sorry to say that we have decided that this submission will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The revised paper has been seen by a reviewer who can judge the <italic>Drosophila</italic> work in your manuscript and by a reviewer who can judge the p53 biology. In the discussion among the reviewers there were serious concerns regarding tools and conclusions that pertain to the p53 biology that you present to the point that the reviewers recommended to not move forward with the manuscript. More specifically, the last section of reviewer 2's main comments that the p53 in glioma cell lines that you used differ in their p53 status (based on published literature, we couldn't find that you checked this yourself), but show a similar phenotype, and that this is not compatible with the model you suggest was a the reason for rejection. I realise this is a revised version and I am very sorry to have to bring this news to you.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have worked very hard to address all of my concerns and those of the other reviewers. The manuscript is much improved and much more convincing.</p><p>I am satisfied with the changes made in this revised version.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Liu et al. investigate the role of the NAD+ synthases NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 in glioma survival to test whether these enzymes are promising targets for therapeutic interventions. The authors employ a glial neoplasia developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> model and the two human glioma cell line models T98G and U87MG. Their data show that depletion of NMNAT1 and NMNAT2 inhibits and overexpression of the enzymes promotes glioma growth. Moreover, the authors show that depletion of NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> increased apoptosis while overexpression of the enzymes inhibited apoptosis upon cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, the authors propose that NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> physically interact with p53 and PARP1 to drive PARylation and deacetylation of p53, ultimately leading to reduced p53 activity.</p><p>I find substantial parts of the underlying data not convincing (see below). I felt that the authors overinterpreted poor or insufficiently controlled data, jumped to conclusions from ambiguous results, and exaggerated several conclusions.</p><p>Together, I cannot recommend the manuscript for publication.</p><p>I am not fully convinced by the growth data presented by the authors. Publicly available data (www.DepMap.org) do not indicate that glioma cell lines are particularly sensitive to NMNAT1 or NMNAT2 depletion. Controls for si-mediated protein reduction in the cell lines are missing throughout and a second siControl could be helpful.</p><p>The PARylation data is not convincing. A methods part is missing that explains how PARylation was analyzed. Total PAR or PAR overlay assay? The latter would be crucial to claim p53 PARylation, the former is critical for statements on PARylation in general. The authors claim that NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> form a complex with p53 and PARP1 to facilitate PARylation, but it is unclear whether they refer to only p53 PARylation or also PARylation in general.</p><p>The authors draw conclusions on p53 activity from signals that are known to be regulated by various pathways (e.g. apoptosis). Instead, it would be crucial to test for the expression of p53 targets (e.g. MDM2, BBC3, GADD45A) to investigate p53 activity. Yet, given that the p53 status differs between T98G (mutant p53) and U87MG (wild-type p53) cells (van Meir et al., 1994 Cancer Res), the authors' growth data, which are similar for T98G and U87MG, demonstrate that the potential effect elicited by NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> is independent of. Moreover, all p53 interaction data shown using T98G data reflect mutant p53, which is known to have potentially different binding partners than wild-type p53. In general, the fact that T98G harbor mutant p53 turns most parts of the manuscript upside down that deal with mechanistics.</p><p>Figure 1: why is Nmnat not color-coded?</p><p>Figure 3G: The AnnexinV:PI gating is strange.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Jonathan Cooper (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>There is consensus that the manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>We would like you to submit a final paper that includes:</p><p>1) Data indicating that NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> interacts with p53 also in the U87MG p53 wild-type line;</p><p>2) Data that tests if p53 depletion rescues the apoptosis-inducing effect of siNMNAT in both cell lines they use (T98G and U87MG);</p><p>3) Toning down claims on PARylation at different locations in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors provided a revised version addressing most concerns that I raised. However, some key points in the authors' study still require supportive data.</p><p>– The NMNAT-PARP1-p53 interaction:</p><p>Previously, I raised the concern that protein interaction with mutant p53 not always translates into an interaction with wild-type p53. The present M237I mutant reportedly possesses neomorphic functions. Given that the NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub>-p53 interaction is an integral part of the model proposed by the authors, I would like to reiterate that I find it crucial to corroborate this interaction also in the p53 wild-type line U87MG.</p><p>– The NMNAT-p53-apoptosis mechanism:</p><p>Following my concern that much of the authors' data on p53 was generated using a mutant p53 cell line (T98G), the authors explain that they intentionally included both wild-type and mutant p53 cell systems and clarify their strategy to the reader in the revised version, such as by adding a respective sentence to the Discussion section &quot;Our findings that NMNAT similarly affects p53 modification in either wild-type (U87MG) or mutant p53 (T98G) cells suggest NAD+-dependent PARylation or deacetylation of p53 is independent of the p53 [M237I] mutation. Indeed recent studies have shown that mutant p53 proteins retain the ability to induce apoptosis despite losing tumor-suppressive transactivation functionality (Timofeev et al., 2019)&quot;.</p><p>Notably, Timofeev et al., 2019 refers to the p53 mutant R181E (R178E in mice). p53 mutants are known to differ. The M237I mutant present in the authors' T98G cell line, for example, did not display residual apoptosis-driving function when it was tested in a different study (Boettcher et al., 2019 Science). Given that the authors propose reduced p53-dependent apoptosis to be a key mechanism by which NMNAT promotes glioma growth, it is crucial to show that there actually is p53-dependent apoptosis occurring in the authors' experimental setup, i.e. by adding data on sip53 in Figure 3G showing whether p53 depletion can indeed rescue the apoptosis-inducing effect of siNMNAT in both T98G and U87MG cells. Given the importance to the authors' mechanistic model and the different experimental setup, it is insufficient to only refer to the findings by Enns et al., 2004.</p><p>– The NMNAT-p53-PARylation mechanism:</p><p>The authors convincingly demonstrate that NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> affect total PAR levels in the cell (Figure 8A and B, Figure 8-supplement 1). Key points in the authors' model include (1) that PARylation of p53 is induced by NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> (abstract, headlines, Figure 10E) and (2) that complex formation with p53 is important for NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> to facilitate PARylation (abstract). Supportive data for these points, however, is missing.</p><p>1) I would like to reiterate that it is crucial to provide data on NMNAT-dependent p53 PARylation. I.e. by blotting for PAR in p53 IPs (Figure 8C or 9A), in both T98G and U87MG.</p><p>2) To support the authors' point that &quot;NMNAT forms a complex with p53 and PTM enzyme PARP1 to facilitate PARylation&quot; (abstract), it is crucial to show whether p53 indeed is required for NMNAT-dependent PARylation, i.e. whether p53 depletion affects NMNAT-dependent PARylation in both T98G and U87MG (Figures 8A and 8-supplement 1).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70046.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The acetyl-p53 blot is also unconvincing. There are many bands, with no validation that the band labeled as acetyl-p53 is actually acetyl-p53.

(Fig. 10_figure supplement 1-2)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study investigates the role of the NAD biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT in glioma growth. While prior studies have highlighted the important role of the NAD biosynthetic pathway in glioma, this is the first to investigate NMNAT. Using both an in vivo fly model and in vitro cell culture model, the authors find that knockdown of NMNAT inhibits and overexpression of NMNAT promotes glioma growth. Since a role for NAD synthesis is expected, this is not a surprising finding. Indeed, I raise a number of issues below about the specificity of the findings. However, the authors go on to do a potentially interesting mechanistic analysis, claiming that NMNAT overexpression regulates the parylation and acetylation of p53. If these findings are validated (see #4 and #5 below), I think this will be an important and exciting contribution to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for recognizing the significance of our findings. In this revised version, we have comprehensively characterized the cellular and biochemical mechanisms underlying the effects of NMNAT on promoting glioma growth in both fly model and human glioma cell model. Specifically, we identified the role of NMNAT in regulating the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent post-translational modifications of p53: PARylation and deacetylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) In figure 2A the authors claim that the &quot;increase in NMNAT&quot; is required for glioma growth, but their experiment is to knockdown NMNAT. They don't make clear if this is back to wild type levels, or well below wild type levels. If well below, then they cannot conclude that it is the &quot;increase&quot; of NMNAT that matters-instead it just might be that you need NMNAT for a glioma to grow. Testing if a NMNAT heterozygote suppresses could test their hypotheses better, or carefully quantifying the effect of knockdown compared to wild types could also help.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that our data support the conclusion that “NMNAT is required for glioma growth”. This is supported by both loss of function (knockdown) and gain of function (overexpression) experiments.</p><p>In the knockdown experiment, we carefully analyzed the knockdown level following the reviewer’s suggestion and found that the level of NMNAT in flies with <italic>Ras<sup>v12</sup></italic> overexpression and NMNAT RNAi is lower than that of wild-type flies (Figure 2_figure supplement 3).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we clarified the conclusion to avoid confusion. The new version reads; on page 7, “These results suggest that nuclear enzymatically active NMNAT promoted glial neoplasia growth.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) More broadly, it is not surprising that you need NMNAT for glioma growth as you likely need many essential metabolic enzymes for fast growing cells to grow. It would be helpful to test the specificity of these findings. This should be done in two ways. First, is NMNAT necessary for healthy cells to grow. This could be checked by using the same RNAi in clones in imaginal discs-is growth inhibited? The second question to address is whether there is anything selective about NMNAT loss. Do other genes in the NAD biosynthetic pathway also block glioma growth?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. Indeed, it is expected that metabolic enzymes are essential for cell growth, especially fast-growing cancer cells. However, identifying the molecular mechanism of the requirement is critical for targeted anti-cancer therapy. Our previous work has shown that NMNAT as NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme is essential for organism survival, as loss of NMNAT causes organismal lethality but not cell death (Zhai et al., 2006). We carried out the RNAi experiment as suggested by the reviewer and found that RNAi-mediated knockdown of NMNAT in normal glial cells (without Ras<sup>v12</sup> expression) did not result in growth inhibition (Figure 2_figure supplement 1)<bold>,</bold> suggesting NMNAT is not essential for healthy cell survival.</p><p>Regarding the second question on other genes in the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic pathway for glioma growth, significant research effort has been invested in targeting the NAD<sup>+</sup> synthetic pathway, especially the rate-limiting enzyme NAMPT. Several studies have shown that NAMPT is critical for glioma progression (Guo et al., 2019; Lucena-Cacace, Otero-Albiol, Jimenez-Garcia, Peinado-Serrano, and Carnero, 2017; Lucena-Cacace, Umeda, Navas, and Carnero, 2019). However, the clinical outcomes of NAMPT inhibitors as chemotherapy have been largely disappointing, which begs the mechanist investigation of the NAD<sup>+</sup> pathway in glioma and the consideration of alternative targets (Sampath, Zabka, Misner, O'Brien, and Dragovich, 2015). We included this information in the introduction, as this very point is the primary motivation of our work.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we extended the description of this point in the introduction, on page 4, in the paragraph starts with “Disappointingly, several clinical trials of NAMPT inhibitors have failed due to low efficacy and high toxicities, which demands the urgent consideration of an alternative target in the NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolic pathway.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3 addresses the same issue of NMNAT dependence in a human glioma cell line model. Specificity issues again apply. Why does knockdown of either of two NMNAT genes give the same strong phenotype? The authors make a big point about compartmentalization of NAD biosynthesis, and yet here they get the same phenotype from the nuclear and cytoplasmic variants of NMNAT. What are the effects of each of these manipulations on the level of NAD? Does an equivalent drop in NAD induced by inhibiting the pathway via other means (using Nampt inhibitors) give the same phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer touched on an important point. The concept of local/compartmentalized NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis has been proposed based on two main observations, first, the relatively short half-life and diffusion radius of NAD<sup>+</sup>, and second, the compartment-specific localization of several NAD<sup>+</sup> synthetic enzymes including NMNAT. Precise measurement of the compartmental concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup> has been challenging (Rechsteiner, Hillyard, and Olivera, 1976; van Roermund, Elgersma, Singh, Wanders, and Tabak, 1995). It is estimated that mitochondria have the highest level of NAD<sup>+</sup>, around 250 uM, while the nucleus and cytosol share a similar concentration of NAD<sup>+</sup>, around 100 uM, given the large size of nuclear pores that is permissible for the exchange of NAD<sup>+</sup> and metabolic substrates (Alano et al., 2007; Camacho-Pereira et al., 2016). Furthermore, it has been shown that in mammalian cells, nuclear and cytoplasmic NMNATs can regulate each other’s activity, likely through feedback from a dynamic pool of substrates NMN and ATP, as overexpressing cytoplasmic NMNAT may exhaust the supply of NMN, therefore, repress nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis (Ryu et al., 2018). These studies highlight the complexity of the regulation of cellular NAD<sup>+</sup> levels, which includes the contribution from localized synthetic and catabolic enzymes, as well as the dynamic influences from neighboring cellular compartments.</p><p>To probe at this complexity, we included both nuclear and cytoplasmic NMNATs in all of our analyses in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and glioma cell lines experimental models. We found that in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model in vivo, nuclear NMNAT (PC) showed a visibly stronger effect in promoting cell growth than cytoplasmic NMNAT (PD), while knocking down either of two NMNAT genes in glioma cell lines resulted in similar effects of inhibiting cell growth. It is possible that the different effects between nuclear and cytoplasmic NMNATs were below the detection limit of our analysis. Taken together, our results suggest that localized NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis is important to glioma tumorigenesis, and there is a dynamic and complex interaction between the cytoplasmic and nuclear pools of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolites.</p><p>As mentioned in the comment addressing the previous concern (#2), NAMPT inhibitors have been explored as chemotherapy agents but did not result in clinical success (Sampath et al., 2015). While NAMPT is a uni-directional enzyme, synthesizing NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide), NMNAT is downstream of NAMPT and directly regulates the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> by catalyzing the reversible reaction of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis. The direction of the reaction, forward (NAD<sup>+</sup> production) or reverse (NAD<sup>+</sup> breakdown), is dependent upon the availability of subtracts. Therefore, NMNAT functions as a cellular metabolic sensor and maintains the homeostasis of NAD<sup>+</sup> pools. NAMPT inhibition would only result in a reduction in NMN and subsequently NAD<sup>+</sup>, NMNAT inhibition could have much more complex consequences of metabolic homeostasis. For these reasons, we did not include NAMPT inhibitors in our study but rather focused on NMNAT and its downstream functional consequences.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we extended the discussion in addressing this series of questions in the Discussion section, on page 14, in the paragraph starts with “While NAMPT is a uni-directional enzyme, synthesizing NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide), NMNAT is downstream of NAMPT and directly regulates the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> by catalyzing the reversible reaction of NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The most mechanistic and exciting finding in this manuscript is the demonstration that overexpression of NMNAT led to increased parylation and decreased acetylation of p53. Both of these manipulations would inhibit p53-induced apoptosis. This is the most important result in the paper, but unfortunately the data are not convincing. There is no quantification of this effect. Worse yet, a single lane of each is shown, and is not even obvious by eye. First, the band that is claimed to be PAR-p53 is faint and is near the huge IgG band (get some beads with antibody covalently attached so you don't have this band). Second, this blot is full of bands-what is the proof that this band is PAR-p53? Finally, once the band is validated, then it must be repeated multiple times and quantified. The acetyl-p53 blot is also unconvincing. There are many bands, with no validation that the band labeled as acetyl-p53 is actually acetyl-p53. Again, a single blot is shown, and nothing is quantified. Indeed, even by eye it is not clear that NMNAT1 has any effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. Indeed, the post-translational modification of p53 is one of the most exciting findings, and also the most technically challenging. Due to their transient nature, the PTMs could be difficult to detect consistently. We took the reviewer’s criticism to heart and have expanded the biochemical characterization of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PTMs, PARylation, and deacetylation. We employed multiple complementary approaches for each PTM and the new results were included in Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 9_figure supplement 1.</p><p>For PARylation, since there is no antibody available to specifically detect PAR-p53, we used two approaches to address this question. First, we assessed total PARylation level in cells with or without NMNAT overexpression and found that total PARylation is increased with NMNAT overexpression (Figure 8 A, B), suggesting that NMNAT promotes protein PARylation in general. Second, to probe the probability of p53 PARylation, we immunoprecipitated p53 and probed for the PARylation enzyme PARP1 (Figure 8C). We found that the p53, PARP1, and NMNAT forms a trimeric complex that was stable in immunoprecipitation. Importantly we found that endogenous PARP1 expression was upregulated in NMNAT overexpressing cells suggesting a co-regulation of NMNAT and PARP1 to facilitate the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARylation. These biochemical results were corroborated by the immunofluorescent imaging analysis where cells overexpressing NMNAT showed a higher level of PARP1 colocalizing with p53 (Figure 8 D-I). Together, these results support our hypothesis that p53 PARylation is increased in NMNAT overexpressing cells.</p><p>For NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylation, we took advantage of an available acetyl-p53 specific antibody that detects acetylated p53 at residue K382. The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylation of p53 at K382 is mediated by SIRT1 (Cheng et al., 2003; Vaziri et al., 2001). We observed a significant reduction of acetylated-p53 levels in NMNAT overexpressing cells, and interestingly, a concomitant increase of SIRT1. We have added a new figure (Figure 9) to show the western analysis and quantifications. Our results suggest a co-regulation of NMNAT and SIRT1 to facilitate the NAD<sup>+</sup>dependent deacetylation of p53. To rule out a potential cell-line specific effect, we examined the acetylation of p53 in another human glioma cell line U87MG and observed a similar reduction in acetylp53 in NMNAT expressing cells (Figure 9_figure supplement <bold>1</bold>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is a second issue with figure 7. Unlike the other studies in the manuscript, these experiments are only done with overexpression. The authors should test knockdown of the NMNATs in these paradigms. Since they have demonstrated that knockdown and overexpression of NMNATs have opposite effects on glioma cell growth, then if this is the mechanism, they should also have opposite effects on p53 posttranslational modifications. Of course, all of these experiments will require quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point raised by the reviewer, we carried out NMNAT knockdown experiments and examine the cellular consequences of NMNAT reduction and found reduction of PARylation in siRNA knockdown cells. The results and quantification were included in a new figure (Figure 8_figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript addressed an important knowledge gap in the field – roles of the Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) in promoting glioma progression, by using both <italic>Drosophila</italic> in vivo models and cultured human glioma cells.</p><p>The authors first determined that NMNAT is upregulated in glioma induced by activated Ras (RasV12) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Further loss- and gain-of-function analyses showed that NMNAT, particularly its nuclear isoform, inhibits nuclear expression of Caspases, the proteases activating apoptosis, and p53, the key mediator of DNA damage responses, therefore promotes glioma development. From these, the authors conclude that NMNAT accelerates glioma progression by inhibiting p53/caspase-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, although not exactly same in my view, similar principles underlying functions of NMNAT apply to human glioma cells. The authors convincingly showed that, in these cells, NMNAT suppresses the nuclear enrichment of Caspase-3 and activation of apoptosis. Interestingly, NMNAT regulates activity of p53 via posttranslational modifications including PARylation and acetylation, but not the total level of p53. Overall, these findings are novel and are of interest to the broad readership of eLife.</p><p>However, direct evidence showing roles of p53 and caspases in glioma development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is missing in the manuscript.

This manuscript focuses on Ras using a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. However, mutations in Ras proteins, such as HRAS, are limited in human glioma tumors. In omic studies such as TCGA, there are very few genomic alterations in human glioma (2% or less in HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS). This is likely because driver alterations affecting the RAS pathway lie upstream of RAS itself, and this is different than other solid tumors, as the authors cite in the manuscript. This significantly limits the scope and impact of the findings and should be addressed in some way.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the concern on the RAS driver. We agree that indeed RAS alterations in human glioma occur in much lower frequency than some high alteration genes such as IDH and EGFR. Our rationale for using mutant RAS overexpressing model in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was to probe the shared (rather than Ras-specific) fundamental mechanisms in glial neoplasia. To support our finding in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have performed experiments in multiple human glioma cell lines and observed similar phenotypes that were consistent with those observed in vivo in fly models. It would be important to establish <italic>Drosophila</italic> models using other high-frequency glioma drivers, and we plan to include them in the future.</p><p>In the revision, we have included this point in the discussion, on page 13, in paragraph starts with “We adapted a glial neoplasia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using the <italic>UAS-Ras85D<sup>v12</sup></italic> and repo-GAL4 driver system that induces overgrowth of glial cells to mimic glial neoplasia formation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern is the authors use of glioma nomenclature. <italic>Drosophila</italic> models do not get true &quot;gliomas&quot; as defined by neuropathological criteria for humans and other animals, so the language in the paper describing their glioma model should change to &quot;neoplastic glia,&quot; &quot;glial neoplasia&quot; or add the qualifier &quot;model&quot; in their sentences to better distinguish between human and fly biology for this disease. Flies can only model certain aspects of gliomas, such as the genetic basis of neoplastic glial transformation</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and took the criticism to heart.

These databases are publicly available and this analysis could be done without any benchwork. Or, if they are able to do benchwork, they could compare protein levels in normal human neural stem cells or astrocytes vs glioma cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful question.

A strong negative correlation between NMNAT1 expression and survival can be seen in patients with brain lower grade glioma correlation, where patients of higher NMNAT1 expression showed lower survival rate, either the top 50% expression compared to bottom 50% (Figure 11A) or the top 10% expression level compared to the bottom 10% expression (Figure 11B). In the aggressive form of glioma, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), from which the T98G and U87MG cell lines were derived, the NMNAT1 high expression level (top 10%) showed strong correlation with more aggressive disease and poorer outcome, while NMNAT2 expression level did not correlate with the survival of the aggressive GBM (Figure 11C, D). The brain glioma patient dataset clearly indicates the strong correlation between high NMNAT1 expression with lower survival and poorer clinical outcome. These clinical data are consistent with our findings that NMNAT1 depletion has stronger adverse effects on glioma cell growth vs. NMNAT2 depletion, and higher levels of NMNAT1 promote glioma progression.</p><p>Our study provided the mechanism underlying this clinical observation, and identified the effects of NMNAT specifically on promoting glioma growth, without being an oncogene since NMNAT expression alone did not induce glioma initiation. In human glioma cell models, using loss of function (knockdown) and gain of function (overexpression) experiments (MTT assay, growth curve, colony formation), we found NMNAT is required for human glioma cell proliferation without affecting cell cycle control (Figure 3_figure supplement 2).

Instead, it would be crucial to test for the expression of p53 targets (e.g. MDM2, BBC3, GADD45A) to investigate p53 activity. Yet, given that the p53 status differs between T98G (mutant p53) and U87MG (wild-type p53) cells (van Meir et al., 1994 Cancer Res), the authors' growth data, which are similar for T98G and U87MG, demonstrate that the potential effect elicited by NMNAT<sub>1/2</sub> is independent of. Moreover, all p53 interaction data shown using T98G data reflect mutant p53, which is known to have potentially different binding partners than wild-type p53. In general, the fact that T98G harbor mutant p53 turns most parts of the manuscript upside down that deal with mechanistics.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding p53 activity and the p53 status in T98G and U87MG cells. Our findings of similar effects of NMNAT on p53 modification in either wild-type (U87MG) or mutant p53 (T98G) cells, suggest NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARylation or deacetylation of p53 is independent of the p53 [M237I] mutation. This is a gain-of-function mutation in the DNA binding domain that retains the ability of p53 to be modified by acetylation and PARylation as the mutation does not affect the sites of these PTMs (Yamamoto and Iwakuma, 2018; Yi et al., 2013). Furthermore, there is ample literature characterizing apoptosis induction in the T98G line, including through p53-dependent mechanisms (eg. (Enns, Bogen, Wizniak, Murtha, and Weinfeld, 2004) shows the p53 inhibitor pifithrin can inhibit apoptosis in irradiated T98G cells). Indeed, recent studies have shown that mutant p53 can retain the ability to induce apoptosis despite losing tumor-suppressive transactivation functionality (Timofeev et al., 2019). The Timofeev et al. study is one of several lines of emerging data on the complexity of p53 mutants with regards to their retained ability to enact similar functions as wildtype p53, and it can no longer be generalized that mutant p53 will necessarily have different binding partners than wild-type p53, in the face of contrary evidence (as provided by us here with regards to NMNAT p53 interactions).</p><p>Because approximately 51% of glioma are mutated for p53, we intentionally designed a comparative analysis using two different glioma cell lines with different p53 status to dissect common mechanisms of the role of NMNAT in glioma cell growth through modulating global NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein modification. The common apoptosis-inhibitory effect of NMNAT expression we report on both cell lines does not exclude NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent modifications on proteins (other than p53) that play important tumor growth-regulatory roles, in addition to p53. The ribosomal proteins shown in the above-mentioned paper (Challa et al. 2021 Cell) are a potential example. Regardless, our use of lines with differing p53 mutational status here is a strength, showing the pervasive utility of targeting NMNAT, rather than a weakness of our study.</p><p>What our findings collectively show for the first time is a role for NMNAT in glioma progression through regulating the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent post-translational modifications of proteins PARylation and deacetylation, with p53 as one of the targets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1: why is Nmnat not color-coded?</p></disp-quote><p>We used gray scale for Nmnat channel in Figure 1 in order to highlight the upregulation of NMNAT protein in <italic>Ras<sup>v12</sup></italic> overexpressing glial cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3G: The AnnexinV:PI gating is strange.

The M237I mutant present in the authors' T98G cell line, for example, did not display residual apoptosis-driving function when it was tested in a different study (Boettcher et al., 2019 Science). Given that the authors propose reduced p53-dependent apoptosis to be a key mechanism by which NMNAT promotes glioma growth, it is crucial to show that there actually is p53-dependent apoptosis occurring in the authors' experimental setup, i.e. by adding data on sip53 in Figure 3G showing whether p53 depletion can indeed rescue the apoptosis-inducing effect of siNMNAT in both T98G and U87MG cells. Given the importance to the authors' mechanistic model and the different experimental setup, it is insufficient to only refer to the findings by Enns et al., 2004.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. To address this point, we have used two approaches to reduce/deplete p53: siRNA transfection or shRNA lentivirus transduction in both cell lines. After p53 depletion, we carried out siNMNAT knockdown and probed for cleaved caspase3 to examine the activation of apoptosis in both T98G and U87MG cells.

Due to their transient nature, the PARylation of p53 could be difficult to detect consistently. Since there is no antibody available to specifically detect PAR-p53, we used two approaches to address this question. First, we assessed total PARylation level in cells with or without NMNAT overexpression and found that total PARylation is increased with NMNAT overexpression (Figure 9 A, B), suggesting that NMNAT promotes protein PARylation in general. Second, to probe the probability of p53 PARylation, we immunoprecipitated p53 and probed for the PARylation enzyme PARP1 (Figure 9C). We found that the p53, PARP1, and NMNAT form a trimeric complex that was stable in immunoprecipitation both in T98G and U87MG. Importantly, we found that endogenous PARP1 expression was upregulated in NMNAT overexpressing cells suggesting a co-regulation of NMNAT and PARP1 to facilitate the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARylation. These biochemical results were corroborated by the immunofluorescent imaging analysis where cells overexpressing NMNAT showed a higher level of PARP1 colocalizing with p53 (Figure 9 D-I). Together, these results support our hypothesis that p53 PARylation is increased in NMNAT overexpressing cells, although we acknowledge that future studies with specific antibodies to directly detect the p53 PARylation is required for confirmation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To support the authors' point that &quot;NMNAT forms a complex with p53 and PTM enzyme PARP1 to facilitate PARylation&quot; (abstract), it is crucial to show whether p53 indeed is required for NMNAT-dependent PARylation, i.e. whether p53 depletion affects NMNAT-dependent PARylation in both T98G and U87MG (Figures 8A and 8-supplement 1).</p></disp-quote><p>Our findings suggest NMNAT interacts with PARP1 to facilitate NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent PARP1-mediated PARylation, and p53 is likely one of many target proteins of NMNAT-dependent PARylation.
