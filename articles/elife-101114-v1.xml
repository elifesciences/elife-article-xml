Unfortunately, our understanding of necrosis and how it impacts surrounding healthy tissue – an essential consideration when developing effective methods to treat such injuries – has been limited by a lack of robust genetically tractable models. Our lab previously established a method to study necrosis-induced regeneration in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc, which revealed a unique phenomenon whereby cells at a distance from the injury upregulate caspase activity in a process called Necrosis-induced Apoptosis (NiA) that is vital for regeneration. Here, we have further investigated this phenomenon, showing that NiA is predominantly associated with the highly regenerative pouch region of the disc, shaped by genetic factors present in the presumptive hinge. Furthermore, we find that a proportion of NiA fail to undergo apoptosis, instead surviving effector caspase activation to persist within the tissue and stimulate reparative proliferation late in regeneration. This proliferation relies on the initiator caspase Dronc, and occurs independent of JNK, ROS or mitogens associated with the previously characterized Apoptosis-induced Proliferation (AiP) mechanism. These data reveal a new means by which non-apoptotic Dronc signaling promotes regenerative proliferation in response to necrotic damage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>necrosis</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HD102765</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Robin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM147615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Robin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A non-apoptotic function of the caspase Dronc is essential to promote tissue repair in response to necrosis via a previously uncharacterized mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Necrosis is the rapid, disordered death of cells characterized by the loss of membrane integrity and release of cytoplasmic contents into the surrounding tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hajibabaie et al., 2023</xref>). This catastrophic type of cell death can occur in diverse tissues and is central to many human conditions, particularly those related to ischemic injuries. Such conditions include chronic illnesses like diabetes, joint disorders, sickle-cell anemia and other inherited and congenital diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Masi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mulay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Karsch-Bluman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tonnus et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2023</xref>), as well as more acute medical events like strokes, heart attacks, bacterial infections and common traumatic injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Konstantinidis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hakkarainen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonne and Kadri, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Even therapeutic interventions, in particular treatments for cancer, can result in this devastating form of damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Robertson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakada et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Unfortunately, current strategies to treat necrosis mainly focus on invasive procedures that are often met with limited success. With such substantial bearings on human health, it is crucial to better understand the effects of necrosis in disease and injury, particularly in the context of tissue repair and regeneration.</p><p>We currently have a limited understanding of how necrosis impacts surrounding healthy tissue during wound healing. Indeed, much of our understanding about how cell death influences tissue repair comes instead from models involving programmed cell death (PCD) like apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hajibabaie et al., 2023</xref>). This highly regulated process can be triggered by intrinsic or extrinsic pathways, both of which lead to the activation of caspases that mediate the controlled disassembly of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazi and Salvesen, 2014</xref>). Studies of PCD in a variety of species have shown that cells undergoing apoptosis can release signaling molecules that are interpreted by surrounding tissues to drive wound healing events, such as tissue remodeling, immune responses, survival and proliferation of surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan and Bergmann, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergmann and Steller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ryoo and Bergmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vriz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs and Steller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pérez-Garijo and Steller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez-Garijo, 2018</xref>). For example, the signaling molecules Prostaglandin E2 and Hedgehog are produced by dying hepatocytes to induce regenerative proliferation in the vertebrate liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2010</xref>), while apoptotic-deficient mice show both impaired liver regeneration and epidermal recovery after wounding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Although mitogenic signaling by apoptotic cells is an established and conserved process, whether similar signaling events occur following necrotic cell death is less clear.</p><p>Evidence of apoptotic signaling first originated from studies of the larval wing primordia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pérez-Garijo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ryoo et al., 2004</xref>). This epithelial tissue has been extensively characterized as a model for growth, development and regeneration, including the role that cell death plays in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beira and Paro, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Worley and Hariharan, 2022</xref>). Ongoing studies of this model have identified an essential signaling network centered on the highly conserved JNK pathway. JNK activates several major signaling pathways including Hippo and JAK/STAT, which have conserved roles in promoting regeneration across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Worley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hariharan and Serras, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fox et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Worley and Hariharan, 2022</xref>), as well as activating JNK itself via overlapping positive feedback loops. One such feedback loop acts through the initiator caspase Dronc (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Caspase-9), which, independent of its role in apoptosis, is translocated to the cell membrane to activate the release of ROS from the NADPH oxidase Duox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2018</xref>). ROS attracts hemocytes to further activate JNK signaling in the disc through the release of the TNF ligand Eiger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diwanji and Bergmann, 2018</xref>). In a related pathway, JNK can also lead to the expression of the <italic>Duox</italic> maturation factor <italic>moladietz</italic> (<italic>mol</italic>), thus activating this feedback loop without Dronc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pinal et al., 2018</xref>). An important advance in elucidating this network was the ability to generate ‘undead cells’, using the baculovirus caspase inhibitor P35 to prevent apoptotic cells from dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hay et al., 1994</xref>). These cells therefore persist, releasing mitogenic factors including Wingless (Wg, Wnt1), Decapentaplegic (Dpp, BMP2/4), Spitz (Spi, EGF), or Hedgehog (Hh; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pérez-Garijo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ryoo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pérez-Garijo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan and Bergmann, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pérez-Garijo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). These signals subsequently promote proliferation of the surrounding cells in a phenomenon known as Apoptosis-induced Proliferation (AiP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan and Bergmann, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ryoo and Bergmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017</xref>).</p><p>By contrast, the genetic events following necrosis are less well explored. Necrosis is characterized by swelling and loss of cellular membrane integrity, with the release of cellular contents into the intercellular space causing a significant inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Festjens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D’Arcy, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hajibabaie et al., 2023</xref>). Necrosis is highly variable, occurring as a regulated process, for example necroptosis, or as unregulated, caspase-independent lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazi and Salvesen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D’Arcy, 2019</xref>). The factors released from necrotic cells are collectively termed Damage-Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vénéreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roh and Sohn, 2018</xref>), which are thought to interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on nearby cells, mostly of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). DAMPs are understood to mainly consist of fundamental cellular components like histones, chromatin, and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vénéreau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roh and Sohn, 2018</xref>), although specific factors have also been described. For example, High-mobility group box 1 (HMBG1) has been characterized as a DAMP in models of spinal cord, cardiac and muscle injury where it promotes angiogenesis, attracts repair cells and induces proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vénéreau et al., 2015</xref>), as well as in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nishida et al., 2024</xref>). However, the overall role of DAMPs and how they influence healing and regeneration through interaction with healthy tissues has yet to be fully explored.</p><p>To better investigate necrosis-induced wound repair and regeneration, our lab developed a method to rapidly and reproducibly induce necrotic cell death within the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). Using a genetic ablation system we previously established, named Duration and Location (DUAL) Control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris, 2023</xref>), we can induce necrosis in the wing disc via expression of a leaky cation channel <italic>GluR1<sup>LC</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Using this system (<italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic>), we showed that wing discs are capable of fully regenerating following necrotic injury at a rate comparable to that of damage induced by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). However, while apoptotic ablation leads to JNK signaling and extensive caspase activity, we found that necrosis leads to only minor levels of JNK-mediated apoptosis, which is confined to the wound edge, but unexpectedly generates significant caspase activity in cells distant from the injury. We called this non-autonomous caspase activation Necrosis-induced Apoptosis (NiA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). Unlike normal apoptotic cells, NiA form entirely independent of JNK signaling, and cannot be made undead using P35. We also demonstrated that NiA is essential for regeneration, although the mechanism was unclear.</p><p>Here, we have further characterized the NiA phenomenon, finding that only regeneration-competent areas of the wing disc can produce NiA following damage, in part due to WNT and JAK/STAT signaling in the hinge that limits NiA to the pouch. Building upon our finding that NiA is necessary for regeneration, we show that NiA leads to localized proliferation significantly later in regeneration than previously observed. Using tools to trace caspase activity and cell death, we demonstrate that this is possible because a proportion of NiA survive effector caspase activation and persist late into regeneration where they promote proliferation. Finally, we show that this proliferation relies on the initiator caspase Dronc, but surprisingly does not involve established AiP mechanisms. Our data suggest a model in which necrotic injuries induce caspase activity in cells at a distance from the injury, some of which undergo JNK-independent apoptosis (NiA), while others survive and promote proliferation through a novel non-apoptotic function of Dronc, which is separate from its role in AiP. We refer to these surviving NiA cells as Necrosis-induced Caspase-Positive (NiCP) cells. These findings reveal an important genetic response to lytic cell death that could potentially be leveraged to augment regeneration of necrotic wounds.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Formation of NiA occurs primarily in the wing pouch</title><p>Previously, we found that NiA occurs in the lateral pouch (LP) upon induction of necrosis in the distal pouch with <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, D and E</xref>, yellow arrowheads in E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). The wing disc itself comprises different identities reflecting the adult structures they ultimately create, including the pouch, hinge and notum, which are themselves divided into compartments; anterior/posterior and dorsal/ventral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since these various disc identities have distinct regenerative capacities stemming from their different genetic responses to damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martín et al., 2017</xref>), to better understand the formation of NiA and the role it plays in regeneration we tested whether necrosis occurring in different areas of the disc leads to NiA. To do so, we utilized <italic>GAL4/UAS/GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic> to conditionally express <italic>UAS-GluR1<sup>LC</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2013</xref>) in the pouch, hinge or notum tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As an initial test, we attempted to recapitulate our original observations made using <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic> by employing an enhancer of the <italic>spalt</italic> gene driving <italic>GAL4</italic> (<italic>R85E08<sup>ts</sup>&gt;GluR1</italic>) to cause necrosis in the distal pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). As anticipated, NiA are formed in the lateral pouch following 20 hr of ablation (denoted as 0 hr, when larvae are downshifted to 18 °C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In this figure and others, NiA are recognized as cells positive for the cleaved caspase cDcp-1 and negative for GFP that labels the ablation domain (<italic>UAS-GFP</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>, yellow arrowheads), which indicates that these caspase-positive cells originate outside the area of ablation. This test confirms that the NiA phenomenon occurs independent of the ablation system used. Notably, NiA are consistently absent from the presumptive hinge region surrounding the pouch following both <italic>R85E08<sup>ts</sup>&gt;GluR1</italic> or <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic> ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>). Indeed, outside of the pouch, cDcp-1 staining is only observed in a small area of the posterior pleura (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, red arrowhead) and at low levels stochastically across the disc due to stress induced by temperature changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). To further investigate the extent to which necrotic pouch tissue can induce NiA we next ablated the entire pouch using <italic>rotund-GAL4</italic> (<italic>rn<sup>ts</sup> &gt;GluR1</italic>) or <italic>nubbin-GAL4</italic> (<italic>nub<sup>ts</sup> &gt;GluR1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Necrosis of the whole pouch with either driver fails to result in NiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), even after 24 hr of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Importantly, the majority of cDcp-1-positive cells overlap with expression of the JNK target <italic>Mmp1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and J</xref>), and therefore resembles cells undergoing JNK-mediated apoptosis, such as those seen at the wound edge (WE) following distal pouch ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, arrowhead) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). These data suggest that cells outside of the pouch are generally unable to respond to DAMPs released by pouch cells undergoing necrosis to generate NiA, or that such DAMPs are spatially limited.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The NiA response is restricted to pouch cells following ablation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic> ablation scheme.

In this ablation, we observed only minimal NiA, with sporadic cDcp-1-positive, GFP-negative cells in the unablated areas of the notum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>), which does not change after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). To test the hinge, we used a putative <italic>zfh1</italic> enhancer driving <italic>GAL4</italic> (<italic>R73G07<sup>ts</sup>&gt;GluR1</italic>), which has hinge-specific expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). Ablation of the hinge fails to generate NiA in the notum, and surprisingly does not induce a response in the neighboring pouch cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O and P</xref>), despite their demonstrated ability to form NiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Given that the regenerative capacity of the wing disc is mainly constrained to the pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martín et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martín and Morata, 2018</xref>), it is possible that the intrinsic differences in regenerative capacity across the disc accounts for the disparity in NiA/NiCP occurrence in the pouch versus the notum. A difference in the availability of the relevant DAMPs or PRRs may also be responsible for the pattern of NiA formation throughout the disc. Alternatively, there may be inhibitory factors present in notum cells that protect against the induction of pro-apoptotic pathway elements. Indeed, differences in caspase 3 activation within the notum and pouch have been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergantiños et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that either only the pouch releases DAMPs - and has the requisite PRRs to respond to these DAMPs - that lead to NiA following necrosis, or that unknown genetic factors limit the capacity of the notum and hinge to respond to damage.</p><p>As the efficacy of DAMPs might be limited by how far they can reach after being released from lysed cells, we also induced necrosis in the entire posterior disc compartment with <italic>hedgehog-GAL4</italic> (<italic>hh<sup>ts</sup> &gt;GluR1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>), and in an anterior stripe along the anterior/posterior compartment boundary using <italic>patched-GAL4</italic> (<italic>ptc<sup>ts</sup> &gt;GluR1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These experiments cause the simultaneous necrosis of pouch, hinge and notum tissues, allowing us to determine the potential of these different tissue identities to produce NiA. In both experiments, NiA cells are observed in the pouch, and to a lesser extent the notum, but are still strikingly absent from the hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R, R’ and T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, D' and F</xref>). After 24 hr of recovery, there is an increase in the number of NiA within the pouch and notum, but not the hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S, S’ and T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E’ and F</xref>). Thus, it appears that NiA can occur outside of the pouch when a large enough area, or an area that also includes the pouch, is ablated. However, the hinge remains completely refractory to NiA formation.</p><p>To avoid any bias in the use of tissue-specific <italic>GAL4</italic> drivers, we also made RFP-labeled stochastic clones that have the potential to undergo necrosis upon changing the growth temperature to 30 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). After allowing these clones to develop, we triggered necrosis in early third larval instar and examined the extent of active caspase in the different disc regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). As expected, necrosis of clones in the pouch leads to active caspases both within and surrounding the ablated area, including cells without the RFP clone label, suggesting that NiA has occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H’</xref>, arrowheads). We also found that necrosis in the notum leads to comparatively little caspase labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H’’</xref>) consistent with the notum being less able to generate NiA. Necrotic clones in the hinge also produces caspase activity, but most of these cells also have RFP, suggesting again that NiA does not occur in the hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H’</xref>). Using this approach, we also examined whether NiA formation occurs in other larval tissues as well, and found that necrotic clones in both haltere and leg discs appear to result in an NiA response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Of note, the use of clones that naturally vary in size also demonstrates that the area of ablation is related to the amount of NiA produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), which is also true of our tissue-specific ablation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data infer three important conclusions: (1) all areas of the disc can be killed by necrosis and therefore potentially can release DAMPs, (2) NiA is limited to the pouch when local necrosis occurs, but when multiple (or large) areas of the disc are killed, limited NiA can also be induced in the notum, although we cannot rule out that this is due to DAMPs from dying pouch cells, and (3) the hinge is refractory to NiA, which is consistent with other findings that show its resistance to apoptosis in response to irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>). Thus, the overall pattern of competence to undergo NiA appears to reflect the uneven regenerative capacity of the wing disc, with NiA formation predominantly associated with the highly regenerative wing pouch.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NiA is regulated by WNT and JAK/STAT signaling</title><p>As NiA readily occurs in the pouch but is excluded from the nearby hinge, we used this contrasting response to identify genetic factors that might regulate NiA formation. The wing hinge is specified by JAK/STAT signaling during disc development, which can protect cells from irradiation-induced apoptosis potentially via the expression of <italic>Zn finger homeodomain</italic> 2 (<italic>zfh2</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">La Fortezza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Verghese and Su, 2018</xref>). Alongside JAK/STAT, the presence of Wingless (Wg, <italic>Drosophila</italic> Wnt1), which encircles the pouch, may also protect cells from death and permit regeneration of the pouch through the repression of <italic>reaper</italic> (<italic>rpr</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>). As such, we investigated both JAK/STAT and Wg to determine whether they regulate NiA formation.</p><p>The activity of the JAK/STAT pathway can be visualized in the hinge of early third instar larval discs by a <italic>10XSTAT-GFP</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bach et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Upon ablation with <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic>, high levels of JAK/STAT activity are observed in the pouch at the immediate WE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, arrowhead), similar to its upregulation following irradiation or apoptotic ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herrera and Bach, 2019</xref>). As JNK signaling is induced at the WE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>), and the <italic>unpaired</italic> ligands are targets of JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Katsuyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jaiswal et al., 2023</xref>), this JAK/STAT activity is likely to be JNK-mediated. By contrast, low levels of JAK/STAT activity are observed in the areas of the pouch where NiA occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, open arrowheads), surrounded by the higher developmental JAK/STAT in the hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To determine if low JAK/STAT activity is important for NiA, we knocked down the receptor <italic>domeless</italic> (<italic>UAS-dome<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) in the pouch, which results in a significant increase in NiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D and E</xref>), but has no effect when expressed without damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that JAK/STAT signaling may negatively regulate the formation of NiA. To support this finding, we next ectopically activated JAK/STAT (<italic>UAS-hop48A</italic>). However, even in the absence of damage, this expression results in high levels of caspase positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref> and C), making it difficult to determine an effect on NiA formation. Therefore, to further investigate if JAK/STAT regulates NiA formation, we asked whether reducing developmental JAK/STAT in the hinge might lead to NiA spreading further into this region. We generated a version of DUAL Control that expresses <italic>GAL4</italic> in the posterior compartment by replacing the pouch-specific <italic>DVE &gt;&gt;GAL4</italic> with <italic>hh-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To prevent <italic>hh-GAL4</italic> from being active throughout development, we included <italic>GAL80<sup>ts</sup></italic> (hereafter <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup>hh<sup>ts</sup></italic>) and used temperature changes to limit GAL4 activity to the period just prior to ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). With this system, we knocked down the expression of the JAK/STAT transcription factor <italic>Stat92E</italic> (<italic>UAS-Stat92E<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) in the posterior compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>) and ablated the distal pouch, which again shows an increase in caspase-positive cells in the pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, arrowhead, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), but surprisingly NiA cells are still not observed in the hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, open arrowhead). To further test this result, we also targeted <italic>zinc finger homeodomain 2</italic> (<italic>Zfh2</italic>), a downstream target of the JAK/STAT pathway that potentially protects cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">La Fortezza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Verghese and Su, 2018</xref>). The knockdown of <italic>Zfh2</italic> slightly increases the formation of NiA, although not significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). However, we noted that the level of Zfh2 protein did not appear strongly affected by this knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>), and therefore we cannot confidently conclude that Zfh2 is involved in caspase activation in the context of necrotic damage. Expression of these RNAi lines targeting <italic>Stat92E</italic> or <italic>Zfh2</italic> under non-ablating conditions does not yield any increase in caspase signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G and I</xref>). Thus, JAK/STAT signaling appears to limit NiA formation in the pouch, while the inability for NiA to expand into the hinge upon reducing JAK/STAT suggests that other hinge-specific factors may be involved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NiA formation in pouch cells is regulated by the Wg and JAK/STAT pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A control disc (<italic>DC<sup>NA</sup></italic>) bearing the <italic>10xSTAT-GFP</italic> reporter, showing the hinge-specific Stat92E activity that is normally absent from the wing pouch.

Unlike the stochastic temperature change-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), we noted that NiA in the pouch frequently occurs in discrete populations that avoid Wg at the margin stripe and the inner Wg circle at the boundary of the pouch and hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), limiting formation of the NiA cells to regions that appear to overlap the <italic>vestigial quadrant enhancer</italic> (<italic>vgQE-lacZ</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1Kand L</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 1996</xref>). By contrast, cDcp-1-positive cells at the WE do not avoid the Wg margin stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, arrowhead), suggesting that this behavior may be specific to NiA. To test this, we utilized <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup>hh<sup>ts</sup></italic> to knock down <italic>wg</italic> in the posterior compartment of the disc (<italic>UAS-wg<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) and found that NiA now occurs in areas of the pouch where <italic>wg</italic> expression is lost, including the wing margin and inner hinge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, arrowhead, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>), unlike NiA in the anterior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, open arrowhead).

Together, these data demonstrate that both WNT and JAK/STAT signaling act to limit NiA, thus potentially constraining it to the pouch following necrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NiA promotes proliferation late in regeneration</title><p>As NiA is spatially regulated by at least two major signaling pathways in the disc, we next focused on how the localization of NiA relates to its role in promoting regeneration. In our previous work, using an E2F reporter (<italic>PCNA-GFP</italic>) we found that the appearance of NiA coincides with localized proliferation in the distal pouch at 18 hr post-ablation close to the wound, which persists at 24 hr post ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). However, investigation at subsequent time points of recovery shows that regenerative proliferation continues to increase through 36 hr and 48 hr of regeneration, later than we initially assayed, with a significant increase in E2F reporter expression occurring between 18 and 36 hr in the pouch relative to the whole disc, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-A’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B, quantified in C</xref>). To investigate this proliferative response, we used EdU to assay the relative level of cell proliferation in discs throughout regeneration from 18 hr to 48 hr post-ablation with <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–B’’’</xref>), using folds as landmarks to normalize EdU intensity in the pouch relative to the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–D’’’</xref>). We also performed the same time course with apoptotic ablation using <italic>DC<sup>hepCA</sup></italic> for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–C’’’</xref>). At 18 hr of regeneration following ablation with either <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic> or <italic>DC<sup>hepCA</sup></italic>, cells at the WE have already migrated distally to close the injury, while EdU is absent from an area immediately adjacent to the wound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). This is consistent with the recently described JNK-mediated pause in proliferation that occurs in regenerating wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jaiswal et al., 2023</xref>). At 24 hr, this proliferation-devoid area continues to persist following apoptotic injury (<italic>DC<sup>hepCA</sup></italic>) and the EdU signal becomes elevated broadly across the rest of the pouch, representing the formation of a blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C’</xref>). By contrast, at 24 hr after necrosis (<italic>DC<sup>GluRI</sup></italic>), the EdU label is reestablished in cells around the wound showing that proliferation has restarted in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’</xref>). Unlike <italic>DC<sup>hepCA</sup></italic>, the rest of the pouch does not appear to change its rate of proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’</xref>). By 36 hr following necrosis, a higher EdU signal occurs broadly across the pouch relative to the rest of the disc, which is significantly stronger compared to discs ablated by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’’, C’’ and E</xref>).

However, it remains unclear whether this newly observed localized proliferation at 36 hr and 48 hr also relies on a functional apoptotic pathway, and moreover, to what extent this regenerative proliferation relies on the JNK-mediated apoptosis at the WE versus the JNK-independent NiA in the LP. To answer these questions, we blocked apoptosis throughout the pouch and this time examined proliferation in late regeneration using EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–D’’’</xref>). We found that the localized increase in EdU signaling at 36 hr is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D’’ and F</xref>), although by 48 hr this increase is mostly restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D’’’ and F</xref>). Importantly, the expression of <italic>mir(RHG</italic>) does not influence EdU levels in the absence of damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F and G</xref>). Together, these data confirm that a functional apoptotic pathway is necessary to induce a localized proliferative response late in regeneration following necrosis. To understand the relative contribution of WE apoptosis or the NiA in the LP, we designed experiments to block apoptosis in each disc area alone (<italic>LP&gt;mir(RHG),</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, and <italic>WE&gt;mir(RHG</italic>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, see Materials and methods for genotypes) relative to the whole pouch knock down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Strikingly, the high levels of EdU normally present at 36 hr are strongly reduced when apoptosis is blocked in either population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–O</xref>), suggesting that both dying cells at the WE and the NiA in the LP contribute to regenerative proliferation following necrosis.

Although NiA occurs independent of JNK, to determine whether NiA-induced proliferation relies on any of the same signaling factors as AiP, we examined the damage-specific expression of these various secreted factors. To ensure we could visualize such signals, we used <italic>lacZ</italic>-based reporters and generated undead cells by expressing the baculoviral P35 (<italic>UAS-P35</italic>) in the whole pouch. This protein inhibits activity of the effector caspases Drice and cDcp-1 to block cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hawkins et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meier et al., 2000</xref>), thus allowing signals produced by these cells to be readily detected.

In addition to mitogen production, AiP also involves the production of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) through a non-apoptotic function of Dronc that activates Duox.

We first examined the extent of ROS production using dihydroethidium (DHE). This assay showed high levels of ROS localized to the WE but not in the LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, arrowhead), suggesting that NiA does not produce ROS during regeneration. Consistent with this finding, the removal of ROS through pouch-wide expression of either the ROS chelators <italic>Catalase</italic> and <italic>Superoxide dismutase 1</italic> (<italic>UAS-Cat; UAS-Sod1</italic>) or knockdown of <italic>Duox</italic> (<italic>UAS-Duox<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) has no observable effect on the appearance of NiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>), although apoptosis at the WE is strongly suppressed in both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>, open arrowhead). It has also been shown that the Duox maturation factor <italic>moladietz</italic> (<italic>mol</italic>) is upregulated following injury to sustain the production of ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pinal et al., 2018</xref>).

Finally, to functionally test whether AiP is required for the proliferation associated with NiA, we examined EdU levels across the disc at 36 hr when P35 is expressed. Normally, when undead cells are created via P35, ectopic mitogen production results increased proliferation and tumorous overgrowth. However, when P35 is expressed solely in the LP we saw no change in EdU labeling versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, L and M</xref>), suggesting NiA do not form undead cells. When expressed in the whole pouch, P35 has a small but non-significant effect on EdU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, K and M</xref>), consistent with undead cells now being generated at the WE. Together, these data indicate that cells at the WE undergo AiP to contribute to regenerative proliferation, while NiA promote proliferation through a different mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A subset of cells undergoing NiA are both caspase-positive and have markers of DNA repair and proliferation</title><p>Robust populations of NiA appear in the wing pouch at around 18 hr of regeneration, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>), while the localized change in EdU labeling that encompasses much of the damaged pouch is detected later in regeneration at 36 hr and 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–B’’’’, E and F</xref>). Since the loss of NiA abolishes this change in proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, L–M and O</xref>), we sought to understand how NiA might be influencing proliferation at these later time points. To do so, we used a robust sensor for the activity of the effector caspases cDcp-1 and Drice called <italic>Green Caspase-3 Activity indicator</italic> (<italic>UAS-GC3Ai</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schott et al., 2017</xref>) to label NiA throughout regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–E</xref>). GC3Ai consists of a cyclized GFP with the N and C termini linked by a short peptide that contains a caspase-3 cleavage site (DEVD), which prevents fluorescence under non-apoptotic conditions. Activated effector caspases can cleave the linker peptide, resulting in a fluorescent GFP signal that reports caspase activity in real time. Schott et al. demonstrated that apoptotic cells labeled by GC3Ai are extruded within 1 hr of labeling, consistent with previously published work on apoptotic cell extrusion in imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Monier et al., 2015</xref>). With this reporter we found that, unlike normal apoptotic cells that are rapidly cleared from the wing disc, NiA persist and increase in abundance by 36 hr when proliferation localizes to the distal pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), as well as at 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and even up to 64 hr (wandering stage), when regeneration is complete and pouch tissue is restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, arrowhead). These persistent <italic>GC3Ai</italic>-positive cells are also frequently associated with adjacent cells actively undergoing mitosis by 36 hr, indicated by PH3 labelling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–G’</xref>).

When apoptosis is induced in wing discs using <italic>DC<sup>hepCA</sup></italic>, GC3Ai labeling shows apoptotic cells present in the pouch at 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>) throughout the disc proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J’</xref>). At 36 hr these cells appear pyknotic and are basally extruded by 64 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K and K’</xref>). By comparison, upon ablation with <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic>, caspase-positive cells are seen to occupy different regions of the disc at 18 hr, with WE apoptotic cells closer towards the basal surface and NiA derived from the LP still within the disc proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5L and L’</xref>). By 36 hr, the NiA form two distinct populations, some that are rounded up and appear closer to the basal surface, similar to the WE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M and M’</xref> red arrowhead), and others that continue to exhibit a columnar appearance and contact both the apical and basal surfaces of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M and M’</xref>, yellow arrowheads). The appearance and position of these cells suggest that a proportion of NiA cells may fail to complete apoptosis but instead persist into late stages of regeneration, despite the presence of detectible caspase activity. This is supported by the observation that only a minority of GC3Ai-positive cells have blebbing and pyknotic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G’</xref>, white arrowhead), while the majority appear to have a consistent and undisturbed cytoplasmic fluorescent label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G’</xref>, yellow arrowhead). To test our hypothesis that these cells are not undergoing apoptosis, we performed a TUNEL assay to fluorescently label cells with double stranded DNA breaks in GC3Ai-expressing discs. We found that most GC3Ai-labeled cells are co-labeled by TUNEL in early (18 hr) and late (36 hr) stages of regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref> and F, arrowheads). However, while TUNEL is associated with apoptosis, by itself it does not confirm that cells are dying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grasl-Kraupp et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, we also examined levels of γH2Av, a histone variant associated with DNA repair and inhibition of apoptosis following damaging stimuli such as irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Madigan et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, we found that GC3Ai-positive cells initially have high levels of γH2Av at 18 hr of regeneration, including those at the WE and the NiA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>, arrowheads), which later is lost from the NiA at 36 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>, open arrowheads). This indicates that NiA are undergoing active DNA repair rather than apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that a majority of NiA may upregulate caspase activity, but rather than undergoing apoptosis, they repair cellular damage and persist in the tissue into late stages of regeneration where they promote proliferation. As such we are referring to this population of persistent and potentially non-apoptotic NiA as Necrosis-induced Caspase Positive (NiCP) cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>NiCP cells have initiator caspase activity but sublethal effector caspase activity</title><p>While this characterization of caspase activation and discovery of NiCP cells do not change any of the conclusions we have made up until this point, it does raise the question as to why some cells (NiA) undergo apoptosis and are removed from the tissue in response to necrosis, while others (NiCP) seem to persist despite caspase activity. The ability for cells to survive caspase activity is not surprising, as many non-apoptotic roles for caspases have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Su, 2020</xref>), and includes promoting proliferation. As mentioned, the initiator caspase Dronc functions in a non-apoptotic role to activate Duox and thus promote proliferation during AiP in damaged wing discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we wondered whether the difference between NiA and NiCP might arise from the level or activity of caspases within these cells. The GC3Ai reporter indicates activity of Dcp-1 and Drice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schott et al., 2017</xref>) while the anti-cleaved-Dcp-1 antibody is thought to also detect Drice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, these tools exclusively detect effector caspases. As such, to gain a better understanding of caspase activity in NiCP we used two lineage tracing tools to study the activity of initiator versus effector caspases. The initiator caspase-sensitive Drice-Based Sensor (<italic>DBS-GFP</italic>) consists of a modified version of the effector caspase Drice that is (1) a membrane-bound via mCD8, and (2) linked to a nuclear GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baena-Lopez et al., 2018</xref>). Upon cleavage by Dronc the GFP is released and translocates to the nucleus, providing a readout for Dronc activity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baena-Lopez et al., 2018</xref>). The second tool, CasExpress, is also membrane-bound via mCD8 and attached to GAL4 through a short linker peptide that contains the Drice/Dcp-1 cleavage site DQVD, thus providing a readout for the activity of both effector caspases Drice and Dcp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). This tool is highly sensitive and is capable of detecting non-apoptotic caspase activity that occurs during development. However, since GAL4 activity can be modulated by temperature, the sensitivity of CasExpress can be altered by a combination of GAL80<sup>ts</sup> and temperature to suppress this background signal and optimize damage-induced caspase labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colon Plaza and Su, 2024</xref>). Our results show a strong overlap of <italic>DBS-GFP</italic> with anti-cDcp-1 in the LP of <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup></italic> ablated discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and A’</xref>), indicating that these cells have robust Dronc activity, as do the cells at the WE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and A’</xref>). However, when we used CasExpress to examine effector caspase activity with a protocol that eliminates developmental caspase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colon Plaza and Su, 2024</xref>), we noted that only cells at the WE were labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, B’ and B’’</xref>, arrowhead), most of which had pyknotic nuclei showing they are actively undergoing apoptosis, while few cells in the LP were labelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’’</xref>). We hypothesized that the level of effector caspase activity might be high enough to be detected by GC3Ai and the cDcp-1 antibody, but not by CasExpress. To test this idea, we further attempted to detect NiCP with CasExpress by combining it with G-TRACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 2009</xref>), which should lineage trace cells that have effector caspase activity, permanently labeling them with GFP at the start of ablation. Again, we found that only cells of the WE are labelled during regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’’’</xref>, arrowhead), with minimal labelling of cells in the LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B’’’</xref>, open arrowhead), even after 36 hr of regeneration when the NiCP-induced uptick in proliferation occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By comparison, performing these same experiments using <italic>DC<sup>hepCA</sup></italic> to induce extensive apoptotic cell death leads to a significant proportion of cDcp-1-positive cells being labelled by CasExpress under both normal and lineage tracing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, arrowhead), suggesting that in the context of necrosis there is not enough effector caspase activity to label NiCP using these methods. Indeed, if the CasExpress experiment is performed in the absence of the GAL80<sup>ts</sup> that suppresses the background developmental caspase signal, the NiCP cells now become labeled by GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that effector caspases are indeed present in these cells, but at low enough levels to avoid death. Evidence for the existence of a cellular execution threshold of caspase activity in cells of the wing disc, which must be reached to induce apoptosis, has previously been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florentin and Arama, 2012</xref>). This is further supported by the observation that the GFP label becomes more apparent later in regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), confirming that cells with effector caspase activity persist rather than die. Thus, it appears that in response to necrosis, the cells of the LP activate the initiator caspase Dronc and the effector caspase(s) Drice/cDcp-1 (to an extent) but fail to undergo programmed cell death. Instead, these cells persist in the disc late into regeneration where they stimulate regenerative proliferation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>NiCP have sublethal levels of activated executioner caspase.</title><p>(<bold>A-A’</bold>) A <italic>DC<sup>GluR1</sup> DBS-GFP</italic> ablated disc at 18 hr showing strong overlap between cDcp-1 and <italic>DBS-GFP</italic>-positive NiA/NiCP.

AiP depends on both JNK and ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fogarty et al., 2016</xref>), which we have shown are only present at the WE and are not associated with NiA/NiCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H and I</xref>). Thus, it is possible that Dronc’s function in response to necrosis occurs via a distinct mechanism. Importantly, the activity of Dronc in both apoptosis and in AiP is influenced by the Dronc’s upstream regulator, DIAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meier et al., 2000</xref>). DIAP1 modifies Dronc’s CARD domain through K78 mono-ubiquitylation, which blocks both apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamber Kaya et al., 2017</xref>), and AiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fan and Bergmann, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017</xref>). Thus, we expressed <italic>DIAP1</italic> (<italic>UAS-DIAP1</italic>) following ablation with <italic>DC<sup>GluRI</sup></italic> and found that it strongly suppresses the number of cDcp-1-positive cells at the WE and the NiA/NiCP in the LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I and K</xref>), but strikingly has no effect on regenerative proliferation at 36 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J and L</xref>). These results demonstrate a key role for the initiator caspase <italic>Dronc</italic> in promoting regenerative proliferation following necrosis, which is not affected by DIAP1, and therefore is likely separate from its role in apoptosis and the AiP mechanism.</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest a model in which necrosis leads to the establishment of distinct cell populations important for regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N and O</xref>). After injury, cells at the immediate WE undergo JNK-mediated apoptosis and contribute to proliferation via the established AiP mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref>, left), while cells at a distance from the injury in the LP activate Dronc via an unknown DAMP-like signal(s) that occurs independent of JNK. Some of these cells go on to activate effector caspases at levels high enough to result in apoptosis (NiA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref>, right), while others activate these caspases at a low enough level to be detectable but insufficient to induce death (NiCP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7O</xref> right). Instead, these cells persist in the tissue late into the repair process, where they promote proliferation via a novel non-apoptotic and AiP-independent function of the initiator caspase Dronc.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>An important and often overlooked factor when studying regeneration is the type of injury – and consequently the type of cell death it causes – that can significantly impact repair processes. The existence of conserved signaling events that promote recovery has been well established in the context of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez-Garijo, 2018</xref>), while the importance of such events in necrosis are less well established. Here, we have investigated the genetic events that occur in the aftermath of necrosis and how they influence the ability of a tissue to recover and regenerate. We previously showed that wing discs can regenerate effectively in the face of necrotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>), triggering local JNK-dependent AiP at the WE, which is likely in response to tissue disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">La Marca and Richardson, 2020</xref>), while also inducing caspase activity in cells at a distance from the wound. This induction is independent of JNK signaling and, alongside having effector caspase activity, these cells can be marked by TUNEL and can be blocked by inhibiting the apoptotic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). As such, we determined that these cells are undergoing PCD and named this phenomenon Necrosis-induced Apoptosis (NiA). We also showed that both NiA and AiP at the wound contribute to regeneration. Our current work further characterizes the NiA phenomenon, and we have now shown that cells undergoing NiA actually comprise two populations with separate behaviors. Upon necrosis, cells of the LP appear to activate effector caspases, indicated by cDcp-1 antibody staining and the transgenic reporter GC3Ai. While a proportion of these cells develop apoptotic morphology, round up and are cleared over time as part of NiA, a large number of cells appear able to persist despite the presence of caspases, where they promote regenerative proliferation dependent on the initiator caspase Dronc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7N</xref>). To reflect these new findings, we have called these NiCP cells. While NiCP appear to promote proliferation, it remains unclear whether they do so through cell autonomous or non-autonomous effects. We were able to determine that NiCP do not utilize AiP as a potential mechanism, as these events occur in the absence of JNK, and exhibit none of the established hallmarks of AiP, including the presence and requirement for ROS, the ability to be blocked by DIAP1, or the production of mitogens such as Wg and Dpp. However, it is possible that other signaling factors may be secreted by these NiCP cells. Alternatively, the observed non-apoptotic caspase activity in NiCP cells may interact with intracellular factors to promote cell-autonomous proliferation. In either case, our results have identified an important role for Dronc in promoting regeneration in response to necrotic cell death.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The signal from necrotic cells that leads to NiA/NiCP remains unknown</title><p>Although we have shown that necrosis leads to NiCP cells and NiA at a distance from the site of injury, the signal that leads to these events upon wounding is still unknown. Cells undergoing necrosis release DAMPs, a category of molecules that includes both common cellular contents as well as specific proteins, both of which can produce downstream responses like inflammation and the activation of effectors that promote a healing response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>). DAMPs of both categories have been demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; in apoptotic-deficient larvae, circulating DAMPs in the hemolymph can constitutively activate immune signaling in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nishida et al., 2024</xref>), while specific factors such as α-actinin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>), and HMGB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nishida et al., 2024</xref>) are known to possess DAMP activity. Recent work describing an in vivo sensor for HMGB1 demonstrates the release of this DAMP from wing disc cells in response to a necrotic stimulus similar to that used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nishida et al., 2024</xref>), making this an important candidate to test for a potential role in producing NiCP. However, it is equally possible that the causative DAMP(s) is/are one or more of the common fundamental cellular components released upon cell lysis, which would be more challenging to manipulate and test. Considering the potential diversity and variable nature of DAMPs, it may be more feasible to instead identify the downstream PRRs that are required to interpret this unknown signal. Several groups of genes can act as PRRs, most notably the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family, various members of which can respond to DAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ming et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong et al., 2020</xref>). Nine TLR genes have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which have assorted roles in development and innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anthoney et al., 2018</xref>), and have been implicated in DAMP sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ming et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it would be valuable to test the requirement for TLRs, alongside other suspected PRRs such as scavenger receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roh and Sohn, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gong et al., 2020</xref>) for their requirement to cause NiCP.</p><p>An additional approach to elucidating how these cells are generated is by leveraging our finding that both JAK/STAT and WNT signaling seem to block NiCP/NiA in the disc. JAK/STAT signaling promotes survival of cells in response to stress by repressing JNK signaling, thus minimizing JNK-mediated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">La Fortezza et al., 2016</xref>). Although NiCP appear to avoid damage-induced JAK/STAT upregulation in the pouch, it is unlikely they are regulated by this mechanism, since NiCP cells occur independent of JNK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>). However, within the hinge, which is completely devoid of NiCP, JAK/STAT protects cells from apoptosis potentially by upregulating <italic>DIAP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>) and <italic>zfh2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Verghese and Su, 2018</xref>), while Wg represses the transcription of <italic>rpr</italic>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>). Both signaling pathways are required autonomously in hinge cells for their ability to replace and regenerate ablated pouch tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ledru et al., 2022</xref>). Our results show that DIAP1 can prevent cDcp-1 activation in NiCP in the pouch, but not the corresponding proliferation that they produce, suggesting one reason that NiCP is not seen in the hinge is possibly due to the high DIAP1 threshold that results from developmental JAK/STAT activity, which blocks Dronc’s ability to activate effector caspases in this region. Thus, it remains to be seen whether lowering DIAP1 levels in the hinge, or manipulating Wg to allow <italic>rpr</italic> expression alongside changes in JAK/STAT, could allow NiCP to form in the hinge, and whether this might lead to regenerative proliferation in this region. Finally, the observation that both NiCP cells and their associated proliferative effects appear to occur independent of JNK signaling, which is normally central in models of stress and damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pinal et al., 2019</xref>), could help to identify the upstream signaling that leads to NiCP following necrosis. Together, these approaches could provide essential information as to the underlying genetic and cellular events that connect the lysis of cells during necrosis to the formation of NiCP cells required for regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The persistence of NiCP cells versus their elimination via NiA</title><p>Our work shows that cells in the LP can either persist as NiCP and contribute to regenerative proliferation, or progress to apoptosis as part of NiA, but how this decision is made is unknown. During apoptosis in the wing disc, a threshold level of effector caspases must be reached for the cell to complete PCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florentin and Arama, 2012</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that DAMP signals from necrotic cells may result in inconstant levels of effector caspase activity in cells of the LP – some with high caspases that advance to apoptosis (NiA), recognized by the changes in morphology and position in the disc characteristic of PCD, which are ultimately cleared, and others (the NiCP cells) that have low enough caspase activity levels to survive, but this activity can still be detected by sensitized reagents. This is supported by our observations made using effector caspase-based lineage tracing using CasExpress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), in which caspases can only be detected in NiCP cells by lowering the detection threshold. Alternatively, since CasExpress is a membrane-based reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2016</xref>), it is also possible that effector caspases within NiCP cells have a different subcellular localization that reflects a non-apoptotic function, thus preventing reporter activation, rather than a difference in expression level or activity. The idea that caspases have different functions, both apoptotic and non-apoptotic, based on localization is well established, such as the targeting of specific cleavage substrates in distinct subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown-Suedel and Bouchier-Hayes, 2020</xref>), or the trafficking of Dronc to the membrane to promote ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amcheslavsky et al., 2018</xref>). Whatever the mechanism is that distinguishes between elimination via NiA or persistence as NiCP, the proportion of LP cells that participate in each remains difficult to assay due to the dynamic nature of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nano and Montell, 2024</xref>) and overall variability of the NiCP/NiA phenotype. Anecdotal evidence from our experiments examining GC3Ai-labelled cells over time suggests the majority of cells in fact do not undergo apoptosis and are therefore NiCP. Importantly, however, while our experiments demonstrate that GC3Ai labeled NiCP increase over time, it is unclear whether this increase in signal abundance is due to cells with newly activated caspases that cleave and activate GC3Ai, or if GC3Ai labeled NiCP are instead proliferating. The use of other tools with potentially different sensitivities to effector caspases, such as Apoliner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bardet et al., 2008</xref>), or CD8-PARP-Venus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florentin and Arama, 2012</xref>), may shed further light on this issue. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how a cell becomes NiCP or undergoes NiA and dies, and whether distinct levels of caspases (initiator or effector) their localization, or a different attribute is responsible.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How does NiCP contribute to regeneration?</title><p>One of the most important questions that future work must address is how the phenomena we have identified lead to regeneration following necrosis. Our experiments suggest that different caspase-positive populations of cells may contribute to regenerative proliferation: Firstly, the smaller number of apoptotic cells at the WE generated by epithelial disruption likely contribute by the established process of JNK-dependent AiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017</xref>). Secondly, the caspase-surviving NiCP cells in the LP that contribute via the initiator caspase Dronc. Crucially, this non-apoptotic function of Dronc cannot be inhibited by the expression of DIAP1, which has previously been shown to block both the apoptotic and non-apoptotic AiP functions of Dronc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamber Kaya et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that Dronc acts via a different mechanism to induce growth in response to necrosis. The current understanding of how Dronc functions at the molecular level may provide valuable clues as to how. DIAP1 suppresses Dronc through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which mono-ubiquitylates the caspase recruitment (CARD) domain of Dronc to suppress both apoptotic and non-apoptotic functions related to AiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamber Kaya et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we find that the ectopic expression of <italic>DIAP1</italic> or just the CARD-containing pro-domain of Dronc (<italic>Dronc<sup>DN</sup></italic>) cannot block regenerative proliferation, while by contrast heterozygosity for the <italic>Dronc<sup>I29</sup></italic> null allele that can inhibit AiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kamber Kaya et al., 2017</xref>) is sufficient to block NiCP-mediated proliferation. Thus, regulation of Dronc activity in the context of necrosis may not rely on the modification of its CARD domain. The documented functions of Dronc have also shown a requirement for its catalytic domain; mutations in this domain can block the activation of Drice and AiP-induced overgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the inability of DIAP1 to suppress NiCP-mediated proliferation may be due to the catalytic activity of Dronc. Importantly, although the CARD and catalytic domains are important points of regulation for Dronc activity, it has also been shown that damage-specific context cues are also vital. For example, the ectopic expression of <italic>Dronc<sup>K78R</sup></italic>, a mutant that renders it irrepressible by DIAP1, might be expected to induce significant apoptotic cell death. However, this is not the case unless its structural binding partner, the APAF1 ortholog encoded by <italic>Dark</italic>, is expressed alongside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shapiro et al., 2008</xref>), demonstrating the importance of stoichiometry between Dronc and Dark for the apoptotic function of Dronc. As such, further investigation into Dronc’s functional domains and context-dependent interactions with respect to its CARD and catalytic domains as well as its binding partners, including DIAP1 and Dark, will be necessary to understand how Dronc is involved in promoting regenerative proliferation in response to necrotic injury.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>NiCP as a general mechanism to promote regeneration</title><p>Although having initially been characterized for their central role in apoptosis, many non-apoptotic functions of caspases have since been discovered, revealing them to be dynamic regulators of diverse process including cell fate specification, cellular remodeling, tissue growth, development, metabolism and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shinoda et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang and Baker, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Su, 2020</xref>). Studies of caspase signaling during regeneration have revealed essential aspects of non-apoptotic caspase activity, such as initiator and effector-dependent models of AiP that contribute to repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ryoo and Bergmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017</xref>). The contrasts in caspase functions that we have observed between apoptotic and necrotic damage, despite ultimately resulting in comparable levels of regeneration in an organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klemm et al., 2021</xref>), underscores the nuance that exists in damage signaling between different injury contexts. It is clear that caspase activity in response to injury as a mechanism to promote regeneration is a highly conserved process that occurs in many organisms, regardless of tissue identify or type of damage incurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergmann and Steller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vriz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs and Steller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pérez-Garijo and Steller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fogarty and Bergmann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pérez-Garijo, 2018</xref>). Our findings reinforce the idea that much remains to be understood about the role of caspases in tissue repair, and that the nature of an injury – and therefore the type of cell death involved – is an important aspect that must also be considered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks</title><p>Flies were cultured in conventional dextrose fly media at 25 °C with 12 h light–dark cycles.

Specifically, experimentally induced necrosis in the distal pouch of larval wing imaginal discs triggers NiA in the lateral pouch. In this manuscript, the authors confirmed this observation and found that while necrosis can kill all areas of the disc, NiA is limited to the pouch and to some extent to the notum, but is excluded from the hinge region. Interestingly and unexpectedly, signaling by the Jak/Stat and Wg pathways inhibits NiA. Further characterization of NiA by the authors reveals that NiA also triggers regenerative proliferation which can last up to 64 hours following necrosis induction. This regenerative response to necrosis is significantly stronger compared to discs ablated by apoptosis. Furthermore, the regenerative proliferation induced by necrosis is dependent on the apoptotic pathway because RNAi targeting the RHG genes is sufficient to block proliferation. However, NiA does not promote proliferation through the previously described apoptosis-induced proliferation (AiP) pathway, although cells at the wound edge undergo AiP. Further examination of the caspase levels in NiA cells allowed the authors to group these cells into two clusters: some cells (NiA) undergo apoptosis and are removed, while others referred to as Necrosis-induced Caspase Positive (NiCP) cells survive despite caspase activity. It is the NiCP cells that repair cellular damage including DNA damage and that promote regenerative proliferation. Caspase sensors demonstrate that both groups of cells have initiator caspase activity, while only the NiA cells contain effector caspase activity. Under certain conditions, the authors were also able to visualize effector caspase activity in NiCP cells, but the level was low, likely below the threshold for apoptosis. Finally, the authors found that loss of the initiator caspase Dronc blocks regenerative proliferation, while inhibiting effector caspases by expression of p35 does not, suggesting that Dronc can induce regenerative proliferation following necrosis in a non- apoptotic manner. This last finding is very interesting as it implies that Dronc can induce proliferation in at least two ways in addition to its requirement in AiP.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a very interesting manuscript. The authors demonstrate that epithelial tissue that contains a significant number of necrotic cells is able to regenerate. This regenerative response is dependent on the apoptotic pathway which is induced at a distance from the necrotic cells. Although regenerative proliferation following necrosis requires the initiator caspase Dronc, Dronc does not induce a classical AiP response for this type of regenerative response. In future work, it will be very interesting to dissect this regenerative response pathway genetically.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>No weaknesses were identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive evaluation and kind words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary / Strengths:</p><p>In this manuscript, Klemm et al., build on past published findings (Klemm et al., 2021) to characterize caspase activation in distal cells following necrotic tissue damage within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc.

How does the existence of NiCP cells impact the earlier findings presented? Is late proliferation due to NiA, NiCP, or both? Does Wg and JAK/STAT signaling act to prevent the formation of both NiA and NiCP cells or only NiA cells? Moreover, the authors are able to specifically manipulate the wound edge (WE) and lateral pouch cells (LP), but don't show how these manipulations within these distinct populations impact regeneration. The authors provide evidence that driving UAS-mir(RHG) throughout the pouch, in the LP or the WE all decrease the amount of NiA/NiCP in Figure 3G-O, but no data on final regenerative outcomes for these manipulations is presented (such as those presented for Dronc-/+ in Fig 7M). The manuscript would be greatly enhanced by quantification of more of the findings, especially in describing if the specific manipulations that impacted NiA /NiCP cells disrupt end-point regeneration phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a line to the results to clarify that we believe the finding that some NiA likely persist as NiCP does not affect our conclusions up to this point.</p><p>We have added a statement emphasizing the results from our first paper, which demonstrate that LP&gt;miRHG expression reduces the overall capacity to regenerate.</p><p>Quantification of the change in posterior NiA number have been added to Figure 2L to strengthen the evidence. Likewise, we have included quantification of the E2F time course presented in Figure 3A (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1C), and quantification of the change in GC3Ai signal over time has been added to Figure 5 - Figure supplement 1D to emphasize the perdurance of GC3Ai-positive NiA/NiCP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How fast does apoptosis take within the wing disc epithelium? How many of the caspase(+) cells are present for the whole 48 hours of regeneration? Are new cells also induced to activate caspase during this time window? The author presented a number of interesting experiments characterizing the NiCP cells. For the caspase sensor GC3Ai experiments in Figure 5, is there a way to differentiate between cells that have maintained fluorescent CG3Ai from cells that have newly activated caspase? What is the timeline for when NiA and NiCP are specified? In addition, what fraction of NiCP cells contribute to the regenerated epithelium? Additional information about the temporal dynamics of NiA and NiCP specification/commitment would be greatly appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more information concerning the kinetics of apoptotic cell removal, and how this compares to the observations we have made with NiA/NiCP in our GC3Ai experiments. Additionally, we have included a quantification of the percent of the whole wing pouch with GC3Ai signal over time (Figure 5F) as well as the distal wing pouch with GC3Ai signal over time (Figure 5 – Figure supplement 1D) to further support the idea that NiCP persist over time.</p><p>We acknowledge that our GC3Ai time course unfortunately cannot confirm whether the increase in GC3Ai signal over time is due to cells with new caspase activity or proliferating NiCP and have included this point in the discussion.</p><p>We attempted to track the lineage of NiA/NiCP into the pupal and adult wings with CasExpress and DBS, however the results of these experiments were inconsistent, and therefore we did not feel confident to include these data or draw conclusions in either direction. We are currently designing variations of these lineage trace tools in order to better track the lineage of these cells that we hope to include in a future paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The notum also does not express developmental JAK/STAT, yet little NiA was observed within the notum. Do the authors have any additional insights into the differential response between the pouch and notum? What makes the pouch unique? Are NiA/NiCP cells created within other imaginal discs and other tissues? Are they similarly important for regenerative responses in other contexts?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a brief mention of these points to the appropriate results section to avoid further increasing the length of the discussion.</p><p>Data on the necrosis of other imaginal discs through FLP/FRT clone formation in haltere and leg discs has been added to Figure 1 Figure supplement 1J, and described in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Regeneration following tissue necrosis is mediated by non- apoptotic caspase activity&quot; by Klemm et al. is an exploration of what happens to a group of cells that experience caspase activation after necrosis occurs some distance away from the cells of interest.

Additionally, we have included a quantification of posterior NiA/NiCP with the Stat92E<sup>RNAi</sup> (as well as wg<sup>RNAi</sup> and Zfh-2<sup>RNAi</sup>, Figure 2L) to strengthen our conclusion that JAK/STAT and WNT signaling acts to regulate NiA formation within the pouch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the authors should confirm that the Zfh2 RNAi is reducing or eliminating Zfh2 levels in the hinge under these experimental conditions, before concluding that Zfh2 does not play a role in stopping hinge cells from undergoing NiA.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated this experiment with a longer knockdown using a GAL4 driver that expresses from early larval stages until our evaluation at L3, but were unable to demonstrate a loss of Zfh-2 with IF labeling. Additionally, we have quantified posterior NiA/NiCP with a Zfh-2RNAi (Figure 2L) and do find a slight increase in NiA/NiCP number, however this change is not significant. We have altered our conclusions to reflect these new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EdU incorporation was quantified by measuring the fluorescence intensity of the pouch and normalizing it to the fluorescence intensity of the whole disc. However, the images show that EdU fluorescence intensity of other regions of the disc, especially the notum, varied substantially when comparing the different genetic backgrounds (for example, note the substantially reduced EdU in the notum of Figure 3 B' and B'). Indeed, it has been shown that tissue damage can lead to suppression of proliferation in the notum and elsewhere in the disc, unless the signaling that induces the suppression is altered. Therefore, the normalization may be skewing the results because the notum EdU is not consistent across samples, possibly because the damage-induced suppression of proliferation in the notum is different across the different genetic backgrounds.</p></disp-quote><p>To more accurately reflect the observations that we have made with the EdU assay, we have changed our terminology to indicate that the EdU signal is more localized to the damaged tissue in ablated discs, thus taking into account the relative changes across the disc, rather than referring to it as an increase in the pouch. To further strengthen our observation that damage results in a localized proliferation, we have included a quantification of the E2F time course presented in Figure 3A (Figure 3 – Figure supplement 1C), which underscores the trend observed in our EdU experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors expressed p35 to attempt to generate &quot;undead cells&quot;. They take an absence of mitogen secretion or increased proliferation as evidence that undead cells were not generated. However, there could be undead cells that do not stimulate proliferation non-autonomously, which could be detected by the persistence of caspase activity in cells that do not complete apoptosis. Indeed, expressing p35 and observing sustained effector caspase activation could help answer the later question of what percentage of this cell population would otherwise complete apoptosis (NiA, rescued by p35) vs reverse course and proliferate (NiCP, unaffected by p35).</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous work, we showed that P35 expression impairs our ability to detect effector caspases with IF-based tools. This can also be seen in Figure 4 of this work (Figure 4C and F). Given that P35 expression precludes our ability to label and assay effector caspase activity visually, and thus address the concerns outlined above, we relied on other tools such as reporters of AiP mitogens (<italic>wg-lacZ &amp; dpp-lacZ</italic>) to assay whether NiA participate in AiP. As a functional readout, we also paired P35 expression with the EdU assay to test whether proliferation was altered by the presence of undead cells. The results discussed in Figure 4 lead us to conclude that NiA likely do not participate in the canonical AiP feedforward loop, although it is possible that these experiments generate another type of undead cell – one that utilizes a different mechanism to promote proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear if the authors' model is that the NiCP cells lead to autonomous or non-autonomous cell proliferation, or both.
