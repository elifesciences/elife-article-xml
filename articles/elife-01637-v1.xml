CAMSAP homologs associate with microtubule minus-ends, and are important for the stability of epithelial cell adhesions. In this study, we report morphological defects in neurons and neuromuscular defects in mutants of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAMSAP, <italic>ptrn-1</italic>. Mechanosensory neurons initially extend wild-type neurites, and subsequently remodel by overextending neurites and retracting synaptic branches and presynaptic varicosities. This neuronal remodeling can be activated by mutations known to alter microtubules, and depends on a functioning DLK-1 MAP kinase pathway. We found that PTRN-1 localizes to both neurites and synapses, and our results suggest that alterations of microtubule structures caused by loss of PTRN-1 function activates a remodeling program leading to changes in neurite morphology. We propose a model whereby minus-end microtubule stabilization mediated by a functional PTRN-1 is necessary for morphological maintenance of neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01637.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01637.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01637.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microtubules are tiny tubular structures made from many copies of proteins called tubulins. Microtubules have a number of important roles inside cells: they are part of the cytoskeleton that provides structural support for the cell; they help to pull chromosomes apart during cell division; and they guide the trafficking of proteins and molecules around inside the cell. Most microtubules are relatively unstable, undergoing continuous dis-assembly and re-assembly in response to the needs of the cell. The microtubules in the branches of nerve cells are an exception, remaining relatively stable over time. Now Marcette et al. and, independently, Richardson et al., have shown that a protein called PTRN-1 has an important role in stabilizing the microtubules in the nerve cells of nematode worms.</p><p>Marcette et al. became interested in the PTRN-1 protein after conducting a screen of randomly mutated worms to look for those with abnormally developed nerve cells. Although worms with a mutation in the gene encoding the PTRN-1 protein could form nerve cells that looked normal during early development, the pattern of branches on the nerve cells went awry later on. Moreover, the mutant worms lost the swellings that are normally found at the junctions between nerve cells, and they also moved their bodies in an odd way.</p><p>Engineering the mutant worms to produce the PTRN-1 protein in their nerve cells, but nowhere else, restored normal movement, and experiments with fluorescently tagged PTRN-1 proteins revealed that they are found on the microtubules within the nerve cells. Marcette et al. suggest that the microtubules become less stable when this protein is not present, and that this switches on a repair mechanism that remodels the nerve cells, providing that the active form of a protein called DLK-1 is present. Other mutations that reduce the stability of microtubules also triggered the same remodeling process. Future work will be necessary to uncover exactly what triggers the remodeling process, and to identify the other proteins that are involved in repairing the nerve cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01637.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01637.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>PTRN-1</kwd><kwd>microtubule minus-end</kwd><kwd>neuron morphology</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>DLK-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS040094</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nonet</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The minus-ends of microtubules have been implicated as part of a damage sensor to initiate remodeling of nerve cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In animals, stable neuronal morphology is necessary to maintain synaptic architecture. However, morphological alterations are also critical for plastic changes in synaptic strength, pruning of synaptic connections, and occasional responses to injury or other cues. Morphological reorganization of neurons is known to occur as a compensatory mechanism in cases of sight or hearing deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karlen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barone et al., 2013</xref>), and medium spiny neurons are reported to experience reversible morphology changes in response to mild stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bessa et al., 2013</xref>). Neurons in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as well as many mammalian peripheral neurons respond to injuries by remodeling their morphology including the growth of neurites, elimination of existing synapses, and establishment of new synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hilliard, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The study of neuronal remodeling after injury in model organisms has elucidated cellular pathways responsible for morphological changes, however, little is known about the molecular cues that initiate these cascades. The conserved mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase DLK-1 functions to transmit regenerative signals in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, and is a component of regenerative signaling in organisms with more complex nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammarlund et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). While there is a wealth of information about conserved down-stream signals affected by DLK-1 activity, very little information exits about how DLK-1 itself is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tedeschi and Bradke, 2013</xref>). Recently, calcium spikes were shown to activate <italic>C. elegans</italic> DLK-1, but fly and mammalian homologs lack this calcium-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yan and Jin, 2012</xref>). It is known that the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase RPM-1 (PHR, PAM, HIGHWIRE) keeps levels of DLK-1 low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>). Axonal injury is reported to cause microtubule disassembly and disorganization of higher-order microtubule structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Erturk et al., 2007</xref>). Microtubule depolymerization was recently found to activate DLK-1 signaling. However, this study did not investigate in what context (development, regeneration, or degeneration) this microtubule-based mechanism might be functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bounoutas et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Neurons contain both very stable and dynamic microtubule structures. These populations are maintained by the activities of cytoskeletal-associated proteins and by post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conde and Caceres, 2009</xref>). Proteins known to be involved in stabilizing and organizing microtubule structures include molecular motors, and cross-linkers, as well as microtubule nucleating and severing proteins, and proteins involved in regulating plus-end dynamics (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Subramanian and Kapoor, 2012</xref>). Post-translational modifications to microtubules include acetylation, tyrosination, glutamylation, glycylation, and phosphorylation. These modifications affect the recruitment of microtubule-associated proteins and denote subcellular populations of microtubule structures such as the tyrosinated microtubules of dynamic growth cones or the acetylated microtubules of stable neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baas and Black, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Janke and Bulinski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garnham and Roll-Mecak, 2012</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> microtubule acetylation mutants display short microtubules, alterations in microtubule protofilament number, and association of filaments into higher-order structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cueva et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, microtubule de-acetylation was recently shown to be an early signal for the development of growth-cones in neuronal remodeling associated with regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho and Cavalli, 2012</xref>). It is currently unclear how destabilizing modifications or depolymerization of microtubule structures could activate neuronal remodeling. Depolymerization events that occur in dynamic microtubule populations clearly do not cause neurite remodeling in healthy neurons, so it is not likely that depolymerization itself or free microtubule monomers are the remodeling signal.</p><p>One possibility is that the normally stable minus-ends of microtubules initiate remodeling signals. In this study, we report that genetic lesions in <italic>ptrn-1</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of the microtubule minus-end binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated (CAMSAP) family cause neurite remodeling including overextension of neurites and retraction of collateral presynaptic varicosities and branches. These remodeling events require DLK-1, a known player in morphology changes associated with degenerative and regenerative signaling in neurons. This is the first report of a CAMSAP family member being involved in remodeling of neurite morphology. Members of the CAMSAP family are known to associate with microtubule minus ends and stabilize microtubule structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goshima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baines et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). CAMSAPs are found in mammalian neuronal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baines et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>), and genetic variants of human CAMSAP1L1 were recently shown to confer susceptibility to epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus understanding the neuronal consequences of disruptions to CAMSAP function may begin to inform our understanding of disease mechanisms.</p><p>We found that disruptions in <italic>ptrn-1</italic> cause alterations to neuronal morphology, and these changes occur via a DLK-1 neuronal remodeling program. We were able to mimic and enhance <italic>ptrn-1</italic> loss-of-function phenotypes with genetic and pharmacological alterations of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Furthermore, mutation of <italic>dlk-1</italic> suppressed a microtubule acetylation mutant supporting the idea that altering microtubule structures is an upstream signal for DLK-1 activation. PTRN-1 is present in neurites and at sites of synaptic connectivity, suggesting local microtubule minus-end regulation may affect these mechanisms. In addition to identifying a novel function for CAMSAPs in the maintenance of neuron morphology, our results suggest that alterations to microtubule structures caused by loss of CAMSAP function activates a neuronal remodeling program. We propose a model whereby local minus-end microtubule stabilization mediated by CAMSAPs is necessary for the stabilization of mature neurite morphology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAMSAP family homolog <italic>ptrn-1</italic> in a screen for altered neuronal morphology</title><p>We use <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor neurons (TRNs) to study establishment and maintenance of neuronal morphology.

The conserved DLK-1 kinase cascade promotes changes in morphology associated with neurite remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammarlund et al., 2009</xref>), but how this cascade is activated has remained elusive. Our data show that loss of the conserved CAMSAP PTRN-1 induces DLK-mediated remodeling phenotypes. Because CAMSAP family members are known to associate with microtubule minus ends and regulate microtubule structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>), we propose a model where microtubule structures act as upstream sensors to neuronal programs that lead to synapse elimination and growth of neurites.</p><p>How does loss of PTRN-1 initiate neuronal remodeling? PTRN-1 could itself be a part of the machinery that represses the DLK-1 pathway, or it could be acting indirectly through the sequestration of a remodeling sensor. Because we can enhance defects in <italic>ptrn-1</italic> mutants with the microtubule-binding drug colchicine, and mimic Ptrn-1 phenotypes with microtubule acetylation mutants, PTRN-1 is not likely to be the signal itself. We favor a model where perturbations of the microtubule cytoskeleton are responsible for activation of remodeling in <italic>ptrn-1</italic> mutants. Interestingly, recent findings indicate that at cooler temperatures, neuronal microtubules incorporate microtubule monomers that have been stabilized through post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2013</xref>). It is possible that the rescue we see of Ptrn-1 defects by growing animals in cooler temperatures is due to this mechanism; by incorporating cold-stable monomers, microtubule structures may be less sensitive to cytoskeletal alterations caused by <italic>ptrn-1</italic> or acetylation mutants.</p><p>Altered association of microtubule filaments into networks may initiate neurite remodeling rather than disruption of individual microtubules. Separation of microtubule filaments from organized cytoskeletal networks has been reported in experiments that decrease expression of PTRN-1 homologs and in microtubule acetylation mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>). Such alterations would cause the release of factors associated with tethering connections between microtubule filaments, as well as the appearance of free minus ends, either of which could be a signal that a remodeling response is needed.</p><p>In <italic>ptrn-1</italic> mutants, regenerative changes in neuron morphology occurred after developmental patterning of the nervous system. Potential explanations for this observation include that regenerative DLK-1 signaling pathways only become competent to respond to activating cues after development is complete or that the regenerative cue appears later, perhaps because CAMSAPs stabilize microtubule structures present only in mature neurons. One possibility is that CAMSAPs are involved in microtubule-based sequestration of a RPM-1 inhibitor. RPM-1 is known to keep levels of DLK-1 low by targeting it for degradation, and this mechanism must be surmounted in <italic>ptrn-1</italic> mutants that have a functional <italic>rpm-1</italic> gene. Alternatively, if DLK-1 or a DLK-1 activator is being sequestered, then perhaps a build-up of these stores over time overwhelms the ability of RPM-1 to keep DLK-1 levels low.</p><p>Neurites contain overlapping microtubules that must be interconnected to fulfill their known functions in trafficking and morphological integrity. These higher-order cytoskeletal networks must be organized in a way that stabilizes microtubule minus ends, in addition to linking individual microtubules together. The minus-end of microtubules are both known for durability and are distributed at regular intervals throughout neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baas and Black, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurachi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cueva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellanger et al., 2012</xref>). We found PTRN-1 to be distributed in puncta along neurites, and these structures thus represent a potential reservoir for sensors that promote remodeling. Although these results indicate that neuronal CAMSAPs function similarly to epithelial CAMSAPs by stabilizing microtubule networks, additional work will be required to explore the link between <italic>ptrn-1</italic> disruption and specific changes to microtubule-based structures.</p><p>We also found evidence for PTRN-1 function outside of neuronal remodeling pathways, including roles in neurite polarity and in sculpting the shape of synapses. The appearance of ALM posterior neurites, seen in <italic>ptrn-1</italic> mutants, is thought to be a neuron polarity defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hilliard and Bargmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirszenblat et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Prasad and Clark, 2006</xref>), and the cell body puncta seen in animals expressing PTRN-1:mcherry may be microtubule organizing centers necessary for polarized neurite outgrowth. However, the composition of ectopic ALM posterior neurites is incompletely understood. These extensions are reported to occur due to hyper-stabilization of microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirszenblat et al., 2013</xref>), but also appear in mutants where microtubules and cytoskeletal networks are disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>).

CAMSAPs mediate connections between microtubule minus ends and adhesion proteins at epithelial adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meng et al., 2008</xref>), and the synaptic-localized CAMSAPs we observed may play a similar bridging role at synaptic adhesion sites.</p><p>Our data represent the first characterization of CAMSAP function in an intact animal. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we detected CAMSAP expression primarily in neurons. Mammalian CAMSAPs have also been found in neuronal tissue, and CAMSAP1L1 is a genetic trait locus for epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guo et al., 2012</xref>). Abnormal neuronal patterning and seizure-induced morphological remodeling are both thought to contribute to continuing seizures and the development of epilepsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">O’Dell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao and Overstreet-Wadiche, 2008</xref>). We found that mutations in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CAMSAP homolog, <italic>ptrn-1</italic> initiate remodeling programs that cause aberrant extension and morphological re-patterning of neurites. Our data indicate that cytoskeletal-based activation of regenerative programs may exist in the absence of external injury signals. We speculate that without the stabilizing function of CAMSAP proteins, neuronal remodeling may be more likely to occur, a phenomenon we observed in <italic>C. elegans ptrn-1</italic> mutants. We further speculate that the function of CAMSAPs in maintenance of neuronal morphology may be responsible for the association of CAMSAP1L1 with epilepsy.</p><p>This work represents the first evidence of a role for microtubule minus-ends in neuron remodeling pathways. It identifies CAMSAPs as regulators of neuronal morphology, positions both CAMSAPs and microtubule structures as early regulators of neuronal-remodeling programs, and suggests that CAMSAPS regulate microtubule organization in neurons. Additionally, we found evidence for CAMSAP function in establishing neuron polarity and stabilizing the morphology of the synapse. Future work will be necessary to uncover the specific nature of the regenerative signal activating DLK-1 pathways, and to identify the CAMSAP-interacting proteins that function in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and genetics</title><p>Strains were maintained at 22°C, unless otherwise specified, on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) agar plates spotted with OP50 <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenner, 1974</xref>).

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “The <italic>C. elegans</italic> microtubule minus-end binding homolog PTRN-1 stabilizes synapses and neurites” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a member of our Board of Reviewing editors, and three reviewers.</p><p>The prevailing view is that the findings described in your paper are potentially interesting, but a number of significant concerns have been raised that we ask you to address in a revised version of the manuscript:</p><p>1) The Introduction states that “we report that genetic lesions in <italic>ptrn-1</italic>…require <italic>dlk-1</italic> for regenerative morphological changes in neurons.” Similar statements about regeneration are scattered throughout the manuscript. This paper doesn't contain any data on regeneration at all. This sentence, and others like it that discuss regeneration, should be rewritten to focus on maintenance. <italic>dlk-1</italic> has multiple functions in neurons-in regeneration, degeneration, synapses, etc. The emphasis on regeneration seems misplaced.</p><p>2) A strength of this work is that patronin was identified in a forward screen. This could provide important context about the landscape of genes that have similar phenotypes (if any). But the screen is not well described. It would be very helpful to know how many genomes were screened, how many genes were found, and what their identity is if known.</p><p>3) mCherry is reported to be prone to aggregation. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> mCherry puncta can be observed. The basal level of mCherry puncta makes it difficult to interpret the puncta that are observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>. These latter figures appear to have much higher protein expression, much higher exposure, or both. Perhaps this accounts for the puncta? Also, it is stated that the fusion protein is “functional”-does this mean it rescues the mutant when expressed at reasonable levels? These data should be shown. Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is confusing for a separate reason-the mCherry appears to be localized to cell nuclei, but this is not stated in the legend or the Methods.</p><p>4) Patronin clearly functions in maintenance, but it also seems to function in development according to the data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, about a third of the collateral branch defects are developmental. This developmental role should be addressed in the manuscript.</p><p>5) The phenotype for patronin mutants in collateral branches is 60% wild type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, but 13% wild type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>. This is a really big difference, despite a fairly high sample size. What might account for this?</p><p>6) The interpretation of the cholchicine experiment is incomplete. It is possible that the increased sensitivity of patronon mutants to the drug is because their microtubules are perturbed, as the manuscript suggests. But it is also possible, for example, that patronin mutants are more sensitive to sub-threshold amounts of perturbation. The acetylation experiments seek to link microtubule stability to <italic>dlk-1</italic>, but don't address patronin. Unless a direct experiment is done to link patronin to microtubule stability, this section needs to be revised.</p><p>7) The presentation of phenotypic data is often problematic. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows a bar graph depicting ‘individuals with PLM overextension (%)’. There are two PLMs per animal, so it is typical and preferred to report the penetrance based on scoring cells (percentage of affected PLMs) rather than scoring individuals with PLM defects. How is an animal with two defective PLMs scored compared to only one? The ‘individual’ method inflates the penetrance if most animals have only one defective PLM and makes it impossible to compare strains if the distribution of mutant PLMs is different. In particular, the penetrance of D-type motor neuron defects (6 DD + 13 VD) is likely much lower on a cell basis compared to an ‘individual’ basis. It would also be helpful for a broader audience to label the ALM, PVM and PLM neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>8) The error bars on graphs depicting percentages of phenotypes are stated to represent standard deviation. It is unclear why a standard deviation is shown or how it was even calculated. For this type of data, the standard error of proportion would seem appropriate or a chi square analysis could be done to compare the penetrance of different strains. In particular, it is worth determining whether PTRN-1 and RPM-1 act in the same or separate pathways by comparing the penetrance of single and double mutants. However, it is unclear whether a sufficient number of animals were scored to determine whether the penetrance is different between the singles and double. In most cases, the samples sizes appear small, in part, because the n values are based on animals rather than cells.</p><p>9) It is difficult to see the details in many of the images. In particular, the quality of the images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is poor. It seems that maybe a NLS-GFP was used for the <italic>ptrn-1</italic> expression experiments; it is not hard to say whether it is nuclear or cytoplasmic. It would be nice to show that the PTRN-1-GFP puncta colocalize with MTs.</p><p>10) There are several typos and grammatical errors (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>: individuals with defects is stated on both graphs, ‘Data’ is plural not singular). The authors often do not use proper <italic>C. elegans</italic> nomenclature, e.g., Ptrn-1 phenotypes instead of <italic>ptrn-1</italic> for gene and PTRN-1 for protein. There are many awkward or confusing phrases, e.g., Because the effects of colchicine treatment were additive in combination with <italic>ptrn-1</italic> mutants… The authors should contact the curators of wormbase to update the annotation of <italic>ptrn-1</italic>. At present, their <italic>ptrn-1b</italic> gene structure differs from wormbase version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01637.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The Introduction states that “we report that genetic lesions in</italic> ptrn-1<italic>...require</italic> dlk-1 <italic>for regenerative morphological changes in neurons.” Similar statements about regeneration are scattered throughout the manuscript. This paper doesn't contain any data on regeneration at all.

Since we have not used a regeneration paradigm, we have refocused the text on neurite remodeling.</p><p><italic>2) A strength of this work is that patronin was identified in a forward screen. This could provide important context about the landscape of genes that have similar phenotypes (if any). But the screen is not well described. It would be very helpful to know how many genomes were screened, how many genes were found, and what their identity is if known</italic>.</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to include additional information describing the screen, as requested. In short, we found four candidates in a screen of 1134 haploid genomes. The other three mutants identified in the screen remain uncharacterized.</p><p><italic>3) mCherry is reported to be prone to aggregation. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>mCherry puncta can be observed. The basal level of mCherry puncta makes it difficult to interpret the puncta that are observed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3E-H</italic></xref><italic>. These latter figures appear to have much higher protein expression, much higher exposure, or both. Perhaps this accounts for the puncta? Also, it is stated that the fusion protein is “functional”-does this mean it rescues the mutant when expressed at reasonable levels? These data should be shown. Finally,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref> <italic>is confusing for a separate reason-the mCherry appears to be localized to cell nuclei, but this is not stated in the legend or the Methods</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers found the presentation of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> confusing. To clarify we have split the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> into the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3 and 4</xref>, and additional images have been added to both figures.

To address concerns that puncta result from aggregation of mCherry, we added new images that use the <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter to drive expression of a GFP-PTRN-1 N-terminal fusion protein (4D-4G).

This developmental role should be addressed in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (formerly 4B) shows that a fraction of collateral branch defects occur prior to the L1 time-point.

The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (formerly <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is now analyzed by cell rather than by animal (as requested in reviewer comment 5), and the potential developmental role for <italic>ptrn-1</italic> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (formerly 4B) has been discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) The phenotype for patronin mutants in collateral branches is 60% wild type in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref><italic>, but 13% wild type in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>. This is a really big difference, despite a fairly high sample size. What might account for this</italic>?</p><p>Several factors could account for the difference in collateral branching between the two figures.

To address these concerns, we recollected the data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (currently <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), using a temperature of 22°C. The current <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> (formerly 4) &amp; 6 (formerly 5) are now displayed by cell rather than by animal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> (formerly 4B) now shows 79% wild type collateral branches and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> (formerly 5A) shows 63% wild-type branches.

It is possible that the increased sensitivity of patronon mutants to the drug is because their microtubules are perturbed, as the manuscript suggests.

While we agree with the reviewer comment that penetrance of D-type motor neuron defects would be lower on a by-cell basis compared to an individual basis, we included the quantification of these defects as a figure supplement because our purpose in analyzing motor neurons is to report that we do find defects in other neurons (aside from mechanosensory neurons that represent the core of our analysis).

On Jan 13, 2014, the Wormbase annotation is different and now includes both <italic>ptrn-1</italic> isoforms we have documented, but still includes two questionable isoforms. We have made Wormbase aware of the errors and now provide the sequence of the two isoforms as supplemental data. We would be happy to submit these to Genbank if <italic>eLife</italic> requests, but given the RNA-seq data in Wormbase, these forms can be deduced easily from RNA-seq and EST data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
