encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here, we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD<sup>+</sup> level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Iron is an essential nutrient for almost all living organisms. For example, iron contributes to the replication of DNA, the generation of energy inside cells, and the transport of oxygen around the body. Iron deficiency is the most common of all nutrient deficiencies, affecting over 40% of children worldwide. This can lead to anemia and also impair how the brain and nervous system develop, potentially resulting in long-lasting cognitive damage, even after the deficiency has been treated.</p><p>It is poorly understood how iron contributes to the development of the brain and nervous system. In particular, whether and how it supports nerve stem cells (or NSCs for short) which give rise to the various neural types in the mature brain.</p><p>To investigate, Ma et al. experimentally reduced the levels of ferritin (a protein which stores iron) in the developing brains of fruit fly larvae. This reduction in ferritin led to lower numbers of NSCs and a smaller brain. Unexpectedly, this effect was largest when ferritin levels were reduced in glial cells which support and send signals to NSCs, rather than in the stem cells themselves.</p><p>Ma et al. then used fluorescence microscopy to confirm that glial cells make and contain a lot of ferritin which can be transported to NSCs. Adding iron supplements to the diet of flies lacking ferritin did not lead to normal numbers of stem cells in the brains of the developing fruit flies, whereas adding compounds that reduce the amount of iron led to lower numbers of stem cells. Together, this suggests that ferritin transports iron from glial cells to the NSCs<bold>.</bold> Without ferritin and iron, the NSCs could not produce enough energy to divide and make new stem cells. This caused the NSCs to lose the characteristics of stem cells and prematurely turn into other types of neurons or glial cells.</p><p>Together, these findings show that when iron cannot move from glial cells to NSCs this leads to defects in brain development. Future experiments will have to test whether a similar transport of iron from supporting cells to NSCs also occurs in the developing brains of mammals, and whether this mechanism applies to stem cells in other parts of the body.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glia</kwd><kwd>neural stem cells</kwd><kwd>ferritin</kwd><kwd>iron homeostasis</kwd><kwd>self-renewal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32100784</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rui</surname><given-names>Menglong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970675</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Su</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Iron content in neural stem cells controlled by glial ferritin is critical for self-renewal and proliferation of neural stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) possess the remarkable ability to self-renew for maintaining their identity and differentiate into diverse neural cell types required for neurogenesis during brain development. The self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation of NSCs are regulated by both intrinsic programs inside stem cells and extrinsic cues from the surrounding niches. The mammalian NSC niche found in the neurogenic regions is composed of diverse cell types including choroid plexus, vascular endothelia cells, pericytes, microglia, and meninges, which regulate NSC behaviors such as proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bjornsson et al., 2015</xref>). The diversity and complexity of these cell populations confer niche the ability to integrate local and systemic signals, but make it complicated to study the interaction between niches and NSCs in mammals, which is a critical issue in understanding neurogenesis and improving clinical applications of NSCs.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larval central nervous system (CNS), composed of the central brain (CB), optic lobe (OL), and ventral nerve cord (VNC), is a simple but sophisticated model to decipher the regulatory mechanisms underlying NSC behaviors mediated by niche signals. In this system, <italic>Drosophila</italic> NSCs, called NBs, and their progenies are encased by a variety of glial cells including perineurial glia, subperineurial glia, cortex glia, astrocyte-like glia and ensheathing glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartenstein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pereanu et al., 2005</xref>). These glial cells not only form the physical support structure for NBs, but also provide extrinsic cues that regulate NB reactivation, survival, and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Read, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spéder and Brand, 2014</xref>). However, it remains elusive whether the glial-cell-forming niche is involved in the regulation of the prominent characteristics of NBs, self-renewal, and differentiation.</p><p>Iron is a vital micronutrient for almost all living organisms since it participates in many crucial biological processes, including mitochondrial electron transport and cellular respiration that both support ATP production used for most cellular activities. High levels of iron are found in many organs including the brain, where iron is required for myelination and formation of neuronal dendritic trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lozoff et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Möller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rice and Barone, 2000</xref>). Iron deficiency in infants and early childhood has been well-documented to be associated with long-term cognitive, social, and emotional problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fretham et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is intriguing to investigate whether iron is also required in NSCs during neurogenesis.</p><p>Ferritin, a ubiquitous protein present in most organisms, is composed of 24 subunits that assemble into a hollow-sphere complex capable of storing up to 4500 iron atoms in a bioavailable form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knovich et al., 2009</xref>). Ferritin in both mammals and insects is a heteropolymer, consisting of heavy and light chain homolog subunits. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these subunits are encoded by <italic>ferritin 1 heavy chain homolog</italic> (<italic>Fer1HCH</italic>) and <italic>ferritin 2 light chain homolog</italic> (<italic>Fer2LCH</italic>), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arosio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pham and Winzerling, 2010</xref>), which both contain secretion signal peptides that direct them to the ER during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lind et al., 1998</xref>). Consequently, <italic>Drosophila</italic> ferritin is confined to the secretory pathway and abundant in the hemolymph (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nichol et al., 2002</xref>). Ferritin or iron manipulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> glia regulates the adult behavior, such as locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kosmidis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navarro et al., 2015</xref>). Previous researches have shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ferritin not only directly participates in dietary iron absorption by removing iron from enterocytes across the basolateral membrane, but competes with transferrin to deliver iron between the gut and the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang and Zhou, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>). These findings underscore the pivotal role of ferritin in iron transport. Interestingly, iron-loaded ferritin, serving as an essential mitogen, promotes proliferation of cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li, 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is tempting to investigate whether ferritin is required for self-renewal and the proliferation of NSCs during brain development.</p><p>Here, we show that glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to form iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters, which is necessary for the production of ATP, providing the energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs, highlighting ferritin as a potential target for suppressing tumor.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glial ferritin is required for NB maintenance and proliferation</title><p>To identify new niche factors involved in the balance between NB self-renewal and differentiation, we used <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> to perform an RNAi-mediated screen in glial cells. <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> and <italic>Fer2LCH</italic>, two ferritin subunit encoding genes, were identified to be essential for NB maintenance and brain development.

To further assess the impact on NB proliferation, we employed the mitotic marker phosphohistone H3 (PH3) and the thymidine analogue 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU), revealing a substantial decrease in the proliferation rate of NBs upon glial ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).

Western blot analysis of larval brain protein extract using polyclonal antibodies against Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH further confirmed that both subunits were down-regulated in glial knockdown of either subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>), consistent with previous research in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Missirlis et al., 2007</xref>).

Interestingly, only glial knockdown of ferritin-related genes led to NB loss and defective brain development. It appears that ferritin generated in glial cells is the only crucial protein for regulating the behavior of NBs and, ultimately, the larval brain development. To recapitulate the endogenous ferritin expression pattern, we took advantage of a Fer1HCH/Fer2LCH enhancer trapped GAL4 line to drive a variant of DsRed protein with a nuclear localization signal (DsRed Stinger). Surprisingly, our immunostaining experiments revealed that most, if not all, DsRed was co-localized with the glia nuclear protein Repo, instead of the NB nuclear protein Dpn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and A’</xref>). We also used another Fer2LCH enhancer trapped GAL4 line to verify this result, which was consistent with the above result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To investigate whether the ferritin was transported from glia to NBs via the vesicular transport, we expressed a temperature-sensitive dominant-negative Shibire dynamin protein (shi<sup>ts</sup>) to block vesicle trafficking from glial cells, and found that Fer1HCH::GFP accumulated in glia, accompanying with significantly diminished Fer1HCH signal in NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, D’ and E</xref>), suggesting glial ferritin secretes into NBs through vesicle system.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Glial ferritin defects lead to iron deficiency in NBs</title><p>Given that ferritin is required for iron storage as well as delivery, glial ferritin knockdown might increase the free iron level, leading to glial iron overload. Alternatively, it will block the iron transport from glia to NBs, resulting in NB iron deficiency. To determine the underlying cause of the brain development defects observed upon glial ferritin knockdown, we used iron chelator or iron salt ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) to manipulate iron intake and detect how it will influence NBs. We observed that depriving iron intake by adding iron chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium (BPS) to the food led to a dramatic decrease in the number and proliferation rate of NBs, compared to control larvae on normal food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To investigate the effect of feeding behavior in different foods, we tested the feeding behavior of flies by incorporating 1% Brilliant Blue (sigma, 861146) into different foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanimura et al., 1982</xref>) and found the amount of dye in the fly body was similar between normal group and BPS group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which suggested that BPS almost did not affect the feeding behavior. In line with this result, blocking iron absorption by knocking down intestinal ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang and Zhou, 2013</xref>) resulted in the similar defects of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). However, supplementing the diet with FAC did not induce any observable defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also tested another iron chelator deferiprone (DFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Soriano et al., 2013</xref>), and found that DFP alone did not cause any brain defects in wild-type (WT) larvae, but it significantly exacerbated the effect of glial ferritin knockdown on defective NB maintenance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Furthermore, we attempted to rescue the brain defects observed in glial ferritin knockdown by providing dietary FAC, but the effect was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). This may be due to the possibility that the knockdown of glial ferritin largely, if not completely, prevented the transport of iron from glia to NBs, which hindered the additional iron from entering NBs.

Specifically, the knockdown of <italic>Zip13</italic> leads to failure of iron loading in secretory vesicles and consequently defective iron efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xiao et al., 2014</xref>). To investigate whether the NB loss phenotype of glial ferritin knockdown is caused by defective iron transport, we next sought to identify the role of Zip13 in the larval brain. First, we examined the expression pattern of Zip13 and found that, similar to ferritin, the DsRed stinger driven by <italic>Zip13-GAL4</italic> was co-localized with Repo in glial cells rather than Dpn in NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and D’</xref>). Subsequently, we knocked down <italic>Zip13</italic> in glial cells and observed a similar but weaker phenotype with a slightly reduced NB number and proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). Consistently, the defective brain development was confirmed in the <italic>Zip13</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Moreover, the effect of double knockdown of both <italic>Zip13</italic> and <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> was much more severe than that of either single knockdown, with a significant reduction in NB number and proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). Furthermore, we found that the reduced proliferation rate caused by <italic>Zip13</italic> knockdown could be partially rescued by iron supplementation in the food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that glial ferritin collaborates with Zip13 to deliver iron from glia to NBs.</p><p>Since previous studies have demonstrated the essential role of glial cells in NB survival and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Read, 2018</xref>), it is possible that iron overload in glial cells up-regulated the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to apoptosis of glial cells, which ultimately resulted in the loss of NBs. To rule out this possibility, firstly, we examined the ROS level of glial ferritin knockdown via a transgenic reporter GstD-GFP for oxidative stress signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008</xref>). GstD1 is a prototypical oxidative stress response gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sawicki et al., 2003</xref>). We found an obvious increase as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). However, overexpressing anti-oxidant genes in glial cells or NBs did not restore the NB number and proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). ROS accumulation leads to lipid peroxidation, which in turn results in ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirschhorn and Stockwell, 2019</xref>). Mitochondria in cells undergoing ferroptosis typically exhibit a characteristic shrinkage and damage, while the nuclei remain structurally intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mumbauer et al., 2019</xref>). In order to investigate whether the NB loss is due to ferroptosis, we examined the mitochondrial morphology using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). However, our result showed that the mitochondrial double membrane and cristae were clearly visible whether in the control group or glial ferritin knockdown group, which suggested that ferroptosis was not the main cause of NB loss upon glial ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>). In addition, we investigated the level of 4-HNE that indicates lipid peroxidation, the other hallmark of ferroptosis. This result showed that the 4-HNE level did not change significantly after ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>), suggesting that lipid peroxidation was stable, which supported the exclusion of the ferroptosis in glial ferritin knockdown. Taken with the findings from iron chelator feeding together, we conclude that NB loss resulting from glial ferritin knockdown is not a consequence of ferroptosis. Second, we examined the apoptosis in larval brain cells via Caspase-3 or TUNEL staining, and found the apoptotic signal remained unchanged after glial ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Furthermore, we overexpressed the baculovirus protein P35 to inhibit apoptosis in glial cells, but failed to restore the lost NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Given that glial morphology is important for NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Spéder and Brand, 2018</xref>), we used GFP driven by <italic>repo-GAL4</italic> to denote glia cells and found that the glial chamber was almost intact after glial ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3F</xref>). Together, we conclude that it is iron deficiency in NBs, rather than iron overload in glial cells, that leads to NB loss induced by ferritin defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Glial ferritin defects result in impaired Fe-S cluster activity and ATP production</title><p>To further prove that defective iron transport leads to the iron deficiency in NBs, we examined the iron availability by measuring aconitase activity in the brain. The activity of aconitase is sensitive to the level of Fe-S synthesis, so it can serve as an indicator of the availability of iron in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haile et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tong and Rouault, 2006</xref>). Aconitase activity is determined in a coupled enzyme reaction in which citrate is converted to isocitrate by aconitase (Aconitase Activity Assay Kit, sigma, MAK051). As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, aconitase activity of ferritin knockdown diminished significantly, indicating that the availability of iron in the brain was reduced. This result also implies the Fe-S clusters in NBs are probably deficient when knocking down ferritin in glia. Fe-S clusters are essential to activate the aconitase that converts citrate into isocitrate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) in mitochondria, and are one type of critical electron carrier for electron transport chain (ETC), especially for the Complex I, II and III function. Considering that the TCA cycle and ETC are critical biological processes for ATP production, we proposed that the knockdown of glial ferritin might lead to ATP deficiency due to the block of the TCA cycle and ETC, which resulted in the failure of maintaining NBs and their proliferation. To verify this hypothesis, we first assessed the function of Fe-S clusters in NBs by knocking down mitochondrial Fe-S protein Nfs1 and the components of the cytosolic iron-sulfur protein assembly (CIA) complex. After knocking down <italic>Nfs1</italic> and the CIA component <italic>CG17683</italic>, <italic>galla2</italic>, and <italic>ciao1</italic> in NBs respectively, the proliferation level of NBs decreased significantly and brain size became smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>), which phenocopied the knockdown of <italic>Fer1HCH</italic> or <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> in glia.

Given that iron deficiency in NBs probably leads to the defects of energy production and biosynthesis, we performed gene enrichment analysis in these genes based on Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). GO term analysis showed that mitochondrial organization, translation, transport, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and ETC were enriched in the Biological Processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), indicating NB mitochondrial functions including OxPhos and ETC were abnormal after glial ferritin knockdown. Moreover, NADH dehydrogenase and ribosome-related terms were also enriched whether in the Cellular Component or Molecular Function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that NADH dehydrogenase and biosynthesis were defective. Further, we validated the enriched term associated with mitochondrial function by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). And the enriched KEGG pathways included OxPhos and ribosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), aligning with the GO enrichment results and supporting the hypothesis that glial ferritin knockdown disrupted mitochondrial function including OxPhos and ETC as well as further biosynthesis.</p><p>To confirm whether the function of NADH dehydrogenase was disrupted, we used the SoNar that could bind to NAD<sup>+</sup> with a specific conformation and excitatory wavelength to monitor the NAD<sup>+</sup> level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). SoNar was driven by the <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> to indicate the NAD<sup>+</sup> level in NBs. Considering the possibility of protein accumulation in NBs due to the lower proliferation rate in the glial ferritin knockdown group, the signal of SoNar was normalized to DsRed Stinger driven by <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic>. We observed significantly declined SoNar/DsRed after knocking down <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H and I</xref>), suggesting the normalized level of NAD<sup>+</sup> in NBs was decreased, which supports the conclusion that the activity of NADH dehydrogenase was declined. To further verify the change in energy production, we utilized the ATP Determination Kit which offers a convenient bioluminescence assay for the quantitative determination of ATP with recombinant firefly luciferase and its substrate D-luciferin. We found that ATP level decreased significantly after glial ferritin knockdown when compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Therefore, we tried to supply the energy for NBs by restoring bioenergy-dependent NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism. To validate this, we first determined the ATP production after overexpressing Ndi1 in NBs upon glial <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> knockdown. The data suggested that expression of Ndi1 can restore ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

The result showed that NB proliferation decreased significantly, but NB number declined slightly at the second-instar larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), suggesting that brain defect of glial ferritin knockdown manifests at the second-instar larval stage.</p><p>As mentioned before, we did not detect any apoptotic signal in the larval brain after glial ferritin knockdown, suggesting that there is no association between apoptosis and NB loss. The double binary systems, lexA/lexAop, and GAL4/UAS, were employed to further exclude the possibility of apoptosis. We overexpressed P35 in NBs by <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> and knocked down ferritin by <italic>repo-lexA</italic>, which failed to restore the decreased number of NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These results reinforce the notion that NB loss occurs independently of the apoptotic pathway.</p><p>Next, we hypothesized that the NB loss might be attributed to nuclear-Prospero (Pros)-dependent premature differentiation of NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choksi et al., 2006</xref>). Pros in NB nuclear was hardly detected in third-instar WT larvae, but was increased significantly with glial ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). To further verify that the NB loss caused by glial ferritin knockdown was due to nuclear-Pros-dependent premature differentiation, we used the <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> to drive <italic>UAS-pros-RNAi</italic> in order to prevent the NB loss in glial ferritin knockdown background. We found that the NB number was substantially restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>). Interestingly, despite of dramatic NB number increase, the decreased proliferation rate was not rescued. We proposed that <italic>pros</italic> knockdown in NBs blocked premature terminal differentiation, but it could not replenish the reduced energy caused by glial ferritin knockdown. As NB self-renewal and proliferation are both energy-consuming processes, the self-renewal was rescued via inhibiting differentiation by <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> driving <italic>UAS-pros-RNAi</italic>, but at the expense of energy consumption for proliferation, leaving the proliferation rate unchanged, or even lower. Together, we conclude that glial ferritin maintains the number of NBs by preventing the nuclear-Pros-dependent premature differentiation.</p><p>Furthermore, we also investigated whether overexpression of Ndi1 could restore Pros localization in NBs. This result showed that overexpressing Ndi1 could significantly restore Pros localization in NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), which supported that energy shortage induced the entry of Pros into nuclei, leading to the premature differentiation of NBs.</p><p>Considering that asymmetric division defects in NBs may lead to premature differentiation, we also explored the asymmetric division by staining the classical asymmetric marker aPKC and found it displayed a crescent at the apical cortex based on the daughter cell position whether in control or glial ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This result indicated that there was no obvious asymmetric defect after glial ferritin knockdown.</p><p>Given that reduced proliferation is a distinctive characteristic of quiescent NBs, we tried to determine whether NBs were in a quiescent state after glial ferritin knockdown by examining the other two key features associated with quiescent NBs: decreased cell size and the formation of the extended cellular protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ly et al., 2019</xref>). However, we found that the NB size remained at the same level as the control, and the extended cellular protrusion was not observed after glial ferritin knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Furthermore, since insulin signaling is necessary and sufficient to reactivate NBs from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>), we tried to overexpress a constitutively active form of InR (InR<sup>act</sup>) in NBs to promote reactivation at the background of glial ferritin knockdown. However, InR<sup>act</sup> overexpression failed to ameliorate the NB abnormalities including the decreased proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>).

The addition of BPS into dietary food significantly reduced the tumor size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), suggesting that iron is required for tumor development in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain. Considering the conservation of iron’s fundamental function as an essential nutrient for cell growth and proliferation, we thus tried to suppress brain tumors in mice via iron deficiency. Initially, we constructed an orthotopic glioma model in C57BL/6 J mice. One week after inoculation of glioma cells (GL261-luc), the iron chelator DFP was intraperitoneally injected every two days based on the murine weight until being dissected on days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. Histological examination with HE staining revealed that the size of glioma in mice, injected with DFP, decreased significantly on days 14 and 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). Since glioma cells GL261-luc carry the luciferase gene, we injected the substrate luciferin potassium salt into the tumor-bearing mice and detected the bioluminescence signal of mouse gliomas using IVIS Spectrum. This result showed that the bioluminescence signal of glioma in mice with the injection of 10 mg/ml DFP was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). The above results suggested that iron deficiency induced by DFP could suppress glioma in mice effectively. Furthermore, we assessed the survival time of the tumor-bearing mice with DFP or saline injection and found that 10 mg/ml DFP injection could significantly prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Altogether, blocking iron in the tumor is a potential therapy for tumor suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Glial ferritin level is regulated by NBs</title><p>The aforementioned results have highlighted the significant role of glial ferritin in controlling NB number and proliferation. We next wondered whether NBs could provide feedback to regulate glial ferritin levels. To answer this question, we analyzed ferritin levels after altering NB proliferation.

Conversely, highly proliferative NBs, able to form tumors, induced significantly increased levels of the ferritin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>).

Glial ferritin coordinates Zip13 to provide iron for NBs. Once ferritin in glia is defective, NBs proliferate much slower and differentiate prematurely, implying that iron is a necessary metallic element for NBs. Iron participates in the synthesis of Fe-S clusters which activate aconitase required for TCA and facilitate electron-transfer processes involved in OxPhos. Since TCA and OxPhos are essential steps of ATP production, glial ferritin supplies iron into NBs to ensure energy production for maintaining NBs and their proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>NSCs and glial niche</title><p>Previous literatures have reported how the glial niche regulates NB reactivation, proliferation, and survival. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) glia secretes dILP2 and dILP6 that bind on the InR of NBs, which switches on Insulin signaling to reactivate NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Spéder and Brand, 2014</xref>). In addition, Pvr (PDGFR ortholog) signaling in cortex glia sustains NB survival and proliferation in a PI3K-DE-cadherin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Read, 2018</xref>). However, it is unknown whether the glial niche is required for maintaining the self-renewal of NBs. In this study, we demonstrate that the glial niche maintains the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs through supplying the necessary microelement iron into NBs for enough energy production, which implies that mammalian glia likewise provide critical microelement for maintaining NSC function. Oligodendrocytes have been reported to secret ferritin to protect neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>), however, it remains unknown whether the ferritin secretion is employed by oligodendrocytes to regulate NSCs. Astrocytes regulate NSC proliferation via secreting growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shetty et al., 2005</xref>), but it is unclear whether ferritin from astrocytes regulates NSC proliferation and other NSC behaviors, such as self-renewal and differentiation. Based on our findings, it is feasible to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs indirectly through niche cells, which would help to reduce the risk of directly manipulating NSCs to treat neural diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ferritin and iron</title><p>Our results show that ferritin generated outside the brain was not detected in the CNS and vice versa (data not shown), suggesting ferritin can hardly cross the BBB glia, possibly because ferritin is too large to permeate. In this way, BBB glia separates the labile systemic iron from local iron inside the brain to guarantee the normal brain development, as the neural cells, including NBs, require a stable iron level for continuous energy generation during neurogenesis.</p><p>Although the dominant function of ferritin is iron storage in mammals, increasing evidences suggest that ferritin also can transport iron. H-ferritin expression in astrocytes is necessary for proper oligodendrocyte development and myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheli et al., 2021</xref>), which implies H-ferritin probably transports iron from astrocytes to oligodendrocytes for myelination. In mice, ferritin heavy chain is secreted by oligodendrocytes via extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>), which possibly endows ferritin with the function of iron transport. Consistently, previous results showed that ferritin can deliver iron across the cultured BBB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2007</xref>).

Future studies would be interesting to investigate whether ferritin is able to transport iron in the mammalian brain.</p><p>Ferritin specifically targets on the tumor cells, which has been applied to tumor visualization and targeted drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2018</xref>). Our study shows that the block of ferritin or iron can inhibit tumors effectively, which offers an explanation that ferritin targets on the tumor is to transport iron for maintaining the cell proliferation, highlighting a potential target for tumor suppression. In consideration of the role of ferritin in normal tissue, such as antioxidant defense function for neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mukherjee et al., 2020</xref>), the entire block of ferritin for suppressing tumor probably brings neurological disorders. Therefore, we should target on ferritin specifically in tumors to suppress tumor growth.</p><p>Iron is an essential component for Fe-S clusters which participate in TCA and OxPhos, providing energy required for self-renewal and proliferation of NBs.

However, another research observed that OxPhos is dispensable in type II NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnay et al., 2020</xref>).

Therefore, the iron required by NBs is mainly stored in the ferritin of glial cells and allocated as needed.

Furthermore, glial cells can subsequently clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2015</xref>), ensuring normal NB function during neural development.

In this case, Drosophila Neuroblasts are used as models. Authors find that neuronal iron metabolism modulated by glial ferritin is an essential element for Neuroblast proliferation and differentiation. They show that loss of glial ferritin is sufficient to impact the number of neuroblasts. Remarkably, authors have identified that ferritin produced in the glia is secreted to be used as an iron source by the neurons. Therefore iron defects in glia have serious consequences in neuroblasts and likely vice versa. Interestingly, preventing iron absorption in the intestine is sufficient to reduce NB number.

The loss of ferritin in the gut and iron chelators enhancing the NB phenotype are used as evidence that glia provide iron to NB to support their number and proliferation. Since the loss of NB is a phenotype that could result from many possible underlying causes (including low nutrition), this specific conclusion is one of many possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>We have investigated the feeding behavior of fly by Brilliant Blue (sigma, 861146)[1]. Our result showed that the amount of dye in the fly body were similar between control group and BPS group, suggesting that BPS almost did not affect the feeding behavior (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</p><p>There was a gap between the Pros nuclear localization and downstream targets of ferritin, particularly NADH dehydrogenase and biosynthesis. Could overexpression of Ndi1 restore Pros localization in NBs?</p></disp-quote><p>Ferritin defect downregulates iron level, which leads to cell cycle arrest of NBs via ATP shortage. And cell cycle arrest of NBs probably results in NB differentiation[2, 3]. We have added the experiment in Figure 5—figure supplement 2. This result showed that overexpression of Ndi1 could significantly restore Pros localization in NBs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The abstract requires revision to cover the major findings of the manuscript, particularly the second half.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the abstract to add more major findings of the manuscript in the second half as follows:</p><p>“Abstract</p><p>Stem cell niche is critical for regulating the behavior of stem cells. Drosophila neural stem cells (Neuroblasts, NBs) are encased by glial niche cells closely, but it still remains unclear whether glial niche cells can regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Here we show that ferritin produced by glia, cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for the energy production, which is essential to the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. The knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconitase activity and NAD+ level, which leads to the low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. More importantly, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable to maintain the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 2B Mira appeared to be nuclear in NBs, which is inconsistent with its normal localization. Was it Dpn by mistake?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 2B, we confirmed that it is Mira. Moreover, we also provide a magnified picture in Figure 2B’, showing that the Mira mainly localizes to the cortex or in the cytoplasm as previously reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C, Fer1HCH-GFP/mCherry localization was non-uniform in the NBs revealing 1-2 regions devoid of protein localization potentially corresponding to the nucleus and Mira crescent enrichment. It is important to co-label the nucleus in these cells and discuss the intracellular localization pattern of Ferritin.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the picture with nuclear marker DAPI in Figure 2C. The result showed that Fer1HCH-GFP/Fer2LCH-mCherry was not co-localized with DAPI, which indicated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> ferritin predominantly distributes in the cytosol[4, 5]. As for the concern mentioned by this reviewer, GFP/mCherry signal in NBs was from glial overexpressed ferritin, which probably resulted in non-uniform signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3-figure supplement 3F, glial cells in Fer1HCH RNAi appeared to be smaller in size. This should be quantified. Given the significance of ferritin in cortex glial cells, examining the morphology of cortex glial cells is essential.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 3F, we did not label single glial cells so it was difficult to determine whether the size was changed. However, it seems that the chamber formed by the cellular processes of glial cells becomes smaller in <italic>Fer1HCH RNAi</italic>. The glial chamber will undergo remodeling during neurogenesis, which responses to NB signal to enclose the NB and its progeny[6]. Thus, the size of glial chamber is regulated by NB lineage size. In our study, ferritin defect leads to the low proliferation, inducing the smaller lineage of each NB, which likely makes the chamber smaller.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors showed that the reduced NB number was not due to apoptosis, a time-course experiment for glial ferritin KD is recommended to identify the earliest stage when the phenotype in NB number /proliferation manifests during larval brain development.</p></disp-quote><p>We observed brains at different larval stages upon glial ferritin KD. The result showed that NB proliferation decreased significantly, but NB number declined slightly at the second-instar larval stage (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E and F), suggesting that brain defect of glial ferritin KD manifests at the second-instar larval stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Transcriptome analysis on ferritin glial KD identified genes in mitochondrial functions, while the in vivo EM data suggested no defects in mitochondria morphology. A short discussion on the inconsistency is required.</p></disp-quote><p>For the observation of mitochondria morphology via the in vivo EM data, we focused on visible cristae in mitochondria, which was used to determine whether the ferroptosis happens[7]. It is possible that other details of mitochondria morphology were changed, but we did not focus on that. To describe this result more accurately, we replaced “However, our observation revealed no discernible defects in the mitochondria of NBs after glial ferritin knockdown” with the “However, our result showed that the mitochondrial double membrane and cristae were clearly visible whether in the control group or glial ferritin knockdown group, which suggested that ferroptosis was not the main cause of NB loss upon glial ferritin knockdown” in line 207-209.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement “we found no obvious defects of brain at the first-instar larval stage (0-4 hours after larval hatching) when knocking down glial ferritin (Figure 5-figure supplement 1C).” lacks quantification of NB number and proliferation, making it challenging to conclude.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the quantification of NB number and proliferation rate of the first-instar larval stage in Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D. The data showed that there is no significant change in NB number and proliferation rate when knocking down ferritin, suggesting that no brain defect manifests at the first-instar larval stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A wild-type control is necessary for Figure 6A-C as a reference for normal brain sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added <italic>Insc&gt;mCherry RNAi</italic> as a reference in Figure 6A-D, which showed that the brain size of tumor model is larger than normal brain. Moreover, we removed <italic>brat RNAi</italic> data from Figure 6A-D to Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-D for the better layout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 6B, D, “Tumor size” should be corrected to “Larval brain volume”.</p></disp-quote><p>Here, we measured the brain area to assess the severity of the tumor via ImageJ instead of 3D data of the brain volume. So we think it would be more appropriate to use the “Larval brain size” than “Larval brain volume” here. Thus, we have corrected “Tumor size” to “Larval brain size” in Figure 6B and D to Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering that asymmetric division defects in NBs may lead to premature differentiation, it is advisable to explore the potential involvement of ferritin in asymmetric division.</p></disp-quote><p>aPKC is a classic marker to determine the asymmetric division defect of NB. We performed the aPKC staining and found it displayed a crescent at the apical cortex based on the daughter cell position whether in control or glial ferritin knockdown (Figure 5—figure supplement 3A). This result indicated that there was no obvious asymmetric defect after glial ferritin knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the statement &quot;Secondly, we examined the apoptosis in glial cells via Caspase-3 or TUNEL staining, and found the apoptotic signal remained unchanged after glial ferritin knockdown (Figure 3-figure supplement 3A-D).&quot;, replace &quot;the apoptosis in glial cells&quot; with &quot;the apoptosis in larval brain cells&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced &quot;the apoptosis in glial cells&quot; with &quot;the apoptosis in larval brain cells&quot; in line 216.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Include a discussion on the involvement of ferritin in mammalian brain development and address the limitations associated with considering ferritin as a potential target for tumor suppression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the discussion about ferritin in mammalian brain development in line 428-430 and limitation of ferritin for suppressing tumor in line 441-444.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indicate Insc-GAL4 as BDSC#8751, even if obtained from another source.

For example, in Fig 1B and 1K controls present less than 100 NBs whereas in Figure 1 Supplementary 2B it can be seen that controls have more than 150. Then, depending on which control you compare the number of NBs in flies silencing Fer1HCH or Fer2LCH, the results might change. The authors should explain this.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1 Supplementary 2B (Figure 1 Supplementary 3B in the revised version) shows NB number in VNC region while Fig 1B and 1K show NB number in CB region. At first, we described the general phenotype showing the NB number in CB and VNC respectively (Fig 1 and Fig 1-Supplementary 1 and 3 in the revised version). And the NB number is consistent in each region. After then, we focused on NB number in CB for the convenience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This reviewer encourages the authors to use better Gal4 lines to describe the expression patterns of ferritins and Zip13 in the developing brain. On the one hand, the authors do not state which lines they are using (including supplementary table). On the other hand, new Trojan GAL4 (or at least InSite GAL4) lines are a much better tool than classic enhancer trap lines. The authors should perform this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>All stock source and number were documented in Table 2. Ferritin GAL4 and Zip13 GAL4 in this study are InSite GAL4. In addition, we also used another Fer2LCH enhancer trapped GAL4 to verify our result (DGRC104255) and provided the result in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. Our data showed that DsRed driven by <italic>Fer2LCH-GAL4</italic> was co-localized with the glia nuclear protein Repo, instead of the NB nuclear protein Dpn, which was consistent with the result of Fer1HCH/Fer2LCH GAL4. In addition, we will try to obtain the Trojan GAL4 (Fer1HCH/Fer2LCH GAL4 and Zip13 GAL4) and validate this result in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors exclude very rapidly the possibility of ferroptosis based only on some mitochondrial morphological features without analysing the other hallmarks of this iron-driven cell death. The authors should at least measure Lipid Peroxidation levels in their experimental scenario either by a kit to quantify by-products of lipid peroxidation such as Malonaldehide (MDA) or using an anti 4-HNE antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>We combined multiple experiments to exclude the possibility of ferroptosis. Firstly, ferroptosis can be terminated by iron chelator. And we fed fly with iron chelator upon glial ferritin knockdown, but NB number and proliferation were not restored, which suggested that ferroptosis probably was not the cause of NB loss induced by glial ferritin knockdown (Figure 3B and C). Secondly, Zip13 transports iron into the secretary pathway and further out of the cells in Drosophila gut[8]. Our data showed that knocking down iron transporter Zip13 in glia resulted in the decline of NB number and proliferation, which was consistent with the phenotype upon glial ferritin knockdown (Figure 3E-G). More importantly, the knockdown of Zip13 and ferritin simultaneously aggravated the phenotype in NB number and proliferation (Figure 3E-G). These results suggested that the phenotype was induced by iron deficiency in NB, which excluded the possibility of iron overload or ferroptosis to be the main cause of NB loss upon glial ferritin knockdown. Finally, we observed mitochondrial morphology on double membrane and the cristae that are critical hallmarks of ferroptosis, but found no significant damage (Figure 3-figure supplement 2E and F).</p><p>In addition, we have added the 4-HNE determination in Figure 3—figure supplement 2G and H. This result showed that 4-HNE level did not change significantly, suggesting that lipid peroxidation was stable, which supported to exclude the possibility that the ferroptosis led to the NB loss upon glial ferritin knockdown.</p><p>All of the above results together indicate that ferroptosis is not the cause of NB loss after ferritin knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major flaw of the manuscript is related to the chapter Glial ferritin defects result in impaired Fe-S cluster activity and ATP production and the results displayed in Figure 4. The authors talk about the importance of FeS clusters for energy production in the mitochondria. Surprisingly, the authors do not analyse the genes involved in this process such as but they present the interaction with the cytosolic FeS machinery that has a role in some extramitochondrial proteins but no role in the synthesis of FeS clusters incorporated in the enzymes of the TCA cycle and the respiratory chain. The authors should repeat the experiments incorporating the genes NSF1 (CG12264), ISCU(CG9836), ISD11 (CG3717), and fh (CG8971) or remove (or at least rewrite) this entire section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this constructive advice and we have revised this in Figure 4B and C.

However, we did not observe the obvious brain defect in <italic>ISCU(CG9836), ISD11 (CG3717),</italic> and <italic>fh (CG8971)</italic> knockdown in NB. Our interpretation of these results is that Nfs1 probably is a necessary core component in Fe-S cluster assembly while others are dispensable[9].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The presence and aim of the mouse model is unclear to this reviewer. On the one hand, it is not used to corroborate the fly findings regarding iron needs from neuroblasts. On the other hand, and without further explanation, authors migrate from a fly tumor model based on modifying all neuroblasts to a mammalian model based exclusively on a glioma. The authors should clarify those issues.</p></disp-quote><p>Although iron transporter probably is different in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammal, iron function is conserved as an essential nutrient for cell growth and proliferation from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to mammal. The data of fly suggested that iron is critical for brain tumor growth and thus we verified this in mammalian model. Glioma is the most common form of central nervous system neoplasm that originates from neuroglial stem or progenitor cells[10]. Therefore, we validated the effect of iron chelator DFP on glioma in mice and found that DFP could suppress the glioma growth and further prolong the survival of tumor-bearing mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>Although referred to adult flies, the authors did not include either in the introduction or in the discussion existing literature about expression of ferritins in glia or alterations of iron metabolism in fly glia cells (PMID: 21440626 and 25841783, respectively) or usage of the iron chelator DFP in drosophila (PMID: 23542074).

This is important to better understand the experiments done by the authors to describe any mitochondrial contribution (see above in major points).</p></disp-quote><p>In this experiment, we were measuring the total aconitase activity. We also tried to determine mitochondrial aconitase but it failed, which was possibly ascribed to low biomass of tissue sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this line, why do controls in aconitase and atp lack an error bar? Are the statistical tests applied the correct ones? It is not the same to have paired or unpaired observations.</p></disp-quote><p>It is the normalization. We repeated these experiments at least three times in different weeks respectively, because the whole process was time-consuming and energy-consuming including the collection of brains, protein determination and ATP or aconitase determination. And the efficiency of aconitase or ATP kit changed with time. We cannot control the experiment condition identically in different batches. Therefore, we performed normalization every time to present the more accurate result. The control group was normalized as 1 via dividing into itself and other groups were divided by the control. This normalized process was repeated three times. Therefore, there is no error bar in the control group. We think it is appropriate to apply ANOVA with a Bonferroni test in the three groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In some cases, further rescue experiments would be appreciated. For example, expression of Ndi restores control NAD+ levels or number of NBs, it would be interesting to know if this is accompanied by restoring mitochondrial integrity and its ability to produce ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We have determined ATP production after overexpressing Ndi1 and provided this result in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B. The data showed that expression of Ndi1 could restore ATP production upon glial <italic>Fer2LCH</italic> knockdown, which was consistent with our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 293-299 on page 7 are difficult to understand.</p></disp-quote><p>According to our above results, the decrease of NB number and proliferation upon glial ferritin knockdown (KD) was caused by energy deficiency. As shown in the schematic diagram (Author response image 1), “T” represented the total energy which was used for NB maintenance and proliferation. “N” indicated the energy for maintaining NB number. “P” indicated the energy for NB proliferation. “T” is equal to “N” plus “P”. When ferritin was knocked down in glia, “T”, “N” and “P” declined in “Ferritin KD” compared to “wildtype (WT)”. Knockdown of <italic>pros</italic> can prevent the differentiation of NB, but it cannot supply the energy for NB, which probably results in the rescue of NB number but not proliferation. Specifically, NB number increased significantly in “Ferritin KD Pros KD” compared to “Ferritin KD”, which resulted in consuming more energy for NB maintenance in “Ferritin KD Pros KD”. As shown in the schematic diagram, “T” was not changed between “Ferritin KD Pros KD” and “Ferritin KD”, whereas ”N” was increased in “Ferritin KD Pros KD” compared to “Ferritin KD”. Thus, “P” was decreased, which suggested that less energy was remained for proliferation, leading to the failure of rescue in NB proliferation. It seemed that the level of proliferation in “Ferritin KD Pros KD” was even lower than “Ferritin KD”.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The schematic diagram of relationship between energy and NB function in different groups.</title><p>“T” represents total energy for NB maintenance and proliferation. “N” represents the energy for NB maintenance. “P” represents the energy for NB proliferation.

This led me to consider alternate possibilities that the results might point to, other than the ones the authors were suggesting. It was only in Figure 5 that the authors ruled out some of those possibilities. I would suggest that they first illustrate how NBs are lost upon glial ferritin loss of function before they delve into the mechanism. This would also be a place to similarly address that glial numbers and general morphology are unchanged upon ferritin loss.</p></disp-quote><p>This recommendation provides a valuable guideline to build this story especially for researchers who are interested in neural stem cell studies.

Thus, we used <italic>Insc-GAL4</italic> to drive DsRed for indicating the expression level of Insc and found that DsRed rose after glial ferritin knockdown, suggesting that Insc expression was increased indeed.

The fly data on which the authors base this as an angle to chase is weak. Dividing cells will be impaired if they have inadequate energy production. As a therapeutic, this will affect every cell in the body. I'm not sure that cancer therapeutics is pursuing such broadly acting lines of therapies anymore.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data suggested that iron/ferritin is more critical for high proliferative cells. Tumor cells have a high expression of TfR (Transferrin Receptor)[11], which can bind to Transferrin and ferritin[12]. And ferritin specifically targets on the tumor cells[11]. Thus, we think iron/ferritin is extremely essential for tumor cells. If we can find the appropriate dose of iron/ferritin inhibitor, suppressing tumor growth but maintaining normal cell growth, iron/ferritin might be an effective target of tumor treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The feedback from NB to glial ferritin is also weak data. The increased cell numbers (of unknown identity) could well be contributing to the increase in ferritin. I would omit the last two sections from the MS.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>brat RNAi</italic> and <italic>numb RNAi</italic>, increased cells are NB-like cells, which cannot undergo further differentiation and are not expected to produce ferritin. More importantly, we used Repo (glia marker) as the reference and quantified the ratio of ferritin level to Repo level, which can exclude the possibility that increased glial cells lead to the increase in ferritin.</p><p>References</p><p>[1] Tanimura T, Isono K, Takamura T, et al.
