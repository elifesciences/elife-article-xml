Thus, intracellular accumulation of heme has not been observed in mammalian cells to date. Here we show that mice deficient for the heme transporter SLC48A1 (also known as HRG1) accumulate over ten-fold excess heme in reticuloendothelial macrophage lysosomes that are 10 to 100 times larger than normal. Macrophages tolerate these high concentrations of heme by crystallizing them into hemozoin, which heretofore has only been found in blood-feeding organisms. <italic>SLC48A1</italic> deficiency results in impaired erythroid maturation and an inability to systemically respond to iron deficiency. Complete heme tolerance requires a fully-operational heme degradation pathway as haplo insufficiency of <italic>HMOX1</italic> combined with <italic>SLC48A1</italic> inactivation causes perinatal lethality demonstrating synthetic lethal interactions between heme transport and degradation. Our studies establish the formation of hemozoin by mammals as a previously unsuspected heme tolerance pathway.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Specialized cells, known as red blood cells, are responsible for transporting oxygen to various organs in the body. Each red blood cell contains over a billion molecules of heme which make up the iron containing portion of the hemoglobin protein that binds and transports oxygen. When red blood cells reach the end of their life, they are degraded, and the heme and iron inside them is recycled to produce new red blood cells. Heme, however, is highly toxic to cells, and can cause severe tissue damage if not properly removed.</p><p>Scavenger cells called macrophages perform this recycling role in the spleen, liver and bone marrow. Collectively, macrophages can process around five million red blood cells every second or about 100 trillion heme molecules. But, it is unclear how they are able to handle such enormous volumes.</p><p>Macrophages isolated from human and mice have been shown to transport heme from damaged red blood cells using a protein called HRG1. To investigate the role HRG1 plays in heme-iron recycling, Pek et al. used a gene editing tool known an CRISPR/Cas9 to remove the gene for HRG1 from the macrophages of mice. If HRG1 is a major part of this process, removing the gene should result in a build-up of toxic heme and eventual death of the mouse.</p><p>But, rather than dying of heme-iron overload as expected, these mutant mice managed to survive. Pek et al. found that despite being unable to recycle heme, these mice were still able to make new red blood cells as long as they had a diet that was rich in iron. However, the darkening color of the spleen, bone marrow, and liver in these HRG1 deficient mice indicated that these mice were still accumulating high levels of heme. Further experiments revealed that these mice protected themselves from toxicity by converting the excess heme into crystals called hemozoin. This method of detoxification is commonly seen in blood-feeding parasites, and this is the first time it has been observed in a mammal.</p><p>These crystals invite new questions about how mammals recycle heme and what happens when this process goes wrong. The next step is to ask whether humans also start to make hemozoin if the gene for HRG1 is faulty. If so, this could open a new avenue of exploration into treatments for red blood cell diseases like anemia and iron overload.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heme</kwd><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd><kwd>hemozoin</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK085035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamza</surname><given-names>Iqbal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000066</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ES025661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hamza</surname><given-names>Iqbal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK110858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garrett</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name><name><surname>Bodine</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-06CH11357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralle</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017A0074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishibori</surname><given-names>Eiji</given-names></name><name><surname>Sugimoto</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heme accumulation is toxic, but deficiency of the heme transporter HRG1/SLC48A1 causes heme sequestration and crystallization into hemozoin within enlarged lysosomes of macrophages, thereby conferring heme tolerance to mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hemolysis can arise from genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larsen et al., 2012</xref>), parasitic and bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orf and Cunnington, 2015</xref>), and drug-induced autoimmune reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garratty, 2009</xref>).

Since heme-iron accumulates within KO macrophages which facilitate iron recycling during RBC turnover, we hypothesized that KO mice might be more susceptible to a low-iron diet.

We fed weanling WT and KO mice a low-iron diet (1.8 to 2 ppm Fe) and measured the impact of limiting dietary iron on their hematological indices. A significant percentage of KO mice, but not WT mice, died within 20 weeks on the low-iron diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, for the first five weeks, the hematocrits of WT and KO mice on the low-iron diet are comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mazzaccara et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), but by 8 weeks the hematocrits of KO mice were significantly lower (p&lt;0.01), and by 20 weeks they were severely anemic (13.2 ± 2.3 KO versus 39.8 ± 2.2 WT, p&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results imply that the defect in heme-iron recycling in KO mice becomes more pronounced after five weeks on an iron-deficient diet. We therefore focused our subsequent analyses on mice that were on low-iron diets for five weeks to detect any molecular and physiological changes in the absence of overt hematological differences.

Confocal microscopy using antibodies against LAMP1, which has been previously demonstrated to be a strong marker of erythrophagosomes in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delaby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huynh et al., 2007</xref>), showed that all of the hemozoin in isolated-F4/80<sup>+</sup> macrophages from KO bone marrow is enclosed within LAMP1-positive compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

To evaluate the genetic contribution of HMOX1, we generated HMOX1 HET and DKO (HMOX1 KO; SLC48A1 KO double knockout) double mutant mice.

Heme retention leads to impaired iron recycling for erythrocyte production in the bone marrow, stimulating extramedullary erythropoiesis similar to the effects caused by iron-deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). However, the overall impact on RBC production and anemia is modest on a standard iron diet (380 ppm). These findings support the conclusion that mice on an iron-rich diet can circumvent a block in heme-iron recycling by relying more heavily on dietary iron for erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganz and Nemeth, 2006</xref>). This is in stark contrast to humans where the daily iron absorption does not exceed 10% of the amount of recycled iron utilized for erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kautz and Nemeth, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muñoz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Winter et al., 2014</xref>). However, when KO mice are fed a low-iron diet, the block in heme-iron recycling is exacerbated. Furthermore, when KO mice encounter prolonged dietary iron limitation (8 to 20 weeks), they are unable to sustain erythropoiesis, implying that it takes approximately eight weeks for body iron stores to be depleted in the absence of heme-iron recycling. Indeed, results from the <italic>i</italic>n vivo <sup>59</sup>Fe-labeled RBC studies show that the relative proportion of <sup>59</sup>Fe retained within the spleens of KO mice are 50.3% hemozoin: 34.4% heme: 15.3% non-heme iron after 96 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Assuming that ineffective heme-iron recycling reduces recycled iron according to the law of exponential decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leike, 2002</xref>) and RBCs have a lifespan of ~40 days, this <sup>59</sup>Fe distribution pattern would predict that KO mice would become significantly anemic after six weeks as hemozoin accumulates after RBC turnover. Another potential contributing factor is the mouse genetic background. The KO mice were developed on a mixed genetic background (75% C57BL/6J, 25% 129/SvJ). Published studies comparing the iron status of C57BL/6J and 129/SvJ mice on an iron-balanced diet have shown that 129/SvJ mice have more hepatic iron stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dupic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). We recently generated KO mice on a pure C57BL/6J background and placed these mice on an iron-deficient diet post-weaning (P21). KO C57BL/6J mice showed severe anemia within 5.5 weeks compared to WT littermate controls, which approximates one lifespan of circulating erythrocytes (not shown). This result indicates that genetic strain differences that influence body iron stores are important modifiers of the SLC48A1 mutant phenotype. Taken together, we conclude that KO mice reach a ‘metabolic threshold’ on a low-iron diet, that is a physiological transition from an intermediate iron state to severe iron limitation, which eventually lead to mortality in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>, right panel).</p><p>Even though WT and KO mice had similar hematocrits at five weeks on a low-iron diet, KO mice were unable to undergo stress erythropoiesis and showed dysregulation of over 35 iron and heme metabolism genes in their spleens and livers. Typically under iron-deficient conditions, the production of the liver hormone hepcidin is suppressed, which results in greater mobilization of iron by SLC40A1 to iron-deprived compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ganz and Nemeth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nemeth et al., 2004</xref>). The inability to sustain erythropoiesis, despite a significant suppression in hepatic hepcidin expression in KO iron-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), suggest that these mice are iron-deprived even though the RES tissues are heme-iron loaded, that is systemic iron status is uncoupled from tissue and cellular iron status in the absence of <italic>SLC48A1</italic>. While hepatic hepcidin is considered to be the major facilitator of systemic iron homeostasis, recent studies have uncovered an autocrine role for locally-produced hepcidin in regulating cardiac iron homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lakhal-Littleton et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, KO mice show elevated splenic hepcidin regardless of iron status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>), implying a role for splenic hepcidin in stress erythropoiesis.</p><p>In the absence of <italic>SLC48A1</italic>, heme accumulates in the erythrophagosome of RES macrophages in the form of hemozoin biocrystals. Heme-iron recycling of senescent erythrocytes occurs in the RES macrophages - mainly in the splenic RPMs and, to some extent, in liver Kupffer cells and bone marrow macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaumont and Delaby, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Theurl et al., 2016</xref>). Our results establish a direct role for SLC48A1 in transporting heme from the phagolysosomal compartments to the cytosol for degradation by HMOX1. Unlike (SLC48A1) KO mice, loss of <italic>HMOX1</italic> causes over 90% embryonic lethality. Why do (SLC48A1) KO mice survive while HMOX1 KO mice show high embryonic mortality? Our results show that in the absence of <italic>SLC48A1</italic>, high concentrations of heme is sequestered as hemozoin within the acidic phagolysosome, resulting in cellular heme tolerance. By contrast, in the absence of <italic>HMOX1</italic>, heme accumulates within the cytosol resulting in cytotoxicity and embryonic lethality. Genetic epistasis would have predicted that the heme sequestration would rescue the embryonic lethality of the DKO mice. Possible explanations for this unexpected finding could be that <italic>HMOX1</italic> has additional functions beyond heme degradation, or that the heme degradation products are required for cell differentiation and specification in vivo. Our results support both of these explanations and further reveal that KO mice require a fully-operational heme degradation pathway to confer complete heme tolerance, as partial reduction of <italic>HMOX1</italic> in the absence of <italic>SLC48A1</italic> show significant embryonic lethality with severe impairment in macrophage and erythroblast maturation in the bone marrow and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–K</xref>) raising the possibility that functional HMOX1 requires SLC48A1 on the erythrophagosomal membranes. In the absence of SLC48A1, bioactive HMOX1 drops below the 50% expected in HMOX1 HET animals.</p><p>Blood-feeding parasites degrade hemoglobin in their digestive vacuole and accumulate heme in the form of hemozoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toh et al., 2010</xref>). Although the exact mechanisms of in vivo hemozoin formation are not well understood, it is generally agreed upon that hemozoin formation is a heme detoxification method used to protect the parasite from heme toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hempelmann, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toh et al., 2010</xref>). Hemozoin biocrystals are thought to be well-tolerated by both the parasite and subsequent host cells which ingest it, despite some reports on the inflammatory responses towards hemozoin ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basilico et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwarzer et al., 1993</xref>). We found hemozoin within LAMP1-positive intracellular vesicles, which are typically between pH 4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mellman et al., 1986</xref>). Acidic pH appears to be a common requirement for hemozoin formation in parasitic digestive vacuoles, in vitro and in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shio et al., 2010</xref>). To our knowledge, hemozoin formation in mammals has not been documented prior to this study. This phenomenon observed in KO spleens, livers and bone marrows suggests that macrophages are able to elicit a protective mechanism against high concentrations of heme by exploiting the low pH environment of lysosomes. It is important to note that KO mice have fewer RPMs, which implies that hemozoin sequestration may be incomplete or insufficient to confer complete heme tolerance, or that hemozoin itself could cause detrimental effects to these cells. Hemozoin in KO RES macrophages leads to tissue heme accumulation in these mice without causing major damages to tissue architecture. We speculate that pharmacologic inhibition of SLC48A1 in humans would lead to tolerance and protection from heme toxicity and iron overload.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, 129/SvJ/C57BL/6J)</td><td>SLC48A1, HMOX1</td><td>This paper, Materials and methods subsection animals</td><td/><td>Mouse strain</td></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages</td><td>SLC48A1/HMOX1 mice</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td>Hemozoin</td><td><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic></td><td/><td>Gift from Dr. Paul Sigala</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>SLC48A1 (Rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30248094">30248094</ext-link></td><td/><td>1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>F4/80 (Rat, polyclonal)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>MF48000 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10376289">AB_10376289</ext-link></td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>HMOX1 (rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td>Enzo</td><td>ADI-SPA-896 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10614948">AB_10614948</ext-link></td><td>1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>LAMP1 (rat, polyclonal)</td><td>Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td>1D4B <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2134500">AB_2134500</ext-link></td><td>1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-F4/80 microbeads</td><td>Miltenyi Biotech</td><td>130-110-443</td><td>Beads</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>guide RNA</td><td>Sage Laboratories</td><td/><td>TAGGGACGGTGGTCTACCGACAACCGG</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Cas9 RNA</td><td>Trilink Biotechnologies</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>HMOX1 KO F</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963040">24963040</ext-link></td><td/><td>GCTTGGGTGGAGAGGCTATTC</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>HMOX1 KO R</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963040">24963040</ext-link></td><td/><td>CAAGGTGAGATGACAGGAGATC</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>HMOX1 WT F</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963040">24963040</ext-link></td><td/><td>GTACACTGACTGTGGGTGGGGGAG</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>HMOX1 WT R</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963040">24963040</ext-link></td><td/><td>AGGGCCGAGTAGATATGGTAC</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>Custom qPCR array</td><td>Qiagen; this paper</td><td>CLAM25204D</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Stanbio Iron and TIBC kit</td><td>VWR</td><td>10152–550</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>mouse ferritin ELISA kit</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab157713</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>LDH kit</td><td>Sigma</td><td>TOX7</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>ROS kit</td><td>Sigma</td><td>MAK142</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>GSH assay kit</td><td>Abcam</td><td>ab138881</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Clodronate liposomes</td><td>Clodronate liposomes</td><td>C-005</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Heatmapper software</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27190236">27190236</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PRISM seven software</td><td>Graphpad</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td><sup>59</sup>FeCl3</td><td>Perkin Elmer</td><td>NEZ037001MC</td><td>Radioactive material</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice used were housed in a 12 hr light-dark cycle.

The incident X-ray energy was tuned to 10 keV using a Si-monochromator, the monochromatic beam was focused to 80 × 80 nm using a Fresnel zone plate. The sample was placed at 15˚ to the incident X-ray beam and the resulting X-ray fluorescence was collected at 90° using an energy dispersive 4-element detector (Vortex ME-4, SII Nanotechnology, Northridge, CA). Elemental maps were generated by extracting, background subtracting, and fitting the fluorescence counts for each element at each point using the program MAPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vogt, 2003</xref>). The fluorescent photon counts were translated into µg/cm<sup>2</sup> using calibrated X-ray standards (AXO products, Dresden, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data are shown as means ± SEM unless otherwise stated.

Surprisingly, the systemic and erythropoietic effects of the export block on iron recycling and erythropoiesis are relatively mild.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Even accepting that only 50% of iron flux in mice comes from recycling, the recycling block from HRG-1 KO appears only partial as it takes 8 weeks, i.e. almost 1.5 erythrocyte lifespans to separate the severity of anemia of wt and ko mice in the absence of dietary iron (Figure 4). The argument in the Discussion that it takes that long to deplete stores is unconvincing, especially in mice during their growth phase. As the authors can verify based on their own measurements, without recycling there is only enough storage iron in the liver and the spleen for less than 1 week of erythropoiesis. So there must be an important and perhaps major alternative heme recycling pathway, independent of HRG-1. This deserves additional analysis and comment.</p><p>2) The surprising interaction between the HRG-1 KO and heterozygous KO of heme oxygenase-1 is only superficially explored. The addition of the HO-1 KO to the HRG-1 KO does not add much to the hemozoin story other than eliciting a more dramatic phenotype, and at this stage is pure phenomenology in search of explanation. In the current model, heme oxygenase is in the cytoplasm, downstream of HRG-1. Although heterozygous HO-1 KO by itself is essentially wild-type, it appears to have synthetic lethality on the HRG-1 KO background. This is contrary to the simple model and unexplained in the current manuscript. Figure 6E shows that HO-1 undergoes differential proteolytic modification in the absence of HRG-1, raising the possibility that the HRG-1 and HO-1 physically or otherwise interact, potentially decreasing the bioactivity of HO-1 below the 50% expected from the heterozygous state and interfering with other functions HO-1 might have. At the very least this observation deserves a more focused discussion.</p><p>3) The genetic background of the studied mice should be more precisely defined. Gene targeting was performed in C57BL/6J X29SV/J mice and later intercrosses to generate heterozygous and homozygous knockout mice for further study included variable numbers of backcrosses into C57BL/6J. Thus, the studied animals represent variable mixtures of the 129SV/J and C57BL/6J genetic backgrounds. Were comparisons between mice of different genotypes restricted to littermates, to control for contributions from strain-specific genetic differences? The approach used to address this issue should be more completely described.</p><p>4) Some of the images were difficult to interpret, even on a high resolution screen. Improving image quality, selecting different images or quantifying images may help resolve this issue. For example, the HRG1 immunohistochemistry (Figure 1D) is confusing, with ample staining evident in both the wild type and knockout sections. How is staining corresponding to HRG1 distinguished from heme pigmentation? Is HRP the best stain for a heme defect? If the dark staining is HRG1, then why is it seen in the knockout sections? If it represents heme pigmentation, then why is it seen in some of the wild-type tissues? Would a color-contrasting immunoperoxidase substrate or immunofluorescence be easier to interpret?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Hemozoin produced by mammals confers heme tolerance&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The KO mice were developed on a mixed genetic background (75% C57BL/6, 25% 129/SvJ). Published studies comparing the iron status of C57BL/6 and 129/SvJ mice on an iron-balanced diet have shown that 129/SvJ mice have more hepatic iron stores (Dupic et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2007). We recently generated KO mice on a pure C57BL/6 background and placed these mice on an iron-deficient diet post-weaning (P21). KO C57BL/6 mice showed severe anemia within 5.5 weeks compared to WT littermate controls, which approximates one lifespan of circulating erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This result indicates that genetic strain differences that influence body iron stores are important modifiers of the SLC48A1 mutant phenotype.</p><p>We agree that there might be an alternate, specific or non-specific/low affinity, heme recycling pathway independent of SLC48A1. However our results clearly indicate that this alternate pathway is unable to circumvent the loss of SLC48A1 during dietary iron deficiency. We are conducting RNAseq and proteomics-based experiments to identify this alternate pathway using mice and <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49503-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The surprising interaction between the HRG-1 KO and heterozygous KO of heme oxygenase-1 is only superficially explored.

The reviewer is astute in noticing the differential banding patterns of HMOX1 protein in the absence of SLC48A1 (Figure 6E). This has led us to hypothesize that SLC48A1 forms a ternary complex with HMOX1 (and other proteins) during erythrophagocytosis for efficient heme transfer, degradation, and iron release. While this explanation is speculative, a more focused sentence is added to the Discussion to explain the HMOX1 HET; SLC48A1 KO mice phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The genetic background of the studied mice should be more precisely defined.

The relative proportion of genetic background was determined to be 75% C57BL/6 and 25% 129/SvJ by speed congenics using 5307 SNP Illumina Chip. Furthermore, WT mice are wildtype littermate controls of KO mice. Taken together, experimental animals used were obtained from the same generation to control for differences in the genetic strain. We have edited the experimental procedures section to include this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some of the images were difficult to interpret, even on a high resolution screen.

To show that there is virtually no background staining, we have now added secondary antibody only staining controls (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C) for both WT and KO tissues. In addition, we performed SLC48A1 immunohistochemistry with secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, which stains red. SLC48A1 staining is clearly observed in WT tissues but is absent in KO tissue (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Point 4 was felt to be adequately addressed by the revised figures and point 3 (mouse genetic background) now adequately described in the revised Materials and methods.
