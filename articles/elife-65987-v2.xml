In the last decade, sensory biologists have determined that non-neuronal cells and specialized end organ structures in the skin interact with sensory neurons to mediate touch sensation; Merkel cells and Meissner corpuscles encode unique aspects of gentle touch by tuning the responses of AÎ² sensory neurons, and specialized terminal Schwann cells modulate the firing of nociceptors to noxious touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ojeda-Alonso et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neubarth et al., 2020</xref>). Keratinocytes, which constitute &gt;95% of the cells in the epidermis, are innately sensitive to mechanical force, are capable of releasing a wide array of neuroactive factors, and form close âsynapse-likeâ connections with intraepidermal nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumpkin and Caterina, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Talagas et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Talagas et al., 2020c</xref>). Moreover, optogenetic activation of keratinocytes induces action potential firing in sensory neurons, whereas optogenetic inhibition of keratinocyte activity decreases both sensory neuron and behavioral responses to tactile stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moehring et al., 2018a</xref>). Thus, keratinocyte activity is critical for normal sensory neuron and behavioral responses to mechanical stimuli.</p><p>The ability of keratinocytes to respond to force and contribute to touch sensation indicates that they must express one or more mechanically sensitive proteins, but the specific keratinocyte mechanotransducer(s) have not yet been identified. PIEZO1 and PIEZO2 are mechanically gated, non-selective cation channels that share approximately 42% amino acid similarity and are widely expressed in tissues that respond to mechanical force (e.g. lung, skin, bladder, and vasculature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ranade et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedrich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dalghi et al., 2019</xref>). PIEZO2 expression in both dorsal root ganglia (DRG) sensory neurons and Merkel cells is required for innocuous touch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranade et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is unknown if PIEZO1 also contributes to touch sensation. Because PIEZO1 is highly expressed in mouse skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2010</xref>), we hypothesized that this channel may be a key mechanotransducer in keratinocytes. Here, we show that virtually all keratinocytes isolated from mouse and human skin respond to the PIEZO1 agonist Yoda1 and that PIEZO1 expression is important for keratinocyte mechanical sensitivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that loss of epidermal PIEZO1 decreases the firing rate of sensory nerve fibers in response to mechanical stimulation of the skin and blunts behavioral responses to both innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli in vivo. Together, these data demonstrate that epidermal PIEZO1 is critical for normal touch sensation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine if PIEZO1 is a mechanotransducer in keratinocytes, we generated epidermal cell-specific PIEZO1 knockout mice (PIEZO1cKO) by crossing <italic>Keratin14(Krt14</italic>)<sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Piezo1</italic><sup>loxp/loxp</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahalan et al., 2015</xref>).

On a functional level, in vitro calcium imaging experiments revealed that keratinocytes isolated from wild-type animals responded robustly to the PIEZO1-specific chemical agonist Yoda1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>) in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). In contrast, keratinocytes from PIEZO1cKO animals were virtually unresponsive to Yoda1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Similarly, primary human keratinocytes displayed robust, concentration-dependent intracellular calcium flux in response to Yoda1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>).

Keratinocytes were sensitive to mechanical stimulation as the majority of cells responded to a very gentle membrane indentation (â¤1 Âµm) with a mechanically activated (MA) current. However, the amplitude of the MA current evoked by membrane indentation did not show a clear dependence on the increase in membrane indentation depth. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows a representative example of a MA current evoked in a keratinocyte in response to stepwise increases in membrane indentation. In this recording, the initial current was induced in response to 0.50 Âµm membrane indentation (shown in blue), maximum current was observed in response to the next stimulation (black, 0.75 Âµm membrane displacement), and subsequent displacements resulted in smaller currents (red, 1.00 Âµm) or no current (green, 1.25 Âµm). Increasing the time between mechanical stimulations to 2 min did not affect the properties of keratinocyte responses to increasing mechanical indentation (data not shown). We next examined whether PIEZO1 is required for keratinocytes mechanosensitivity. PIEZO1cKO keratinocytes required greater indentation to elicit MA currents compared to wild-type cells, indicating PIEZO1cKO keratinocytes have elevated mechanical thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, there was an increase in the number of keratinocytes unresponsive to membrane indentation (mechanically insensitive) in the PIEZO1cKO group (51.35%, 19 out of 37 cells) compared to wild type group (21.74%, 5 out of 23 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, there was no change in the proportion of keratinocytes that responded to membrane indentation with rapidly adapting (RA), intermediately adapting (IA), or slowly adapting (SA) currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Additionally, we did not observe any effect of PIEZO1 deletion on the profiles of RA, IA, and SA currents. Furthermore, there was no change in the maximum current amplitude elicited by membrane indentation at any force tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These findings indicate that PIEZO1 is critical for setting the mechanical threshold of keratinocytes and that its deletion increases the number of mechanically insensitive cells.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>PIEZO1 deletion decreases keratinocyte mechanical sensitivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of whole-cell recording of mechanically activated (MA) current (Vhâ=ââ40 mV) evoked in keratinocytes by a stepwise increase in membrane indentation depth.

Application of 1 mM Yoda1 failed to induce firing in any fiber type tested (AÎ² n=10, AÎ´ n=10, C n=10 fibers, data not shown). In light of this finding, we next hypothesized that the attending behaviors observed following Yoda1 injection were due to Yoda1-induced mechanical sensitization of primary sensory afferents, such that the normally innocuous pressure of the glass floor was now sufficient to induce paw attending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, we found that Yoda1 application increased the mechanically induced firing frequency of wild-type C fibers relative to vehicle application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâF</xref>), but had no effect on the mechanically induced firing of AÎ² or AÎ´ fibers (10 fibers of each tested, data not shown). The increase in C fiber mechanically induced firing frequency was absent in PIEZO1cKO preparations, indicating that epidermal PIEZO1 is required for the Yoda1-induced mechanical sensitization. Furthermore, we found that intraplantar injection of 1 mM Yoda1 sensitized wild-type mice behaviors to mechanical stimulation 30 minutes following injection, an effect which was absent in the PIEZO1ckO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These results indicate that Yoda1 acts at keratinocyte PIEZO1 to induce C fiber mechanical hypersensitivity that results in attending behaviors and increased mechanical sensitivity.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Yoda1 induces paw attending behaviors and C fiber mechanical hypersensitivity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Yoda1-induced attending behaviors in wildtype mice; Kruskal Wallis test.

However, this dogma has essentially been negated by recent work that demonstrates how non-neuronal cells, including keratinocytes, are required for the normal detection and coding of somatosensory stimuli in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moehring et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neubarth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sadler et al., 2020</xref>).

Furthermore, these results indicate that the functional contributions of PIEZO1 activity in the epidermis are multifaceted, as PIEZO1 also regulates epidermal cell extrusion and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holt et al., 2020</xref>). Epidermal PIEZO1 deletion decreased animal behavioral responsiveness to a range of intensities and qualities of mechanical stimuli. This contrasts to the behaviors observed when PIEZO2 is deleted from various peripheral cell types; animals are not able to detect very light punctate stimuli when PIEZO2 is deleted from Merkel cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woo et al., 2014</xref>), and similarly, deletion of PIEZO2 from dorsal root ganglion neurons results in behavioral deficits to light punctate and dynamic stimuli but not to stimuli in the high to noxious range of forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranade et al., 2014b</xref>). While Merkel cell and neuronal PIEZO2 specifically mediate sensitivity to light touch, epidermal PIEZO1 appears to be a more general amplifier of cutaneous mechanical stimuli. It is important to note that sensory neurons are capable of detecting and encoding aspects of mechanical stimuli without input from epidermal cells; neither epidermal PIEZO1 deletion nor optogenetic inhibition of keratinocytes completely abolishes touch sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moehring et al., 2018a</xref>), but rather both manipulations decrease neuronal and behavioral mechanical sensitivity. Keratinocyte activation and subsequent signaling appears to function in concert with sensory neurons and other cutaneous end organ structures to amplify normal touch sensation. Although it is possible that the mechanical deficits displayed by the PIEZO1cKO mice were due to indirect developmental effects of PIEZO1 deletion on the structure or function of the epidermis rather than a decrease in keratinocyte mechanical signaling, we observed no deficits in cold or heat behaviors in the PIEZO1cKO mice, suggesting that general somatosensation was not affected in the mutants. Furthermore, we did not observe gross changes in epidermal morphology, suggesting that general epidermal disorganization was not the main driver of the decreased mechanical sensitivity exhibited by the PIEZO1cKO mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>PIEZO1 is a key keratinocyte mechanotransducer</title><p>Previous work has demonstrated that keratinocytes are inherently mechanically sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsutsumi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>). However, the molecular transducer that converts force into cellular responses in keratinocytes was unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moehring et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Talagas et al., 2020b</xref>). Here, we show that PIEZO1 deletion substantially reduces the number of keratinocytes that respond to membrane indentation; 51.35% of keratinocytes were insensitive to mechanical indentation following deletion of PIEZO1. These results indicate that PIEZO1 is a key mechanotransducer in keratinocytes, mirroring the role PIEZO2 plays in both Merkel cells and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ranade et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). In the population of PIEZO1cKO keratinocytes that retained mechanical sensitivity, the mechanical threshold was higher than those observed in wild-type keratinocytes. Furthermore, PIEZO1 deletion reduced but did not eliminate the number of rapidly and intermediately adapting currents. These changes in mechanical response properties suggest that one or more unknown mechanotransducers function to detect mechanical stimuli in a subset of keratinocytes. One potential candidate for this function is PIEZO2, which is shown to mediate the rapidly adapting mechanical currents in DRG neurons and Merkel cells. However, keratinocytes express low levels of PIEZO2 transcript, making it unlikely to be the primary contributor to the remaining keratinocyte mechanical sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). In addition to PIEZO1, keratinocytes express a host of ion channels that may modulate keratinocyte mechanical responses downstream of bona fide mechanotransducers. These include members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of ion channels, such as TRPV4 and TRPC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Peier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">OâNeil and Heller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, TRPV4 expression in keratinocytes is required for the development of mechanical allodynia in a mouse model of sunburn pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, TRPC5 expression is required for the development of mechanical allodynia in several inflammatory and neuropathic pain models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sadler et al., 2021</xref>), although the contribution of epidermal TRPC5 to injury induced mechanical hypersensitivity remains to be explored. Whether TRPV4, TRPC5, and/or other channels contribute to normal keratinocyte mechanotransduction, or the potential sensitization of keratinocyte mechanotransduction following injury, warrants further investigation beyond this current study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Epidermal PIEZO1 is important for mechanically induced sensory afferent firing</title><p>Our teased fiber recordings revealed that deletion of PIEZO1 from the epidermis selectively decreased the firing frequency of AÎ´ fibers. This difference was most notable at the higher range of forces tested, indicating that epidermal PIEZO1 is important for the high intensity firing of AÎ´ fibers. However, the PIEZO1cKO animals had deficits in behavioral responses to both light touch and high-threshold mechanical stimuli. A potential explanation is that the reflexive behavioral responses to touch may rely on the summation of activity in many overlapping receptive fields, and therefore, activity in keratinocytes from a broad area of skin. Alternatively, the mechanical responsiveness of a single afferent fiber may rely on signaling from far fewer keratinocytes. Interestingly, AÎ´ nociceptors have been shown to mediate behavioral responses to pinprick stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arcourt et al., 2017</xref>), which was the behavior most affected by loss of epidermal PIEZO1 in our high-speed imaging experiments.</p><p>We found that epidermal PIEZO1 deletion had no effect on the mechanical responses of SA-AÎ² fibers. This is likely because Merkel cells tune the mechanical responses of these fibers and Merkel cell mechanical sensitivity is primarily mediated by PIEZO2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). Surprising to us, however, was that C fiber afferents from PIEZO1cKO and wild-type preparations exhibited similar mechanical firing frequency and mechanical thresholds. This was unexpected since many C fiber terminals are closely apposed to keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zylka et al., 2005</xref>) and, in experiments performed by Baumbauer, Deberry, and Adelman, et al., optogenetic inhibition of epidermal cells decreased C fiber mechanical firing in 12 of 25 fibers tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible that the absence of an effect of keratinocyte PIEZO1 deletion on C fiber mechanical sensitivity may be explained by differences in our teased fiber recording methods compared to those used by Baumbauer and colleagues; we apply our mechanical stimulus to the dermal side of the skin, whereas Baumbauer et al. applied their mechanical stimulus to the corneum (i.e., how an external mechanical stimulus would naturally be applied to the skin in vivo). Alternatively, because many C fibers terminate more superficially in the epidermis than AÎ´ fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zylka et al., 2005</xref>), it is possible that the differentiated keratinocytes of the outer epidermis rely on a different mechanotransducer than PIEZO1 to encode tactile information. We recently reported that keratinocytes release ATP in response to mechanical stimulation, which subsequently acts at purinergic receptors on sensory terminals to mediate tactile sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moehring et al., 2018a</xref>). Therefore, ATP may be one of the signaling molecules linking epidermal PIEZO1 activity to sensory neuron responses. In addition to ATP, keratinocytes can release a variety of other neuroactive factors, including calcitonin gene-related peptide Î², acetylcholine, glutamate, epinephrine, neurotrophic growth factors, endothelin-1, and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumpkin and Caterina, 2007</xref>) the contribution of these ligands to neuro-epithelial mechanical signaling remains to be explored.</p><p>An important caveat to our findings is that the use of the <italic>keratin 14</italic> (K14) promotor to target PIEZO1 deletion in the epidermis means that we cannot definitively rule out the contribution of other K14-expressing cells to our experiments.

However, given that keratinocytes make up the vast majority of cells in the epidermis (&gt;95%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs, 1995</xref>), and Merkel cells express minimal PIEZO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffman et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesize that our findings are largely mediated by keratinocytes.

This type of study could reveal important information about the role of PIEZO1 in human touch sensation.</p><p>We found that intraplantar injection of the PIEZO1 specific agonist Yoda1 induced paw attending behaviors in wild-type but not PIEZO1cKO mice, suggesting that activation of epidermal PIEZO1 is sufficient to induce behavioral responses. However, application of Yoda1 to the receptive fields of functionally identified primary afferent fibers failed to induce action potential firing. This result was surprising given that Yoda1 induced calcium responses in isolated keratinocytes and PIEZO1 is functionally expressed in itch-specific sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hill et al., 2022</xref>). Because we applied Yoda1 to the dermal layer of the skin, it is possible that Yoda1 failed to penetrate sufficiently to the PIEZO1 expressing cells in the epidermis to induce sensory fiber firing. Interestingly, we observed an increase in C fiber mechanical sensitivity following Yoda1 application, an effect that was dependent on epidermal PIEZO1 expression. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the Yoda1 induced behaviors may reflect increased hindpaw mechanical sensitivity, such that the innocuous force produced by the paw resting on the glass floor becomes sufficient to induce paw attending. In line with this hypothesis, we found that intraplantar injections of Yoda1 induced mechanical allodynia in wild-type but not PIEZO1cKO mice. Indeed, while Yoda1 can activate PIEZO1 channels on its own, it prominently sensitizes PIEZO1 to mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Syeda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lacroix et al., 2018</xref>). Such an increase in PIEZO1 mechanical sensitivity may explain why the effects of Yoda1 on sensory fiber firing were only observed in the presence of mechanical force. Interestingly, the team of Baumbauer, DeBerry, and Adelman reported that subthreshold mechanical stimulation could induce firing in high-threshold mechanically sensitive afferents when paired with optogenetic activation of keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumbauer et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that sensitization of keratinocyte mechanical signaling may enhance sensory afferent responses to force. This idea is intriguing, as injury induced sensitization of keratinocyte mechanotransduction may contribute to the development of mechanical allodynia and hyperalgesia. Alterations in keratinocyte function and signaling contribute to inflammatory and neuropathic cutaneous pain states, such as psoriasis, dermatitis, fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome, and postherpetic neuralgia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benhadou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Leung, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evdokimov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, in a mouse model of sunburn pain, UVB light exposure resulted in profound mechanical and heat allodynia, effects which were completely dependent on UVB-induced activation and sensitization of keratinocyte expressed TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moore et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, injury-induced sensitization of keratinocyte mechanotransducers may enhance normal keratinocyte activation in response to mechanical stimulation and subsequent signaling to sensory neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the data presented here demonstrate that epidermal PIEZO1 is critical for normal touch sensation in mice and that PIEZO1 is also expressed and functional in human keratinocytes.

Plates were kept at 37 Â°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. Growth media was exchanged every 2 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Keratinocytes were isolated from the glabrous hindpaw skin of PIEZO1cKO animals and littermate controls as described above. RNA was isolated from these keratinocytes using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (LifeTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA). Total RNA content was assessed with a Nanodrop Lite spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE). cDNA was generated using the SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, LifeTechnologies). Quantitative real-time PCR reaction was performed on a BIO-RAD CFX96 system (Bio-Ra, Hercules, CA). Samples were run in triplicate. Gene expression was normalized to <italic>Hprt</italic>.

Keratinocytes were loaded with 2.5 Âµg/mL Fura-2-AM, a dual-wavelength ratiometric calcium indicator dye, in 2% BSA for 45 min at RT then washed with extracellular buffer for 30 min. Keratinocytes were superfused with RT extracellular buffer (pH 7.4, 320 Osm) containing (in mM) 150 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 8 glucose, 5.6 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2,</sub> and viewed on a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope. Nikon elements software (Nikon Instruments, Melville, NY) was used to capture fluorescence images at 340 and 380 nm. Responsive cells were those that exhibited &gt;30% increase in 340/380 nm ratio from baseline. Yoda-1 (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared from a 10 mM stock solution (5 mg Yoda1 in DMSO) at 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 (nM) concentrations in extracellular buffer for the dose response curve. Yoda-1 was applied for 3 min and washed out for 3 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p>For all spontaneous and evoked behavior experiments, the experimenter was blinded to genotype throughout testing and data entry. Animals were tested between 8am and 1pm and were allowed to acclimate for at least an hour to the new surroundings and experimenter before any behavior testing was performed.</p><p>Mechanical sensitivity: A battery of different assays using various stimuli were utilized to determine the mechanical sensitivity of the of PIEZO1cKO and wild-type littermate controls. Using the Up-Down method and a series of calibrated von Frey filaments ranging from 0.20 to 13.73 mN, mechanical thresholds of the glabrous hindpaw skin were assessed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaplan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dixon, 1980</xref>). Additionally, the hindpaw skin was stimulated 10 times using a 3.61 mN von Frey Filament in the suprathreshold assay, and using a 0.6 mN von Frey Filament in the static light touch assay. The number of stimulus-evoked paw withdrawals were recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weyer et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, we utilized a paintbrush that was stroked 10 times across the hindpaw and responses were categorized as: normal/innocuous (simple withdrawal of the paw), noxious (elevating the paw for extended periods of time, flicking and licking of the paw), and null responses (no withdrawal) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowie et al., 2019</xref>). Lastly, noxious mechanical sensitivity was assessed using the needle assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hogan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrison et al., 2014</xref>), where responses were categorized similar to the paintbrush assay.</p><p>To test heat sensitivity, mice were placed in a small plexiglass enclosures on top of a glass plate, and a focal radiant heat source was applied to the plantar hindpaw. The response latency to hind paw withdrawal from the heat stimulus was quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hargreaves et al., 1988</xref>), with a cut off at 25 s to avoid tissue damage. Each paw was tested 4 times, with 5 min of rest between testing, and results were averaged for each animal.</p><p>To test cold sensitivity, animals were placed in small plexiglass enclosures on top of a thin 2.5-mm-thick glass plate, and powdered dry ice packed into a 10 mL syringe with the top cut off was pressed against the glass beneath the plantar surface of the hindpaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenner et al., 2012</xref>). Withdrawal latencies were recorded three times for each paw, with 5 min of break in between testing, and results were averaged for each animal. The maximum time allowed for withdrawal was 20 s to avoid potential tissue damage.</p><p>Spontaneous behaviors were recorded in response to intraplantar Yoda-1 injections (10 ÂµM, 100 ÂµM, and 1 mM). Yoda1 or vehicle was injected into the plantar surface of the hindpaw and behaviors were recorded for 10 min following the injection. Videos were analyzed offline by an experimenter blinded to both genotype and treatment. Behaviors exhibited by the animals included biting and licking of the hindpaw.</p><p>High speed imaging was used to record withdrawal behaviors in response to von Frey filaments (0.6 g, 1.4 g, 4 g), paintbrush, and needle stimulation. Videos were recorded on a FastCAM UX100 high-speed camera (Photron, Tokyo, Japan) for five seconds at 2000 frames per second starting with the application of the mechanical stimulus to the hindpaw. Videos were analyzed offline using Fastcam software (Photron). Paw height was measured as the distance from the apex of the first upward movement to the point directly below it on the mesh, as previously described. Paw velocity was measured by taking two points at different frames during the first upward movement of the paw. Pain score was measured based on the presence of jumping, paw shaking, or paw guarding behaviors. The presence of each of these behaviors was worth 1 point toward the pain score. An animal displaying 2 of the 3 behaviors would receive a score of 2, whereas an animal exhibiting all three behaviors in response to the stimulus would receive a score of 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdus-Saboor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>H&amp;E staining</title><p>A hematoxylin and eosin stain was performed to assess the general morphology of the glabrous skin of PIEZO1cKO and wild-type littermate controls. Glabrous skin of PIEZO1cKO and wild-type animals was dissected, and the tissue was fixed in 4% formaldehyde. The skin was processed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned into 4 Î¼m sections and dried at RT until subsequent staining at the MCW Histology Core. Rehydrated sections were stained in hematoxylin for 3 min, washed in Richard-Allan Scientific Signature Series Clarifier 1,2 (for 45 sec, dipped for 30 sec in 0.1% ammonia water (bluing agent)), stained in eosin for 30 s, washed four times using 100% EtOH and lastly rinsed in Xylene. Slides were scanned using a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer HT slide scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics, K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan) and images were assessed using NDP.View 2 software (Hamamatsu Photonics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Patch clamp recordings</title><p>On the first day of culture, keratinocyte recordings were performed. Keratinocytes were superfused with RT extracellular normal HEPES solution containing (in mM): 127 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2,1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose, pH 7.35Â±0.05, and viewed on a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope. Keratinocytes were patch clamped in voltage clamp mode (holding voltage â40 mV) with a borosilicate glass pipette (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 135 KCl, 10 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 0.2 NaGTP, 2.5 ATPNa2, 10 glucose and 10 HEPES, pH 7.25Â±0.05. Mechanical stimulation was elicited using a glass rod positioned approximately 2 Âµm from keratinocyteâs membrane and driven by a piezo stack actuator (PA25, PiezoSystem Jena, Jena, Germany) at a speed of 39.17 Î¼m/ms. Keratinocytes were stimulated with a series of mechanical steps in 0.25 Î¼m increments applied for 150ms every 30 s to avoid sensitization/desensitization of the cell membrane. Data was recorded using (Axon pCLAMP 11 software using Digidata 1550B and Axopatch 200B amplifier Molecular Devices LLC, San Jose, CA). The cell was considered mechanically insensitive if the inward current was not observed with 5.0 Âµm displacement beyond the initial touch. Current profiles were classified using the following parameters: rapidly adapting (RA, inactivation time constant (Ï)&gt;10ms), intermediately adapting (IA, 10ms &lt; <italic>Ï</italic>&lt;30ms), and slowly adapting (SA; <italic>Ï</italic>&lt;30ms) current.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Ex vivo teased nerve fiber recordings</title><p>Tibial skin nerve recordings were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reeh, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffman et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, animals were anesthetized and sacrificed via cervical dislocation. The leg of the animal was shaved and the glabrous skin with the innervating tibial nerve was quickly removed and placed in a heated (32 +- 0.5 Â°C), oxygenated bath (pH 7.45 +- 0.05) consisting of (in mM): 123 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1.7 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5.5 glucose, 7.5 sucrose 9.5 sodium gluconate and 10 HEPES. Small nerve bundles were placed on a recording electrode and a blunt glass probe was used to search for receptive fields of single afferent fibers. Fibers were characterized based on their shape and conduction velocities: C-fibers&lt;1.2 m/s; AÎ´-fibers 1.2â10 m/s; and AÎ²-fibers&gt;10 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koltzenburg et al., 1997</xref>). Only slowly adapting AÎ² and AÎ´ fibers were collected. Action potential thresholds were determined using a continuous force ramp (0â100 mN over 10 s). A custom designed feedback-controlled mechanical stimulator was used to stimulate the receptive fields with 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100, and 150 mN for 10 s. Sensitization was prevented by allowing 1 min breaks between mechanical stimulations. Data was recorded and analyzed with LabChart (ADInstruments; Colorado Springs, CO). A 3D printed plastic moat secured to the tissue with vacuum seal grease was used for recordings where Yoda1 was introduced to mechanically sensitive receptive fields. Drug was administered after determining the threshold with a continuous force ramp as described above, all other mechanical stimuli was conducted after addition of the drug. A 1 min recovery time was recorded to observe any drug induced activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Histological comparisons were made using a two-way ANOVA.

Previous work from the Stucky group (and others) has shown stimulation of optical excitation of keratinocytes can evoke action potentials in sensory neurons and behavioural responses suggesting functional connectivity. Earlier work from the Stucky group provided evidence that keratinocytes are thermosenstive and required for normal temperature sensation. Here, they look into whether these cells are also important for mechanosensation. Moehring and colleagues convincingly show that keratinocytes have mechanically evoked currents mediated by Piezo1. They next provide evidence that removing Piezo1 from keratinocytes reduces the frequency of spiking in select types of sensory neurons to punctate and dynamic touch stimuli. Finally, they supply quite surprising data documenting significant behavioural deficits in Krt-conditional knockout mice.</p><p>Overall, an intriguing topic although I do have some questions. My biggest concerns is that the differences in the skin-nerve recordings are quite subtle whereas the behavioural effects are remarkably robust. How do the author reconcile this? Similarly, it is hard to understand how such profound mechanical deficits could be occurring given the known essential role for Piezo2 in many of these touch behaviours</p><p>Major Comments</p><p>1. This manuscript is lacking a discussion.</p><p>2. In the skin nerve prep experiments, the authors should examine the response of Abeta and ADelta fibres to Yoda1 application to the skin. If Piezo1-expressing keratinocytes strongly couple to these fibres, then Yoda1 application should cause AP firing selectively in large calibre mechanically-sensitive afferents. Given the relatively low expression of Piezo1 in these afferents, the Yoda1-induced firing should be abolished by keratinocyte-specific deletion of Piezo1. This experiment would strongly support the author's interpretation of their behavioural experiments using Yoda1.</p><p>3. Piezo2 is required in LTMRs for light touch sensation. Can the authors explain why Piezo1 in keratinocytes is not sufficient to support residual touch sensation in the afferent Piezo2 KO lines? If the authors interpretation is correct, the Yoda1 behavioural experiments imply that keratinocyte Piezo1 activation is sufficient to drive behavioural responses.</p><p>4. In the skin nerve prep experiments, SA-Abeta fibres showed deficient firing in the keratinocyte Piezo1 KO only at the very highest applied forces. Likewise for Adelta. The authors also show the SA-Abeta threshold was not altered. On the other hand, in the behavioural experiments the keratinocyte Piezo1 KO animals showed a remarkable impairment for both high-threshold AND light touch stimuli. How do the authors explain the reduced behavioural response to low-threshold stimuli given the unaltered afferent responses to stimuli of a similar type?</p><p>5. Figure 1C and 1E â the figures show that virtually 100% of mouse and human keratinocytes respond to the highest doses of Yoda1. The lack of response in the mouse KO to the highest Yoda1 dose indicates this must be Piezo1-mediated, and by implication 100% of keratinocytes express functional Piezo1. This seems very high and worth commenting on. Do the authors have immuno or RNAscope data to expect ubiquitous expression of Piezo1 in keratinocytes? The authors have previously shown that keratinocytes respond to cold temperatures. How can keratinocytes selectively regulate cold sensation when the same cold-sensing keratinocytes presumably also express Piezo1 and are mechanosensitive, and thus also couple to the mechanically sensitive afferents?</p><p>6. Similarly, keratinocytes respond to cold, hot and mechanical stimuli? How then would there be any selectivity at the sensory neuron level? Something doesn't quite make sense to me.</p><p>7. Figure 2A â the current clamp experiments need representative traces of the force-dependent membrane depolarization to gauge the shape/kinetics of the response. E.g. at the highest forces, do you see a VG calcium spike(let) that rides on top of the depolarization attributable to Piezo1 opening? (Would expect this given the calcium imaging!)</p><p>8. It is surprising that Piezo1 knockout diminishes the amplitude of mechano-currents but not the activation threshold- can the authors discuss what they think is happening here?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 3 B-D. These results put together suggest that keratinocytes have MA currents with three different kinetics and PIEZO1 is responsible for the RA mediated 60-70% of all MA responses in keratinocytes, whereas the remaining ~30% of the MA currents are unaccounted for and are likely mediated by an unknown mechanosensor. This is an interesting and important observation. I think a little more information in this figure will be helpful. Specifically, the authors should consider showing representative traces for the IA and SA responses. Pannel C and D suggests that in addition to a decrease in RA currents, knocking out PIEZO1 results in smaller MA currents in the remaining IA/SA containing cells. Is this true? This a bit confusing and the authors should consider describing these panels better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Moehring and collaborators report that the mechanosensitive channel Piezo1 is expressed in keratinocytes in mice and humans and claim that it contributes to touch sensation. The identification of Piezo1 as a major mechanotransducer in keratinocytes is convincing however proving its direct role in touch would require more solid experimental evidence.</p><p>Major issues</p><p>1) K14 expression is not exclusive to keratinocytes (refs 1,2), therefore both expression and conditional KO of Piezo1 in other K14-expressing epidermal cells (i.e. melanocytes, Langerhans cells) could contribute to the cellular and behavioral responses observed.</p><p>2) In absence of a functional link (release of a mediator?) demonstrated between activation of Piezo1 in keratinocytes and transduction in primary sensory neurons, the changes observed in the cKO mice could be due to developmental or homeostatic effects of the cKO in the epidermis and their indirect consequences on the mechanosensitivity of cutaneous sensory fibers. Supplemental figure 3 does not address potential changes in cellular composition of the epidermis in adult cKO mice.</p><p>3) Supplemental Figure 1. If Piezo1 is a major mechanotransducer in keratinocytes, it is not clear to me how its ablation does not have any measurable impact on their mechanical threshold.</p><p>4) Figure 3 A-F: the typical traces shown in A, C, E do not fit with quantitative data in B, D, F. This discrepancy is more obvious in the condition of 40 mN stimulations for the three types of fibers.</p><p>5) Figure 4J is missing.</p><p>6) The manuscript title does not reflect the complete story. The sections on mechanosensory fibers and touch are left out.</p><p>Other comments</p><p>1) Figure 1A shows a double normalization. The real expression level of Piezo1mRNA (i.e. relative to HPRT) in wildtype vs. cKO is not indicated.</p><p>2) Figure 1B. How many cells have been recorded from how many mice in both conditions?</p><p>3) Based on the currents (or absence of) shown in figures 2B and based on 2C, panel 2D does not fit, or this was plotted should be explained.</p><p>4) Figure 2C.

The revised patch clamp recordings cast doubt on the relevance of Piezo1 in keratinocyte mechanotransduction.

The Yoda1-induced paw attending behavior (Figure 4B) is also hard to interpret â it seems unlikely to be due to the discussed mechanism of neuronal sensitization because the mechanical threshold for neuron firing is unchanged (Figure 4D)</p><p>5. Very recently it was shown that Piezo1 is functionally expressed in mouse NppB/Ssst positive neurons and drives mechanical itch responses. Could this be another explanation for the paw-attending behavior? Even though that work came out after the initial submission, it would be great if can be addressed and cited here.</p><p>6. Similarly, if Piezo1 is expressed in a subset of c-Fibers, is it surprising there seem to be no responses to Yoda in the skin-nerve recordings?

We found that Yoda1 application failed to induce any Yoda1-induced firing in any fiber types tested (AÎ² n=10, AÎ´ n=10, C fibers n=10). In contrast, 1 Î¼M capsaicin to the same receptive fields induced robust firing in all C fibers tested. These findings suggest that Yoda1 does not directly induce firing in primary afferent terminals, which is at odds with our original interpretation of the behavior data in Figure 4 where Yoda1 injection into the hind paw induced paw withdrawal behaviors. In light of this, we hypothesized that these behaviors induced by direct activation of PIEZO1 expressing cells were withdrawal behaviors elicited by Yoda1-mediated mechanical sensitization, such that the pressure of the glass floor on the paw skin was sufficient to induce withdrawal responses. To test this on a behavioral level, we measured von Frey withdrawal thresholds in mice following intraplantar injection of Yoda1. Yoda1 decreased the withdrawal thresholds of wildtype mice 30 min post injection but had no effect on PIEZO1cKO mice (Figure 4G). Next, we performed additional teased fiber recordings in the presence of 1 mM Yoda1 while simultaneously mechanically stimulating the receptive fields of identified fibers (Figure 4C-F). We found that Yoda1 elevated the mechanical firing frequency of C fiber types in wildtype preparations but had no effect on the mechanical responses of A fiber afferents. Interestingly, the Yoda1 induced mechanical sensitization of C fiber afferents was absent in PIEZO1cKO preparations, indicating a requirement for epidermal PIEZO1. These findings suggest that the Yoda1-induced behavioral responses were primarily due to the epidermal-PIEZO1 mediated sensitization of C fiber afferents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Piezo2 is required in LTMRs for light touch sensation. Can the authors explain why Piezo1 in keratinocytes is not sufficient to support residual touch sensation in the afferent Piezo2 KO lines? If the authors interpretation is correct, the Yoda1 behavioural experiments imply that keratinocyte Piezo1 activation is sufficient to drive behavioural responses.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our recently added teased fiber recordings (see comment 2 above), Yoda1 application is not sufficient to initiate firing in sensory fibers but does sensitize C fiber afferents to mechanical stimulation in an epidermal-PIEZO1 dependent manor. Therefore, we believe that both keratinocytes and sensory neuron mechanoreceptors function together to mediate touch sensation. Neither epidermal PIEZO1 deletion nor optogenetic inhibition is sufficient to completely abolish behavioral responses to mechanical stimulation, indicating the requirement of neuronal mechanotransducers in these behavioral responses. We hypothesize that activation of keratinocyte PIEZO1 amplifies (likely through the release of signaling mediators such as ATP) but does not necessarily initiate sensory fiber responses to mechanical force. In the absence of neuronal PIEZO2, the keratinocyte to neuronal mechanical signaling does not appear to be sufficient to on its own preserve behavioral responses to light touch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the skin nerve prep experiments, SA-Abeta fibres showed deficient firing in the keratinocyte Piezo1 KO only at the very highest applied forces. Likewise for Adelta. The authors also show the SA-Abeta threshold was not altered. On the other hand, in the behavioural experiments the keratinocyte Piezo1 KO animals showed a remarkable impairment for both high-threshold AND light touch stimuli. How do the authors explain the reduced behavioural response to low-threshold stimuli given the unaltered afferent responses to stimuli of a similar type?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional teased fiber recordings on all fiber types and our revised data in Figure 3 and figure 4 show that there is little effect of keratinocyte PIEZO1 deletion on afferent firing to mechanical stimulation of the receptive field. The only difference that remains is a decrease in PIEZO1cKO AÎ´ mechanically induced firing frequency, specifically at the highest forces tested. The dichotomy between the effect of PIEZO1 deletion on behavior and lack of effect on terminal firing is even more striking with the addition of these new data. A potential explanation is that the reflexive behavioral responses to touch may rely on the summation of activity in many overlapping receptive fields, and therefore, activity in keratinocytes from a broad area of skin. Alternatively, the mechanical responsiveness of a single afferent fiber may rely on far fewer keratinocytes. Another possibility is that the nature of our teased fiber recording preparation is not entirely representative of the processes that occur during in vivo mechanical stimulation; in our preparation the vasculature and connective tissues are removed and the corium (inside) of the epidermis is stimulated. In behavioral experiments, the stratum corneum (outermost layer) of keratinocytes was stimulated; perhaps there are anatomical differences in the ways in which keratinocytes respond to punctate stimuli in the two directional formats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 1C and 1E â the figures show that virtually 100% of mouse and human keratinocytes respond to the highest doses of Yoda1. The lack of response in the mouse KO to the highest Yoda1 dose indicates this must be Piezo1-mediated, and by implication 100% of keratinocytes express functional Piezo1. This seems very high and worth commenting on. Do the authors have immuno or RNAscope data to expect ubiquitous expression of Piezo1 in keratinocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed RNAscope on skin sections and found that <italic>Piezo1</italic> mRNA is expressed throughout the epidermis in wild type skin and this staining is not present in the PIEZO1cKO skin. These findings are presented in Figure 1A. Although virtually 100% of keratinocytes responded during Yoda1 application, it is possible that some of these responses may not actually be due to Yoda1 but rather caused by the release of paracrine compounds from nearby cells that are activated by Yoda1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Similarly, keratinocytes respond to cold, hot and mechanical stimuli? How then would there be any selectivity at the sensory neuron level? Something doesn't quite make sense to me.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing up this interesting point. Based on previous work from our lab and others, we hypothesize that keratinocytes function as general detectors and amplifiers of cold, heat, and mechanical sensation by signaling to sensory neurons and thus increasing their likelihood of firing. For example, we have identified keratinocyte ATP release as important for normal behavioral responses to cold, heat and mechanical stimuli. Thus, epidermal purinergic signaling appears to be a ubiquitous mechanism that amplifies sensory neuron firing to multiple modalities of somatosensory stimuli. Detection of the sensory stimulus (cold, heat, mechanical) still requires the sensory fiber and it is likely at the level of the sensory neuron that sensory selectivity is mainly regulated. The keratinocytes seem to be generic amplifiers of somatosensory stimuli that function to potentiate but not necessarily initiate sensory neuron firing in response to heat, cold and mechanical stimuli. Additionally, there may exist modality-specific signaling pathways that convey specific aspects of cold, heat or mechanical stimuli to sensory neurons, although future studies are needed to identify these.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Figure 2A â the current clamp experiments need representative traces of the force-dependent membrane depolarization to gauge the shape/kinetics of the response. E.g. at the highest forces, do you see a VG calcium spike(let) that rides on top of the depolarization attributable to Piezo1 opening?

Two skilled electrophysiologists in the lab have now independently observed results similar to those presented in updated Figure 2. Specifically, we show that PIEZO1cKO keratinocytes require a greater level of indentation to elicit mechanical currents compared to wild-type cells, indicating PIEZO1cKO keratinocytes have elevated mechanical thresholds (Figure 2B). In addition, there was an increase in the proportion of mechanically insensitive cells in PIEZO1cKO group compared to wild type (Figure 2C). In whole-cell current clamp mode we observed activation of fast conductance (presumably, calcium or sodium voltage-gated channels) in response to the indentation-induced membrane depolarization. We did not include these data in resubmission as we are still in the process of studying the effect of mechanical stimulation on keratinocytes membrane voltage and plan to describe these mechanisms in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

However, the amplitude of the evoked mechanical current in keratinocytes did not show a clear dependence on the increase of membrane indentation depth.

These results put together suggest that keratinocytes have MA currents with three different kinetics and PIEZO1 is responsible for the RA mediated 60-70% of all MA responses in keratinocytes, whereas the remaining ~30% of the MA currents are unaccounted for and are likely mediated by an unknown mechanosensor. This is an interesting and important observation. I think a little more information in this figure will be helpful. Specifically, the authors should consider showing representative traces for the IA and SA responses. Pannel C and D suggests that in addition to a decrease in RA currents, knocking out PIEZO1 results in smaller MA currents in the remaining IA/SA containing cells. Is this true? This a bit confusing and the authors should consider describing these panels better.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these comments.

The revised patch clamp recordings cast doubt on the relevance of Piezo1 in keratinocyte mechanotransduction. Keratinocytes respond robustly to Piezo1 agonist (Figure 1C-F), yet they have very little Piezo1 transcript (Figure 1A) and are minimally affected by Piezo1cKO (Figure 2).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we observed less robust PIEZO1 mRNA staining than would have been expected based on the calcium imaging data. This was surprising given that recent publications examining the role of keratinocyte PIEZO1 in wound healing (PMID:Â 34569935) and the epidermal mesenchymal transition (PMID:Â 35615675) both found more robust PIEZO1 expression in keratinocytes than we observed here. This discrepancy may reflect differences in the techniques used between these studies; we used RNAscope to measure PIEZO1 mRNA expression in the skin, whereas the other studies used PIEZO1 reporter lines and immunohistochemistry to visualize PIEZO1 expression in the epidermis. Thus, it is possible that the PIEZO1 mRNA staining we performed underrepresents the amount of PIEZO1 protein present in these cells. Ultimately, cellular function is a more sensitive reporter assay than mRNA transcript. Our data in the PIEZO1cKO keratinocytes shows no Yoda1-induced responses, indicating that the Yoda1-induced function is entirely due to PIEZO1.</p><p>For our patch clamp studies, the most noticeable effect of PIEZO1cKO was in the number of keratinocytes that <italic>failed</italic> to respond to the mechanical stimulus when it was applied (21.74% of the WT vs. 51.35% of the PIEZO1cKO cells were non-responsive to force). We also observed an increase in the mechanical threshold that elicited the first mechanical current upon membrane indentation in the PIEZO1cKO cells. However, we observed no change the maximum current amplitude evoked by membrane indentation in mechanically sensitive PIEZO1ckO keratinocytes compared to wildtype. This suggests that the role of PIEZO1 in keratinocyte mechanotransduction is in tuning the sensitivity of the cell to the mechanical stimulus but may be dispensable for the magnitude of inward current when the keratinocytes responds to force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Why do the representative RA currents run down with increasing membrane indentation (Figure 2A)?</p></disp-quote><p>We found that there was a large amount of variability in the current amplitude evoked by mechanical stimulation at each stimulus intensity in keratinocytes. As such, we did not observe a relationship between stimulus intensity and the amplitude of the evoked current. In some keratinocytes, the cell would respond with the largest inward current in response to the lowest membrane indentation and decrease in amplitude as the stimulus intensity was increased. In other keratinocytes, an intermediate intensity stimulus evoked the largest amplitude current. As such, the average maximum amplitude comparison in Figure 2C represents the maximum current amplitude evoked during the entire cellâs recording, regardless of stimulus intensity. These results in keratinocytes are very different to results from our recordings in isolated Dorsal Root Ganglion neurons where we observe a clear stimulus-intensity current-amplitude relationship using a similar stimulation protocol (PMID:Â 29563343). At this point, we do not have an explanation for the finding that keratinocytes do not respond in a stimulus-graded manner to mechanical poking. Because our data indicate that the mechanical sensitivity of keratinocytes is a result of the amalgamated activation of several channels, some of which we have not identified, we suggest that the channels involved may have different inactivation kinetics that could affect the keratinocytesâ total membrane response to increasing membrane indentation. Future studies are needed to determine whether this speculation is accurate or not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The Yoda1-induced paw attending behavior (Figure 4B) is also hard to interpret â it seems unlikely to be due to the discussed mechanism of neuronal sensitization because the mechanical threshold for neuron firing is unchanged (Figure 4D)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the Yoda1-induced paw attending behavior is likely not due to direct neuronal sensitization by Yoda1 and have updated the text to better reflect and explain this. Since this attending behavior was reduced in the PIEZO1cKO mice, we hypothesize that Yoda1 is acting on epidermal PIEZO1 and sensitizing the keratinocytes to mechanical stimulation. This sensitization may lead to increased release of signaling molecules from keratinocytes, such as ATP, in response to mechanical stimulation, leading to the increased C fiber firing that we show in 4D. Since there was an increase in the firing frequency of wildtype C fibers treated with Yoda1 but not PIEZO1cKO C fibers, this may indicate that keratinocyte PIEZO1 mediated paracrine signaling is important for the depolarization of neighboring sensory afferents, leading to sustained sensory fiber firing in response to stimulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Very recently it was shown that Piezo1 is functionally expressed in mouse NppB/Ssst positive neurons and drives mechanical itch responses. Could this be another explanation for the paw-attending behavior? Even though that work came out after the initial submission, it would be great if can be addressed and cited here.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this. We have updated the Discussion to include these recent findings. Although we cannot rule out the contribution of neuronal PIEZO1 to the Yoda1 paw attending behaviors, we believe our findings are specific to epidermal PIEZO1 since the PIEZO1 conditional keratinocyte knockout animals did not exhibit increased paw attending time following Yoda1 injection over vehicle treatment. This suggests that epidermal PIEZO1 is necessary for these responses, at least 10 minutes after Yoda1 injection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Similarly, if Piezo1 is expressed in a subset of c-Fibers, is it surprising there seem to be no responses to Yoda in the skin-nerve recordings? Can this be discussed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is surprising that Yoda1 failed to induce firing in the skin nerve preparation, both in light of our calcium imaging data showing robust keratinocyte responses to Yoda1 (Figure 1C) and in light of the recent Hill et al., 2022 article demonstrating a role for neuronal PIEZO1 in mechanical itch. Because we applied Yoda1 to the dermal layer of the skin, it is possible that Yoda1 failed to penetrate sufficiently to the PIEZO1 expressing cells in the epidermis to induce sensory fiber firing. Interestingly, we observed an increase in C fiber mechanical sensitivity following Yoda1 application, an effect that was dependent on epidermal PIEZO1 expression. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the Yoda1 induced behaviors may reflect increased hindpaw mechanical sensitivity, such that the innocuous force produced by the paw resting on the glass floor becomes sufficient to induce paw attending. In line with this hypothesis, we found that intraplantar injections of Yoda1 induced mechanical allodynia in wild-type but not PIEZO1cKO mice. Indeed, while Yoda1 can activate PIEZO1 channels on its own, it has been shown to prominently sensitize PIEZO1 to mechanical stimulation<sup>26</sup>. Such an increase in PIEZO1 mechanical sensitivity may explain why the effects of Yoda1 on sensory fiber firing were only observed in the presence of mechanical force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed reviewers' comments satisfactorily and the manuscript is significantly improved.</p><p>Due to recently published findings on the role of PIEZO1 in mechanical itch (Hill et al., 2022), they must now address the potential impact of the expression of PIEZO1 in subsets of primary somatosensory neurons on the interpretation of their data on Yoda1-evoked fiber firing activity and behavioral responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our discussion of the Yoda1 evoked behavior and fiber sensitization to include this recent publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The title could be downtoned as keratinocyte PIEZO1 appears to be neither necessary nor sufficient for mechanosensation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have updated the title to âKeratinocyte PIEZO1 modulates cutaneous mechanosensationâ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
