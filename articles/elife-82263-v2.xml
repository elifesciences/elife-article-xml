development. Here, we established robust methods for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture in the common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> [cj]), allowing stable propagation in an undifferentiated state. Notably, iPSCs cultured on a feeder layer in the presence of a WNT signaling inhibitor upregulated genes related to ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic processes and enter a permissive state that enables differentiation into primordial germ cell-like cells (PGCLCs) bearing immunophenotypic and transcriptomic similarities to pre-migratory cjPGCs in vivo. Induction of cjPGCLCs is accompanied by transient upregulation of mesodermal genes, culminating in the establishment of a primate-specific germline transcriptional network. Moreover, cjPGCLCs can be expanded in monolayer while retaining the germline state. Upon co-culture with mouse testicular somatic cells, these cells acquire an early prospermatogonia-like phenotype. Our findings provide a framework for understanding and reconstituting marmoset germ cell development in vitro, thus providing a comparative tool and foundation for a preclinical modeling of human in vitro gametogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>marmoset</kwd><kwd>primordial germ cell</kwd><kwd>in vitro gametogenesis</kwd><kwd>primordial germ cell-like cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Philanthropy Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-197906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasaki</surname><given-names>Kotaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Philanthropy Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>10080664</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sasaki</surname><given-names>Kotaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01DA054170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermann</surname><given-names>Brian P</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarrey</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name><name><surname>Navara</surname><given-names>Christopher S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Corinna N</given-names></name><name><surname>Sasaki</surname><given-names>Kotaro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD090007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hermann</surname><given-names>Brian P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P51OD011133</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>Corinna N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006545</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G12MD007591</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vargas</surname><given-names>Sean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1337513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vargas</surname><given-names>Sean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-2018408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vargas</surname><given-names>Sean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro model of germline specification in marmosets established by directed differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells, which transcriptionally resemble pre-migratory primordial germ cells in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The germline, a lineage that ultimately form the gametes, is the fundamental component of the life cycle in metazoan species, ensuring perpetuation and diversification of the genome across generations. In addition, the germline is the foundation of totipotency, since combination of gametes at fertilization gives rise to totipotent zygotes that establish all embryonic and extraembryonic lineages necessary for production of a new organism. The germline first arises during early embryonic development as primordial germ cells (PGCs), which subsequently migrate to the developing gonads and ultimately produce either spermatozoa or oocytes through complex and sex-specific developmental pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saitou and Miyauchi, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, aberrancies associated with PGC development can lead to infertility and a variety of genetic and epigenetic disorders in offspring. Therefore, a precise understanding of how PGCs develop bears significant implications not only for reproductive medicine but also toward a better understanding of a breadth of human diseases.</p><p>Although much has been learned from murine genetic studies regarding the cellular dynamics, signaling, genetic, and epigenetic requirements accompanying PGC specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saitou and Miyauchi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saitou and Yamaji, 2012</xref>), the scarcity of germ cells and complexity of their development and cellular interactions has limited deep understanding of transcriptional regulatory networks and epigenetic bases of germ cell development. The last decade, however, has witnessed remarkable progress toward establishing in vitro gametogenesis (IVG) technologies as an alternative approach to study germ cell development. Remarkably, through the stepwise recapitulation and validation of developmental milestones starting with pluripotent stem cells (embryonic stem cells [ESCs] or induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs]), the entirety of mouse germline development has been reconstituted in vitro, culminating in the successful generation of fertilization-competent oocytes and spermatozoa, and healthy offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hikabe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishikura et al., 2021</xref>). These landmark studies have been followed by successful development of human iPSC-based germline reconstitution methods, in which pre-meiotic oogonia and prospermatogonia-like cells generated through PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) bear remarkable transcriptional similarities to in vivo counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>IVG platforms have provided valuable tools to dissect the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms underlying germline specification and subsequent gametogenesis. Recent studies using IVG-derived germ cells or primate embryos in vivo have revealed a substantial divergence in the origin of germ cells and transcriptional networks governing germ cell specification between mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saitou and Miyauchi, 2016</xref>). For example, in mice, core germ cell transcription factors, <italic>Prdm14</italic>, <italic>Blimp1,</italic> and <italic>Tfap2c</italic>, that are deployed by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4)-induced <italic>TBXT</italic>, sufficiently establish germ cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aramaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nakaki et al., 2013</xref>), whereas <italic>SOX17</italic> and <italic>TFAP2C</italic>, deployed by <italic>EOMES</italic> and <italic>GATA2/3,</italic> make up the analogous transcriptional network and fate in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kojima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kojima et al., 2021</xref>). Such divergence between mice and humans necessitates additional layers of caution in direct translation of IVG technologies to human infertility treatment and warrants careful scrutinization and functional validation of IVG-derived gametes in comparison to those developing naturally in vivo. Since ethical and legal constraints make research with human embryos difficult to impossible, IVG studies using model organisms that are phylogenetically close to humans is an important next step. The common marmoset (<italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic>) is a new-world monkey that shares many biological characteristics with humans, and thus, has been widely used for biomedical research to bridge the gap between rodent models and clinical translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishi et al., 2014</xref>). Marmoset embryo development, including implantation and formation of fetal membranes, is well conserved with that in humans, serving as a powerful surrogate model for human post-implantation development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moore et al., 1985</xref>). Moreover, the relatively short reproductive lifespan, small body size, and reasonable cost for breeding compared to other primates render the marmoset a tractable preclinical model for IVG. In particular, use of marmosets permits vigorous validation of intermediary cellular derivatives by comparing them with their in vivo counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kishi et al., 2014</xref>) and may enable future functional validation of resultant IVG-derived gametes by fertilization and embryo transfer.</p><p>In this study, we provide a highly efficient method to generate, expand, and maintain <italic>C. jacchus</italic> (cj)PGCLCs from cjiPSCs and demonstrate that these cells are immunophenotypically and transcriptionally similar to pre-migratory stage cjPGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Immunohistochemical characterization of pre-migratory cjPGCs</title><p>To validate germ cell generation in vitro, we must first have a precise understanding of the molecular features of cjPGCs in vivo. In particular, molecular characterization of early stage endogenous PGCs is critical to guide the first step of IVG – the induction of PGCLCs that appear to represent pre-migratory PGCs in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>). However, there is a dearth of information describing primate PGCs at stages before gonad colonization, primarily due to their scarcity. Therefore, we collected marmoset embryos from a triplet pregnancy at embryonic day (E)50 for immunofluorescence (IF) and molecular analyses (Carnegie stage [CS]11, 19 somites, corresponding to ~E8.5–9.0 in mice) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As we and others have previously identified TFAP2C, SOX17, and PDPN as specific markers of pre-migratory/migratory PGCs and PGCLCs in humans and macaque monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2017</xref>), we traced cjPGCs using these markers. At this stage, TFAP2C<sup>+</sup>SOX17<sup>+</sup>PDPN<sup>+</sup> cjPGCs were predominantly localized within the ventral portion of the hindgut endoderm and exhibited round nuclei with generally lower DAPI intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). A few scattered cjPGCs were also seen in the adjacent hindgut mesenchyme outside of the basement membranes, suggestive of the initiation of active migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additional IF analyses revealed that cjPGCs were mostly non-proliferative (i.e., MKI67<sup>-</sup>) and co-expressed pluripotency-associated markers (e.g., POU5F1, NANOG), but were negative for SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>). Notably, cjPGCs did not express later germ cell markers (e.g., DDX4 and DAZL), that are typically observed in testicular germ cells (i.e., prospermatogonia) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). IF analysis on cjPGCs showed increased global levels of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and reduced global levels of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), consistent with the germline epigenetic reprogramming that occurs in mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Immunophenotypic characterization of pre-migratory <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> primordial germ cells (cjPGCs) at embryonic day (E)50.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Bright field images of a cj embryo at E50 (Carnegie stage [CS]11).

Three cell lines, 20201_6, 20201_7, and 20201_10, were established by reprogramming of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Materials and methods). Although hematological chimerism is frequently observed in marmosets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ross et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benirschke et al., 1962</xref>), whole-exome sequencing confirmed that the established cjiPSCs originated from the intended PBMC donor (ID number, 38189) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). CjiPSCs were initially established using conventional on-feeder (OF) culture conditions (see below), but were subsequently switched to feeder-free (FF) culture conditions (PluriSTEM for basal medium and iMatrix-silk for a substrate) for its ease of maintenance. Under these conditions, FF cjiPSCs could be stably maintained over multiple passages (more than 20 passages) when passaged every 4–6 days in the presence of Y27632, a ROCK inhibitor. FF cjiPSCs bore a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio, were tightly packed in colonies with sharp borders and exhibited flat morphology, each of which are characteristic features of primate primed-state pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These cells were mycoplasma-free, exhibited normal 46, XY karyotypes, and uniformly expressed key pluripotency-associated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).</p><p>Notably, similar to FF culture, conventional OF cultures allowed long-term propagation of cjiPSCs. However, OF cjiPSCs tended to differentiate at the center or periphery of colonies 4–5 days after passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Moreover, OF cjiPSCs required clump passaging because single-cell passaging decreased colony formation after two passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Accordingly, OF cjiPSCs exhibited modest upregulation of mesodermal (e.g., <italic>T</italic>, <italic>EOMES</italic>, <italic>MIXL1</italic>) and endodermal genes (e.g., <italic>FOXA2</italic>, <italic>SOX17</italic>) compared to those maintained under FF conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Previous studies showed that inhibition of WNT signaling stabilizes primate iPSC/ESC cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, we compared our conventional OF culture to cultures containing a WNT signaling inhibitor (IWR1). Notably, OF cjiPSCs cultured with PluriSTEM containing IWR1 (OF/IWR1) maintained an undifferentiated morphology and pluripotency-associated gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>). Under this condition, mesoderm/endoderm genes were suppressed compared with conventional OF culture. Moreover, OF/IWR1 culture conditions allowed efficient single-cell passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). While we also found that addition of IWR1 to OF culture conditions previously utilized to grow cynomolgus monkey ESCs (AITS+IF20: advancedRPMI1640 and Neurobasal [1:1] supplemented with AllbuMax [1.6%], 1× ITS [Insulin, Transferrin, Selenium], IWR1 [2.5 μM], and bFGF [20 ng/ml]) suppressed spontaneous differentiation, the effects were not as great as when PluriSTEM was used as a basal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, F</xref>). Consistent with the role of Wnt inhibition in suppressing spontaneous cjiPSCs differentiation, two independent Wnt antagonists, IWR and XAV939, increased expression of pluripotency-associated surface markers, SSEA3 and SSEA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G, H</xref>). Although cjiPSCs cultured under various conditions differed in the expression of some genes, all cjiPSCs expressed key pluripotency-associated markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–H</xref>), and a trilineage differentiation assay confirmed their potential to differentiate into all three germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2I, J</xref>). Together, our findings reveal that we have identified an optimal culture protocol in both FF and OF conditions that allows stable propagation of cjiPSCs in an undifferentiated state and with a normal karyotype, thus serving as a foundation for directed differentiation toward the germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Generation of PGCLCs from cjiPSCs</title><p>Our next goal was to derive cjPGCLCs directly from cjiPSCs following the protocol established in humans and cynomolgus monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2020</xref>). For this, we first treated FF cjiPSCs with a PGCLC induction cocktail (i.e., BMP4, LIF, stem cell factor [SCF], epidermal growth factor [EGF], Y27632) in GK15 (Glasgow minimal essential medium [GMEM] supplemented with 15% KSR) or aRB27 (advanced RPMI1640 and supplemented with 1% B27) basal medium. Under these conditions, cjiPSCs formed aggregates with a markedly cystic appearance and did not generate SOX17<sup>+</sup>TFAP2C<sup>+</sup> cjPGCLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>), suggesting that they may not have germline competency. Thus, we next turned our attention to OF cjiPSCs without WNT inhibition given prior success in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>). Remarkably, upon floating culture with a PGCLC induction cocktail in GK15 or aRB27, ~3–4% PDPN<sup>+</sup>ITGA6<sup>weak+</sup> cells emerged as a distinct population starting at d4 of induction, although the frequency of such cells generally declined after d4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B–D</xref>). Sectioning of these aggregates at d4 revealed small clusters of PDPN<sup>+</sup> cells uniformly expressing cjPGC markers (TFAP2C, SOX17, PRDM1, NANOG, and POU5F1), which was further confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B, E, F</xref>).</p><p>We posited that the relatively low induction efficiency of cjPGCLCs might be due to their tendency to differentiate under OF conditions. Therefore, we next utilized OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs for cjPGCLCs induction. Upon induction in floating culture, cjiPSCs readily formed tighter and more uniform size/shape aggregates compared to those induced from OF cjiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Moreover, under this condition, the induction efficiency of cjPGCLCs was significantly improved, with ~15–40% cells becoming PDPN<sup>+</sup>ITGA6<sup>weak+</sup> at d4 and d6 of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3G, H</xref>). Although variable across experiments, the median yield of PDPN<sup>+</sup> cells per aggregate was ~600 at d4 and d6, but declined thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). IF of sections of aggregates at d4 revealed multifocal large clusters of PDPN<sup>+</sup> cells uniformly expressing key early germ cell markers (e.g., SOX17, TFAP2C, PRDM1, POU5F1, NANOG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, this finding suggests that PDPN can serve as a highly specific surface marker of cjPGCLCs that will allow for isolation of cjPGCLCs for downstream analyses. In support, qPCR of isolated PDPN<sup>+</sup> cjPGCLCs also expressed pluripotency-associated genes (i.e., <italic>POU5F1</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>), PGC specifier/early marker genes (i.e., <italic>SOX17</italic>, <italic>TFAP2C</italic>, <italic>PRDM1,</italic> and <italic>NANOS3</italic>) and lacked detectable <italic>SOX2</italic> and late germ cell marker (i.e., <italic>DDX4</italic>, <italic>DAZL</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), features similar to pre-migratory PGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>).

As expected, E50 cjPGCs (cluster 7) juxtaposed with clusters 2/5 (d6 cjPGCLCs) in PHATE embedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–K</xref>), and these clusters revealed a high correlation by Pearson correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>). Pairwise correlation analysis revealed that many key germ cell markers/specifier genes are equally upregulated in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). Notably, we found that d6 cjPGCLCs were more proliferative/apoptotic whereas E50 cjPGCs upregulated genes were enriched in ‘regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>). Some up- and downregulated DEGs were enriched with GO terms ‘actin cytoskeleton organization’ (up in d6 cjPGCLCs) or ‘response to insulin’ (up in E50 cjPGCLCs), which might reflect culture adaptation or differences in the surrounding nutritional/hormonal environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we made a cross-species comparison of PGCLC genes (genes upregulated in PGCLCs compared to iPSCs) between marmoset and humans.

Notably, species-specific PGCLC genes were enriched in GO terms such as ‘fatty acid homeostasis’ (human PGCLC upregulated) or ‘carbohydrate metabolic process’ (marmoset PGCLC upregulated), which might indicate a species-specific metabolic requirement in early developing germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Global DNA methylation in cjPGCLCs</title><p>Previous studies suggested that hPGCLCs showed only modest reductions in global 5mC levels with or without expansion culture, suggesting that hPGCLCs have just undergone specification and have not yet completed global DNA demethylation, a hallmark of mammalian PGC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saitou and Miyauchi, 2016</xref>). Therefore, we next evaluated global 5mC levels in cjPGCLCs by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Similar to hPGCLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murase et al., 2020</xref>), d4 PGCLCs showed a slight but significant reduction in 5mC levels (mean, ~63%) compared with OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs (mean, ~75%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Notably, cjPGCLCs in expansion culture exhibited further reduction in 5mC levels, bearing a 5mC level of ~50% at c30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>). Thus, the dynamics of global 5mC levels during cjPGCLC induction and expansion is similar to that of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murase et al., 2020</xref>). To gain further insight into the regulation of global DNA methylation profiles in cjPGCLCs, we evaluated expression dynamics of genes related to DNA methylation. Among de novo DNA methyl transferases, <italic>DNMT3B</italic> was highly expressed in cjiPSCs, but exhibited a sharp downregulation upon cjPGCLC induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>DNMT3A</italic> showed modest downregulation upon cjPGCLC induction, and <italic>DNMT3L</italic> was expressed only at low levels in all cells examined. Among the genes related to maintenance of DNA methylation, <italic>DNMT1</italic> was expressed at a significant level in all cells analyzed, whereas <italic>UHRF1</italic>, which is responsible for the recruitment of <italic>DNMT1</italic> into replication foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kagiwada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sharif et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bostick et al., 2007</xref>), showed a marked reduction upon cjPGCLC induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In cjPGCLC expansion cultures, <italic>DNMT3B</italic> expression was further downregulated whereas <italic>UHRF1</italic> showed slightly higher expression than d4/6 cjPGCLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Among genes related to active DNA demethylation, <italic>TET1</italic> was highly expressed in all cells whereas expression of <italic>TET2</italic> and <italic>TET3</italic> were very low. Thus, compared to cjiPSCs, cjPGCLCs at d6 or in expansion culture showed reduced but detectable levels of <italic>DNMT3B</italic> and <italic>UHRF1</italic>, which might serve as a basis for the modest reduction of global DNA methylation of these cells. In mice, EHMT2 (~E7.5 onward) followed by EHMT1 (~E9.5 onward) are downregulated in PGCs, which might account for low global H3K9Me2 levels. Similar to human PGCLCs, we found that cjPGC/cjPGCLCs both show marked downregulation, which might explain the low global H3K9me2 levels. Overall, the expression pattern of epigenetic modifiers, including those related to DNA methylation, is similar to those observed in endogenous cjPGCs at E50 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), further supporting the notion that cjPGCLCs derived by our protocol accurately resemble endogenous pre-migratory cjPGCs.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Genome-wide DNA methylation in <italic>Callithrix jacchus</italic> primordial germ cell-like cells (cjPGCLCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Boxplot showing overall CpG DNA methylation levels.

Previous studies demonstrated the presence of POU5F1<sup>+</sup>NANOG<sup>+</sup> cjPGCs localized within the hindgut endoderm in an E50 embryo, similar to that observed in human and monkey embryos at equivalent stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aeckerle et al., 2015</xref>). We extended this study and further provided the first comprehensive immunophenotypic and transcriptomic profile of cjPGCs from E50 embryos (CS11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). We discovered that cjPGCs displayed immunophenotypic and transcriptomic features characteristic of endogenous PGCs of humans and old-world monkeys. For example, they expressed key primate germ cell specifier genes (<italic>SOX17</italic>, <italic>SOX15</italic>, <italic>TFAP2C PRDM1</italic>, <italic>PRDM14</italic> [at low levels]), and lacked <italic>SOX2</italic>. In contrast, mouse germ cells highly express <italic>SOX2</italic> but only transiently express <italic>SOX17</italic> immediately after specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kurimoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Western et al., 2005</xref>). Recent studies suggest that these features are also shared in rabbits and pigs, suggesting that the germline gene regulatory networks functioning in primates are more widespread evolutionary than that of rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobayashi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, cjPGCs in E50 (CS11) embryos are primarily pre-migratory (i.e., localized within the hindgut endoderm), and exhibit features of early PGCs (i.e., lack of DDX4 or DAZL expression) similar to PGCs of cynomolgus monkeys at the corresponding developmental stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, human/cynomolgus PGCs at the same chronologic age (E50) already colonize the gonads and upregulate DDX4/DAZL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castrillon et al., 2000</xref>). This finding is likely due to the overall delay in early post-implantation embryo development in marmoset and suggest that germ cell development is synchronized with overall embryo development rather than chronologic age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Phillips, 1976</xref>).</p><p>With immunophenotypic and transcriptomic characterization of cjPGCs in hand, we were now able to validate methods required to generate cjiPSCs, which could subsequently be used to assess molecular events associated with germline induction. To this end, we first established various culture methods for cjiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Previous studies suggested that cynomolgus ESCs cultured in DK20 on MEF were prone to differentiate, but that inhibition of WNT signaling in these cultures stabilized the undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2020</xref>). Consistently, we found that inhibition of WNT signaling by IWR1 stabilized the undifferentiated state of cjiPSC cultured on MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, our newly established PluriSTEM-based FF cjiPSC culture method facilitated stable maintenance of an undifferentiated state, regardless of the presence or absence of IWR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). This might be due to the inclusion of proprietary factors in the PluriSTEM base medium that support the undifferentiated state. Nonetheless, despite the distinct propensities toward differentiation, the cjiPSCs used in this study exhibited gene expression characteristics of primed-state pluripotency and could be maintained across multiple passages in all of above culture conditions.</p><p>Our successful identification of culture conditions capable of generating and maintaining cjiPSCs allowed us to next compare their competency to differentiate into cjPGCLCs. Although cjiPSCs cultured under various conditions were all pluripotent as evidenced by pluripotency-associated gene expression and outcomes of a trilineage differentiation assay, they differed substantially in germline competency. Specifically, we noted that FF cjiPSCs (with or without IWR1) had no germline competency whereas OF and OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs had modest and high germline competency, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Transcriptomes of FF, OF, OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs aligned accordingly on the PC space, where FF cjiPSCs were the most distant from and OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs were the closest to cjPGCLCs. As both FF and OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs are pluripotent and can be cultured stably without overt meso/endodermal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>), these findings suggest that pluripotency/differentiation state per se might not be the primary reason why FF cijPSCs are completely devoid of germline competency. Rather, a comparison of OF/IWR1 (vs. OF) and OF (vs. FF cjiPSCs) revealed that upregulation of a number of genes related to UPS protein catabolism, particularly those within the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex known as the Skp, Cullin, F-box containing (SCF) complex (e.g., <italic>UBE3A</italic>, <italic>FBXW7</italic>), correlated with increased germline competency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The vast majority of these genes continued to be expressed in d2 cjPGCLCs, which suggests their potential role in germ cell specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). In line with this, recent studies highlighted the critical role of the UPS system, and in particular FBXW7, in regulation of pluripotency and germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanatsu-Shinohara et al., 2014</xref>). Further mechanistic studies investigating the role of UPS and protein catabolism in germline competency and cjPGCLCs specification are warranted.</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence that cjPGCLCs can be derived from cjiPSCs through direct floating culture of OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs in the presence of a PGCLC induction cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2020</xref>). Under these conditions, cjPGCLCs were induced in a highly efficient manner, with the number of PDPN<sup>+</sup> cjPGCLCs peaking at d4 (~600 cells/aggregate). The marmoset germline induction efficiency is higher than that of hPGCLCs induced under direct floating culture and similar to those induced through a stepwise method (2D induction of incipient mesoderm-like cells [iMeLCs] by ACTIVIN A and WNT agonist, CHIR99021, followed by floating culture with PGCLC induction factors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>). Since the iMeLC induction step is not essential for robust PGCLC induction in cynomolgus monkeys, these results highlight differential requirements for WNT/NODAL/ACTIVIN signaling to prime PGCLC specification, and/or differential endogenous production by the aggregates themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, lineage trajectory analysis of emerging cjPGCLCs revealed the transient upregulation of mesodermal program (e.g., <italic>EOMES</italic>, <italic>MIXL1</italic>) at d2 cjPGCLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7F and G</xref>), similar to d2 cynomolgus PGCLCs and human iMeLCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kojima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakai et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that germline developmental programs from pluripotency are overall conserved across primate species.</p><p>Interestingly, a previous study by Okano and colleagues failed to produce cjPGCLCs from cjiPSCs by floating culture using a PGCLC induction cocktail similar to ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshimatsu et al., 2021</xref>). This may in part be due to the relatively poor germline competency of cjiPSCs/ESCs used in that study, which were cultured under conventional OF condition without IWR1. To overcome the lack of induction, these authors employed an alternative approach in which cytokine-based induction was combined with over-expression of key PGC specifier transcription factors, <italic>PRDM1</italic> and <italic>SOX17</italic>. Although this approach allowed induction of PRDM1-Venus<sup>+</sup> cjPGCLCs from both cjESCs and cjiPSCs, the efficiency was variable, with two cjESC lines showing 30–40% induction and a cjiPSC line showing only 1.7% efficiency. Moreover, DDX4 was upregulated in some of PRDM1::Venus<sup>+</sup> cells as early as d9-10. In primates including marmoset, DDX4 is not expressed in pre-migratory PGCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>), and human PGCLCs upregulate DDX4 only after prolonged xrTestis/xrOvary culture in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hwang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamashiro et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the induction method utilized in this study might not fully recapitulate the physiological germ cell developmental trajectory. Whether over-expression of transcription factors can drive cjPGCLC formation from the OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs with high germ cell competency that we established in this study remains to be determined.</p><p>In summary, the in vitro platform described here enables efficient induction of cjPGCLCs from cjiPSCs, which will serve as a foundation for analyzing mechanisms of PGC specification in marmoset monkeys. Although the road ahead will likely be long, efforts to develop IVG in marmosets, which allows functional validation by fertilization and creation of offspring, may ultimately provide a suitable preclinical model of human IVG.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Collection of marmoset embryo samples</title><p>Marmosets were housed at the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC), Texas Biomedical Research Institute, an AAALAC accredited institution.

GATK best practices were used with minor alterations. Calling of genetic variants in marmosets has been performed only on a small scale, thus providing limited information for recalibration of base qualities.

The within-sample allele frequency across all sites was indicative of the level of chimerism present.

In a diploid individual, unfixed sites should display a sharp peak in allele frequency at approximately 50% after exclusion of homozygous sites. This distribution can shift according to the level of chimerism present. We devised a simple model wherein the chimeric fraction was estimated by maximum likelihood.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>cjPGCLC induction</title><p>cjiPSCs were maintained by feeder-free condition. These cells were harvested and subsequently cultured on Mitomycin C-treated MEFs in the presence of DK20F20 medium until it becomes confluent (6–7 days). In some experiments, IWR1 (2.5 µM) was added to DK20F20 medium. After treatment with Accutase, single-cell suspension were prepared for cjPGCLCs induction. The cjPGCLCs were induced by plating of 3500 cjiPSCs per well of a low cell binding V-bottom 96-well plate (Greiner, 651970) in GK15 (GMEM (Thermo Fisher, 11710035), 15% KSR, 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 25 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin) or aRB27 (Advanced RPMI 1640 [Thermo Fisher, 12633-012]), 2×B27 [Thermo Fisher, 17504044, 0.1 mM NEAA, 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and 25 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin] supplemented with 200 ng/ml of BMP4 (R&amp;D Systems, 314 BP-010), human LIF at 1000 U/ml, SCF (R&amp;D Systems, 255-SC-010) at 200 ng/ml, EGF (R&amp;D Systems, 236-EG) at 100 ng/ml, and 10 mM ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632).

Briefly, the STO cell line (American Type Culture Collection, 1503) was maintained in DMEM (Gibco, 11965-084) containing 10% FBS (Gibco) and penicillin-streptomycin at 25 U/ml. STO cells were treated with Mitomycin C (MMC) (Sigma, M0503) at 10 μg/ml for 2 hr and then harvested by trypsinization.

First, to isolate fetal testicular somatic cells, E12.5 mouse embryos were isolated from timed pregnant ICR females and collected in chilled DMEM (Gibco) containing 10% FBS (Gibco) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Fetal testes were identified by their appearance, and the mesonephros were removed by tungsten needles. Isolated testes were washed with PBS and then incubated with dissociation buffer for 15 min at 37°C with periodic pipetting. The dissociation buffer contained 1 mg/ml Hyaluronidase Type IV (Sigma), 5 U Dispase (Corning), and 5 U DNase (Qiagen) in wash buffer (100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 0.1% BSA in DMEM/F12). After another PBS wash, testes were dissociated into single cells using 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA in PBS for 10 min at 37°C followed by quenching with FBS. Cell suspensions were strained through a 70 µm nylon cell strainer and centrifuged. The remaining cell pellet was then resuspended with MACS buffer (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) and incubated with anti-SSEA1 antibody MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) for 20 min on ice before being washed with MACS buffer and centrifuged. The cell pellet was again resuspended in MACS buffer and then applied to an MS column (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The flow-through cells were centrifuged, resuspended with Cell Banker Type I, and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen until use. All centrifugations were performed at 232×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min and were followed by removal of the supernatant. To generate floating aggregates, c10 cjPGCLCs (5000 cells per xrTestis) and thawed fetal testicular somatic cells (60,000 cells per xrTestis) were mixed and plated in a Lipidure-coated U-bottom 96-well plate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 174925) in Minimum Essential Medium alpha (α-MEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% KSR (Gibco), 55 µM 2-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco), and 10 µM Y-27632. After 2 days of floating culture, floating aggregates were transferred onto Transwell-COL membrane inserts (Corning, 3496) using a glass capillary. Membrane inserts were soaked in α-MEM supplemented as described above, without Y-27632. xrTestes were cultured at 37°C under an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in air and one-half the volume of medium was changed every 3 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>IF analysis</title><p>For IF analysis, floating aggregates during cjPGCLC induction and xrTestes were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 3 hr on ice, washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 (PBST) and then successively immersed in 10% and 30% sucrose (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in PBS overnight at 4°C. The fixed tissues were embedded in OCT compound (Thermo Fisher Scientific), frozen and sectioned to 10 μm thickness with a −20°C cryostat (Leica, CM1800). Sections were placed on Superfrost Microscope glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which were then air-dried and stored at −80°C until use. Before staining, slides were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with blocking solution (5% normal goat serum in PBST) for 1 hr. Slides were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 hr, then with secondary antibodies and 1 μg/ml DAPI in blocking solution for 50 min. Both incubations were performed at room temperature and followed by four PBS washes. For negative control of IF studies, samples were not treated with primary antibodies whereas the remaining procedures remained the same (please refer to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

After dehydration, tissues were embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned at 4 μm thickness with a microtome (Thermo Scientific Microm HM325) and placed on Superfrost Microscope glass slides. Paraffin sections were then de-paraffinized with xylene. Antigens were retrieved by treatment of sections with HistoVT One (Nacalai USA) for 35 min at 90°C and then for 15 min at room temperature. The staining and incubation procedure for paraffin sections was similar to that for frozen sections, with the following modifications: the blocking solution was 5% normal donkey serum in PBST; the primary antibody incubation was performed overnight at 4°C; and slides were washed with PBS six times after each incubation. Slides were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium for confocal microscopic analysis.</p><p>For IF of expansion cultured cjPGCLCs, the cells were cultured on STO plated Glass Bottom Dishes (Matsunami, D11130H).

It is noted that OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs are transcriptionally very similar to cjPJCLCs. This raises doubts as to whether these two cell types are really distinct, i.e., whether the cjPGCLCs generated have been derived from a true iPSC state. Are OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs an intermediate primed/differentiated state that is required for germline induction from iPSCs? How dissimilar are OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs and cjPGCLCs? Are OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs still pluripotent (see below)?</p><p>2. Comparisons between cjPGCs and cjPGCLCs are limited to Pearson's correlation analysis. A more detailed description of the transcriptomic similarities between these in vivo and in vitro cell types should be provided.</p><p>3. While the absence of mycoplasma and a stable karyotype are encouraging features when describing the iPSC lines that are generated, functional evidence of iPSC properties (pluripotency) is lacking. The authors should validate whether the iPSCs are pluripotent through tri-lineage differentiation using an embryoid body assay followed by either immunostaining or RT-PCR to detect germ layer markers. Please also provide expression results for pluripotency surface markers (likely to include SSEA3, 4 and PODXL for marmosets). OCT3/4, <italic>SOX2</italic>, and NANOG expression and morphology are not sufficient for iPSC validation. Please also compare validation results between iPSCs under each culture condition.</p><p>4. Negative controls should be included in IF results in the supplementary data. These should show both secondary antibody-only results, as well as staining in iPSCs as a further negative control.</p><p>5. Please provide a sentence in the introduction or the results to give context for why PDPN marks cjPGCLS, i.e., what does it mark and in which species?</p><p>6. The authors discuss methylation in cjPGCs and then later cjPGCLS. However, only UHRF1 and de novo methyltransferases are reported as associated with both cell types. Do cjPGCLCs show similar expression of demethylases and enzymes involved in the deposition of H3K9Me2/3 as reported for cjPGCs?</p><p>7. Spelling/grammatical errors: Pierson should be Pearson. in vitro/in vivo are not always italicised. Expension should be expansion in Figure 6.C. Callithrix Jacchus: the second word should not be capitalised in species names.</p><p>8. Results: Transcriptome accompanying formation of cjPGCLCs, paragraph 2: &quot;Clustering analysis of variably expressed genes across the developmental trajectory…&quot; It is very unclear which developmental trajectory is being referred to here. As far as can be seen, Cluster 1 refers to iPSCs, but which type is not specified; Cluster 2: Not specified, the authors simply state &quot;along the trajectory&quot;; which cell-line and which stage has produced this cluster must be reported. Cluster 3: 2D expansion cells, and Cluster 4: Refers to d2 cjPGCLCs. Taken together, these cell types do not represent a developmental trajectory. This needs to be clarified if indeed the authors intend to represent the trajectory from iPSCs to PGCLCs. A visual schematic would further clarify how these represent a trajectory.</p><p>9. The potential role of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) should only be described in the discussion. Evidence for this is not robust enough to be reported in the results, as this is based on one GO term, for &quot;ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process&quot;.</p><p>10. Results displayed from whole genome bisulphite sequencing are quite limited. A more detailed analysis of this dataset should be provided.</p><p>11. The generation of DDX4 and DAZL positive cells in reconstituted testis culture that represent prospermatogonia are described as &quot;a few&quot;. Please provide quantification to indicate the efficiency of generating these cells.</p><p>12. There appears to be a direct contradiction in the discussion, with a statement made in the results. The results state that the OF/IWR1 condition suppressed the problematic expression of genes involved in meso/endoderm differentiation. However, the discussion states that transcriptomic analysis revealed no differences in genes associated with meso/endodermal differentiation between iPSC culture conditions. Please clarify this.</p><p>13. Because IWR1 had no effect on iPSCs in FF conditions, the authors suggest factors in Pluristem better support the undifferentiated state. However, these cells are not germline competent. The best outcomes have been produced by OF conditions with IWR1. No explanation is provided for why these conditions support differentiation to the germ lineage. While this is attributed to the upregulation of genes associated with the UPS, no explanation is given for what factors in the media have caused this upregulation. An additional explanation is required here to provide a link between the growth factors and small molecules present in the superior condition, and the upregulation of these genes. Furthermore, the role of WNT inhibition in germline specification requires elucidation since it dramatically increases efficiency in the OF conditions. How might inhibition of this pathway interact with the OF conditions?</p><p>14. Figure 6: D: Please provide a legend for the clusters; E and F: It is not clear which plot represents which gene.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82263.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The functionality of generated cells (both germ cells and the starting iPSC populations) is critical.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful comment. We understand the importance of functional assessment of in vitro derived germ cells, which in a strict sense, requires derivation of spermatozoa and fertilization to generate offspring. However, such a feat has not yet been accomplished using in vitro derived germ cells in any primate species. While we are currently attempting to overcome the multiple technical hurdles that challenge in vitro derivation of primate gametes and are setting up a transplantation scheme in which to assess the functionality of in vitro derived germ cells in our 5-year U01 consortium funded by NIH, it is not realistic to include such data in this revision in a timely manner. In regard to the functionality of cjiPSCs, we have added additional validation of cjiPSCs cultured under various conditions using flow cytometric evaluation of pluripotency markers (i.e., SSEA3, SSEA4) and a trilineage differentiation assay. These studies confirmed that both on feeder (with or without IWR1) and feeder free cjiPSCs bear pluripotency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We have compared E50 cjPGCs in vivo and cjPGCLCs derived in vitro and demonstrated the overall similarities between E50 cjPGCs and d6 cjPGCLCs (Figure 7I-M). We also noted some differences between in vivo and in vitro cells, which might be exaggerated because of the limited number of cjPGCs available in this study (Figure 7I-M). We are currently undergoing extensive characterization of in vivo cjPGCs at various stages, which will enable more precise mapping of our cjPGCLCs in developmental coordinates in vivo. This will be published separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In particular, as the reviewer suggested, we have made the pairwise comparison between d6 cjPGCLCs and E50 cjPGCs. Key germ cell marker/specifier genes were equally expressed between cjPGCLCs in vitro and cjPGCs in vivo (Figure 7I-L). Neither cell types expressed post-migratory germ cell markers (e.g., <italic>DDX4</italic>, <italic>DAZL</italic>), suggesting that they are both at pre-migratory stage (Figure 1, 2, 3, 4). We also noted some transcriptional differences between E50 cjPGCs in vivo and d6 cjPGCLCs in vitro (Figure 7M). Some of these up- and down-regulated genes might be due to culture adaptation or differential nutritional environment (e.g., “actin cytoskeleton organization” or “response to insulin”). Notably, d6 cjPGCLCs showed more genes related to cell division/apoptosis, which might indicate that they are more proliferative. Some genes encoding zinc-finger proteins were more upregulated in E50 cjPGCs, which might reflect their differences of developmental stage or the absence of key signals in cjPGCLCs. These points have been addressed in the revised manuscript (page 13, Results, “scRNA-seq revealed lineage trajectory and gene expression dynamics during formation of cjPGCLCs”). Because we have sampled in vivo cjPGCs only at E50, it is difficult to map the exact developmental stage of cjPGCLCs on the in vivo germline trajectory. We are currently collecting cjPGCs at broad developmental stages, which will allow more precise determination of the developmental stage of cjPGCLCs in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The reconstituted gonad suggests the successful generation of spermatogonia-like cells.

Overall scarcity of cells and lack of fluorescence reporters (DAZL and DDX4 are cytoplasmic proteins necessitating technically challenging intracellular staining procedure to be assessed by flow cytometry), we were not able to provide the flow cytometric plots in this study.

Are OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs still pluripotent (see below)?</p></disp-quote><p>Although OF/IWR1 cjiPSCs are closer to cjPGCLCs than cjiPSCs cultured in other conditions, they are pluripotent (as evidenced by trilineage differentiation assay, morphological assessment, and expression of pluripotency markers, Figure 3—figure supplement 2) and do not express most of key germ cell markers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). Our newly added scRNA-seq analyses also highlighted the differences between OF/IWR1 and cjPGCLCs and the molecular dynamics associated with the transition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Comparisons between cjPGCs and cjPGCLCs are limited to Pearson's correlation analysis. A more detailed description of the transcriptomic similarities between these in vivo and in vitro cell types should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been now described using scRNA-seq data of both E50 cjPGCs and d6 cjPGCLCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While the absence of mycoplasma and a stable karyotype are encouraging features when describing the iPSC lines that are generated, functional evidence of iPSC properties (pluripotency) is lacking. The authors should validate whether the iPSCs are pluripotent through tri-lineage differentiation using an embryoid body assay followed by either immunostaining or RT-PCR to detect germ layer markers. Please also provide expression results for pluripotency surface markers (likely to include SSEA3, 4 and PODXL for marmosets). OCT3/4, SOX2, and NANOG expression and morphology are not sufficient for iPSC validation. Please also compare validation results between iPSCs under each culture condition.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed tri-lineage differentiation assay for each culture condition and added surface marker expression data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Negative controls should be included in IF results in the supplementary data. These should show both secondary antibody-only results, as well as staining in iPSCs as a further negative control.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included negative control data in the revised manuscript (Figure 1–Source Data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please provide a sentence in the introduction or the results to give context for why PDPN marks cjPGCLS, i.e., what does it mark and in which species?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following sentence: “As we and others have previously identified that TFAP2C, SOX17 and PDPN specifically mark pre-migratory/migratory PGCs and PGCLCs in humans and macaque monkeys<sup>7,14–16</sup>, we attempted to trace cjPGCs using these markers.” (page 5, Results, “Immunohistochemical characterization of pre-migratory cjPGCs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors discuss methylation in cjPGCs and then later cjPGCLS. However, only UHRF1 and de novo methyltransferases are reported as associated with both cell types. Do cjPGCLCs show similar expression of demethylases and enzymes involved in the deposition of H3K9Me2/3 as reported for cjPGCs?</p></disp-quote><p>We had already described demethylases and enzymes involved in the deposition of H3K9me2/3 for cjPGCLCs in Figure 8D (Figure 7D in the older version). Regarding demethylases, <italic>TET1</italic> was highly expressed in both cjPGCLCs and cjPGCs, which might partly explain the modest demethylation occurring in cjPGCLCs. In mice, <italic>EHMT2</italic> (~E7.5 onwards) followed by <italic>EHMT1</italic> (E9.5 onwards) were downregulated in PGCs, which seems to be the basis of low global H3K9Me2 levels(Sekl et al., 2007). Similar to human PGCLCs (Sasaki et al., 2015), we found that cjPGC/cjPGCLCs both show marked downregulation, which might explain the low global H3K9me2 levels. These points have been added to the revised manuscript (page 15, Results, “Global DNA methylation in cjPGCLCs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Spelling/grammatical errors: Pierson should be Pearson. in vitro/in vivo are not always italicised. Expension should be expansion in Figure 6.C.

These have been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Results: Transcriptome accompanying formation of cjPGCLCs, paragraph 2: &quot;Clustering analysis of variably expressed genes across the developmental trajectory…&quot; It is very unclear which developmental trajectory is being referred to here. As far as can be seen, Cluster 1 refers to iPSCs, but which type is not specified; Cluster 2: Not specified, the authors simply state &quot;along the trajectory&quot;; which cell-line and which stage has produced this cluster must be reported. Cluster 3: 2D expansion cells, and Cluster 4: Refers to d2 cjPGCLCs. Taken together, these cell types do not represent a developmental trajectory. This needs to be clarified if indeed the authors intend to represent the trajectory from iPSCs to PGCLCs. A visual schematic would further clarify how these represent a trajectory.</p></disp-quote><p>Our original analysis revealed which cell lines produced clusters (Figure 6A) and defined the stages of the trajectory (iPSCs feeder free, iPSCs on feeder, PGCLCs, expansion, Figure 6C). The four clusters to which the reviewer refers are gene clusters that are defined by unsupervised clustering analysis of variably expressed genes across the samples (Figure 6D). As it is defined computationally, it is not possible to unequivocally define gene clusters by particular cell types. However, we found that these gene clusters revealed insightful patterns (1, genes higher in cjiPSCs; 2, genes higher in cjPGCLCs; 3, genes higher in expansion culture cjPGCLCs; 4, genes higher in d2 cjPGCLCs). We have added sample information to the Figure 6D to further clarify the meaning of the data and a brief explanation of gene clusters in the figure legend. To define the trajectory in a more unbiased manner, we performed scRNA-seq and have added additional trajectory analyses (Figure 7A-K in the revised manuscript). Moreover, we also added the transcriptomic comparison as the reviewer suggested (Figure 7L, M in the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The potential role of the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) should only be described in the discussion. Evidence for this is not robust enough to be reported in the results, as this is based on one GO term, for &quot;ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this description from the result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Results displayed from whole genome bisulphite sequencing are quite limited. A more detailed analysis of this dataset should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>This bisulfite sequencing is based on shallow sequencing that allowed estimation of the overall genome-wide DNA methylation levels and was not intended for base-resolution mapping of DNA methylation. Such analyses requires labor intensive and highly expensive efforts. We believe that our approach provided sufficient information to substantiate our claim and defer the base-resolution DNA methylome analyses to our next paper, which is part of our U01 consortium specific aims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The generation of DDX4 and DAZL positive cells in reconstituted testis culture that represent prospermatogonia are described as &quot;a few&quot;. Please provide quantification to indicate the efficiency of generating these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>By IF analyses, we identified 0.89 and 3.3% of DAZL or DDX4 positive cells, respectively (DDX4<sup>+</sup>TFAP2C<sup>+</sup> cells [4/123, 3.3% among all TFAP2C<sup>+</sup> cells] and DAZL<sup>+</sup>TFAP2C<sup>+</sup> cells [2/232, 0.86% among all TFAP2C<sup>+</sup> cells]). Overall scarcity of cells and lack of fluorescence reporters (DAZL and DDX4 are cytoplasmic proteins necessitating technically challenging intracellular staining procedure to be assessed by flow cytometry), we were not able to provide the flow cytometric plots in this study. This point has been described in the revised manuscript (page 11, Results, “Maturation of cjPGCLCs into early prospermatogonia-like state”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. There appears to be a direct contradiction in the discussion, with a statement made in the results. The results state that the OF/IWR1 condition suppressed the problematic expression of genes involved in meso/endoderm differentiation. However, the discussion states that transcriptomic analysis revealed no differences in genes associated with meso/endodermal differentiation between iPSC culture conditions. Please clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Because IWR1 had no effect on iPSCs in FF conditions, the authors suggest factors in Pluristem better support the undifferentiated state. However, these cells are not germline competent. The best outcomes have been produced by OF conditions with IWR1. No explanation is provided for why these conditions support differentiation to the germ lineage. While this is attributed to the upregulation of genes associated with the UPS, no explanation is given for what factors in the media have caused this upregulation. An additional explanation is required here to provide a link between the growth factors and small molecules present in the superior condition, and the upregulation of these genes. Furthermore, the role of WNT inhibition in germline specification requires elucidation since it dramatically increases efficiency in the OF conditions. How might inhibition of this pathway interact with the OF conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>It is unclear at this point why Wnt inhibition in OF cjiPS culture conditions facilitates germ cell specification upon cjPGCLCs induction. One possibility is that some of the cells in OF cjiPSCs are already primed towards different lineages. Another possibility is that this relates to differential expression of the UPS system. Future mechanistic studies are required to resolve this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Figure 6: D: Please provide a legend for the clusters; E and F: It is not clear which plot represents which gene.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 6E and F are intended to show the overall pattern of mesodermal and endodermal genes transiently upregulated at d2 cjPGCLCs. Readers can refer to Figure 6G and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 for key gene expression. Also note that these findings were confirmed by scRNA-seq analyses (Figure 7F, G), for which some of the key genes have also been shown (Figure 7F).</p><p>References</p><p>Sasaki K, Yokobayashi S, Nakamura T, Okamoto I, Yabuta Y, Kurimoto K, Ohta H, Moritoki Y, Iwatani C, Tsuchiya H, Nakamura S, Sekiguchi K, Sakuma T, Yamamoto Takashi, Mori T, Woltjen K, Nakagawa M, Yamamoto Takuya, Takahashi K, Yamanaka S, Saitou M. 2015.
