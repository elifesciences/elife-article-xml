In nervous system, microtubules are the major route for cargo protein trafficking and they specially extend into and out of synapses to regulate synaptic development and plasticity. However, the detailed depolymerization mechanism that regulates dynamic microtubules in synapses and dendrites is still unclear. In this study, we find that KIF2C, a dynamic microtubule depolymerization protein without known function in the nervous system, plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional plasticity of synapses and regulates cognitive function in mice. Through its microtubule depolymerization capability, KIF2C regulates microtubule dynamics in dendrites, and regulates microtubule invasion of spines in neurons in a neuronal activity-dependent manner. Using RNAi knockdown and conditional knockout approaches, we showed that KIF2C regulates spine morphology and synaptic membrane expression of AMPA receptors. Moreover, KIF2C deficiency leads to impaired excitatory transmission, long-term potentiation, and altered cognitive behaviors in mice. Collectively, our study explores a novel function of KIF2C in the nervous system and provides an important regulatory mechanism on how activity-dependent microtubule dynamic regulates synaptic plasticity and cognition behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>microtubule depolymerization</kwd><kwd>spine invasion</kwd><kwd>cognition</kwd><kwd>long-term potentiation</kwd><kwd>KIF2C</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970902</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Junyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3192010300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Jianhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32000692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xintai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31871418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Jianhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81821091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Jianhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LD19H090002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Jianhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LR19H090001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Junyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Special Project for Research and Development in Key areas of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019B030335001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Junyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong SAR, China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16103520</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xia</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KIF2C plays an important role in synaptic plasticity and cognition behaviors in mice by regulating activity-dependent microtubule dynamic.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) are eukaryotic cytoskeletons that play an important role in cell function. In the central nervous system, MTs serve as a structural basis for trafficking material throughout the neuron and are the primary regulators of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dent and Baas, 2014</xref>). The MTs dynamic instability, that is the growing or shrinking of MT plus end, has been detected in both shaft and dendritic protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1984</xref>) and is involved in spine formation and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merriam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tada and Sheng, 2006</xref>). Inhibition of MT polymerization results in deficits in long-term potentiation (LTP) and negatively affects memory formation or retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shumyatsky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaworski et al., 2009</xref>). The abnormal MTs dynamics is associated with several neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunden et al., 2014</xref>). During neuronal activities, MTs can be regulated to extend from the dendritic shaft into spines and affect synaptic structure and function (<italic>3-8</italic>), which could be an important event for synaptic plasticity. However, regulatory mechanism underlying MT dynamics in or out from synapse upon neuronal activity is still unclear, nor its role in learning and memory.</p><p>The polymerization dynamics of MTs are essential for their biological functions and can be regulated by many MT-associated proteins (MAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowne-Anderson et al., 2015</xref>). The kinesin-13 family of kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) has a distinct function in depolymerizing MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howard and Hyman, 2007</xref>), and therefore is involved in many MT-dependent events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kline-Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Homma et al., 2003</xref>). KIF2C, also called mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK), is the best-characterized family member and is localized to the spindle poles, spindle midzone, and kinetochores in dividing cells. KIF2C utilizes MT depolymerase activity to regulate spindle formation and correct inappropriate MT attachments at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gorbsky, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Helenius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knowlton et al., 2006</xref>). KIF2C uses ATP hydrolysis for MT depolymerization from both ends and directly interacts with EBs to enhance its destabilizing ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wordeman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Walczak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). Particularly, KIF2C is associated with Alzheimer’s disease and suicidality psychiatric disorders. In vitro study showed that Oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) directly inhibits the MT-dependent ATPase activity of KIF2C and leads to abnormal mitotic spindles, which may cause chromosome mis-segregation and increased aneuploid neurons and thereby contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borysov et al., 2011</xref>). Clinical evidence shows that KIF2C is significantly decreased in suicidal ideation cohort and could be utilized as a reference for predicting suicidality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niculescu et al., 2015</xref>). However, the in vivo physiological function of KIF2C in the CNS remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In this study, we have found that KIF2C in the CNS is expressed in a brain-wide and synaptic localized pattern, which could be regulated by neuronal activity. Using a nervous-system-specific KIF2C conditional knockout (cKO) mouse, we further confirmed its pivotal role in spine morphology, synaptic transmission, and synaptic plasticity. By re-expression of KIF2C wild-type (WT) and MT depolymerization-defective mutation, we have found that KIF2C regulates synaptic plasticity by mediating MT depolymerization and affecting MT synaptic invasion. Furthermore, KIF2C cKO mice exhibit deficiencies in multiple cognition-associated tasks, which could be rescued by re-expression of KIF2C(WT) but not the MT depolymerization-defective mutant. Overall, our study explores a novel function of KIF2C in neurons and synaptic plasticity, and reveals how MT dynamics in synapses upon neuronal activity contributes to cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KIF2C is highly expressed in the brain and at the synapse</title><p>Previous studies have showed that KIF2C plays an important role during cell division in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sanhaji et al., 2014</xref>); however, it is not clear whether KIF2C is also present in the nervous system. Western blot analyses showed that KIF2C was expressed in multiple regions of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and shows sustained high expression in the hippocampus throughout the postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To identify KIF2C abundance in neurons, western blot analyses were performed on whole-cell extracts of cultured hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The results showed that KIF2C was expressed in a development-related pattern in cultured neurons: detectable at day in vitro 3 (DIV 3) and significantly increased at DIV 10. Moreover, the subcellular fractionation analysis showed an enrichment of KIF2C in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Immunofluorescent staining of cultured neurons revealed KIF2C expression as granular puncta of different sizes along dendrites overlapping with the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 and presynaptic protein Bassoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These results show that KIF2C is abundantly expressed in CNS neurons and is enriched at postsynaptic density, suggesting a possible function in synapses.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of KIF2C in the central nervous system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of KIF2C in different mouse brain regions by immunoblotting.

The results showed that KIF2C knockdown did not affect spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Electrophysiological recordings also showed similar frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory synaptic currents (mEPSCs) in control and knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, C), suggesting that acute knockdown of KIF2C in cultured neurons does not affect basal synaptic transmission. We then investigated whether KIF2C regulates spine morphology in an activity-dependent manner. The induction of LTP results in changes in spine structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fifková, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oertner and Matus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vlachos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fortin et al., 2010</xref>). To test whether KIF2C is involved in spine structural plasticity, we further conducted a glycine-induced chemical LTP (cLTP) assay to produce synaptic enhancements that mimic LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2001</xref>) in KIF2C knockdown hippocampal neurons. Spine density in knockdown neurons was consistent with control after cLTP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). However, the spine head width significantly increased in control hippocampal neurons, whereas it was not affected in the KIF2C knockdown neurons after cLTP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that KIF2C is essential for spine structural plasticity. In addition, both subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemical results showed that KIF2C was not colocalizing as much with PSD-95 and expressed more in dendritic shafts after cLTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>), suggesting a translocation of KIF2C from synaptic protrusions into dendrites.

Mice were injected with either AAV-scramble shRNA (control) or AAV-KIF2C shRNA (sh<italic>kif2c</italic>) in the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and mEPSCs were recorded. Compared to the control, KIF2C knockdown neurons had enhanced amplitude but similar frequency of mEPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This discrepancy between cultured neurons and brain slices may result from activity-dependent synaptic scaling in free-behaving mice after viral injection. KIF2C knockdown blocked cLTP-induced increased spine width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), so we wondered whether the increased mEPSCs amplitude after cLTP stimulation could also be blocked in sh<italic>kif2c</italic> neurons. Hippocampal CA1 slices were incubated with ACSF or glycine (200 μM) for 10 min before mEPSCs recording. The results showed that mEPSCs amplitude was significantly increased in control hippocampal neurons, whereas it was not affected in the sh<italic>kif2c</italic> neurons after cLTP stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). These data indicate that KIF2C knockdown blocks the raise of mEPSCs amplitude induced by cLTP. Furthermore, we investigated whether KIF2C regulated presynaptic function retrogradely by comparing paired-pulse ratios (PPRs). KIF2C knockdown neurons exhibited comparable PPRs to the control, suggesting that KIF2C had a minimal effect on contacting presynaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, the excitatory postsynaptic current ratio of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR)/α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) was decreased in knockdown hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The input-output relationship of NMDAR/AMPAR-mediated EPSCs showed that amplitude of NMDAR-mediated EPSCs under various stimulation intensities was comparable, while AMPAR-mediated EPSCs was increased in KIF2C knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>), indicating a specific change in AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents. To test whether synaptic plasticity was affected in KIF2C knockdown neurons, we measured whole-cell LTP in CA1 pyramidal neurons by stimulating Schaffer collaterals. The magnitude of LTP was significantly attenuated in knockdown hippocampal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These results suggest that KIF2C is necessary for synaptic plasticity in hippocampal neurons, and its insufficiency may affect the basal function of AMPARs in the hippocampus.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Knockdown KIF2C impairs synaptic transmission and plasticity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mEPSCs recorded from control and sh<italic>kif2c</italic> CA1 pyramidal neurons. n = 10 per group, n.s., p &gt; 0.05, **p &lt; 0.01, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test; For the cumulative probability curves, *p &lt; 0.05, ***<italic>*</italic>p &lt; 0.0001, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.

Consistent with the shRNA knockdown experiments in CA1, the amplitude of mEPSCs increased in cKO mice compared to that in WT controls, whereas the frequency of mEPSCs was similar between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The increased mEPSC amplitude was not due to altered presynaptic activity as the PPRs were not affected in cKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating a postsynaptic influence in mEPSC property. Therefore, we examined the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio as well as the input-output relationship of NMDAR/AMPAR-mediated EPSCs.

Using the plusTipTracker software, which is designed to track MT growth parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Myers et al., 2011</xref>), we analyzed the polymerization properties of the EB3-labeled MT plus ends in dendrites. Depletion of KIF2C significantly increased MT plus-end growth speed (WT: 24.0 ± 1.1 μm / min, cKO: 31.0 ± 1.0 μm / min), and decreased its growth lifetime (WT: 9.4 ± 0.4 s, cKO: 6.7 ± 0.1 s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). MT plus end growth length was not significantly altered (WT: 3.1 ± 0.1 μm, cKO: 3.0 ± 0.1 μm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggest that KIF2C regulates MT depolymerization in hippocampal neurons and that MT dynamics become disordered with KIF2C deficiency.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Abnormal MT dynamics causes deficit in synaptic transmission and plasticity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time-lapse recordings of EB3-tdtomato-infected neurons showing EB3-tdtomato comets in dendrite of WT and cKO hippocampus neuron.

The conditioned fear learning test showed that KIF2C cKO mice displayed a comparatively weaker freezing response to the context and tone conditioned stimulus (CS) during the acquisition stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We monitored the conditioned freezing response to the background context and CS until seven or 8 days after acquisition, respectively, and found that cKO mice still showed less freezing time compared to WT mice, particularly in context-dependent freezing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These results suggest that fear memory in KIF2C cKO mice was impaired. The percentage change in freezing time between the KIF2C WT and cKO mice showed no significant difference, indicating an intact fear memory maintenance in cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In a prepulse inhibition test, WT and cKO mice showed the same extent of inhibition as the prepulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>), showing that the cKO mice had normal sensorimotor gating. In the three-chambered social test, both WT and KIF2C cKO mice exhibited no position preference in habituation stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G</xref>). KIF2C cKO mice exhibited a normal preference for the chamber in which a stranger mouse (S1) was present, compared with the empty chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). However, with the introduction of a second stranger (S2), KIF2C cKO mice exhibited no preference for the novel stranger (S2), compared with the familiar mouse (S1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). These results showed that KIF2C cKO mice showed normal sociability but significantly reduced social novelty, indicating that KIF2C is essential for social memory maintenance.</p><p>Based on the behavioral tests, we found that KIF2C plays an important role in CA1-mediated cognitive and memory functions. The deficiencies observed in the Y-maze test, cued conditioned fear memory, and three-chambered social test of KIF2C cKO mice were highly likely due to the lack of LTP in the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>). As re-expression of KIF2C(WT) in the CA1 region restored LTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), we speculated whether such CA1-specific rescue could also ameliorate the behavioral abnormalities in KIF2C cKO mice. In our pretests, over-expression of KIF2C in mice for a long time would lead to neuronal death (data not shown). Therefore, we re-expressed KIF2C in the cKO mice CA1 region using a doxycycline-induced viral expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and examined the rescuing effects in the Y-maze test and three-chambered social test. The results showed that cKO mice with KIF2C(WT) re-expression displayed a normal alternation in the Y-maze test compared to cKO mice with control virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Furthermore, cKO mice with KIF2C(WT) re-expression also showed normal interaction with the stranger mouse in the social novelty test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>). In addition, we tested whether the expression of the functional-null mutant KIF2C(G491A) in the CA1 region of cKO mice would have any rescue effect. The results showed that cKO mice injected with KIF2C(G491A) virus still showed impaired working and social memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that KIF2C is critical for cognitive function, and this functional role is mediated by its MT depolymerization ability in synapses during LTP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>KIF2C is an ATP-dependent MT depolymerization factor that functions in several mitotic processes, such as spindle assembly, MT dynamics, correct kinetochore-MT attachment, and chromosome positioning and segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanhaji et al., 2011</xref>). However, its function in the CNS was largely unknown. Our study elucidated the functions of KIF2C in regulating spine morphology, synaptic transmission, and plasticity in hippocampal neurons and its critical role in CA1-mediated cognitive behaviors. Our study unveils the critical role of KIF2C in the CNS, showing that its known function in regulating dynamic MT stability also takes place in neurons.</p><p>The stabilization of dendritic spines is an important structural basis for synaptic plasticity. According to our results, KIF2C deficiency seems to have higher impact on synaptic structure plasticity than that on spine formation, which provides a link between dynamic MT stability and synaptic plasticity. We have also found that both acute knockdown or genetic deficiency of KIF2C eliminated LTP but not LTD expression. On the molecular basis, KIF2C knockdown or cKO hippocampal neurons exhibited a higher AMPAR-mediated EPSC amplitude and an increase in surface AMPARs expression. It is possible that increased expression of ionic glutamate receptors, particularly AMPARs, on synapses leads to LTP occlusion. Moreover, 4-train LTP impairment in cKO mice, which requires further gene transcription and protein synthesis in the postsynaptic neuron, suggests that KIF2C might also be involved in the expression and/or transportation of synaptic substances for LTP long-lasting maintenance. It would be interesting to further explore the mechanism of KIF2C-involved receptor trafficking or synaptic expression.</p><p>As important architectural elements in neurons, MTs are also responsible for intracellular transport. It has been reported that NMDA receptors can be transported by KIF17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Setou et al., 2000</xref>) and AMPA receptors can be transported by KIF5 along MTs in dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Setou et al., 2002</xref>). It is possible that KIF2C regulates membrane receptor trafficking by mediating MT dynamics through the regulation of MT stability. We observed MT dynamics using live cell imaging of KIF2C cKO hippocampal neurons. We observed that depletion of KIF2C induced faster, shorter lived MT growth in dendrites. KIF2C deficiency also increased the frequency of MT invasion under basal conditions, which was probably due to the loss of MT polymerization suppression. These results suggest that KIF2C regulates MT depolymerization and stability in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, MT dynamic stability regulates AMPARs postsynaptic localization and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McVicker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>). In the case of AMPARs trafficking, MT-dependent trafficking has been typically associated with long-range transport along the dendrites, supporting the continuous supply and redistribution of AMPARs among synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoerndli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heisler et al., 2014</xref>), which can also be regulated by neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoerndli et al., 2013</xref>). We speculate that KIF2C may also confine the AMPARs’ trafficking to the synaptic site through MT depolymerization and stability.</p><p>Activity-dependent MT invasion of dendritic spines becomes disabled after BDNF stimulation in cKO hippocampal neurons. Our findings reveal that during cLTP induction, KIF2C was removed from the synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–I</xref>). It is possible that translocation of KIF2C out from synapse or depletion of synaptic KIF2C during synaptic activation is required to ensure robust MT invasion into spines, where and MT depolymerization should be inhibited. However, we still need direct evidence to prove this hypothesis. Even though the genetic depletion of KIF2C increases the basal MT invasion into spines, and largely prevents further increase in MT invasion after BDNF stimulation, we are not clear whether this is the result of depletion of KIF2C’s function in spines or a followup consequence after dendritic failure of MT depolymerization, that is, after depletion of KIF2C’s function in dendrites. KIF2C’s translocation after cLTP induction would be a touch to its pure role in spines, and it would be interesting to further explore the underlying mechanism.</p><p>Abnormal dynamic MT stability would further lead to synaptic plasticity failure and, finally, cognition defects. This hypothesis was further supported by our rescue experiments using the KIF2C(G491A) mutant, in which ATP hydrolyzing and MT depolymerization capabilities are abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Re-expression of KIF2C(WT), but not KIF2C(G491A) mutant, rescued the mEPSC hyper-amplitude in KIF2C cKO mice. KIF2C(G491A) also failed to restore the impaired LTP or cognitive function in KIF2C cKO mice during working memory or social memory tests. Therefore, the MT depolymerization function of KIF2C plays a critical role in regulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive behaviors.</p><p>Interestingly, Oligomeric amyloid-β directly inhibits the MT-dependent ATPase activity of KIF2C in vitro, and thereby leads to the generation of defective mitotic structures which may contributes to the development of Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borysov et al., 2011</xref>). Aβ stabilizes MT by reducing catastrophe-frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qu et al., 2017</xref>), which is similar with KIF2C conditional knockout phenotype. Furthermore, KIF2C was recently discovered as a blood biomarker for suicidal ideation in psychiatric patients, such as patients with schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niculescu et al., 2015</xref>).Therefore, KIF2C could be a therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease or suicidality psychiatric disorders.

Data were filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz.</p><p>For field excitatory postsynaptic potential recording, DG zone was cut down before recording to avoid the generation of epileptic wave. A concentric bipolar stimulating electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum to evoke EPSP and the recording electrode filled with ACSF was placed at 200–400 µm away from the stimulus electrode at the same region. Increasing stimulus intensity step by step to find the maximal response and then the baseline response was adjusted at 1/3 to 1/2 of the maximal response. After the steady baseline response was recorded for 30 min, a strain of 100 Hz-100 pulses high frequency stimulus (1× HFS) or four strains of 100 Hz-100 pulses high frequency stimulus applied with 5 min intervals (4× HFS) was delivered to induce LTP and a train of 2 Hz-900 pulses low-frequency stimulus was delivered to induce LTD. The induced post response was recorded for 1 hr (1× HFS) or 2 hr (4× HFS). The slope within 2ms at initial EPSP was calculated as the value for field EPSP. The magnitude of LTP and LTD was calculated based on the EPSP values 55–60 min (1× HFS) or 130–135 min (4× HFS) after the end of the induction protocol.</p><p>For whole-cell LTP recording, 100 µmol/L picrotoxin was added in recycling ACSF to block GABAR-mediated current. The stimulus electrode was placed in the stratum radiatum to evoke EPSC at 0.1 HZ and AMPAR-mediated current was recorded at –70 mV. After the steady baseline response was recorded for 5 min, the cell was held at 0 mV and received two strains of 100 Hz-100 pulses high frequency stimulus with 20 s intervals. And then the cell was held at –70 mV to record for 40 min. Here, the HFS must be given within 10 min of achieving the whole-cell recording to avoid ‘wash-out’ of LTP. The magnitude of LTP was calculated based on the EPSC values 35–40 min after the end of the induction protocol.</p><p>For NMDAR-mediated current and AMPAR-mediated current recording, 100 µmol/L picrotoxin was added in recycling ACSF to block GABAR-mediated current. AMPAR-mediated current was recorded at –70 mV. A mixed current for AMPAR-mediated current and NMDAR-mediated current was recorded at +40 mV. The current at 50ms after stimulus was counted for NMDAR-mediated current. The AMPAR/NMDAR ratio was calculated as the peak of the averaged AMPAR-mediated EPSC (30–40 consecutive events) at –70 mV divided by the averaged NMDAR-mediated EPSC (30–40 consecutive events).</p><p>Input-Output curves were established by plotting the EPSC amplitude against various intensities of the test pulse, ranging from 25 μA to 50 μA in 5 μA steps. NMDAR-mediated EPSCs were recorded in the presence of 20 μM CNQX and 100 μM picrotoxin and at +40 mV holding potential. AMPAR-mediated EPSCs were recorded in the presence of 50 μM AP5 and 100 μM picrotoxin and at –70 mV holding potential.</p><p>For mini excitatory synaptic transmission recording, 100 µmol/L picrotoxin and 1 µmol/L TTX was added into recycling ACSF to block GABA currents and sodium currents respectively. Recording was conducted at –70 mV. Chemical LTP (cLTP) was induced by treatment of hippocampus slices with glycine (200 μM) to activate NMDA receptors. Slices were treated with glycine in the Mg<sup>2+</sup> free ACSF for 10 min, then transferred to the recording chamber with ACSF containing 1 μM tetrodotoxin, 100 μM picrotoxin for patch recordings. Mini analysis software was used to count the mini EPSCs.</p><p>Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was examined by paired stimulations at different intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Behavioral experiments</title><p>All behavioral experiments were performed with the age of 2- to 3-month-old male littermates. All animals were given at least 1 hr of habituation time before testing. KIF2C(WT) re-expression assay for behavioral tests used a doxycycline-induced viral expression system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Open-field test</title><p>The open-field test was used to evaluate the autonomous behavior, exploratory behavior, and tension of animals in a new environment. Through dynamic monitoring of exploratory behavior and spontaneous activity, it is often used to test basic exercise volume and anxiety level. The mice were put in an area of 40 cm× 40 cm × 40 cm box and exploring freely for 30 min using a video tracking system. Data were analyzed using ANY-maze software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Y-maze</title><p>The Y-maze was used to evaluate discriminative learning, short-term working memory and reference memory test. It is based on the innate curiosity of the rodents to explore an arm that has not been previously visited. The Y-shaped maze is composed of three equal-length arms (40 cm×9 cm × 16 cm). The angle between each two arms is 120 degrees. The inner arms and the bottom of the maze are painted dark gray. The mice were placed in the center of the maze and allowed to freely explore the three arms for 5 min. Take the animals’ four feet into the arm as the standard. One alternation would be recorded if all arms were entered successively at a time. The numbers of arm entries were recorded to evaluate the locomotion of animals in the Y-maze. Spontaneous alternation was calculated as total alternations/the number of maximum alternations (total arm entries-2). Error % was calculated as total errors/the number of maximum errors (total arm entries-2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Elevated zero maze</title><p>Elevated zero maze was used to investigate the animal’s anxiety state which was based on the animal’s exploring characteristics of the new environment and the fear of hanging open arms to form conflicting behaviors. The annular platform (60 cm in diameter, 5 cm track width) was evaluated 50 cm above the floor and divided equally into four quadrants. Two opposite quadrants were ‘open’ and others were surrounded by 16 cm high blue, opaque walls. The mice were randomly placed in closed quadrants and allowed to freely to explore for a period of 5 min using an overhead video tracking system. Dependent measures were: time in open quadrants, open entrances, number of head dips, number of stretch attendance postures (SAP) and number of four paws in open section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Morris water maze</title><p>Morris water maze is the most classic behavioral experiment that evaluates animal learning, memory, cognition, and space exploration ability. The water maze consists of a circular pool (radius 120 cm) filed with water containing nontoxic titanium pigment to make the platform invisible. Mice were trained to find the hidden platform (5 cm) and placed gently in different quadrants each time. The maximum searching period allotted was 60 s. If a mouse did not find the platform, it will be placed on the platform by the experimenter and remained for 10 s. Training was performed for five days and tested on the sixth day. For the training sessions, the time taken to find the platform, velocity, and distance traveled were recorded. For the test session, the platform was removed. The time spent in the four quadrants of the pool were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Self-grooming</title><p>The mice were placed individually in a clean cage with fresh bedding. After 10-min habituation, mice were monitored with a camera and recorded for 10 min to score the spontaneous grooming behavior. Time of grooming was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Three-chambered social test</title><p>Three-chamber social interaction test was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silverman et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, two empty steel cylinders were respectively placed in the left and right rectangular. The test mice were individually placed in the center chamber for a 10-min habituation. Then the mice encountered a stranger C57BL /6 N mouse (S1) in the cage for 10 min. The social novelty test was then arranged and another stranger C57BL/6 N (S2) was placed in the cage and let the test mouse explored freely for 10 min. The close interaction time of the test mouse spent in each chamber was recorded. The ratio of (S1-E) to (S1+ E) was calculated as the preference index (S1-E), and the ratio of (S2-S1) to (S2+ S1) was measured as the preference index (S2-S1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Cued fear conditioning</title><p>Mice from each genotype were placed to the conditioning chamber for a 160-s habituation and then received three conditional stimulus (CS)- unconditional stimulus (US) trails inter-spaced by 40 s inter-trail intervals. They were given 60 s stimulus-free interval before returned to their home cage. The conditional stimulus comprised a 20 s discrete tone (80 dB, 2.8 kHz), which was followed by an unconditional stimulus at the last 2 s (US, 0.55 mA foot shock). To examine the condition response to the background contextual cues, the mice were placed back in the conditioning chamber for 6 min in the absence of the CS and US stimuli after training 24 hr, 7d. To examine the condition response to the CS, the mice were placed in a distinct and modified context and given a 6 min CS tone after training 48 hr, 8d. The context maintenance index is the ratio of (24hr-7d) to 24 hr freezing time, and the CS maintenance index is the ratio of (48hr-8d) to 48 hr freezing time. For all procedures, the animal freezing behaviors were monitored using a manufacturer’s software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Prepulse inhibition (PPI) test</title><p>PPI was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maekawa et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, in PPI test, prepulses (PP) were set at 70, 74, 78, and 82 dB, and pulse (P) was set at 120 dB. Percentage PPI was calculated as [(P amplitude – PP amplitude)/ P amplitude] × 100%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), Excel 2017 (Microsoft, Seattle, WA), and Sigmaplot 12.0 (Systat Software, Erkrath, Germany). Data analyses were blind to experimental conditions until the data were integrated. Standard deviations for controls were calculated from the average of all control data. Statistical difference was determined using a Student’s <italic>t</italic> test or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s <italic>post hoc</italic> tests or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction. The accepted level of significance was p &lt; 0.05. <italic>n</italic> represents the number of preparations, experimental repeats or cells as indicated in figure legends.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yu-Tian Wang (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The authors have provided data for the function of the microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, KIF2C/MCAK, in hippocampal neuron function, synaptic transmission, plasticity and mouse behavior. As such, many different techniques are used to determine the function of this protein. Previous work has implicated a similar family member, KIF2A, in axonal branching, however KIF2C appears to be functioning primarily in dendrites. This is an intriguing hypothesis and would provide important data for understanding the function of a microtubule depolymerase in nervous system function. Although copious amounts of data are shown and the manuscript is relatively clearly written, the authors oftentimes overinterpret the data and do not use the appropriate statistical tests and comparisons. The manuscript title and conclusions made in the Abstract and Discussion suggesting that the mechanism of KIF2C action is due to changes in microtubule invasion of dendritic spines is not substantiated. Because KIF2C conditional knock out neurons clearly have defects in microtubule dynamics throughout the dendritic shafts, many of the defects ascribed to microtubule invasion of spines are potentially indirect and may not be responsible for changes in synaptic transmission or behavior. More careful and appropriate analysis of their current data and additional experiments, specifically regarding the possibility of KIF2C leaving spines during synaptic activity and the dynamics of MT invasion of spines, would be needed to determine the mechanism of KIF2C action in dendrites. Thus, although interesting, the manuscript requires substantial revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. An important part of the proposed mechanism of KIF2C action relies on the data in 2H and I. The authors argue that KIF2C is leaving dendritic spines and concentrating in the dendritic shaft after cLTP treatment. However, only colocalization of PSD95 and KIF2C is quantified, and this quantification is a percentage. It is not clear to what the percentage refers – the % of spines where they are colocalized? How is colocalization determined? What is the cutoff? Even if all of these measures were indicated, much more rigorous quantification would have to be done to provide convincing evidence that KIF2C is leaving spines and concentrating in the dendrite shaft after cLTP (as the show in their model in Figure 8). Specifically, both fixed cell imaging of endogenous KIF2C in a much more rigorous fashion, taking into account spine volume changes and comparison with another protein known to leave spines after cLTP. Imaging GFP-KIF2C in individual spines before and after cLTP and showing a subsequent decrease in the spine and increase in the shaft would also provide more compelling data.</p><p>2. The authors overinterpret the data from Figure 6C. In this experiment they treated cells with BDNF, fixed the neurons and labeled them with an antibody to dynamic MTs (tyrosinated tubulin). They show that the percent of spines containing a MT increased with BDNF in WT neurons but not in controls. They also show that cKO neurons have slightly more spines containing MTs. This methodology is useful, in addition to live-cell imaging of EB3 entries into spines, but it is difficult to quantify MT invasions because tyrosinated tubulin is also cytoplasmic and spines can change sizes with treatment. Thus, it is difficult to determine which spines contain a MT vs. just increased volume of tyrosinated tubulin. Without live cell imaging of labeled EB3 or tubulin these data are not sufficient to make claims about MT invasion. Also, only live cell imaging would be able to differentiate increased invasion of MTs vs. increased retention of MTs in spines. It is unclear what is happening in the KIF2C cKO neurons. Thus, they can't claim in the discussion that &quot;KIF2C deficiency also increased the frequency of MT invasion under basal conditions&quot; (line 318).</p><p>3. In addition to the points made in #2 the fact that MT dynamics are affected in the dendrites suggests that changes in MT invasion of spines are indirect. KIF2C is clearly affecting MT dynamics throughout the neuron. Thus, one would expect changes in MT invasion of spines. Therefore, changes in synaptic transmission may have nothing to do with MT invasion of spines but rather they are due to changes in MT-based transport throughout the dendritic arbor.</p><p>Non-essential comments:</p><p>1. A major effect of KIF2C seems to be constraining the number of AMPARs in the postsynaptic membrane. However, its underlying mechanism remains uncharacterized – is it a result of inhibiting trafficking of the receptor to the synaptic site, its exocytosis into the plasma membrane, or destabilizing the receptor on the postsynaptic membrane? Can the authors provide any clarification on this?</p><p>2. Figure 2E：Is cLTP-induced increase in the spine width associated with an increase in the synaptic AMPARs and amplitude of mEPSCs? If so, would they also be blocked by shRNA?</p><p>3. Figure 3: N/A ratio changes may not indicate an increase in AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission as it is not clear if NMDAR-mediated mEPSCs change or not. The authors should try to evaluate the changes in synaptic transmission by comparing the input-output curves between control and shRNA-treated neurons.</p><p>4. Figure 4: again, there should be a detailed analysis of the input-output curves in slices of WT and cKO mice. The individual traces on the left in 4E are not representative as the reduction of N/A ratio in cKO was not as obvious as shown in the bar graph on the right, and need to be changed. The impairment in LTP induced by a single HFS may not be sufficient. In order to further substantiate the impaired LTP, the authors should also attempt to maximize the LTP induced by 4xHFS.</p><p>5. Hippocampal re-expression of KIF2C rescues mEPSC, LTP, and behavioral phenotypes. These are nice sets of data suggesting KIF2C directly regulates the synaptic and behavioral phenotypes. However, I wonder whether the same KIF2C re-expression rescues baseline and BDNF-dependent MT invasion, which is an essential part of the conclusions together with synaptic phenotypes.</p><p>6. Biochemical work and ICC of hippocampal neurons suggests KIF2C is present postsynaptically, but it also colocalizes with Bassoon (Figure 1E). However, the authors discount the colocalization with a presynaptic label and only focus on the postsynaptic localization. A line scan is used to show colocalization, but this not sufficient. Colocalization analysis and Pearson's correlation coefficients should be computed to definitively show there is more colocalization with PSD95 than Bassoon.</p><p>7. Throughout Figure 6 and Figure 7 the authors use a KIF2C point mutant (G491A) that has been shown previously to have little MT depolymerization activity. However, they do not directly compare the point mutant to the WT KIF2C when they attempt to rescue the synaptic transmission phenotypes in the cKO mouse. Instead they compare each to a control and use a Student's t-test to indicate that the cKO + WT protein is significantly different than control, while the cKO + G491A is not. They need to compare cKO + WT directly to G491A and controls via ANOVA and show these two &quot;rescues&quot; are different. Moreover, addition of a WT control would be needed if they wanted to claim that the cKO + WT is the same as WT control (i.e. a full rescue).</p><p>8. In Figure 2 and 3 it is not clear why immunoblots are not used to show decreases in protein expression after knockdown. Only mRNA quantification is shown.</p><p>9. In Figure 2 KIF2C knockdown seems to have no effect on basal levels of spine density or spine head width. It is only after cLTP that significant differences are noted. However, in Figure 1D a Student's t-test is used, while in Figure 1E an ANOVA is used. Both of these graphs, as well as Figure 1G, should be analyzed with an ANOVA because more than two conditions are being compared. The minor differences (p&lt;0.05) in Figure 1D and 1G are likely to be non-significant when analyzed with an ANOVA.</p><p>10. Bar graphs and scatter plots are used randomly throughout the paper. Scatter plots, or better yet SuperPlots (Lord et al., 2020, JCB, 219(6):e202001064), should be used throughout the paper.</p><p>11. The data in Figure 5E and F seem to be inconsistent. Both NMDAR and AMPAR appear to increase, although AMPAR to a greater extent than NMDARs, but the N/A ratio is significantly less in the cKO. Furthermore, only a p-value is provided. No statistical tests are mentioned.</p><p>12. In Figure 6B it is unclear why measurements of EB3 speed manually and using Tip Tracker software would result in such different growth speeds (EB3 speed vs. MT growth speed). The MT growth speeds are double the EB3 speeds. Shouldn't these be the same speeds?</p><p>13. In Figure 7C (lines 260-261) the authors claim the maintenance of fear memory is impaired in KIF2C cKO mice, however it appears that the maintenance is preserved – the two lines are parallel. Rather the fear memory is decreased throughout the periods of measurement. Also, these measures need to be analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA, rather than a t-test.</p><p>14. Lines 320-21: The authors suggest that MTs bring AMPAR to the synapse. To my knowledge, this has not been shown here or elsewhere in the literature.</p><p>15. The model in Figure 8 is inaccurate. The authors want to show increased invasion of MTs into spines but show multiple simultaneous invasions. They never image MT dynamics in spines to show this.</p><p>16. The authors need to carefully review the writing contained within the manuscript, including the figure legends. The corresponding legend for Supplementary Information Figure S1 needs to be updated to reflect A-D as opposed to an abridged version A-B.

There are also a number of confusing/distracting sentences within the body of the manuscript that need remedying.</p><p>17.

As such, many different techniques are used to determine the function of this protein. Previous work has implicated a similar family member, KIF2A, in axonal branching, however KIF2C appears to be functioning primarily in dendrites. This is an intriguing hypothesis and would provide important data for understanding the function of a microtubule depolymerase in nervous system function. Although copious amounts of data are shown and the manuscript is relatively clearly written, the authors oftentimes overinterpret the data and do not use the appropriate statistical tests and comparisons. The manuscript title and conclusions made in the Abstract and Discussion suggesting that the mechanism of KIF2C action is due to changes in microtubule invasion of dendritic spines is not substantiated. Because KIF2C conditional knock out neurons clearly have defects in microtubule dynamics throughout the dendritic shafts, many of the defects ascribed to microtubule invasion of spines are potentially indirect and may not be responsible for changes in synaptic transmission or behavior. More careful and appropriate analysis of their current data and additional experiments, specifically regarding the possibility of KIF2C leaving spines during synaptic activity and the dynamics of MT invasion of spines, would be needed to determine the mechanism of KIF2C action in dendrites.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;KIF2C regulates synaptic plasticity and cognition in mice through dynamic microtubule depolymerization&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

An important part of the proposed mechanism of KIF2C action relies on the data in 2H and I. The authors argue that KIF2C is leaving dendritic spines and concentrating in the dendritic shaft after cLTP treatment. However, only colocalization of PSD95 and KIF2C is quantified, and this quantification is a percentage. It is not clear to what the percentage refers – the % of spines where they are colocalized? How is colocalization determined? What is the cutoff? Even if all of these measures were indicated, much more rigorous quantification would have to be done to provide convincing evidence that KIF2C is leaving spines and concentrating in the dendrite shaft after cLTP (as the show in their model in Figure 8). Specifically, both fixed cell imaging of endogenous KIF2C in a much more rigorous fashion, taking into account spine volume changes and comparison with another protein known to leave spines after cLTP. Imaging GFP-KIF2C in individual spines before and after cLTP and showing a subsequent decrease in the spine and increase in the shaft would also provide more compelling data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The colocalization refers to the percentage number of PSD-95-colocalized KIF2C puncta relative to total number of KIF2C puncta in dendritic protrusions. We totally agree with the reviewer that the increased PSD-95 puncta volume after cLTP would affect the result interpretating. We therefore dug into our data more carefully for more information and made more quantification. We have found that both the density or intensity (i.e., expression level/spine) of synaptic KIF2C was significantly reduced, percentage number of PSD-95-colocalized KIF2C puncta relative to total number of KIF2C puncta was reduced as well. Though the spines enlarged after cLTP, instead of increasing or unchanging, the percentage area of PSD-95-colocalized KIF2C relative to total KIF2C was decreased significantly, indicating that the spine volume change after cLTP was not the disturbing factor in our quantification. Taken together, we are confident that the imaging data did show the translocation of KIF2C out from spines after cLTP. The new data have been incorporated into Figure 2I together with corresponding descriptions in the main text (line 133-135).</p><p>The detailed quantification procedures have been incorporated into the Method section. Generally, fluorescence intensity was measured using region measurements function in MetaMorph. Single dendrites were selected randomly. Fixed threshold values were used to optimize highlighting of puncta in green (PSD-95) and red (KIF2C) channels and then applied to all images from the same experiment. For the colocalization quantification, the percentage area of KIF2C overlapping PSD-95 was performed using Measurement Colocalization function. For the quantification of synaptic KIF2C density and intensity, all the puncta on the green (PSD-95) channel were selected and used as a mask for red channel (KIF2C) overlapping to filter out the PSD-95-colocalized KIF2C puncta automatically, using the Process function, and Integrated Morphometric Analysis function was used to identify the puncta and measure their properties.</p><p>We have also overexpressed KIF2C in hippocampal neurons and checked its synaptic localization before or after cLTP treatment, according to the reviewer’s suggestion. However, we found that KIF2C overexpression impaired the postsynaptic structure largely, and neurons did not respond to cLTP stimulation. In fact, we found that KIF2C overexpression in WT neurons did more damage than in cKO neurons, as it could not be expressed for too long time in vitro or in vivo. Perhaps overloading of KIF2C in neurons would lead to an overactivated microtubule depolymerization. We suspect that KIF2C's expression in neuron needs to be in a precise balance in order to maintain normal physiological activity, with a mechanism that we have not understood yet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors overinterpret the data from Figure 6C. In this experiment they treated cells with BDNF, fixed the neurons and labeled them with an antibody to dynamic MTs (tyrosinated tubulin). They show that the percent of spines containing a MT increased with BDNF in WT neurons but not in controls. They also show that cKO neurons have slightly more spines containing MTs. This methodology is useful, in addition to live-cell imaging of EB3 entries into spines, but it is difficult to quantify MT invasions because tyrosinated tubulin is also cytoplasmic and spines can change sizes with treatment. Thus, it is difficult to determine which spines contain a MT vs. just increased volume of tyrosinated tubulin. Without live cell imaging of labeled EB3 or tubulin these data are not sufficient to make claims about MT invasion. Also, only live cell imaging would be able to differentiate increased invasion of MTs vs. increased retention of MTs in spines. It is unclear what is happening in the KIF2C cKO neurons. Thus, they can't claim in the discussion that &quot;KIF2C deficiency also increased the frequency of MT invasion under basal conditions&quot; (line 318).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the thoughtful analysis and for the suggestion. Our previous result did not provide direct evidence that KIF2C affects MT spine invasion. To just this question, we performed the live-imaging of EB3 and quantified the MT spine invasion events. Our result showed that without KIF2C, the MT invasion events in average each spine increased about 2 folds in an hour. We also provided a representative Kymograph and time-frame images showing a single MT invasion event. Therefore, we feel confident that KIF2C did affect MT invasion under basal condition. The new result has now been incorporated into Figure 6C together with corresponding descriptions in the main text (line 237-238).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

As our response for #2, we have seen the change in MT invasion by live imaging in cKO mice. We also agree with the reviewer that even though MT invasion of spines is affected, the defects in dendrites also count. Currently, we don’t have a clean and clear method to distinguish KIF2C’s function in dendrites or in spines. KIF2C’s translocation after cLTP induction would be a touch to its regulatory mechanism in spines, but currently we are unable to strip it out from dendritic factor. In order to avoid overinterpretation of the results, we have revised the inaccurate deduction in the article (line 39-42, 213-214, 265-267) as well as in the title, and made a discussion about this issue in the main text (line 335-338, 358-366, 367-388).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Non-essential comments:</p><p>1.

Our results suggest that KIF2C regulates microtubule depolymerization and stability in hippocampal neurons (Figure 6A). Microtubule-dependent trafficking has been typically associated with long-range transport along the dendrites, supporting the continuous supply and redistribution of AMPARs among synapses (1-4) (5, 6), which can also be regulated by neuronal activity (1, 7, 8). There has also been report showing microtubule dynamic stability regulates AMPARs postsynaptic localization and synaptic plasticity(<italic>9</italic>). We therefore speculate that KIF2C constrain AMPARs trafficking to the synaptic sites by microtubule depolymerization and stability. However, other possibilities are not excluded. This could be a very interesting topic for our follow up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2E：Is cLTP-induced increase in the spine width associated with an increase in the synaptic AMPARs and amplitude of mEPSCs? If so, would they also be blocked by shRNA?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been shown that cLTP induction is characterized by increases in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous mEPSCs and elevation of CREB phosphorylation (10), altering the size and/or shape of the specialized postsynaptic compartment of the dendritic spine(11-13). Synaptic AMPARs recruitment is required for cLTP-induced spine expansion (13). Our data showed that knockdown of KIF2C blocked the cLTP-induced increase of dendritic spine width (Figure 2E), suggestion a change in synaptic AMPARs and mEPSC amplitude. To direct answer this question, we examined the mEPSCs before and after cLTP in KIF2C knockdown neurons, and found that shKIF2C blocked the cLTP-induced raise of synaptic AMPARs and mEPSCs amplitude. The new results were added in our revised manuscript (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F) (line 148-151).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The line scan result showed that KIF2C was colocalized with both PSD-95 and Bassoon. KIF2C must have played some roles in a pre-synaptic way. But in our electrophysiological experiments, we checked the paired-pulse ratios in hippocampus after KIF2C knockout and didn’t find any change (Figure 5B). Post-synaptic knockdown of KIF2C in CA1 neurons didn’t affect the paired-pulse ratios of CA3 neurons (Figure 3B). It is a hint that KIF2C may not be involved in the release probability. We didn’t perform the PDS-95 or Bassoon colocalization quantification because in our study we focused mainly on its function in post-synapse or dendrites. We found that the post-synaptic knockdown of KIF2C is sufficient to abolish the LTP in CA3-CA1 pathway (Figure 3F) and post-synaptic re-expression of KIF2C expression in CA1 could effectively rescue the LTP-defects in CA3-CA1 pathway (Figure 6G). Therefore, we think that at least KIF2C is an important post-synaptic regulator in neuron plasticity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In order to make our data more readable, we have compiled the data together and re-analyzed the result by one-way ANOVA. The results are consistent with previous ones and there was significant difference between WT and G491A rescue (Figure 6F-G, Figure 7F-H).</p><p>The re-expression of KIF2C in cKO mice was achieved <italic>via</italic> viral infection system, through which the expression level of KIF2C could be higher or lower than its endogenous level. Therefore, the phenotype readout of the “rescued mice” could be different to the WT mice. The aim of our rescue experiment was to prove the function of KIF2C in synaptic plasticity and cognition, and we did not claim “full rescue”. Moreover, according to our previous results, the expression level of KIF2C need to be finely tuned in neurons. Long-time overdosing of KIF2C affects synaptic plasticity or even cause deadly effect in neurons. In our study, we used doxycyline-induced expression to limit the duration and level of KIF2C expression. Even though, we did not speculate to reach a “full rescue” through viral-mediated overexpression but not the knockin approach. Therefore, we didn’t add the WT control in the rescue experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

In Figure 6B it is unclear why measurements of EB3 speed manually and using Tip Tracker software would result in such different growth speeds (EB3 speed vs. MT growth speed). The MT growth speeds are double the EB3 speeds. Shouldn't these be the same speeds?</p></disp-quote><p>We used EB3 to mark the +TIPs of MT and track the growing MT ends in live imaging. The EB3 speed we measured actually is the average velocity of EB3 moving (i.e., the displacement of EB3 divided by the time interval). As it cannot be measured by the software, we manually located EB3 at the beginning and at end of the live imaging and measured its displacement. The MT growth speed is the average forward moving speed of EB3. The software traced the moving of EB3 puncta and filters out the shrinking movement, calculates the average forward moving speed (i.e., total forward moving distances divided by the forward moving time). That’s why the MT growth speed is much higher than the EB3 speed. The detailed quantification procedures and parameters have been provided in the method section (Live-cell imaging and microtubule dynamics analysis, line 227-230, 510-527).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. In Figure 7C (lines 260-261) the authors claim the maintenance of fear memory is impaired in KIF2C cKO mice, however it appears that the maintenance is preserved – the two lines are parallel. Rather the fear memory is decreased throughout the periods of measurement. Also, these measures need to be analyzed with a repeated measures ANOVA, rather than a t-test.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful analysis. The freezing levels of WT and cKO mice did show similar decreasing tendencies. We re-checked the memory maintenance by calculating the percentage change of the freezing time between two consecutive times (i.e. (Freezing time<sub>24h</sub>- Freezing time<sub>7d</sub>)/ Freezing time<sub>24h</sub> to contextual cue and (Freezing time<sub>48h</sub>- Freezing time<sub>8d</sub>)/ Freezing time<sub>48h</sub> to conditioned stimulus) (Figure 7—figure supplement 1E) and there was no significant difference, showing the preserved maintenance of fear memory. We have corrected our mis-interpretation in the text (line 291-294).</p><p>Moreover, we have used RM ANOVA to analyze data in the revised submission, the result is consistent with our previous one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Lines 320-21: The authors suggest that MTs bring AMPAR to the synapse. To my knowledge, this has not been shown here or elsewhere in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We should draw our conclusions more carefully. We have now corrected the inappropriate description in the revised manuscript (line 355-359).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The model in Figure 8 is inaccurate. The authors want to show increased invasion of MTs into spines but show multiple simultaneous invasions. They never image MT dynamics in spines to show this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. It is difficult to distinguish whether the increase in MT invasion frequency take place in the same spine or just the increase in invasion probability in a population of spines or both. By now, we cannot tell between the two possibilities, so we took down the schematic diagram.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. The authors need to carefully review the writing contained within the manuscript, including the figure legends. The corresponding legend for Supplementary Information Figure S1 needs to be updated to reflect A-D as opposed to an abridged version A-B. Figure 4A includes &quot;sgRNA&quot; as opposed to &quot;shRNA&quot;. Supplementary Information Figure S4 fails to mention B' in the legend and currently states &quot;Number of strenching&quot; as the title for the y-axis. There are also a number of confusing/distracting sentences within the body of the manuscript that need remedying.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have now revised the manuscript thoroughly and corrected the inappropriate wording or descriptions carefully.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. In the description of Figure 2 (line 111), the authors state that spine morphology was examined at DIV 16-18 when the methods and figure legend state that this assessment occurred at DIV 18-20.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the mistake. We have now corrected the date.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18.

These changes have strengthened the manuscript considerably. However, there are still a few points that the authors did not directly address.</p><p>In their response to Essential Revision #1 the authors quantified the distribution of KIF2C with regard to PSD-95 in different ways but the data in Figure 2H and I are still not very convincing. They didn't seem to make any measurements in the dendrite shaft to show that KIF2C was increasing in the shaft while decreasing in the spine. From these data it seems they can just conclude that KIF2C is not colocalizing as much with PSD-95 after cLTP. Additionally, they state that they tried overexpressing KIF2C but this caused damage to the neurons. However, in Figure 6E they show they expressed GFP-KIF2C in cKO neurons. Why could they not image these neurons live and quantify changes in KIF2C in the spine and shaft as requested?</p><p>The authors still used a Student t-test for Figure 2G and Figures 6F and G instead of ANOVA. Moreover, although they use ANOVA more appropriately in the revision, they have not indicated what post-tests they have run (Bonferroni, Tukey, etc.?) in their ANOVA analyses throughout the manuscript. These post-hoc tests should be included in the Methods and in the appropriate figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. we have added the quantitative data of KIF2C level in dendritic shafts after cLTP stimulation and clearly see an increase of KIF2C expression in dendrites accompanying a reduction in spines (Figure 2I), corresponding text was added to describe this finding (Line 133-138, 581-582).</p><p>We had tested KIF2C overexpression in WT and cKO neurons and slices with biochemical and electrophysiological experiments in our pre-tests, and finally found that neurons survive far less in wild type than in cKO, which was less than four days for cKO neurons in in vivo experiments and less than two dasys in cultured cKO neurons. For our rescue experiments in cKO neurons, overexpression of KIF2C(WT) was controlled in a limited time, or else a highly expressed KIF2C level would be toxic to cKO neurons. However, we found that the lowly expressed KIF2C in healthy cKO neurons showed very weaker fluorescent signal which was too dim to be detected under microscope. We therefore think it’s not suitable for the suggested live-imaging experiment. That’s why we used GFP antibody to detect KIF2C expression in the rescue experiment (Figure 6E).</p><p>For Figure 6F, G, we have re-analyzed the data by one-way ANOVA and the results are consistent with previous ones (line 1224 and 1234, Figure 6F, G). We have also carefully looked into our data, and added post-hoc tests in the Methods (line 814-821) and in the appropriate figure legends. For Figure 2G, what we actuary compared was the KIF2C expression level between the ECS and cLTP-treated groups in each fraction. We have now re-plotted the bar chart for clearer representation (Figure 2G).</p></body></sub-article></article>
