stimulation triggers an increase of cerebral perfusion and blood oxygenation (neurovascular response) as well as an alteration of the metabolic neurochemical profile (neurometabolic response). Here, we show in human primary visual cortex (V1) that perceived and unperceived isoluminant chromatic flickering stimuli designed to have similar neurovascular responses as measured by blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) have markedly different neurometabolic responses as measured by proton functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-fMRS). In particular, a significant regional buildup of lactate, an index of aerobic glycolysis, and glutamate, an index of malate–aspartate shuttle, occurred in V1 only when the flickering was perceived, without any relation with other behavioral or physiological variables. Whereas the BOLD-fMRI signal in V1, a proxy for input to V1, was insensitive to flickering perception by design, the BOLD-fMRI signal in secondary visual areas was larger during perceived than unperceived flickering, indicating increased output from V1. These results demonstrate that the upregulation of energy metabolism induced by visual stimulation depends on the type of information processing taking place in V1, and that 1H-fMRS provides unique information about local input/output balance that is not measured by BOLD-fMRI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>central visual system</kwd><kwd>visual perception</kwd><kwd>human brain metabolism</kwd><kwd>lactate</kwd><kwd>BOLD-fMRI</kwd><kwd>single-voxel 1H-fMRS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003196</institution-id><institution>Ministero della Salute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ricerca Corrente</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Giove</surname><given-names>Federico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open Access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hagberg</surname><given-names>Gisela E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Perceived and unperceived visual stimuli that are contrast matched to produce similar BOLD responses in V1 elicit clearly distinct changes in the neurochemical profile, implying a perception-related dissociation between neurometabolic and neurovascular response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the brain, sensory stimulation is associated with a substantial increase of regional functional hyperemia (i.e., cerebral blood flow, CBF) as well as energy metabolism of glucose, the main cerebral energy substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siesjo, 1978</xref>). The metabolic response to stimulation includes an oxidative component, as measured by the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>), and a nonoxidative component, as reflected by lactate accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mangia et al., 2009</xref>). Cortical lactate levels have been shown to increase during visual stimulation, simultaneously to the acceleration of the malate–aspartate shuttle (MAS), a process termed aerobic glycolysis (i.e., lactate production independent of oxygen availability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bednařík et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bednařík et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boillat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fernandes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mangia et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Schaller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schaller et al., 2014</xref>). Despite intense research, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the upregulation of glycolytic metabolism of glucose are still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dienel, 2019a</xref>). Most importantly, the impact of information processing to the metabolic response of the cerebral cortex to sensory stimulation has not been fully investigated thus far. In particular, nothing is known about the modulatory effect exerted by the perception of different stimuli on regional brain energy metabolism.</p><p>Sensory perception is thought to rely on the complex interplay of neural circuits that process information in a cortical layer- and area-mediated manner involving thalamocortical, intracortical, corticocortical, and corticothalamic feedforward/feedback loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">D’Souza and Burkhalter, 2017</xref>). Sensory stimuli transduced by sensory organs reach specific thalamic nuclei that relay information to primary sensory cortices, which in turn filter and eventually transmit information to secondary sensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crick and Koch, 1995</xref>). These transactions are dependent on the particular features of different incoming stimuli, thus it is possible that the relevant neurovascular and neurometabolic counterparts are correspondingly distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lauritzen, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) mediates visual stimuli with temporal frequencies at least up to 90 Hz to the layer IV of V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gur and Snodderly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Herrmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pastor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Regan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vialatte et al., 2010</xref>), which in turn relays to output layers II/III and V where temporal filtering occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</xref>), consistent with the notion that visual perception requires the activation of visual areas downstream V1 (i.e., secondary visual areas). In agreement with these arguments, it has been repeatedly reported that invisible visual flickering is still able to activate V1 even without any perceptual effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alais et al., 2016</xref>), as revealed by in vivo electrophysiology in nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gur and Snodderly, 1997</xref>) as well as behavioral evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lorenceau, 1987</xref>) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jiang et al., 2007</xref>) in humans. High (30 Hz) frequency visual stimulation has been found to selectively suppress multiunit activity (MUA) in cat V1 as compared to low frequency (4 Hz) visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007</xref>). Importantly, local field potentials and tissue oxygen response, which directly contribute to the generation of the BOLD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Logothetis et al., 2001</xref>), were preserved at both frequencies.</p><p>In the present study, we combined BOLD-fMRI and proton functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-fMRS) in humans and exploited the well-known effect of temporal frequency on visual perception. Specifically, we examined the functional and metabolic responses of the primary visual cortex (V1) to perceived or unperceived isoluminant chromatic flickering stimulation obtained by using temporal frequency either below (7.5 Hz; PF, perceived flickering) or above (30 Hz; UF, unperceived flickering) the critical flicker fusion (CFF) threshold of ~15 Hz for rod-mediated vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hecht and Shlaer, 1936</xref>). Based on experimental evidence and metabolic modeling, we have previously proposed that the local input–output balance between neuronal synaptic/spiking (or subthreshold/suprathreshold) activity is a primary determinant in the upregulation of aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DiNuzzo and Giove, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">DiNuzzo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DiNuzzo and Nedergaard, 2017</xref>). We thus hypothesized that the loss of visual perception is accompanied by fundamental changes in the metabolic responses of human V1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects perception of the visual stimuli</title><p>To achieve perceptual isoluminance between green and red color (necessary for the UF condition), we adjusted the brightness of the green color for each individual subject, which was remarkably similar across subjects (green/red brightness ratio 71.9% ± 1.2%, range 70.1–73.5%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). After this procedure, 100% of the subjects confirmed that their perception of the 30 Hz frequency stimulus steadiness was equivalent to the resting condition. Overall, the subject’s perception was a gray/colored checkerboard that in the colored squares showed either a fast green and red alternation during PF epochs, or a static yellow during UF epochs (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). As a further confirmation, while in the scanner the subjects were unable to distinguish the 30 Hz red-green flickering checkerboard (used in the actual experiments) from a color-matched static yellow checkerboard (used for testing only). Specifically, the perception of the steady yellow color versus the 30 Hz red-green flickering was indistinguishable, as assessed by asking the subjects to guess the origin of the stimulus for 10 consecutive trials (average of correct responses 52% ± 16%, not different from chance level, p = 0.62). All subjects reported to distinctly perceive the green and red color when the checkerboard was flickering at 7.5 Hz.

Although energy is recognized as a limiting factor for the human cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Herculano-Houzel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Niven and Laughlin, 2008</xref>), the increase in lactate concentration occurring upon sensory stimulation is not the result of limited oxygen availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aalling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DiNuzzo, 2016</xref>), as it is for skeletal muscle. Why the cerebral cortex upregulates glycolytic metabolism for sensory information processing is unknown, but it is well established that glycolysis serves specific neurophysiological and neurobiological purposes, such as axonal vesicle transport, vesicle recycling, action potential waveform modulation, reuptake of neuroactive compounds, and dendritic spine remodeling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DiNuzzo and Nedergaard, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, lactate is known to be implicated in cognitive processes occurring during waking activity, like learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Descalzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Newman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Scavuzzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>), although the exact underlying mechanisms are still debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dienel, 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Steinman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we asked whether alterations in visual perception are also reflected in metabolic changes within the primary visual cortex in humans. We report that stimulus perception affects the lactate and glutamate response in V1. The PF and UF stimulations elicited, by experimental design, the same average BOLD signals increase inside V1, indicating an equivalent degree of neurovascular coupling and possibly of local synaptic activity in the two experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Logothetis, 2008</xref>). Yet, we observed a significant increase in the regional lactate level only during the PF stimulus, with no appreciable change of lactate during the UF stimulus compared with resting conditions. A temporal dissociation between BOLD and lactate changes has been previously reported during repeated photic stimulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mangia et al., 2007b</xref>). In that case, BOLD response was preserved, but not the lactate accumulation, possibly due to habituation of neuronal firing. Metabolic adaptation, in terms of glutamate levels, in the presence of constant BOLD and electrophysiological activity was also reported in epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Peca et al., 2010</xref>). These results suggest that the physiological mechanisms underlying BOLD signals and energy metabolism do not necessarily overlap under all experimental conditions.</p><p>Our results suggest that lactate and glutamate may be dissociated from BOLD changes when cortical input and output are differentially modulated by for example, intracortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007</xref>) or thalamocortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Min et al., 2020</xref>) inhibition. In fact, an overall switch toward inhibition is expected to reduce the energy request of the brain, thus impacting on metabolic rates independently of BOLD response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mangia et al., 2009</xref>). Although inhibition, in terms of GABA concentration, has been positively correlated with changes of the BOLD signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Donahue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Northoff et al., 2007</xref>), the dependence of GABAergic neurotransmission and corresponding BOLD changes upon temporal flickering frequency is difficult to predict, as the gating of sensory information is much likely supported by dishinibitory mechanisms (e.g., through vasoactive intestinal peptide-positive interneurons) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Askew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gasselin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Williams and Holtmaat, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, changes in excitation/inhibition equilibrium have been proposed as a source of variability of the CBF/CMRO<sub>2</sub> coupling ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buxton et al., 2014</xref>). In more general terms, the metabolic response seems capable of differentiating neural states that are intrinsically distinct, although they induce the same BOLD response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moradi et al., 2012</xref>). Similar BOLD signal changes in correspondence to substantially different alterations in tissue lactate and glutamate level during visual flickering could not be predicted a priori unless assuming fundamental differences in information processing during stimulation. In particular, the firing rate of layer IV neurons that receive input from LGN is higher during UF than PF, as evidenced by the synchronization of these neurons to the stimulus frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gur and Snodderly, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Herrmann, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Norcia et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pastor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Regan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Vialatte et al., 2010</xref>), yet we found that lactate and glutamate increases during PF, not UF. These findings indicate that the stimulation-induced effect on metabolite concentrations is happening downstream of the input stage in layer IV, and specifically during the intracortical processing involving output layers II/III and V. This conclusion is supported by the fact that high-frequency flickering (30–60 Hz) abolished MUA, a measure of neuronal spiking (putatively from layer II/III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007</xref>), but not single neuron recordings from layer IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gur and Snodderly, 1997</xref>).</p><p>Using compartmentalized metabolic modeling, we have recently obtained evidence that the abovementioned outcome can be explained by distinct signaling mechanisms underlying spiking and synaptic activity (e.g., pre- and postsynaptic ionic currents) that are indeed frequency dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DiNuzzo and Giove, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DiNuzzo et al., 2014</xref>). We previously reported that chromatic and achromatic flickering at the same temporal frequency elicited the same neurochemical response in V1 despite differences in the responding neuronal populations (i.e., blob vs interblob) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bednařík et al., 2018</xref>). Together with the results that we report here, this observation suggests that lactate and glutamate, and hence aerobic glycolysis, are both sensitive to cortical processing (e.g., input/output or excitation/inhibition balance) rather than the targeted neuronal population. Our results can be interpreted in keeping with the concept that increased glutamate levels reflect an upregulation of the MAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mangia et al., 2012</xref>), although we were unable to report significant differences in aspartate levels likely due to insufficient sensitivity of MRS at 3T. Indeed, the decrease in aspartate during sensory stimulation is commonly observed at 7T, but to our knowledge has never been reported at 3T, most likely due to limited sensitivity of detection. In fact, the small absolute concentration of aspartate, its multiplet spectrum profile, and its overlap with other metabolites pose several challenges for detection of the small changes (around 0.1–0.2 mmol/l) occurring during a functional design. Similar considerations actually apply to glucose, which also was not reported in this study to decrease as observed in 7T studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mangia et al., 2007a</xref>). The NADH produced by the metabolism of glucose to lactate has to be transported from the cytosol to the mitochondria to be used for energy production within the electron transport chain. Among other components of the MAS, such process requires that glutamate is transported from cytosol to mitochondria and concomitantly aspartate is counter-transported from mitochondria to cytosol through the aspartate–glutamate carrier (AGC1/Aralar). The AGC1/Aralar carrier-mediated transport is a rate-limiting step within the MAS and therefore it lags behind the concomitant increase in tricarboxylic acids cycle and NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH-redox shuttling in mitochondria. In agreement with existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hertz and Chen, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hertz and Rothman, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mangia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mangia et al., 2007a</xref>), we interpret the increase in glutamate (and decrease in aspartate) concentration as reflecting an increase in the rate of MAS, with accumulation of glutamate at the cytosolic side and reduction of aspartate at the mitochondrial side. Notably, the MAS does not necessarily correlate with mitochondrial respiration and cerebral blood flow, as evidenced by the findings that (1) oxidative metabolism and CMRO<sub>2</sub> are enhanced at both low and high flickering frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Viswanathan and Freeman, 2007</xref>), and (2) glutamate and aspartate, but not lactate, correlate with BOLD signals during low frequency (~8 Hz) visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bednařík et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ip et al., 2017</xref>). To what extent aerobic glycolysis and MAS can dissociate from oxidative phosphorylation in the brain remains to be established, but previously published data strongly indicate that the increase in lactate and glutamate levels is the consequence of the surge in glycolysis and the ensuing increase of cytosolic NADH:NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio taking place during neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Díaz-García et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While the similar BOLD response in V1 is a direct consequence of our experimental design, we additionally found that secondary visual areas were recruited to a larger extent during PF stimulus than UF stimulus, supporting the argument that their activation is necessary for perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lamme et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Salminen-Vaparanta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tong, 2003</xref>). The preferential response of secondary visual areas to perceived stimuli that we observe here broadly confirms previous results of a strong BOLD activity in ventral (‘visual-for-perception’ processing) and dorsal (‘visual-for-action’ processing) streams during visible stimuli and a reduction of their activity in conditions of invisible stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hesselmann and Malach, 2011</xref>). However, since our stimulation protocol is associated by design with higher activation of output layers of V1 and hence higher input to V2/V3, we cannot conclusively and unambiguously establish that the higher activation of secondary visual areas is causally linked to perception. In fact, the very notion that BOLD activity in secondary visual areas actually reflects V1 output is uncertain because we have no direct measurement to firmly support such assumption, although it is very tightly linked to the unique architecture of the visual system.</p><p>The role of the primary visual cortex in stimulus perception is an intense area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gail et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Leopold and Logothetis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Polonsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wunderlich et al., 2005</xref>). Previous fMRI studies investigating the dependence of V1 BOLD activity on visual perception produced controversial results, which might be related to the difficulty of disentangling perception from spatial attention. Indeed, it has been shown that attention, but not perception, modulates the BOLD signal in human V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Watanabe et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, perception was found to enhance the BOLD response within V1 for specific experimental designs (e.g., flash suppression of perception) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yuval-Greenberg and Heeger, 2013</xref>). Our study employed a substantially different stimulation paradigm that specifically allowed us, by adjusting the stimulation contrast, to induce the same BOLD response, and inductively an equivalent mean degree of synaptic activity, within V1 under the two experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Logothetis, 2008</xref>). Most importantly, we did not use any additional stimulus (e.g., visual masking) to suppress or modulate visual perception. On the contrary, we used a simple way to modulate perception for extended periods of time (required by 1H-fMRS) while maintaining attention at a nearly constant level, as evidenced by pupillometry and task performance. In particular, we employed the well-known dependence of BOLD response in V1 to flickering, which at full-contrast peaks at 4–8 Hz and settles around 70% of its maximal value even at frequencies above 30 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Thomas and Menon, 1998</xref>), that is, in the absence of flickering perception. Previous literature reported that the peak activations in V1 and secondary visual areas are stimulation dependent and occur at distinct temporal frequencies (4 or 8 Hz in V1, and 20 or 40 Hz in secondary visual areas for chromatic or luminance flickering, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fox et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kastner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kwong et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Singh et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the preferred frequency of secondary visual areas is just below the CFF for chromatic flickering (~25 Hz) and luminance flickering (~50 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shady et al., 2004</xref>). In our experiments, the isoluminant chromatic flickering stimulation at 30 Hz is above the CFF and accordingly we found that the BOLD response in secondary visual areas drops substantially compared with the concurrent BOLD response in V1. Overall, by using visual stimulations below and above the CFF and adjusting the contrast of the low-frequency stimulus we were able to modulate perception alongside BOLD activity in secondary visual areas with a unchanged BOLD activity in V1. It should be noted that subtle differences in the qualitative nature of the BOLD signal response might exist between the two conditions, although the trends toward longer onset time and time-to-peak during UF compared with PF were not statistically significant.</p><p>Our study has some limitations. For instance, the fMRI measurements have been obtained using 30 s epochs, while the fMRS measurements have been obtained using 4 min epochs. Long acquisition times are required for achieving a good sensitivity of the 1H-fMRS measurements and a reliable metabolite quantification, even at magnetic fields of 3T. Nonetheless, results in both humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mangia et al., 2007b</xref>) and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Just et al., 2013</xref>) have shown that prolonged (i.e., minutes) stimulations elicit a persistent BOLD response with minimal attenuation. Although we cannot exclude a certain degree of neuronal adaptation, we confirmed that the BOLD effect during the fMRS acquisition was indeed relatively stable as determined by the linewidth changes of tCr and tNAA signals. Another limitation to consider is represented by the large volume used for 1H-fMRS measurements. It could be possible that the observed changes in lactate levels include distinct neuronal populations showing nonuniform responses. Indeed, although the main differential effect of frequency was located far from the calcarine sulcus, it also involved some mid hemispheric areas presumably included in the spectroscopic voxel. As an illustration, heterogeneity in the response to stimulation within V1 might be due to, for example, eccentricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chai et al., 2019</xref>), which we however minimized by using a 3° foveal stimulation. There is also an hemispheric lateralization for the spatial frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kauffmann et al., 2014</xref>), but this is not likely to apply to our study, as we used the same radial checkerboard (i.e., including many spatial frequencies) for both PF and UF. The finding that the changes in BOLD signal during PF and UF were nearly double in the anatomical (i.e., Brodmann atlas-based) V1 compared with the spectroscopic VOI indicates a substantial partial-volume effect. The associated loss of sensitivity entails that the lactate concentration change that we report here might in fact be underestimated. Furthermore, we cannot exclude that feedback input to V1 from secondary visual areas might be taking place during stimulus perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Watkins et al., 2006</xref>). However, under our experimental design we were able to fully control BOLD response in V1 by only acting on stimulus contrast, without altering the subjective perception of the stimuli, which indicates that the BOLD activity in V1 largely reflected stimulus features. Finally, we based the positioning of the spectroscopic VOI solely on the online estimate of the stimulus-induced BOLD signal change. In particular, we could not perform online retinotopic mapping for driving the positioning of the spectroscopic VOI, as this would have increased the acquisition protocol duration to an impractical length for guaranteeing good attention levels and absence of motion during the 1H-fMRS session. In any case, partial-volume effects are unavoidable because the STEAM sequence we used requires a box-shaped VOI, which would have not allowed us to entirely avoid the inclusion of tissue outside V1, regardless of the availability of the retinotopic map.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we report for the first time that visual perception has a measurable metabolic effect on V1. Although we could not establish any causal relation between metabolism and perception, our findings imply that BOLD-fMRI and 1H-fMRS are complementary techniques. Specifically, they are capable of highlighting different aspects of neural activation and stimulus processing, for example, under conditions in which synaptic and spiking activity are partially disentangled due to an alteration of excitation/inhibition patterns and, in turn, local input/output balance.</p><p>Although we focused on the visual pathways, it is conceivable that our results can be translated to other sensory modalities. For example, tactile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laureys et al., 2002</xref>) or auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boly et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Laureys et al., 2000</xref>) stimulations during vegetative state can still activate primary somatosensory cortex (S1) or primary auditory cortex (A1), respectively, in the absence of perception and without the involvement of higher-order associative areas.</p><p>We suggest that the cortical metabolic profile might be an indicator of sensory perception, in keeping with the dynamics of lactate and glutamate across the sleep–wake cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aalling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DiNuzzo and Nedergaard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Naylor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Naylor et al., 2011</xref>) as well as with the relation between lactate and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zuend et al., 2020</xref>). Elevated brain lactate and glutamate levels are associated with wakefulness and memory formation, which naturally require the processing of incoming sensory stimuli, like the control exerted by the central visual pathways for either gating or filtering out behaviorally relevant or irrelevant visual information. As such, the metabolic responses to perceived, but not unperceived, sensory stimulation could be enabling factors for learning and memory, as indicated by the relevance of aerobic glycolysis and lactate in synaptic plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bueschke et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Descalzi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">DiNuzzo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Harris et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herrera-López et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jourdain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kobayashi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lundquist et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Margineanu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Scavuzzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yang et al., 2014</xref>).

Thirteen subjects were discarded either upon online fMRI processing (see below) or in early quality control on data, because of motion (3) or because the most activated area was in unfavorable position with respect to the surface-coil sensitive volume (10). Nineteen healthy volunteers (10 females, 9 males; age 25 ± 4 years), mean ± standard deviation (SD; age range 20–35 years) were thus considered for this study.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Perception affects the brain's metabolic response to sensory stimulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Peter Kok as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Norris (Reviewer #2); Polytimi Frangou (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The reviewers agreed that the study is of interest but had serious concerns about the interpretation of some of the main results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The possibility exists that you have a significant partial volume contamination of V2 in your spectroscopy voxel, and that this activates more in the PF than the UF condition. In fact, you yourselves raise a potential partial voluming issue in the fMRS measurement that seems important to consider, given the differential BOLD signal in nearby regions (V2 and V3). This effect may not fully explain your results because you have such large increases in Glu and Lac, but it may exaggerate them. In this context, you used the Freesurfer coordinates to locate the primary visual areas. Is there any reason why you did not perform retinotopic mapping? There can be a large variation in the size of early visual regions between subjects (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3201). Retinotopic mapping would have made it possible to exclude V2 from your spectroscopic voxel on an individual basis. Is there something you can do to address this conclusively?</p><p>2. Although you matched the level of BOLD response, the qualitative nature of the BOLD activation within V1 will probably differ. In the Discussion you point out that the firing rate of layer IV neurons will be higher during UF than PF. This would imply a higher level of activity in the input layer during UF than PF. As the total BOLD activity was matched then there will by necessity have been higher activity in the layers outside layer IV for PF, which by definition implies a higher activation in the output layers of V1 and hence a higher input to V2. The significant increase in activation in V2 cannot be unambiguously ascribed to perception as your design forces a higher level of activity in the output layers of V1. Please discuss how this affects the interpretability of your findings.</p><p>3. The acquisition of MRS data necessitates long acquisition times and block designs. Early work on lactate emphasised that it was only detectable for prolonged stimulation. Work from your lab (Mangia et al. 2007) suggests that lactate levels are highest during the first period of stimulus than later. Do you believe that the lactate signal results from prolonged stimulation of a (sub)population of neurons or is it intrinsic to the process? Please discuss the potential role of lactate in more detail, for instance by including a short historical overview regarding the interpretation of the lactate signal, going back to the Prichard paper. Also some discussion of the role of lactate as a substrate for neurons would be interesting.</p><p>4. Lin et al. (2012) found a reduction in aspartate in a similar experiment but performed at 7T. In your experiment Asp remains unchanged. Is either result in any way consistent with an upregulation in MAS? Differences in glutamate could be suggested to reflect higher levels of excitatory synaptic activity: did you consider this?</p><p>5. In Figure 2B, it looks like BOLD dynamics may differ between the slow and fast flicker blocks, even if the mean amplitude did not. So perhaps there are some more subtle BOLD differences between conditions that are not sufficiently explored. (E.g. an increased BOLD response to perceived flicker early on, follow by adaptation; Figure 2B looks potentially in line with this.) Is it possible to look into this further? It is unclear whether the time-courses between PF and UF were compared statistically. During visual stimulation under wakefulness vs. anaesthesia, onset time and time to peak of the BOLD response differ between the two states (e.g. Dinh, T. N. A. et al. 2021, Neuroimage). The authors suggest that the metabolic processes described here are in line with lactate and glutamate dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle; therefore, it would be interesting to explore the differences in the time-course of the BOLD response for perceived vs. unperceived stimulation in primary and secondary visual areas.</p><p>Please see the recommendations made by the individual reviewers for further suggestions and more detail on some of these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In Figure 2B, it looks like BOLD dynamics may differ between the slow and fast flicker blocks, even if the mean amplitude did not.

For instance, can we be sure a different fMRI sequence would also have yielded a null effect?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>You have shown that in early visual cortex the metabolic response profile as measured by proton spectroscopy differs between two experimental conditions, even when the total BOLD response is matched. Given our knowledge of the origins of the BOLD signal change, and of the metabolite signal changes that you record this is a highly plausible result. I do have some questions about aspects of your experimental design and interpretation.</p><p>1. Although you matched the level of BOLD response, the qualitative nature of the BOLD activation within V1 will probably differ. In the Discussion you point out that the firing rate of layer IV neurons will be higher during UF than PF. This would imply a higher level of activity in the input layer during UF than PF. As the total BOLD activity was matched then there will by necessity have been higher activity in the layers outside layer IV for PF, which by definition implies a higher activation in the output layers of V1 and hence a higher input to V2. The significant increase in activation in V2 cannot be unambiguously ascribed to perception as your design forces a higher level of activity in the output layers of V1.</p><p>2. It would have been interesting to have measured CBF as well as BOLD. By matching BOLD alone, the possibility remains that in one condition (probably PF) both CBF and CMRO2 could be elevated relative to the other condition (UF) leading to equal BOLD responses but different underlying metabolic rates.</p><p>3. The acquisition of MRS data necessitates long acquisition times and block designs. Early work on lactate emphasised that it was only detectable for prolonged stimulation. Work from your lab (Mangia et al. 2007) suggests that lactate levels are highest during the first period of stimulus than later. My somewhat philosophical question, is do you believe that the lactate signal results from prolonged stimulation of a (sub)population of neurons or is it intrinsic to the process? In this context I would also have appreciated a short historical overview regarding the interpretation of the lactate signal, going back to the Prichard paper. Also some discussion of the role of lactate as a substrate for neurons would be interesting.</p><p>4. Lin et al. (2012) found a reduction in aspartate in a similar experiment but performed at 7T. In your experiment Asp remains unchanged. Is either result in any way consistent with an upregulation in MAS? Differences in glutamate could be suggested to reflect higher levels of excitatory synaptic activity: did you consider this?</p><p>5. You used the Freesurfer coordinates to locate the primary visual areas. Is there any reason why you did not perform retinotopic mapping? There can be a large variation in the size of early visual regions between subjects (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3201). Retinotopic mapping would have made it possible to exclude V2 from your spectroscopic voxel on an individual basis. The possibility exists that you have a significant partial volume contamination of V2 in your spectroscopy voxel, and that this activates more in the PF than the UF condition. I do not believe that this effect explains your results because you have such large increases in Glu and Lac but it may exaggerate them.</p><p>6. Why wasn't the experiment done at 7T? You would have had a smaller MRS voxel and a fuller metabolic profile?</p><p>7. If you would like to do a better experiment (though I am not insisting that this should be done) then instead of trying to match the activation level in V1, I would perform the experiment at different contrast levels. I would also perform retinotopic mapping to ensure that partial voluming from V2 etc. is negligible. You could test then if the intercepts of the Lac/glu concentration as a function of stimulus intensity are linear with the same intercept, implying both are involved in metabolic activity, or have different intercepts implying that they are involved in different processes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors briefly touch upon the time-course of the BOLD response in Figure 2B. It is unclear whether the time-courses between PF and UF were compared statistically. During visual stimulation under wakefulness vs. anaesthesia, onset time and time to peak of the BOLD response differ between the two states (e.g. Dinh, T. N. A. et al. 2021, Neuroimage). The authors suggest that the metabolic processes described here are in line with lactate and glutamate dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle; therefore, it would be interesting to explore the differences in the time-course of the BOLD response for perceived vs. unperceived stimulation in primary and secondary visual areas.</p><p>2) Could the authors elaborate on how upregulation of the MAS would result in increased MRS-visible glutamate? My understanding is that upregulation of the MAS would result in increased glutamate transportation into the mitochondrial matrix – how would this impact glutamate in the extracellular space that is presumably what MRS picks up?</p><p>3) Removing the statistics from the plots would further declutter the figures.</p><p>4) The order of the figures should be reconsidered. While the authors provide an impressive array of convincing controls for attention, these are not the focus of the paper and should not occupy Figure 1. These analyses would be best suited as figure supplements to Figure 4, showing that the differences observed cannot be attributed to attentional modulation. Similarly, Table 1 should be split into two tables as figure supplements to Figures 2 and 4, respectively or provided as source data. Table 2 could be provided as source data.</p><p>The first question the authors answer is whether there are differences in the BOLD signal between the two frequency conditions. This is answered in (1) Figure 3B – no differences in fMRI BOLD within V1 for PF vs UF and (2) 2C/3C/3D – differences within BA18/19 but not BA17 or the MRS voxel for PF vs UF.</p><p>The authors provide further supporting evidence to secondary questions about (i) areas activated for PF vs rest and UF vs rest (2B, 2C) and (ii) whether they overlap (3A). These secondary questions (as well as Figure 2A that refers to methodology) can be added as figure supplements without distracting the reader from the key findings.</p><p>5) You show in figure S4 the different ROIs (BA17, BA18, BA19) and your MRS voxel. It would be very informative if you also overlayed the MRS voxel on the PF&gt;UF activation of Figure 3B and quantified the overlap.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Perception is associated with the brain's metabolic response to sensory stimulation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before we can accept your paper for publication, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the manuscript, it is still unclear how you performed normalisation to the concentration of creatine, as we do not understand the use of &quot;assumed concentration of creatine&quot; in the VOI (line 612). We agree that creatine would be the appropriate reference, rather than water, (lines 610-611 could explain what the &quot;inherent uncertainty&quot; is) and would expect that measured concentration of metabolites is referenced to the measured concentration of creatine. Indeed, this is what we understand from your response letter, but it's not clear from your manuscript text. To be clear, the concern is mainly that your methods are easily understood and replicable, rather than a concern about their validity.</p><p>The following points are suggestions for clarifications.</p><p>2) Thank you for rearranging the figures and adding figure supplements. We appreciate your concerns about the two main figures and the increased number of supplements for Figure 1. A potential solution could be splitting the fMRI results in two figures:</p><p>Figure 1: VOI-based fMRI results; that is the current Figure 1 and the figure supplements that include control analyses (Figure 1 – supplements 1,2,3,4,5)</p><p>Figure 2: voxel-based fMRI results; that is a composite figure of Figure 1 – supplement 6 and Figure 1 – supplement 7, with Figure 1 – supplement 8 as supplement</p><p>Figure 3: fMRS results; as is, that is the current Figure 2 with its supplements.</p><p>3) Thank you for providing a detailed explanation to our question about the interpretation of glutamate increase. Lines 336-349 in your revised text contain important interpretational information and would benefit from being rewritten in a more accessible way for the wider readership your paper will attract.</p><p>4) Our understanding from lines 615-620 is that you iteratively apply linewidth-matching until the amplitude of the difference spectra is minimised; that is because you assume that the amplitude in the difference spectra would arise from either BOLD effects or true metabolite differences. This process is not very clear in the text and it would be helpful to clarify the steps.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71016.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Accordingly, the reported changes in lactate and glutamate during the PF condition could be somewhat overestimated, assuming that the sign of the changes in V1 and V2/V3 are congruent between each other. We also agree that subject level retinotopic mapping would have improved experimental design. However, we could not perform online retinotopic mapping for driving the spectroscopic voxel positioning within our 1H-fMRS protocol because of time constraints. Indeed, acquiring and processing retinotopic information, and transferring back the maps to the scanner, would have lengthened the acquisition protocol duration to more than 90 min, an impracticable length for guaranteeing good attention levels and absence of motion during the fMRS session. Furthermore, partial volume would have been in any case unavoidable considering that the STEAM sequence we used requires a rectangular box-shaped voxel (not an arbitrary shape, although there have been proposals in such direction, like ASSESS sequence or 2D-SSE/SPEN pulses). In particular, a box-shaped voxel would have not allowed to entirely avoid inclusion of tissue outside V1, regardless of the availability of the retinotopic map. This is due to anatomical considerations, i.e. the three-dimensional shape of the visual cortex. Therefore, we based the positioning of the spectroscopic voxel solely on the online (i.e., in-scanner) determination of the stimulation-induced BOLD-fMRI signal change. In this revision, we have stressed the lack of retinotopic mapping as a limitation of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Although you matched the level of BOLD response, the qualitative nature of the BOLD activation within V1 will probably differ. In the Discussion you point out that the firing rate of layer IV neurons will be higher during UF than PF. This would imply a higher level of activity in the input layer during UF than PF. As the total BOLD activity was matched then there will by necessity have been higher activity in the layers outside layer IV for PF, which by definition implies a higher activation in the output layers of V1 and hence a higher input to V2. The significant increase in activation in V2 cannot be unambiguously ascribed to perception as your design forces a higher level of activity in the output layers of V1. Please discuss how this affects the interpretability of your findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the qualitative nature of the BOLD signal within V1 might be different during the PF and UF conditions, which also implies different ratios between the neural activity in input vs. output layers. We also agree that the changes we have reported in BOLD signal within V2/V3 (and by the way, also the changes in metabolite levels within V1) cannot be unambiguously ascribed to perception. In fact, we tried to avoid any discussion about “causality”, but we rather focused on “association”. We realized that in some circumstances we might have used ambiguous terminology, thus in this revision we have paid particular attention not to over-interpret our findings, also emphasizing the inappropriateness of implying causality between our results and perception. Finally, we slightly changed the title accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The acquisition of MRS data necessitates long acquisition times and block designs. Early work on lactate emphasised that it was only detectable for prolonged stimulation. Work from your lab (Mangia et al. 2007) suggests that lactate levels are highest during the first period of stimulus than later. Do you believe that the lactate signal results from prolonged stimulation of a (sub)population of neurons or is it intrinsic to the process? Please discuss the potential role of lactate in more detail, for instance by including a short historical overview regarding the interpretation of the lactate signal, going back to the Prichard paper. Also some discussion of the role of lactate as a substrate for neurons would be interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous 1H-fMRS experiments from our group and other labs clearly showed that there is a net lactate increase in the stimulated cortical tissue in the order of approx. 20% that develops within about 1 minute and then settles there to a new steady-state. Partial volume here could partly explain the slow dynamics of the lactate signal, as electrode-based lactate measurements in the stimulated cat visual cortex have reported that extracellular lactate concentration rises on the sub-second time scale in a manner which is robustly time-locked with the visual stimulus (Li and Freeman, J Neurochem 2015). Unfortunately, based on current literature it is not possible to assign the lactate increase to a specific neuronal population. In fact, there is no way of assigning the lactate increase to any cellular population, including astroglia. The latter argument prevents discussing the interpretation of lactate as a substrate for neurons, because any underlying astrocyte-to-neuron or neuron-to-astrocyte lactate shuttle remains unproven in vivo (see, for example, Dienel, J Neurosci 2017). Moreover, lactate has been proposed to have a role as a signaling molecule rather than (or in addition to) a metabolic substrate (DiNuzzo, Front Integr Neurosci 2016). We have even advanced new hypothesis on the production and flux of lactate in the brain during stimulation related to glycogen (see, for example, DiNuzzo et al., JCBFM 2010, 2019). Overall, while the stimulation-induced increase in brain lactate is a well-established concept, the exact mechanisms responsible for its production as well as its fate (whether metabolic or other) is unknown. Therefore, we would avoid reiterating the examination about the role of lactate in the brain, which we feel would distract from the main focus of the present paper, also considering that the discussion is already quite long and dense. However, as noted in XXX at page XXX, we invite the interested reader to refer to the papers published by our and other groups on the lactate debate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lin et al. (2012) found a reduction in aspartate in a similar experiment but performed at 7T. In your experiment Asp remains unchanged. Is either result in any way consistent with an upregulation in MAS? Differences in glutamate could be suggested to reflect higher levels of excitatory synaptic activity: did you consider this?</p></disp-quote><p>The involvement of activation-induced changes of glutamate and aspartate observed in previous works has been indeed ascribed to MAS (Mangia et al., JCBFM 2007; Mangia et al., Neurochem Res 2012; Lin et al., JCBFM 2012; Hertz and Chen, Front Integr Neurosci 2017; Hertz and Rothman, Biology 2017). Yet, a decrease in aspartate during sensory stimulation is commonly observed at 7T, while to our knowledge has never been reported at 3T (including the current study), most likely due to lower detection sensitivity. Therfore we would like to refrain from interpreting the lack of an observed Asp change in our study as evidence of a physiological process.</p><p>The suggested idea of a direct relation between glutamate and higher levels of excitatory synaptic activity is interesting. However, the amount of released glutamate (on average, 1 umol/g in 1 minute) is comparably minor compared with the intracellular pool (10 umol/g in neurons), and part of the released glutamate has been shown to undergo oxidation in astrocytes (i.e., disappear), with the oxidized fraction increasing non-linearly with the extracellular glutamate levels, and hence neurotransmission (McKenna, Front Endocrinol 2013). Furthermore, NMR visibility of glutamate might change during neurotransmission due to different mobility of the glutamate molecules when they are released compared to when they are densely packed into synaptic vesicle, which would additionally complicate the interpretation of a direct relation between glutamate and neurotransmission per se. In light of such observations, discussing the possibility that different findings among studies may be ascribed to different levels of excitatory activity could be unnecessarily speculative, although this is certainly a fascinating idea. In this revision we mention the main reason for why aspartate is not commonly reported at 3T, and we also clarify our interpretation that glutamate and aspartate changes relates to MAS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 2B, it looks like BOLD dynamics may differ between the slow and fast flicker blocks, even if the mean amplitude did not. So perhaps there are some more subtle BOLD differences between conditions that are not sufficiently explored. (E.g. an increased BOLD response to perceived flicker early on, follow by adaptation; Figure 2B looks potentially in line with this.) Is it possible to look into this further? It is unclear whether the time-courses between PF and UF were compared statistically. During visual stimulation under wakefulness vs. anaesthesia, onset time and time to peak of the BOLD response differ between the two states (e.g. Dinh, T. N. A. et al. 2021, Neuroimage). The authors suggest that the metabolic processes described here are in line with lactate and glutamate dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle; therefore, it would be interesting to explore the differences in the time-course of the BOLD response for perceived vs. unperceived stimulation in primary and secondary visual areas.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the average BOLD signals that we report during PF and UF might contain subtle differences, possibly related to processing of visual information in V1.

For instance, can we be sure a different fMRI sequence would also have yielded a null effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a null effect is intrinsically difficult to prove. Without prospectively acquiring relevant data, it is hard to exclude the possibility that other fMRI sequences may have found differences among conditions. However, we still consider this scenario unlikely, as generally speaking other fMRI sequences (such as spin-echo EPI or ASL sequences) have lower sensitivity than the EPI sequence used here, albeit they may have higher specificity to the yet-unknown mechanisms that may generate a difference in response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>You have shown that in early visual cortex the metabolic response profile as measured by proton spectroscopy differs between two experimental conditions, even when the total BOLD response is matched. Given our knowledge of the origins of the BOLD signal change, and of the metabolite signal changes that you record this is a highly plausible result. I do have some questions about aspects of your experimental design and interpretation.</p><p>1. Although you matched the level of BOLD response, the qualitative nature of the BOLD activation within V1 will probably differ. In the Discussion you point out that the firing rate of layer IV neurons will be higher during UF than PF. This would imply a higher level of activity in the input layer during UF than PF. As the total BOLD activity was matched then there will by necessity have been higher activity in the layers outside layer IV for PF, which by definition implies a higher activation in the output layers of V1 and hence a higher input to V2. The significant increase in activation in V2 cannot be unambiguously ascribed to perception as your design forces a higher level of activity in the output layers of V1.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee raises a very important point, that we incorporated in our revised manuscript. We now stressed that our findings are “associated” with stimulus perception, without necessarily a causal relationship. Nonetheless, a higher activity of output layers is a necessary correlate of perception. We understand that everything here would be speculative, so we do not elaborate further on this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It would have been interesting to have measured CBF as well as BOLD. By matching BOLD alone, the possibility remains that in one condition (probably PF) both CBF and CMRO2 could be elevated relative to the other condition (UF) leading to equal BOLD responses but different underlying metabolic rates.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that measuring CBF in addition to BOLD may provide valuable insights.

You used the Freesurfer coordinates to locate the primary visual areas. Is there any reason why you did not perform retinotopic mapping? There can be a large variation in the size of early visual regions between subjects (https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms3201). Retinotopic mapping would have made it possible to exclude V2 from your spectroscopic voxel on an individual basis. The possibility exists that you have a significant partial volume contamination of V2 in your spectroscopy voxel, and that this activates more in the PF than the UF condition. I do not believe that this effect explains your results because you have such large increases in Glu and Lac but it may exaggerate them.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response in the “Essential revisions” above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Why wasn't the experiment done at 7T? You would have had a smaller MRS voxel and a fuller metabolic profile?</p></disp-quote><p>Because we were interested in confirming whether the typical changes observed at 7T are robustly observed on a more widespread clinical platform (3T), while implementing at the same time an original study design for addressing putative dissociation between BOLD-fMRI and fMRS. The point raised by the referee is also related to our MRS findings about aspartate. Please see our response in the “Essential revisions” above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. If you would like to do a better experiment (though I am not insisting that this should be done) then instead of trying to match the activation level in V1, I would perform the experiment at different contrast levels. I would also perform retinotopic mapping to ensure that partial voluming from V2 etc. is negligible. You could test then if the intercepts of the Lac/glu concentration as a function of stimulus intensity are linear with the same intercept, implying both are involved in metabolic activity, or have different intercepts implying that they are involved in different processes.</p></disp-quote><p>Such an experiment, as suggested by the referee, would be of exceptional value, but it would also be extremely costly and time-consuming. In fact, repeating the same measurements at different contrast levels would require for subjects to undergo excessively prolonged fMRI and MRS sessions (it took around 80 minutes to acquire the individual data sets used in the present study), especially at 3T where 4 min of averaging was needed for reliable metabolite quantification of each spectrum. A somewhat feasible version of such study may be designed for future investigations to be preferably conducted at higher fields.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The authors briefly touch upon the time-course of the BOLD response in Figure 2B. It is unclear whether the time-courses between PF and UF were compared statistically. During visual stimulation under wakefulness vs. anaesthesia, onset time and time to peak of the BOLD response differ between the two states (e.g. Dinh, T. N. A. et al. 2021, Neuroimage). The authors suggest that the metabolic processes described here are in line with lactate and glutamate dynamics across the sleep-wake cycle; therefore, it would be interesting to explore the differences in the time-course of the BOLD response for perceived vs. unperceived stimulation in primary and secondary visual areas.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this interesting comment. Following the present and another referee’s observation, we have now compared the BOLD time-courses during PF and UF. We did not find any statistically significant difference, nor onset-time and time-to-peak were significantly different. However, the suggestion that onset-time and time-to-peak might be able to distinguish between the two conditions is intriguing and we will look into it in future experiments with more statistical power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could the authors elaborate on how upregulation of the MAS would result in increased MRS-visible glutamate? My understanding is that upregulation of the MAS would result in increased glutamate transportation into the mitochondrial matrix – how would this impact glutamate in the extracellular space that is presumably what MRS picks up?</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right. The up-regulation of the MAS results in an increased rate of transport of glutamate in mitochondria via the aspartate-glutamate carrier (AGC1), which also counter-transport aspartate out of the mitochondria. However, such transport requires concomitant exchange between malate and α-ketoglutarate via the oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), together with two dehydrogenation and two transamination reactions. When the overall MAS activity increases in order to process more glycolysis-derived NADH, all the various transporters and enzymes also accelerate. However, AGC1 is a rate-limiting step in MAS (i.e., it is the slower component), which results in a decrease in intramitochondrial aspartate and an increase in cytosolic glutamate (as explained in Mangia et al., Neurochem Res 2012; see also references therein). Notice that trans-mitochondrial malate transport is always possible (even independently of alphaketoglutarate counter-transport) due to the presence of dicarboxylate carrier (DIC, mediating malate exit from mitochondria) and citrate carrier (CIC, mediating malate entry into mitochondria with counter-transport of citrate).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Removing the statistics from the plots would further declutter the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now removed statistics from the figure plots, as suggested by the referee.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The order of the figures should be reconsidered. While the authors provide an impressive array of convincing controls for attention, these are not the focus of the paper and should not occupy Figure 1. These analyses would be best suited as figure supplements to Figure 4, showing that the differences observed cannot be attributed to attentional modulation. Similarly, Table 1 should be split into two tables as figure supplements to Figures 2 and 4, respectively or provided as source data. Table 2 could be provided as source data.</p><p>The first question the authors answer is whether there are differences in the BOLD signal between the two frequency conditions. This is answered in (1) Figure 3B – no differences in fMRI BOLD within V1 for PF vs UF and (2) 2C/3C/3D – differences within BA18/19 but not BA17 or the MRS voxel for PF vs UF.</p><p>The authors provide further supporting evidence to secondary questions about (i) areas activated for PF vs rest and UF vs rest (2B, 2C) and (ii) whether they overlap (3A). These secondary questions (as well as Figure 2A that refers to methodology) can be added as figure supplements without distracting the reader from the key findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for these useful comments. In the present revision, we arranged the material to better focus on the main results of the study. We generally agree with the referee that some tables and figures are better suited for being supplementary figure or source data, and we actually followed all referee’s suggestions, yet we would prefer to maintain our logical flow in introducing our results. As a note, by moving most of the material as figure/data supplement as suggested by the referee, we ended up in having only two main figures in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) You show in figure S4 the different ROIs (BA17, BA18, BA19) and your MRS voxel. It would be very informative if you also overlayed the MRS voxel on the PF&gt;UF activation of Figure 3B and quantified the overlap.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done. With the chosen statistics, the contamination of the PF&gt;UF voxels represent 0.5% of the spectroscopic VOI. We also included a new figure supplement, as suggested by the referee.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before we can accept your paper for publication, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the manuscript, it is still unclear how you performed normalisation to the concentration of creatine, as we do not understand the use of &quot;assumed concentration of creatine&quot; in the VOI (line 612). We agree that creatine would be the appropriate reference, rather than water, (lines 610-611 could explain what the &quot;inherent uncertainty&quot; is) and would expect that measured concentration of metabolites is referenced to the measured concentration of creatine. Indeed, this is what we understand from your response letter, but it's not clear from your manuscript text. To be clear, the concern is mainly that your methods are easily understood and replicable, rather than a concern about their validity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the description was a bit unclear. As highlighted by the Editors, the concentration of total creatine has been assumed constant. This is a standard approach in the brain MRS literature, albeit for absolute quantification water referencing (ie, assuming water content constant) is currently preferred. Thus, we have normalized the spectra to the tCr signal amplitude, fitted over the whole run. Results were converted into concentrations using tCr values taken from the literature. We changed the text in the relevant section, keeping also into account your remark about imprecise wording (“inherent uncertainty”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following points are suggestions for clarifications.</p><p>2) Thank you for rearranging the figures and adding figure supplements. We appreciate your concerns about the two main figures and the increased number of supplements for Figure 1. A potential solution could be splitting the fMRI results in two figures:</p><p>Figure 1: VOI-based fMRI results; that is the current Figure 1 and the figure supplements that include control analyses (Figure 1 – supplements 1,2,3,4,5)</p><p>Figure 2: voxel-based fMRI results; that is a composite figure of Figure 1 – supplement 6 and Figure 1 – supplement 7, with Figure 1 – supplement 8 as supplement</p><p>Figure 3: fMRS results; as is, that is the current Figure 2 with its supplements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have separated the VOI-based and the voxel-based fMRI results into two figures, as indicated. In addition to the suggestions of the Editors, we have also moved a Data source that was previously in Figure 1, because it turned out to be relevant to the new Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Thank you for providing a detailed explanation to our question about the interpretation of glutamate increase. Lines 336-349 in your revised text contain important interpretational information and would benefit from being rewritten in a more accessible way for the wider readership your paper will attract.</p></disp-quote><p>We have slightly rewritten the portion of the text indicated by the Editors to make it more accessible. Although we have attempted to simplify the text, a detailed explanation would require an in-depth description of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which we feel is beyond the scope of the interpretational point that we want to make about glutamate and aspartate, considering that we have already discussed these arguments in other publications (e.g., Mangia et al., 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Our understanding from lines 615-620 is that you iteratively apply linewidth-matching until the amplitude of the difference spectra is minimised; that is because you assume that the amplitude in the difference spectra would arise from either BOLD effects or true metabolite differences. This process is not very clear in the text and it would be helpful to clarify the steps.</p></disp-quote><p>The Editors are right, we assume that the amplitude in the difference spectra arises from either BOLD effects or true metabolite differences. Yet, we did not minimize the difference spectra corresponding to the entire spectral width, but only the spectral window containing the metabolite chosen to estimate the BOLD effect, whether total creatine (tCr) or total N-acetyl-aspartate (tNAA). Indeed, it is commonly assumed that the concentration of these metabolites does not change across conditions (rest versus stimulation). This assumption entails that the corresponding area under the curve remains constant across conditions, whereas the line width possibly changes (i.e., due to the BOLD effect). Under these conditions, our iterative approach guarantees that the adjustments of spectral line width that minimize the difference between spectra at rest and during stimulation coincides with the BOLD effect. We have modified the text to clarify our approach.</p></body></sub-article></article>
