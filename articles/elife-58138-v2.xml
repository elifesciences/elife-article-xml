In cases of congenital heart defects, localized ultrastructural disruptions that increase the risk of heart failure are only starting to be discovered. This is in part due to a lack of technologies that can image the three-dimensional (3D) heart structure, to assess malformations; and its ultrastructure, to assess organelle disruptions. We present here a multiscale, correlative imaging procedure that achieves high-resolution images of the whole heart, using 3D micro-computed tomography (micro-CT); and its ultrastructure, using 3D scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In a small animal model (chicken embryo), we achieved uniform fixation and staining of the whole heart, without losing ultrastructural preservation on the same sample, enabling correlative multiscale imaging. Our approach enables multiscale studies in models of congenital heart disease and beyond.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The heart is our hardest-working organ and beats around 100,000 times a day, pumping blood through a vast system of vessels to all areas of the body. Specialized heart cells make the heart contract rhythmically, enabling it to work efficiently. Contractile molecules inside these cells, called myofibrils, align within the heart cells, and heart cells align to each other, so that the heart tissue contracts effectively.</p><p>However, when the heart has defects or is diseased this organization can be lost, and the heart may no longer pump blood efficiently, leading to sometimes life-threatening complications. For example, around one in a hundred newborn babies suffer from congenital heart defects, and despite medical advances, these conditions remain the main cause of non-infectious mortality in children.</p><p>Many cases of congenital heart disease are diagnosed before a baby is born during an ultrasound scan. However, these scans, as well as subsequent diagnostic tools, lack the precision to detect problems within the heart cells. Now, Rykiel et al. used two complementary imaging techniques known as micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy to acquire pictures of the whole heart as well as of the organization inside the heart cells.</p><p>This made it possible to capture the structure of the heart tissue at both micrometer (the whole heart) and nanometer resolution (the inside of the cells), and to study what happens within the heart and its cells when the heart has a defect.</p><p>Rykiel et al. tested the imaging technology on the hearts of chicken embryos, at stages equivalent to a five to six-month-old human fetus, and compared a healthy heart with a heart with a defect called tetralogy of Fallot. They found that the tissues in the heart with a defect had a sponge-like appearance, with increased space in between cells. Moreover, the myofibrils of the heart with a defect were aligned differently compared to those in the normal heart.</p><p>More research is needed to fully understand what happens when the heart has a defect. However, the imaging technology used in this study offers the possibility of examining the heart at an unprecedented level of detail. This will deepen our understanding of how structural heart defects arise and how they affect the pumping of the heart, and will give us clues to design better treatments for patients with heart defects and other heart anomalies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heart defects</kwd><kwd>fetal heart structure</kwd><kwd>fetal heart ultrastructure</kwd><kwd>myocardial organization</kwd><kwd>congenital defects</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL094570</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rugonyi</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006668</institution-id><institution>Oregon Health and Science University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rugonyi</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007269</institution-id><institution>School of Medicine, Oregon Health and Science University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rugonyi</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Correlative imaging of the heart at multiple spatial scales has the potential to revolutionize the way we understand deficiencies in congenital heart disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital heart disease (CHD), which manifests as a morphologically defective heart, affects about 1% of newborn babies, and remains the primary cause of non-infectious children mortality in the developed world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilboa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van der Linde et al., 2011</xref>). While CHD mortality rates have been dramatically reduced in recent years thanks to advances in surgical practice and interventional technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilboa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Czosek and Anderson, 2016</xref>), CHD patients continue to be at an increased risk of developing heart failure at a much younger age than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilljam et al., 2019</xref>). Despite early indicators of success, heart failure continues to take the lives of young children with CHD: 10% to 25% of newborns with a critical heart defect do not survive the first year, and 44% do not survive to 18 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oster et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stout et al., 2016</xref>). This unfortunate trend points to cardiac deficiencies in CHD that are not yet understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sugimoto et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Imaging approaches have been employed to study cardiac function in normal and CHD hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Prakash et al., 2010</xref>). In humans, ultrasound-based echocardiography, which can image the in vivo motion of cardiac walls and measure blood flow velocities within the heart, is used to diagnose fetal CHD in utero and assess CHD severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jatavan et al., 2016</xref>). After the baby is born, echocardiography is useful to monitor cardiac function before and after interventions to repair CHD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also employed to precisely diagnose malformations and monitor cardiac function in CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sreedhar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ntsinjana et al., 2011</xref>). In heart development animal research, moreover, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and echocardiography are used with avian and mammalian models of CHD. OCT, like ultrasound, is a non-invasive technique that can image heart motion and measure blood flow velocities within the heart. OCT resolution (&lt;5 µm) is ideal for early avian and mouse embryos during tubular-heart developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Larina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Syed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Larina et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenkins et al., 2007</xref>). For later stages of heart development echocardiography is used in mice and chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grune et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Damen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>). In small animal research, moreover, due to the small size of developing hearts, functional imaging techniques are frequently complemented with micro-CT or histology to more accurately phenotype the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butcher et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gregg and Butcher, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The structural (morphological or ‘geometrical’) characteristics of heart malformations, including changes in cardiac wall architecture, have been extensively studied. However, the mechanisms that lead to an anomalous cardiac architecture in CHD and the clinical consequences of it are unknown. Recent studies have revealed an abnormal orientation of myocardial cells (the heart muscle cells) within CHD hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Canadilla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stephenson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Canadilla et al., 2018</xref>). Myocardial cells are elongated, cylindrical-like cells, that contract along their long axis. In a normal heart, myocardial cells arrange in sheet-like layers with their long axes in parallel to each other, forming a helical pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Omann et al., 2019</xref>). This highly organized pattern ensures that cardiac contraction occurs along specific directions, so that the heart can effectively eject blood into the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Perturbations of the normal myocardial architecture affect cardiac contractility and compliance. This is both because the tissue can no longer contract on the very specific directions and patterns that optimize cardiac function, but also because cardiac contraction force may be diminished. Therefore, changes in myocardial architecture (with respect to normal) frequently lead to heart tissues with impaired contractility and reduced compliance. Newly developed contrast episcopic microscopy and synchro micro-CT imaging techniques, enable non-destructive analyses of banked human fetal and neonatal hearts with CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stephenson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Canadilla et al., 2018</xref>). These emergent studies are revealing myocardial disarray in CHD (with respect to their normal counterparts) that very likely affect cardiac function before and after surgical repair. In addition to changes in the myocardial organization, the subcellular contraction machinery of myocardial cells (e.g. the myofibrils that contract the cell; and the mitochondria that provide energy for contraction) may also be compromised in CHD, affecting heart function. For instance, a reduced number of myofibrils per myocardial cell will reduce the contractile force that the cell can generate, leading to cardiac dysfunction. The extent to which the cells of malformed hearts exhibit deficiencies is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garcia-Canadilla et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garcia-Canadilla et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez-Quintana et al., 1999</xref>). This is in part due to limitations of existing technologies that have not achieved precise multiscale mapping to decipher the association between structural and cellular deficiencies in the heart and beyond.</p><p>We describe here a proof-of-concept correlative multiscale procedure that combines imaging of whole heart morphology and its subcellular organization (ultrastructural organelle architecture). Our multiscale procedure uses micro computed tomography (micro-CT) imaging to capture heart morphology at micrometer resolution, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to capture cardiac tissue ultrastructure at nanometer resolution. Current SEM technologies allow for three-dimensional (3D) imaging, enabling reconstruction and quantification of ultrastructural features within a tissue volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rennie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Midgett et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>). Among 3D SEM methods, we have selected serial block-face SEM (SBF-SEM) for ultrastructural imaging, as it allows 3D imaging of relatively large volumes (sample size 40 × 60×40 µm<sup>3</sup>). The methodology we present herein improves upon previous protocols by achieving uniform staining of a relatively large heart sample (4-5 mm wide), circumventing micro-CT X-ray penetration issues, and allowing sample screening and selection prior to full SEM sample preparation. Our multiscale imaging, further, enables mapping of structural and ultrastructural heart features.</p><p>As proof of concept, we applied our developed multiscale imaging procedure to two embryonic chick hearts. These hearts were collected at stages corresponding to about 5–6 months of human fetal development, when the heart is already formed but maturing in preparation for birth/hatching. We imaged: (1) a control heart with no structural defects and (2) a heart with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), a combination of structural heart malformations found in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailliard and Anderson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wiputra et al., 2018</xref>). Our results show the morphology and ultrastructure of these two hearts, and emphasize the need for a multiscale approach to deepen our understanding of CHD and enable the development of effective strategies to combat heart failure in CHD.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overview of multiscale imaging procedure</title><p>To achieve multiscale imaging, we followed a four-step protocol (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; details in Materials and methods).

We selected: (1) a normal heart and (2) a heart exhibiting TOF malformation. In a normal heart, blood in the left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) is separated by an interventricular septum; the pulmonary valve and pulmonary artery connect to the RV, which pumps blood to the lungs; and the aortic valve and aorta connect to the LV, which pumps blood to the body. TOF is characterized by a combination of four defects: (i) ventricular septal defect, which is a hole in the interventricular septum; (ii) overriding aorta, a change in the position of the aorta such that it sits in the middle of the two ventricles, on top of the ventricular septal defect; (iii) pulmonary stenosis or atresia, a narrowing or closure of the pulmonary artery or pulmonary valve; and (iv) RV hypertrophy, a thickening and enlargement of the RV wall.

Anomalous microstructural and ultrastructural architectures can be detrimental to the heart’s capacity to adapt to new conditions imposed by corrective surgeries or other therapies intended to repair structural congenital heart defects. Thus, it is to our advantage to understand the organization of the heart at multiple scales, and how it is disrupted in CHD, to advance treatment planning.</p><p>The heart walls contain myocardial cells, which are elongated, cylindrical-like muscle cells that are aligned in patterns that optimize cardiac contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischman, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brook et al., 1983</xref>). In humans, myocardial cells are about 50–150 μm long and 10–20 μm thick (diameter), and in the heart are connected to each other forming a 3D network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert et al., 2007</xref>). More specifically, myocardial cells are organized in laminar sheets that exhibit characteristic cell orientations (elliptical and transmural angles), which change over the heart wall thickness and the cardiac cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonnenblick et al., 1967</xref>). At the ultrastructural level, myocardial cells contain contractile units, the myofibrils, which are supplied with energy (ATP) by the mitochondria surrounding them. In a healthy, mature heart, myocardial nuclei have an ellipsoidal shape aligned with the cell long axis; myofibrils are meticulously aligned and organized along the myocardial cells; and mitochondria are densely packed around the myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brook et al., 1983</xref>). Other cell components (such as lipid droplets and glycosomes) are organized around the cell myofibrils, mitochondria and nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pinali and Kitmitto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pinali et al., 2013</xref>). While this organization may vary significantly from individual to individual, even in normal hearts, it ensures proper cardiac function. Multiscale studies of the heart, spanning whole organ to ultrastructural details, can reveal subtle deficiencies in CHD heart tissues, and relationships between abnormalities across spatial scales.</p><p>The correlative, multiscale imaging approach presented here was implemented and optimized in a chicken embryo model of heart development and CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>). Heart dimensions ranged from approximately 4–5 mm wide, 5-6 mm long, and 250–700 μm wall thickness. We acquired images of the whole embryonic heart using 3D micro-CT, and of cardiac ultrastructure using 3D SBF-SEM. Our multiscale imaging procedure achieved high-resolution images exhibiting both microstructural and ultrastructural preservation, while protocol completion was achieved in about 4 days, which is comparable to completion timings for much smaller samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genoud et al., 2018</xref>). Our multiscale imaging methodology could enable studies of yet unknown tissue deficiencies in CHD.</p><p>The correlative multiscale imaging approach presented here could provide new insights into the underpinnings of heart development, and on cardiac mechanical changes in CHD. For example, analysis of multiscale cardiac images over developmental stages could be used to unravel how cardiac tissues progressively assemble and mature at diverse scales to form a functional heart. When cardiac development is perturbed (due to altered blood flow, hyperglycemia, hypoxia or any teratogen substance or changes in the environment) multiscale images can be used to reveal how the natural maturation and assembly of cardiac components (cells, extracellular matrix, organelles) are altered, sometimes in irreversible ways that lead to CHD. Multiscale images, furthermore, promise to reveal differences and similarities among CHD hearts with different phenotypes, as well as among hearts with similar phenotypes resulting from diverse insults. Moreover, the combination of morphological and ultrastructural cardiac imaging data can predict the mechanical function of the heart. Indeed myocardial disarray or marked reductions in myofibrils, for example, will decrease the contraction efficiency (and force) of cardiac tissues. In turn, decrease contractility affects cardiac efficiency, including compromised ejection fraction and stroke volume.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Our protocol in relation to previous works</title><p>Researchers have used EM techniques, including SEM, for decades to visualize the organization of organelles within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malick and Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karnovsky, 1965</xref>).

Because the ultrastructural features analyzed are at the nanometer scale, samples used for EM are typically very small (&lt;1 mm<sup>3</sup>), which facilitates proper sample preparation. In preparing samples, portions of the heart are typically excised, carefully prepared for imaging (fixed and stained) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rennie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee, 2016</xref>), and then imaged with an EM modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rennie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pinali and Kitmitto, 2014</xref>). Using this procedure, however, finding the ultrastructure associated with a specific microscopic feature or malformation site can be daunting. Moreover, in micro-dissecting tissue samples, the myocardial organization within the heart may be lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert et al., 2007</xref>). Our methodology enables correlative microscopy in a way that allows precise identification and mapping of portions of the heart to their ultrastructure.</p><p>Whole animals and organs have been scanned with computed tomography (CT), a 3D X-ray imaging modality, to determine the internal and external structure of organs, including the heart. For small animal models, micro-CT, a high-resolution CT, is typically employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butcher et al., 2007</xref>). To enhance contrast and thus resolution, prior to micro-CT imaging excised tissue samples are stained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>). Preparing samples for micro-CT imaging requires good and uniform penetration of the stain, intended to preserve and contrast the tissue microstructure (e.g. heart morphology, heart chambers and valves). Micro-CT can then reveal subtle and overt malformations in the heart and its microstructure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>). For example, using micro-CT cardiac images it is possible to visualize ventricular septal defects or translocations of the great arteries, but also wall and septum thickness, and differentiate trabecular from compact myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><p>The discrepancy in the scale at which we acquire micro-CT and SBF-SEM images introduces fundamental differences in the requirements for sample preparation. Due to diverse fixation and staining protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hopkins et al., 2015</xref>), tissues prepared for micro-CT or other microstructural imaging (e.g. histology) cannot typically be simultaneously processed for SBF-SEM (and other EM modalities), thereby restricting the ability to analyze both the microstructural and ultrastructural characteristics within the same tissue sample. Our correlative micro-CT/SBF-SEM procedure can reveal the sub-cellular architecture associated with specific pathological or malformed regions of the heart found from micro-CT images.</p><p>Applications combining micro-CT and EM technologies have recently begun to emerge, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karreman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sengle et al., 2013</xref>). However, several challenges remain in applying these methods to correlative, multiscale imaging of a relatively large organ like the heart (even the heart of a small animal). To achieve both EM and micro-CT high-quality imaging of the same sample, existing protocols have capitalized on heavy metal contrast in small tissue samples, which are fully processed prior to EM and micro-CT imaging, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genoud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karreman, 2017</xref>). However, achieving the uniform staining necessary for optimal imaging with both micro-CT and SEM becomes progressively challenging with increasing tissue sample size. This is mainly due to difficulties in achieving uniform and fast fixation (that preserves the ultrastructure), and uniform stain penetration (both for post-fixation purposes and to enhance contrast for SEM and micro-CT imaging). Modifications to the classic ROTO protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malick and Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Willingham and Rutherford, 1984</xref>) for EM tissue preparation have been quite successful in achieving strong and uniform staining of relatively large samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deerinck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tapia et al., 2012</xref>). However, acceptable staining was typically only up to a depth of 200 μm, and more recently 500 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua et al., 2015</xref>) in dense brain tissues. In an attempt to stain whole brains for EM reconstruction of synapses, Mikula et al. developed the brain-wide reduced-osmium staining with pyrogallol-mediated amplification (BROPA) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mikula and Denk, 2015</xref>) for 3D SBF-SEM (no other heavy metals were used). While the protocol is compatible with both micro-CT and 3D SBF-SEM imaging, preparing a whole mouse brain (about 8–10 mm in diameter) using BROPA required 2–3 months. A fast BROPA protocol (fBROPA) was later developed and used to prepare whole brains from zebrafish in about 4 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genoud et al., 2018</xref>). Zebrafish brains, however, are significantly smaller than mouse brains (diameter of 1.1 mm vs 8–10 mm, respectively). For our hearts, we needed to achieve stain penetration of a relatively large sample (4–5 mm wide) and a fast preparation protocol was also desired. We found that preparing the heart for SBF-SEM and stopping the protocol after initial ROTO staining (1 day processing), was compatible with micro-CT and later SBF-SEM full sample processing and imaging. Further, full sample preparation compatible with SBF-SEM required and additional 3 days, making the entire heart processing around 4 days. To our knowledge, this is the first time that correlative micro-CT/SBF-SEM imaging is applied to the heart.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protocol implementation</title><p>Sample preparation for SBF-SEM required strong, immediate fixation to preserve the ultrastructure of the heart tissue. We used a modified Karnovsky’s fixative with equal parts glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde. The paraformaldehyde rapidly penetrated and temporarily stabilized the tissue, and the slower-penetrating glutaraldehyde, a superior cross-linker, more permanently preserved the tissue sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karnovsky, 1965</xref>). An obvious difficulty was to achieve uniform fixation of the whole heart sample. Homogenous fixation was achieved by perfusing fixative into the heart prior to excision and then promptly immersing the heart in fixative after excision, allowing the fixative to simultaneously penetrate the heart through the tissue’s internal and external surfaces. The hearts were then post-fixed with osmium tetroxide, a lipid cross-linker, which fully stabilized membrane structures while enhancing contrast for micro-CT and SBF-SEM imaging. For our heart samples, we could achieve uniform stain penetration using a variation of the ROTO protocol with extended staining timing (about 30% increase; see Materials and methods). The extended timing was sufficient for our hearts, even considering small size variations. We expect, however, that further time increases would apply to larger heart samples (for instance if we image embryos at a more advanced developmental stage, or other species are considered). For the chick embryos studied here, sample preparation after ROTO was adequate for micro-CT imaging of the whole heart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>For 3D SBF-SEM images, heart samples were further stained with a combination of heavy metals. This is because SEM images are acquired via the detection of secondary and backscattered electrons that are emitted as the tissue is scanned with a high energy beam of primary electrons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cazaux, 2012</xref>). Soft biological tissues, like the heart muscle, yield few backscattered electrons and need to be stained with heavy metals, which readily produce secondary and backscattered electrons. Heavy metal stains interact with specific ultrastructural components, and therefore combinations of stains are frequently used in a single sample. The application of osmium tetroxide, used in ROTO protocols, served as the first application of a heavy metal stain in the SBF-SEM preparation. The osmium tetroxide, which interacts with lipids in membranes and vesicles, both post-fixed and stained tissues. Further staining with uranyl acetate stained lipids and proteins, and lead aspartate stained proteins and glycogens. Together, these heavy metal stains fully preserved and contrasted ultrastructural details, as evidenced by high-resolution SBF-SEM images (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>For whole-heart samples, we found that staining with uranyl acetate and lead aspartate rendered resin-embedded hearts opaque to micro-CT imaging (data not shown). Our multiscale multimodality imaging procedure overcame these difficulties by performing micro-CT imaging after ROTO (see above) but prior to the lead and uranium staining steps, such that correlative 3D micro-CT and 3D SBF-SEM could be implemented. This initial modified ROTO post-fixing and staining provided tissue contrast for micro-CT while also ensuring that the sample was preserved and stabilized before final SBF-SEM sample preparation and imaging (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, ROTO post-fixing enabled screening, storing and selection of hearts before final SBF-SEM processing. This feature of our multiscale approach is advantageous for several reasons. At this early processing point, hearts could be stored for relatively long periods (at least 2 weeks, but potentially months/years) before further processing. This allows researchers to prepare and screen by micro-CT a large number of hearts, and then select only those hearts of interest (e.g. with a specific malformation) for further analysis with SBF-SEM. Not only does this approach permit banking of samples, but it also saves considerable time and resources by avoiding full sample preparation of hearts that are not useful. This is important for our application, in which at most 60% of treated hearts develop structural malformations, and the nature and severity of defects vary among individual hearts. Since we cannot accurately classify malformations until they are scanned with micro-CT, being able to use the micro-CT as both a screening tool and as a navigational tool for later correlative microscopy is invaluable to CHD studies.</p><p>Due to the size of the hearts and slow diffusion (penetration) of heavy metals into the tissue, achieving uniform staining during further SBF-SEM tissue processing was not straightforward. Initial iterations of the procedure (data not shown) resulted in a strong gradient of staining into the heart tissue, a manifestation of poor stain penetration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genoud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mikula and Denk, 2015</xref>). Application of microwave steps to enhance diffusion was not helpful, although perhaps optimizations of those steps could achieve improved results. We found, however, that following a Renovo Neural, Inc protocol (see Materials and methods) after ROTO and before embedding the sample in a resin capsule allowed the samples to achieve homogeneous staining. Uniform stain penetration throughout the heart, was apparent from semithin transverse sectional images of the heart and low-resolution images of ROIs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The uniform contrast and resolution of ultrastructural details provided further evidence of uniform staining and proper tissue fixation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>While the focus of this study was to demonstrate homogeneous staining and fixation, our procedure enables correlative microscopy. One way to achieve accurate localization of ultrastructures within the heart structure, is to register semithin transverse sections to micro-CT images, and then SBF-SEM images to the semithin images (as done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Because sectioning of samples for SBF-SEM imaging is done after micro-CT images are acquired, sectioning is guided by the images of the whole heart, facilitating the selection of regions of interest. Registration can then be performed among the images themselves. This could be done directly, or by adding fiduciary markers in the resin/heart to facilitate image alignment. Our procedure allows imaging of ultrastructure at several regions of interest within the heart, enabling extensive ultrastructural mapping.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparison of control and TOF hearts and limitations of this study</title><p>We explored some possible analysis and quantification strategies enabled by our multiscale imaging procedure. We acknowledge that results from this study are very preliminary: Analysis of more heart samples is needed to reach conclusions applicable to CHD. In the future, combining echocardiography, which can acquire in vivo images of the heart for functional analysis (including blood flow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>), together with 3D micro-CT and SEM, can reveal functional as well as detailed microstructural and ultrastructural characteristics of normal versus CHD hearts. Further, a combination of segmentation, quantification and other refined methods to interrogate images (at the functional, microstructural and ultrastructural levels) will elucidate similarities and differences between normal and malformed hearts, possibly informing therapeutic treatment strategies. To be biologically meaningful, however, these studies need to include more animals. The quantifications and comparisons presented here for one control and one TOF heart (thus n = 1) pertain only to these two hearts, and are presented as an illustration of possible ways of extracting information from the proposed multiscale imaging method.</p><p>Micro-CT images reveal the microstructural characteristics of hearts. Not only could we classify the hearts based on phenotype (normal vs TOF), but cardiac characteristics, such as heart size and wall thickness could be visualized and quantified. For example, it was noted from our analysis that the RV of the TOF heart exhibited a larger volume than that of the CON heart examined here (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). During fetal life, the lungs are not functional, and blood to the lungs is shunted to the systemic circulation through the ductus arteriosus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiserud, 2005</xref>) (a pair of ducti in chick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dzialowski, 2018</xref>]). The RV hypertrophy characteristic of TOF, develops over time after the baby is born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iacobazzi et al., 2016</xref>). RV hypertrophy, therefore, may not be present at the fetal stages of heart development examined in this study and was not observed in our TOF heart. In the future, it would be interesting to determine whether the trait observed in this study is preserved among TOF fetal hearts, and if so under which conditions and how it affects the RV wall ultrastructure (not examined here). To be meaningful, however, such study requires a larger number of heart samples, and is outside of the scope of this paper.</p><p>Another difference between the two hearts was that the ventricles of the TOF heart exhibited less dense tissue and a more extended trabecular architecture compared with the control heart. This is consistent with reduced myocardial compaction in TOF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jenni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weiford et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finsterer et al., 2017</xref>). The heart trabeculae is characterized as a ‘spongy’ or porous tissue that develops inside the heart ventricles, and in our samples was evident from semithin transverse heart sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), but could also be approximately quantified as the extracellular portion of the images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It has been shown that the heart trabecular architecture is sensitive to blood flow conditions during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sedmera et al., 1999</xref>), and thus a disrupted trabecular architecture may be a characteristic of many CHD hearts due to their anomalous flow characteristics during fetal stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wiputra et al., 2018</xref>). However, the trabecular and myocardial architecture can also exhibit variations from heart to heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert et al., 2007</xref>), therefore further analysis with a larger sample size is required before we can make conclusions related to TOF.</p><p>We noticed differences in SBF-SEM image sharpness, which are attributable to excessive ‘charging’ (accumulation of static charge on a sample’s surface) when scanning the TOF heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The increased charging in our TOF heart is linked to its trabeculation, which features larger and more numerous void regions filled with free resin. To address this problem during imaging, we slightly shortened the dwell time when acquiring SBF-SEM images from the TOF sample. In the future, we could embed silver particles in the resin to increase sample conductivity and enhance image quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Genoud et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, the image quality of both the TOF and CON hearts was sufficient to appreciate ultrastructural details (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>While 2D EM images have been invaluable in deciphering ultrastructural features of myocardial cells and tissues, 3D images can unravel more details in the spatial organization of the ultrastructural architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinali et al., 2015</xref>). As an example, segmentation and quantification of the 3D data revealed that myofibril alignment was slightly different between our TOF and control hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This is perhaps because the ROIs from the two hearts are not exactly corresponding, or due to the more extended trabecular architecture of the TOF heart, and warrants further investigation. For myocardial alignment quantification, it is also important to arrest the heart consistently (in diastole as done here, or systole) as myocardial cell orientation changes over the cardiac cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Omann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonnenblick et al., 1967</xref>). 3D SBF-SEM images also revealed a greater proportion of endocardial cells in TOF heart tissues than in control tissues, such that volumetric studies not focusing on myocardial cells show reductions in the myofibril density of the TOF heart (data not shown). When the analysis was focused exclusively on myocardial cells, however, we could not find any differences in the density of myofibrils or mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Outside the scope of this paper, but relevant to the comparison of normal versus CHD hearts, would be an extensive analysis of left and right ventricular wall microstructure and ultrastructure, including the distribution of lipid droplets, glycogen, and mitochondria with respect to the myofibrils. In addition, studies of the ultrastructural organization within myocardial, endocardial, fibroblast and conduction cells, in normal and CHD hearts, would be relevant to decipher the impact of CHD on cell and cardiac function. While outside the scope of this paper, future studies that include more animals should focus on elucidating ultrastructural cardiac differences in animal models of CHD as such differences can inform clinical studies and impact the lives of children and adults with congenital heart defects. Our proposed multiscale imaging methodology could certainly enable such studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Studies enabled by multiscale imaging</title><p>Previous studies have detailed the congenital heart anomalies associated with outflow tract banding (OTB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gessner, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clark et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Midgett et al., 2014</xref> used in this study to induce TOF. Those studies found a spectrum of congenital heart defects after OTB, which originated from abnormalities in the outflow tract (conotruncal defects). These abnormalities included increased separation between the aortic and mitral valve annuli (altered aortic-mitral valve continuity), ventricular septal defects, abnormal position of the aorta, including TOF and double outlet right ventricle (DORV), in which both the aorta and pulmonary trunks emerge from the right ventricle. Meanwhile, neural crest cell ablation also leads to conotruncal anomalies in the chick embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hutson and Kirby, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirby et al., 1983</xref>). Cardiac neural crest cells are required for normal heart development (in the chick and mouse), and ablation of these cells leads to persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), characterized by lack of separation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, but also to TOF and DORV. Likewise, diverse genetic anomalies are also associated with conotruncal heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava and Olson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rugonyi, 2016</xref>). However, the mechanisms by which anomalous genes, neural crest cell ablation, and altered hemodynamics lead to conotruncal defects may differ, and these differences may impact myocardial and myofiber orientation and maturation. Multiscale imaging studies could reveal the impact of diverse interventions on cardiac microstructure and ultrastructure, both when the same or different phenotypes are obtained. This in turn could contribute to our understanding of the underpinnings of CHD and their functional and structural consequences.</p><p>Direct application of the proposed multiscale imaging method to human hearts is limited. The method presented here is destructive, and thus can only be applied to human samples of deceased individuals. Moreover, the larger size of the human heart will lead to difficulties in attaining homogeneous fixation and staining. To circumvent fixation and stain homogeneity issues, increased timing for diffusion of fixative and heavy metal stains is certainly a possibility as is microwave steps (to accelerate diffusion). In addition, changes in processing, such as sectioning of hearts after micro-CT to facilitate diffusion of heavy metal stains and control imaging are also possible. As presented, using our methods, multiscale imaging of human hearts is limited.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our correlative, multiscale imaging procedure allowed us to acquire detailed micro-CT images of an entire embryonic chicken heart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), followed by ultrastructural 3D SBF-SEM images from the same heart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The described approach allows the correlation of microstructural and ultrastructural architecture in selected regions of the heart. This is important when studying CHDs, as each malformation phenotype may be different and therefore may need to be analyzed separately to fully appreciate multiscale effects and to understand how phenotypes affect cardiac architecture at disparate levels. Furthermore, similar phenotypes that result from diverse insults (e.g. hemodynamics, neural crest cell ablation) could also lead to dissimilar cardiac ultrastructure and function. Importantly, multiscale studies can be used to decipher the imprints that early alterations in the environment in which the heart is growing have on cardiac formation and function. Other potential applications to CHD (and beyond) are determinations of extracellular matrix organization/disorganization, cardiac fibrosis, glycogen distribution and myxomatous degeneration of valve tissues in response to different insults and aging. The multiscale imaging approach presented here therefore could enable animal studies to inform how human cardiac anomalies, even when repaired, could subsequently lead to increased cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. For patients with CHD, such studies may further reveal associated pathologies in cardiac tissues that, if not properly treated, may have devastating implications for survival and long term cardiac health.</p><p>While our multiscale imaging approach was implemented and optimized using embryonic chicken hearts, we expect it will be straightforward to adapt it for use in mouse and other small animal models of cardiac malformations. It will be advantageous to use complementary models, as typically genetic insults are studied using mouse models, while environmental perturbations are studied using avian models. Heart dimensions in those species (mouse and chicken) are very similar, and we anticipate that tissue processing will not differ significantly. Slight increases in heart size may just require an increase in protocol staining times. Extending the approach to different species and models of congenital heart disease will likely enable us to understand in detail the similarities and differences between cardiac defects, and the underpinnings of malformations that result from genetic and environmental insults.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Sodium Cacodylate</td><td valign="top">EMS</td><td valign="top">Cat#RT 12300</td><td valign="top">RT 12300 <break/>0.1M; pH 7.4</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Tannic acid</td><td valign="top">EMS</td><td valign="top">Cat#21700</td><td valign="top">0.1% (w/v)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Osmium Tetroxide, OsO<sub>4</sub></td><td valign="top">Ted Pella</td><td valign="top">Cat#18463</td><td valign="top">2% (v/v) final concentration</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Potassium Ferricyanide, K₃[Fe(CN)₆]</td><td valign="top">EMS</td><td valign="top">Cat#20150</td><td valign="top">1.5% (w/v)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Thiocarbohydrazide, TCH</td><td valign="top">Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#223220</td><td valign="top">0.1% (w/v)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Uranyl acetate</td><td valign="top">Ted Pella</td><td valign="top">Cat# 19481</td><td valign="top">1% (w/v) working solution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Lead nitrate</td><td valign="top">EMS</td><td valign="top">Cat#17900</td><td valign="top">Used to prepare Lead Apartate</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Aspartic acid</td><td valign="top">Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Cat#11195</td><td valign="top">Used to prepare Lead Apartate</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Acetone</td><td valign="top">EMS</td><td valign="top">Cat#10015</td><td valign="top">Glass Distilled</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Epoxy resin</td><td valign="top">EMS</td><td valign="top">Cat# RT 14900 Epon 812</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Amira 6.0</td><td valign="top">FEI, now ThermoFisher</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Dragonfly 4.1</td><td valign="top">Object Research Systems</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Our research used chicken embryos.

Therefore, chicken embryos are not considered animals and our research did not require approval. Incubator logs in the lab were monitored daily to ensure there were no eggs near the hatching time of 21 incubation days. Nevertheless, we used the minimum possible number of embryos to achieve our goals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of cardiac defects</title><p>Our multiscale approach was implemented and optimized using fully formed embryonic chicken hearts (heart length ~ 5–6 mm), and applied to a chick animal model of congenital heart disease. Chicken embryos were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Midgett et al., 2017a</xref>). Briefly, fertilized white Leghorn chicken eggs were incubated blunt end up at 38°C and 80% humidity for approximately 3 days (to Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) stage HH18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1992</xref>]). Control and treatment interventions were then performed as described below and the embryos were re-incubated for an additional 9 days (to HH38, when the heart has four chambers and valves). Two embryonic hearts were included in this study: (1) a control, normal heart; and (2) a malformed heart with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). TOF was achieved by performing outflow tract banding (OTB) at HH18, wherein a 10–0 nylon suture was passed under the mid-section of the heart outflow tract and tied in a knot (band tightness 38%). The band was removed from the outflow tract ~ 24 hr after placement (HH24), and then the embryo was allowed to develop to HH38. The control heart was obtained by passing a 10–0 nylon suture under the heart outflow tract without knotting it, and subsequently allowing the embryo to develop to HH38. Embryo hearts were collected at HH38 for multiscale imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Homogenous fixation of whole hearts</title><p>At HH38, embryonic whole hearts were excised and fixed as follows. The chest cavity was opened and the pericardial sac around the heart gently removed with forceps. Each heart was arrested by injecting 500 µL of chick ringer solution containing 60 mM KCl, 0.5 mM verapamil, and 0.5 mM EGTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tobita et al., 2005</xref>) into the left ventricle through the heart’s apex. Hearts were then immediately perfused with ~2 mL of ice-cold (0°C) modified Karnovsky’s fixative (2.5% Glutaraldehyde and 2.5% PFA in PBS (pH 7.4)) through the same injection site. All perfusions were performed with a 21 gauge needle. A transfer pipette was used to quickly apply ~ 1 mL of fixative to the heart’s exterior to ensure uniform fixation of the heart tissue. Next, the heart great vessels were cut with small spring scissors and hearts were placed in 1.5 mL fixative and stored at 4°C until further processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Cardiac processing enabling micro-CT imaging</title><p>In order to enable both whole-heart micro-CT imaging and subsequent SBF-SEM imaging of regions of interest (ROIs), we processed fixed hearts for micro-CT using the initial portion of a Renovo Neural, Inc (Cleveland, USA) protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mukherjee, 2016</xref>) designed for SBF-SEM imaging (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <italic>Step 1</italic>). Each heart was placed in a 5 mL glass scintillation vial and we used 3 mL of solution per vial for each incubation/wash. First, the fixed hearts were washed in 0.1M Sodium Cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 20 min with 4 exchanges of fresh buffer. Next, the hearts were incubated in 0.1% (w/v) of tannic acid in 0.1M Sodium Cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed in 0.1M Sodium Cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 20 min with 4 exchanges of fresh buffer. Since the reducing agents used in subsequent steps (modified ROTO protocol) were light-sensitive, the sample vials were covered in aluminum foil from this point on. The whole hearts were post-fixed in 2% (v/v) Osmium Tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>) and 1.5% (w/v) Potassium Ferricyanide (K₃[Fe(CN)₆]) in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O) for 2 hr at room temperature on a rotating platform. The samples were then extensively washed in dH<sub>2</sub>O for 20 min with four exchanges of fresh dH<sub>2</sub>O. Next, the samples were immersed in 0.1% (w/v) Thiocarbohydrazide (TCH) solution in dH<sub>2</sub>O, placed in an oven, and incubated for 40 min at 60°C. This step was followed by another four exchanges of fresh dH<sub>2</sub>O over 20 min. Samples were then immersed in a 2% (v/v) OsO<sub>4</sub> solution in dH<sub>2</sub>O for 2 hr at room temperature on a rotating platform. Finally, the hearts were washed extensively in dH<sub>2</sub>O over 20 min with four exchanges of fresh water. Each heart was stored in dH<sub>2</sub>O at 4°C until imaged by micro-CT. This preparation provided excellent contrast for micro-CT scans (see Results).</p><p>Micro-CT images of whole hearts were acquired to assess the cardiac structure. We acquired high-resolution (~10 μm) 3D scans of each heart using a Caliper Quantum FX Micro-CT system (Perkin-Elmer, CLS140083) with 10 mm field of view, 140 μA current, 90 kV voltage, and a scan time of 3 min. We used the Amira 6.0 software platform (FEI Company) or Dragonfly 4.1 software (Object Research Systems, Quebec, Canada) to visualize these scans and identify cardiac defects. Hearts were then stored in double distilled water at 4°C until further processing.

In large samples, like the whole hearts described in this manuscript, it is necessary to extend most of the staining steps. Failure to extend the timing of staining resulted in a heterogenous stain distribution throughout the tissue (in our early iterations of the procedure). In our final, optimized procedure, we incubated the samples in 1% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate for 24 hr at 4°C, after which they were washed in dH<sub>2</sub>O for 30 min with 6 exchanges of fresh dH<sub>2</sub>O. We then incubated the samples in lead aspartate for 30 min at 60°C. The samples were then extensively washed in dH<sub>2</sub>O for 20 min with 4 exchanges of dH<sub>2</sub>O. Dehydration steps were done in a series of acetone-dH<sub>2</sub>O mixtures (50, 75, 85, 95, and 100%); each step was repeated twice for 5 min at room temperature. The whole heart sample was then embedded in an epoxy (Epon 812) resin for further manipulation and SBF-SEM sample preparation. The first infiltration step was done for 1 hr at room temperature in a mixture of 1:1 (v/v) acetone:epon followed by a 1:3 (v/v) acetone:epon incubation for 1 hr at room temperature. The hearts were subsequently incubated overnight in pure (100%) epon on a rotating platform. The following day the epoxy solution was exchanged four times, each time with 30 min incubation steps at room temperature. Samples were polymerized at 60°C for 48 hr in a conventional oven, leading to a whole heart sample embedded in an Epon block.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Selection of regions of interest (ROIs) and SBF-SEM image acquisition</title><p>Using the micro-CT images as reference, the Epon-embedded heart blocks were sectioned to reach a selected short axis (transverse) section using a diamond-wire jewelry saw. For this study we selected the mid cardiac transverse section, at a plane where the heart is wider (the equatorial plane). After this step, a semithin section (250 nm) was obtained using an ultramicrotome and mounted on a silicon chip previously glow discharged for 1 min at 15 mA (PELCO easyGlow, Ted Pella). Semithin section images were used to confirm the area of interest as well as to check for both the ultrastructural quality of the sample and the success of the staining procedure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <italic>Step 2</italic>). This step is crucial since the SBF-SEM imaging requires samples with extremely good contrast. Semithin sections were imaged on a Teneo Volume Scope in low vacuum mode using a VS-DBS backscattered electron detector and the MAPS software (FEI Company). Imaging conditions used were 2.5 kV and 0.2 mA, dwell 3–5 µs. In some cases, the samples imaged using this method needed to be coated with a thin (5–8 nm) layer of carbon to minimize charging artifacts induced by the electron beam.</p><p>The same diamond-wire jewelry saw was then utilized to generate a slab (~1.5 mm) from the sample (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <italic>Step 3</italic>). The slabs were sectioned into smaller ROIs, which were subsequently mounted on Microtome stub SEM pins (Agar Scientific 61092450) using H20E Epo-Tek silver epoxy (Ted Pella 16014) and cured overnight at 60°C in a conventional oven. The resulting small blocks were then trimmed using a Trim90 diamond knife (Diatome) to generate a pillar of 500 × 500 µm<sup>2</sup>. The block was then coated with 20 nm of gold using a Leica ACE 600 unit.</p><p>In the last step of our multiscale imaging procedure, 3D SBF-SEM images of sub-ROIs selected from the mounted sample were acquired (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <italic>Step 4</italic>). 3D image acquisition was done on a Teneo Volume Scope SBF-SEM in low vacuum mode (50 Pa) using a VS-DBS backscattered detector. Images were acquired at a lateral resolution of 10 nm/pixel and image sets included 800–1000 serial sections (with each section thickness measuring 40 nm in the z axis). SBF-SEM data sets were approximately 40 μm × 60 μm×32–40 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Image analysis and segmentation</title><p>All registration, of SBF-SEM data was performed with Amira 6.0 (FEI Company). First, complete image stacks (800–1000 slices) from each ROI and sub-ROIs were automatically aligned to generate a continuous 3D volume. Next, a non-local means filter was applied to every 2D slice in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Due to slight differences in the intrinsic properties of the tissue, sections from the TOF heart appeared slightly lighter compared to the control heart. We adjusted the intensity of the TOF sections during post-processing to match that of the control heart.</p><p>To better appreciate ultrastructural differences between the two hearts, we used Dragonfly 4.1 software to segment and quantify SBF-SEM images. We segmented: cell nuclei, mitochondria, myofibrils and the extracellular space (this later one to allow quantification of relative organelle volume within cells). The segmentation used a combination of tools in Dragonfly, including deep learning algorithms. Briefly, we employed a six-level U-Net deep learning model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ronneberger et al., 2015</xref>) implemented in Dragonfly to perform an initial segmentation of nuclei, mitochondria, and myofibrils within imaged cells. Training sets required for the deep learning model were obtained initially through manual segmentations of a few selected images from the image stacks. The training set was later augmented by applying the segmentation deep learning algorithms to other (selected) images from the set, follow by thorough manual cleaning. For each training session, the model was run for 50 epochs with a patch size of 128 pixels. Dragonfly automatically divides the training sets into training and validation regions, so that training (and further inclusion of training images) continued until the reported accuracy (from validation regions) was &gt; 98% with a loss &lt; 0.06. Images were then segmented with the trained model, and segmentations further refined both using Dragonfly automated tools, such as morphological operations, and manual clean up using painter tools available in Dragonfly. Unlike organelles, the extracellular space was easily recognized by intensity levels, and thus simply segmented based on its intensity, followed by clean up using both automatic and manual tools in Dragonfly.</p><p>For visualization purposes, we segmented a whole dataset from the control heart and an approximately corresponding dataset from the TOF heart (region A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The total volume of the dataset was 40 × 60 × 32 μm<sup>3</sup>. For quantification purposes, we segmented and further curated smaller portions of the data sets from two corresponding regions of the control and the TOF hearts (regions A and B). Quantifications of extracellular space and nuclei were done from 17 evenly spaced images from the 800 image datasets of region A; and 21 evenly spaced images from the 1000 image datasets of region B (thus every 50th image was used for these segmentations). For quantification of mitochondria and myofibrils, we cropped images (n ≥ 10) so that we could focus on smaller regions, allowing us to manually improve the accuracy of segmentations in a more tractable manner and focusing on myocardial regions.</p><p>Quantifications were performed based on segmented images. We quantified, from each image or image portion, the total surface area (S<sub>T</sub>), and the surface area occupied by extracellular space (S<sub>E</sub>), nuclei (S<sub>N</sub>), mitochondria (S<sub>Mit</sub>) and myofibrils (S<sub>Myo</sub>). We then computed the fraction of the total surface area occupied by the extracellular space (S<sub>E</sub>/S<sub>T</sub>); and the fraction of the cell occupied by organelles (nuclei, mitochondria and myofibrils), computed as the ratio of organelle surface (S<sub>i</sub>, with i = N, Mit, Myo) to the cell surface (S<sub>i</sub>/(S<sub>T</sub> - S<sub>E</sub>)). Because quantifications were performed from different portions (n ≥ 10) of the dataset, average and standard deviations were calculated to represent quantifications for the dataset (control or TOF hearts, regions A and B).</p><p>Myofibril orientation (angle) quantifications were also performed. To this end, we used the myofibril segmentations in the transmural image plane (x-y), split them into individual segmentations (each myofibril was separately assessed using the multi-ROI functions in Dragonfly) and quantified the transmural angle of each myofibril, as the angle with respect to the x-direction, θ angle. Because the x-direction was approximately parallel to the wall boundary, θ = 0° represents myofibrils that are oriented parallel to the wall or in circumferential direction, and θ = 90° are myofibrils oriented towards the ventricle lumen in the radial direction. Angular quantifications were plotted as histograms showing frequency (number of myofibrils) versus an angular range. For quantifications in the x-z plane (a plane approximately parallel to the heart wall), we re-sampled the images acquired in the x-y plane, to obtain images in the x-z plane, and then performed the quantifications as before. We quantified the elliptical orientation angle of each myofibril (x-z plane) with respect to the x-direction, Φ angle. Thus Φ = 0°, represents myofibrils that are oriented circumferentially around the ventricle, and θ = 90° are myofibrils oriented longitudinally along the ventricular wall (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Results were plotted as histograms, from which elliptical and transmural angular orientations were further characterized using average and standard deviation data.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work has been funded by a grant from US National Institutes of Health, NIH R01 HL094570 (SR); the OHSU University Shared Resource pilot funding program (SR); the OHSU School of Medicine Faculty Innovation Fund (SR).

The authors have utilized an avian (chick) in vivo model and have satisfactorily demonstrated the applications of their novel imaging system. Micro-CT and SEM techniques have been individually well established and combining both can be challenging due different ensuing image resolutions and problems with fixation and staining. In the avian heart model, this study indicates to have overcome these problems and successfully applied this technique to larger tissues (5-6 mm wide) than the previous studies. This novel method can indeed be a powerful tool in studying the CHD and other disease models. The procedures and steps of optimized staining, fixation and imaging using micro-CT and SBF-SEM are clearly illustrated and described in good detail. There are, however, some minor issues that need to be addressed in the manuscript to improve the clarity and before the study can be published.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>1) Subsection “Cardiac structure analysis from 3D micro-CT images”, while analyzing the micro-CT images of control avian heart vs the TOF avian heart, authors mention that in the TOF heart, 'right' branch of the pulmonary artery was missing compared to control heart. In support of this observation, they refer to a rare human condition 'unilateral absence of pulmonary artery' seen in TOF patients. However, in Figure 3 legend, they mention that the 'left' branch of pulmonary artery was absent in the TOF heart. Was this observation made in the other sample? It is confusing to the reader and needs to be clarified.</p><p>2) Article's main focus in on the multiscale imaging technique and its potential applications. The data presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 are obtained from one control and one TOF avian heart. Although authors address this limitation in the article, one would need to be careful not to conclude much based on the observations comparing CT and TOF hearts although they are in line with previously published findings.</p><p>3) In subsection “Image segmentation and quantification”, authors mention while describing the 3D visualization of SBF-SEM segmentations (Figure 8), that orientation of myocardial cells were 'slightly' different. This needs to be described further as to how exactly the orientation of TOF myocardial cells was different from the control.</p><p>4) Other potential applications of this novel imaging technique in addition to CHDs (extracellular matrix disorganization, fibrosis, myxomatous degeneration of valve tissues etc.) need to be briefly commented on. Any other cardiac ultra-structures that can potentially be studied using this technique must be mentioned briefly.</p><p>5) The novel imaging technique presented here improves on the previous methods by being applicable to larger tissues (up to 5-6mm according to authors). However, this is still smaller tissue size compared to other in vivo models and human heart tissues. Do authors foresee any potential problems in translating this technology to human heart tissues? This needs to be elaborated upon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58138.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The current title suggests that the described methods are applicable to a better understanding of congenital heart disease (CHD).

Our current title “Multiscale imaging of the whole heart and its internal cellular architecture: Application to congenital heart disease” certainly suggests that we have analyzed congenital heart disease extensively, which is not the case. Our intention was to highlight this possibility. We agree to change the title to “Multiscale cardiac imaging spanning the whole heart and its internal cellular architecture in a small animal model” to more accurately reflect the paper scope of presenting the multiscale imaging procedure, with examples supporting its use.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should comment on, aside from the technical accomplishments of the approach, how this data provides new insights into errors in cardiac morphogenesis, altered growth and adaptation, or the changes in mechanical function that occur in CHD.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for making this point. We have added a paragraph explaining this in more detail. Briefly, the imaging method presented will allow us to determine how the heart adapts to hemodynamic conditions (the case presented) but also to other insults (e.g. hyperglycemia, hypoxia), and draw comparisons among different cases and normal hearts. The combination of structural and ultrastructural cardiac imaging data, moreover, can predict mechanical function. Indeed, myocardial disarray or marked reductions in myofibrils, for example, will decrease cardiac efficiency, including compromised ejection fraction and stroke volume.</p><p>We added the following paragraph in the Discussion section of the paper:</p><p>“The presented correlative multiscale imaging approach will provide new insights into the underpinnings of heart development, and on cardiac mechanical changes in CHD. Analysis of multiscale cardiac images over developmental stages, will unravel how cardiac tissues progressively assemble and mature at diverse scales to form a functional heart. When cardiac development is perturbed (due to altered blood flow, hyperglycemia, hypoxia or any teratogen substance or changes in the environment) multiscale images will reveal how the natural maturation and assembly of cardiac components (cells, extracellular matrix) are altered, sometimes in irreversible ways that lead to CHD. Multiscale images, furthermore, promise to reveal possible differences and similarities among CHD hearts with different phenotypes (e.g. TOF vs DORV), as well as among hearts with similar phenotypes but that were the result of diverse insults (e.g. TOF hearts that arise due to altered blood flow vs TOF hearts due to deficiencies in the Hedgehog gene). Moreover, the combination of morphological and ultrastructural cardiac imaging data can predict the mechanical function of the heart. Indeed, myocardial disarray or marked reductions in myofibrils, for example, will decrease the contraction efficiency (and force) of cardiac tissues. In turn, decrease contractility affects cardiac efficiency, including compromised ejection fraction and stroke volume.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should discuss, briefly, how changes in myofiber architecture are related to mechanical function (chamber compliance and contractility,.…) since changes in mechanical loading and function can result in multiscale changes in cardiac architecture.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this insightful suggestion. We agree that this is missing, and we have added to this, explaining how myocardial cell architecture impacts cardiac function. Briefly, myofibers contract along their long axes and align parallel to each other, so that cardiac contraction occurs along specific directions in the heart. The normal helical architecture of myofibers ensures that the heart contracts and twists to effectively eject blood into the pulmonary and systemic circulations. If the myofiber architecture is perturbed, however, cardiac contractility is compromised. This is both because the tissue can no longer contract on a specific direction, and because contraction force may be diminished. Thus, changes in myofiber architecture (with respect to normal) frequently lead to heart tissues with impaired contractility and thus reduced compliance.</p><p>We added the following sentences in the Introduction:</p><p>“This highly organized pattern ensures that cardiac contraction occurs along specific directions, so that the heart can effectively eject blood into the pulmonary and systemic circulations. Perturbations of the normal myocardial architecture affect cardiac contractility and compliance. This is both because the tissue can no longer contract on the very specific directions and patterns that optimize cardiac function, but also because cardiac contraction force may be diminished. Therefore, changes in myocardial architecture (with respect to normal) frequently lead to heart tissues with impaired contractility and reduced compliance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The paper would be strengthened by the analysis of larger number of imaged hearts (normal and abnormal) to better understand the reproducibility of the described methods. This paper uses a single normal and a single abnormal heart, and describes the results from 2 regions of interest from the LV free wall of each specimen. The only significant difference between the 2 specimens was the increase in extracellular space noted in the TOF specimen (Figure 7B). The paper would be strengthened, for example, by the analysis of adjacent ROIs in the same heart to determine reproducibility and by comparison of specimens from both LV and RV specimens.</p></disp-quote><p>We have developed the methods described after several iterations that optimized tissue fixation and preparation for both the microCT and SEM images. Once we found the combination of procedures to achieve the multiscale resolution presented in this paper, we chose two hearts (the normal and abnormal heart specimens). We applied the methods to those two hearts to show that we could successfully reproduce proper fixation and preparation of tissues required for high resolution imaging at diverse scales, even though the hearts were different. In other words, we showed that the method works not only for normal hearts, but also for malformed hearts. Indeed, the methods worked without additional optimizations or tweaks. Adding more hearts to the study will be useful for a Research paper, with the objective of understanding how abnormal hearts differ among themselves and with respect to normal; and how perturbed blood flow conditions or other insults lead to different adaptations and ultrastructure. We therefore respectfully disagree with the reviewer: we do not think we need more samples to show, in a Tools and Resources article, that our method works. Instead, more samples will be required for a full Research paper focused on comparisons of hearts and insights gained by the methods and analyses of images.</p><p>We agree that the paper will be strengthened by analysis of adjacent ROIs from the same hearts, which we have performed. By analyzing SEM images that were 2 microns apart (results presented in Figure 7A – now Figure 8A) we accomplished adjacent ROI analysis and comparison, and further found that differences among these adjacent ROIs were small (not more than 10%), emphasizing the reproducibility of our imaging and segmentation methods. Including the RV as well as the LV would be nice – however, the main objective of the analysis presented was not to do an extensive comparison of these two hearts, but show possible types of analyses, and the kind of insights that can be gained. The fact that the only difference we could find in the LV of these two hearts is increased extracellular space is not important (and not significant), the point we want to emphasize is that our approach enables cardiac multiscale imaging and quantitative analysis. A more extensive study with more hearts (a full Research paper) could then show similarities and differences among hearts at multiple scales, as well as perhaps unique adaptations in diverse regions of the same heart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors highlight the ability to classify phenotype, heart size, and wall thickness with their technique (subsection “Comparison of control and TOF hearts and limitations of this study”), however the paper lacks any discussion of the now readily available and less time-consuming approach of using of high-resolution echocardiography to acquire data on multiple time points from beating avian and mammalian developing hearts. It is important to explain how the multiscale data derived from this approach complements currently available data sets.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing this important point to our attention. We are well aware of the currently available echocardiography imaging (we have published a study that analyzes both normal and malformed hearts using a combination of echocardiography and microCT [Midgett, Thornburg and Rugonyi, 2017]). Using echocardiography we can certainly obtain data on heart function from beating avian and mammalian hearts. Echocardiography data can be further used to quantify heart size and wall thickness, but also blood flow velocities, ejection fractions and other functional cardiac parameters. However, while we can observe functional problems in hearts using echocardiography, we cannot get the ultrastructural details of the hearts. Moreover, it is also difficult to identify, using only echocardiography, subtle malformations in the heart structure (this is the reason we used a combination of echocardiography and microCT in our study, to phenotype hearts more precisely). Our multiscale approach, therefore, can certainly complement echocardiography data: by providing a more detailed phenotyping of the hearts, including structural and ultrastructural characteristics that can explain and eventually predict in vivo function.</p><p>We have now addressed these considerations in the Introduction: “For later stages of heart development ecochardiography is used in mice and chick. In small animal research, moreover, due to the small size of developing hearts, functional imaging techniques are frequently complemented with micro-CT or histology to more accurately phenotype the heart.”</p><p>And in the Discussion section: “…combining echocardiography, which can acquire in vivo images of the heart for functional (including blood flow) analysis, together with 3D micro-CT and SEM, can reveal functional as well as detailed microstructural and ultrastructural characteristics of normal versus CHD hearts.”</p><p>–</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is important for the authors to reference the studies that detailed the congenital cardiac anomalies associated with conotruncal banding in the chick embryo which are associated with abnormal neural crest migration, altered aortic-mitral valve continuity, aortic valve override, VSDs, and abnormal conotruncal septation (Gessner, 1966 and Clark et al., 1984). This mechanism for altered conotruncal septation may be very different from the altered neural crest and conotruncal anomalies in the chick embryo produced by neural crest ablation (Hutson and Kirby, 2003) which may impact the changes in myocardial and myofiber orientation and maturation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important point for discussion and consideration. Thanks for highlighting this point. We have added a short explanation clarifying that conotruncal heart defects, similar to the ones obtained after hemodynamic interventions, can also result from neural crest ablation, adding the references mentioned by the reviewer. Our multiscale imaging method could then be useful to determine possible changes in ultrastructure and adaptation in a seemingly similar cardiac malformation phenotype but due to diverse origins.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph in the Discussion section:</p><p>“Previous studies have detailed the congenital heart anomalies associated with outflow tract banding (OTB) used in this study to induce TOF. Those studies found a spectrum of congenital heart defects after OTB, which originated from abnormalities in the outflow tract (conotruncal defects). These abnormalities included increased separation between the aortic and mitral valve annuli (altered aortic-mitral valve continuity), ventricular septal defects, abnormal position of the aorta, including TOF and double outlet right ventricle (DORV), in which both the aorta and pulmonary trunks emerge from the right ventricle. Meanwhile, neural crest cell ablation also leads to conotruncal anomalies in the chick embryo. Cardiac neural crest cells are required for normal heart development (in the chick and mouse), and ablation of these cells leads to persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), characterized by lack of separation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, but also to TOF and DORV. Likewise, diverse genetic anomalies are also associated with conotruncal heart defects. However, the mechanisms by which anomalous genes, neural crest cell ablation, and altered hemodynamics lead to conotruncal defects may differ, and these differences may impact myocardial and myofiber orientation and maturation. Multiscale imaging studies could reveal the impact of diverse interventions on cardiac microstructure and ultrastructure, both when the same or different phenotypes are obtained. This in turn could contribute to our understanding of the underpinnings of CHD and their functional and structural consequences.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The technical details of the current studies are excellent (with the exception of the lack of quantitative data on cellular orientation).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this omission.

We have rewritten this sentence as follows: “The structural (morphological or “geometrical”) characteristics of heart malformations, including changes in cardiac wall architecture, have been extensively studied.

We have edited this sentence, which now states “These emergent studies are revealing myocardial disarray in CHD (with respect to their normal counterparts) that very likely affect cardiac function before and after surgical repair.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should include 1 or 2 references to other imaging approaches, such as OCT and the use of high-resolution echocardiography for cardiovascular phenotyping of CHD in developing avian and mammalian developing hearts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have included references to other methodologies employed for phenotyping. We are aware of these techniques and have used them in our work. OCT is used for earlier stages, when the heart is still small and tubular (before about 4 days of incubation in chick). For the studies presented here, when the heart already has four chambers (day 12 of incubation in chick) OCT, an optical imaging technique, cannot penetrate the tissue, and instead high-resolution echocardiography is used in avian and mammalian developing hearts. In our own studies [Midgett, Thornburg and Rugonyi, 2017], further, for the chick hearts echocardiography was used for phenotyping but was complemented by microCT, from which we could get a more detailed image of the heart morphology.</p><p>We have added a paragraph on the use of OCT and echocardiography techniques in the context of heart development and CHD: “Imaging approaches have been employed to study cardiac function in normal and CHD hearts. 8 In humans, ultrasound-based echocardiography, which can image the in vivo motion of cardiac walls during heart pumping and measure blood flow velocities within the heart, is used to diagnose fetal CHD in utero and assess severity. After the baby is born, echocardiography is useful to monitor cardiac function before and after interventions to repair CHD. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also employed to precisely diagnose malformations and monitor cardiac function in CHD. In heart development animal research, moreover, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and echocardiography are used with avian and mammalian models of CHD. OCT, like ultrasound, is a non-invasive technique that can image heart motion and measure blood flow velocities within the heart. OCT resolution (&lt; 5 µm) is ideal for early avian and mouse embryos during tubular-heart developmental stages. For later stages of heart development ecochardiography is used in mice and chick. In small animal research, moreover, due to the small size of developing hearts, functional imaging techniques are frequently complemented with micro-CT or histology to more accurately phenotype the heart.”</p><p>–</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide an updated pathogenesis that TOF results from abnormal neural crest cell migration and altered aortopulmonary septation which can present with a range of phenotypes including four basic features (i, ii, iii, and iv…) (Hutson and Kirby, 2003).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for bringing this important point out. TOF can certainly result from other mechanisms, including abnormal neural crest cell migration, which is extremely interesting. Originally, we had just focused the presentation and discussion of the paper on the model we were presenting (hemodynamic interventions), but it is fair to also mention other possible causes of TOF. Interestingly, our proposed multiscale imaging method can be used to compare hearts with TOF from perturbations in hemodynamics versus perturbations in neural crest cell migration. We have added in the Discussion section that TOF can result from abnormal neural crest cell migration as well as provide the reference cited by the reviewer.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Previous studies have detailed the congenital heart anomalies associated with outflow tract banding (OTB) used in this study to induce TOF.

However, more quantifications have now been included to illustrate additional data that can be obtained from our presented multiscale imaging approach, while warning the reader that data is for illustration purposes only.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Tests of statistical significance were performed based on multiple measurements of the same samples. These tests are not appropriate for the n=1 sample sizes in the current study.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical tests on multiple measurements from the same samples (different locations) were only included to show whether the two samples were different. We have removed these tests not to confuse readers (statistical tests are typically performed when comparing animal groups), and also because they are not necessary (differences are obvious without the statistical tests).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is difficult to appreciate the benefit of the 3D ultrastructural analysis from the images shown. It is difficult to appreciate the features of interest in Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8. What are the red and green stains showing in Figure 8?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comment. We apologize for not showing more clearly the advantages of 3D SEM from our figures. We have added a Figure (Figure 7) showing the detailed architecture obtained from SEM in a small region, that illustrates the advantages of 3D SEM.</p><p>Regarding the specific figures mentioned by the reviewer. Figure 6 just shows that ultrastructural details can be appreciated on the imaging plane (x-y plane) but also on perpendicular planes (x-z and y-z planes), and that the images acquired (part of the image stack) are well aligned and homogeneous. We have added labels to the figure to make it more clear, and edited its caption. Figure 7 (now Figure 8) simply shows quantifications based on SEM images in A and B, and then a depiction of the 3D extracellular space in C and D for the control and TOF hearts, respectively. We have edited the caption to more accurately reflect this. Figure 8 (now Figure 9) shows a completely segmented 3D SEM volume. Please note that the ‘stains’ are segmentations (painted delineations) of the nuclei (red), mitochondria (blue) and myofibrils (green). These segmentations were obtained semi-automatically using a deep learning (artificial intelligence) strategy. We are very sorry we omitted to mention in the figure caption what the colors represent, and we have now added this explanation to the figure caption. In addition, as mentioned before, we have added a figure (Figure 7) showing detailed segmentations of ultrastructure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The main conclusion related to differences in the control and TOF heart seems to be at there is increased extracellular space related to increased trabeculation. This likely would be easier to appreciate on a lower resolution analysis or ventricular myocardial architecture.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer: increased trabeculation could be better appreciated with other methods. However, we cannot conclude anything of biological significance from n = 1. We apologize for not being clear on this, and we have clarified this in the paper now. The analysis performed on images was not exhaustive, and was only presented as an example of possible quantifications. There are other aspects that were not fully analyzed, like lipid droplet distribution, glycogen distribution, the distribution of the mitochondria with respect to the myofibrils, etc. Our intention on selecting nuclei, mitochondria and myofibrils for segmentation, and to perform an initial quantification of them, was to show possible quantitative outcomes, and merely as an example. More detailed quantifications could be performed – and would indeed be appropriate for a paper analyzing differences between normal or control hearts and CHD hearts, in which also appropriate number of animals, and careful selection of SEM ROIs including both the left and right ventricles, are considered. The fact that for these two hearts there was no difference in myocardial cell volume fraction of nuclei, myofibrils and mitochondria, in their left ventricles was coincidental. Thus, while it seems that the main conclusion from the analysis is that left ventricle trabeculation and the extracellular space is increased in TOF, and that therefore other techniques are more suitable (and cheaper) to analyze these two hearts, this conclusion is misleading, as there is more information from 3D SBF-SEM images that we have not analyzed that cannot be obtained from low resolution images of the ventricular myocardial architecture. Further, this conclusion could pertain exclusively to these two hearts, with other hearts perhaps showing differences.</p><p>We have added the following in the Discussion section: “To be biologically meaningful, however, these studies need to include more animals. The quantifications and comparisons presented here for one control and one TOF heart (thus n=1) pertain only to these two hearts, and are presented as an illustration of possible ways of extracting information from the proposed multiscale imaging method. “</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors emphasize that this method could be applied to analysis of human congenital heart disease. The reported sample preparation and ultrastructural analysis is not feasible at a whole organ level for humans.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. Sorry the text was misleading. The method is not intended for human hearts, it is intended for small animal models of congenital heart disease, which could inform human congenital heart disease. We have now clarified this more emphatically in the manuscript.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Direct application of the proposed multiscale imaging method to human hearts is limited. The method presented here is destructive, and thus can only be applied to human samples of diseased individuals. Moreover, the larger size of the human heart will lead to difficulties in attaining homogeneous fixation and staining. To circumvent fixation and stain homogeneity issues, increased timing for diffusion of fixative and heavy metal stains is certainly a possibility as is microwave steps (to accelerate diffusion). In addition, changes in processing, such as sectioning of hearts after microCT to facilitate diffusion of heavy metal stains and control imaging are also possible. As presented, using our methods, multiscale imaging of human hearts is limited.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) This protocol might be useful for analysis of cardiac malformations in mice. Are there any data to support the use of this method in other animal models?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing this important point. In fact, mice hearts are very similar in size to chicken hearts, and we mentioned in the manuscript that we could apply the same techniques to mice. Unfortunately, while we have some microCT images of fetal mice hearts, and others have acquired 2D EM images of mouse hearts, we have not yet performed a full multiscale image as described in the manuscript on a mouse heart. However, we anticipate that the techniques will translate seamlessly to mice hearts with perhaps only a few (if any) small optimizations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript titled &quot;Multiscale imaging of the whole heart and its internal cellular architecture: Application to congenital heart disease&quot; by Rykiel et al., presents a multiscale and correlative imaging system that combines the 3D-micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy techniques to simultaneously assess micro and ultrastructure of whole heart tissues. The authors have utilized an avian (chick) in vivo model and have satisfactorily demonstrated the applications of their novel imaging system. Micro-CT and SEM techniques have been individually well established and combining both can be challenging due different ensuing image resolutions and problems with fixation and staining. In the avian heart model, this study indicates to have overcome these problems and successfully applied this technique to larger tissues (5-6 mm wide) than the previous studies. This novel method can indeed be a powerful tool in studying the CHD and other disease models. The procedures and steps of optimized staining, fixation and imaging using micro-CT and SBF-SEM are clearly illustrated and described in good detail. There are, however, some minor issues that need to be addressed in the manuscript to improve the clarity and before the study can be published.</p></disp-quote><p>We greatly appreciate your positive view of our work, and we would like to thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript. We have addressed issues in the manuscript as detailed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Cardiac structure analysis from 3D micro-CT images”, while analyzing the micro-CT images of control avian heart vs the TOF avian heart, authors mention that in the TOF heart, 'right' branch of the pulmonary artery was missing compared to control heart. In support of this observation, they refer to a rare human condition 'unilateral absence of pulmonary artery' seen in TOF patients. However, in Figure 3 legend, they mention that the 'left' branch of pulmonary artery was absent in the TOF heart. Was this observation made in other samples? It is confusing to the reader and needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the typo. Observations were made from the same heart, and the left branch is missing. We have amended this mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Article's main focus in on the multiscale imaging technique and its potential applications. The data presented in Figure 7 and Figure 8 are obtained from one control and one TOF avian heart. Although authors address this limitation in the article, one would need to be careful not to conclude much based on the observations comparing CT and TOF hearts although they are in line with previously published findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this important aspect of our work (Please note that Figure 7 and Figure 8 are now Figure 8 and Figure 9). We completely agree with the reviewer. Indeed, we cannot conclude anything of biological significance from just comparing one control and one TOF heart. We have performed some quantifications and analyses merely to show possibilities, but by no means suggesting we could make conclusions from them. We have now emphasized in the manuscript that the main focus is on the multiscale imaging, and the analysis performed on the imaging is to illustrate possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In subsection “Image segmentation and quantification”, authors mention while describing the 3D visualization of SBF-SEM segmentations (Figure 8), that orientation of myocardial cells were 'slightly' different. This needs to be described further as to how exactly the orientation of TOF myocardial cells was different from the control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. The orientation of myocardial cells can be quantified, and because the ROIs are corresponding, these quantifications can be compared. We tried to do this visually in Figure 8 (now Figure 9) but we agree this is not enough. We have added to the explanation and have now included quantifications of myofibril orientation from both samples. These quantifications are summarized in Figure 10 but also described in the text (Results section and Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Other potential applications of this novel imaging technique in addition to CHDs (extracellular matrix disorganization, fibrosis, myxomatous degeneration of valve tissues etc.) need to be briefly commented on. Any other cardiac ultra-structures that can potentially be studied using this technique must be mentioned briefly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for making this important point, which we have not carefully discussed. Indeed, other applications of our imaging approach are possible, including the analysis of hearts that look normal but were subjected to insults early during development (are they completely normal?). As the reviewer points out, other applications of the multiscale imaging method are studies of extracellular matrix disorganization, fibrosis, and degeneration of valves. Moreover, in addition to studying nuclei, mitochondria and myofibrils (which we have emphasized in this manuscript as an example) we could also study the distribution (and amount) of lipid droplets, glycogen, as well as the ultrastructural organization within myocardial, endothelial, fibroblast and conduction cells.</p><p>We have added these points to the Discussion section.</p><p>“Outside the scope of this paper, but relevant to the comparison of normal versus CHD hearts, would be an extensive analysis of left and right ventricular wall microstructure and ultrastructure, including the distribution of lipid droplets, glycogen, and mitochondria with respect to the myofibrils. In addition, studies of the ultrastructural organization within myocardial, endocardial, fibroblast and conduction cells, in normal and CHD hearts, would be relevant to decipher the impact of CHD on cell and cardiac function.”</p><p>And the following to the Conclusions: “Importantly, multiscale studies can be used to decipher the imprints that early alterations in the environment in which the heart is growing have on cardiac formation and function. In addition, other potential applications to CHD and beyond are determinations of extracellular matrix organization/disorganization, cardiac fibrosis, glycogen distribution and myxomatous degeneration of valve tissues in response to different insults and aging.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The novel imaging technique presented here improves on the previous methods by being applicable to larger tissues (up to 5-6mm according to authors). However, this is still smaller tissue size compared to other in vivo models and human heart tissues. Do authors foresee any potential problems in translating this technology to human heart tissues? This needs to be elaborated upon.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this insightful comment. The method presented here is destructive, and as such (as presented) can only be applied to human samples of deceased individuals. Moreover, the larger size of the human heart will lead to difficulties in attaining homogeneous fixation and staining. To achieve fixation and stain homogeneity, increased timing for diffusion of fixative and heavy metal stains is certainly a possibility as is microwave steps (to accelerate diffusion). In addition, changes in processing, such as sectioning of hearts after microCT to facilitate diffusion of heavy metal stains and control imaging are also an option.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Direct application of the proposed multiscale imaging method to human hearts is limited.
