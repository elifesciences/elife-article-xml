may mediate its toxicity via cell-to-cell transmission. Here, we reconstituted soluble, monomeric α-syn secretion by the expression of DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 5 (DNAJC5) in HEK293T cells. DNAJC5 undergoes palmitoylation and anchors on the membrane. Palmitoylation is essential for DNAJC5-induced α-syn secretion, and the secretion is not limited by substrate size or unfolding. Cytosolic α-syn is actively translocated and sequestered in an endosomal membrane compartment in a DNAJC5-dependent manner. Reduction of α-syn secretion caused by a palmitoylation-deficient mutation in DNAJC5 can be reversed by a membrane-targeting peptide fusion-induced oligomerization of DNAJC5. The secretion of endogenous α-syn mediated by DNAJC5 is also found in a human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, differentiated into neurons in the presence of retinoic acid, and in human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain dopamine neurons. We propose that DNAJC5 forms a palmitoylated oligomer to accommodate and export α-syn.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>alpha-synuclein</kwd><kwd>DNAJC5</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd><kwd>unconventional secretion</kwd><kwd>trafficking</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH Biology and Biotechnology of Cell and Gene Therapy Training Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH training program T32GM139780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez Villegas</surname><given-names>Nancy C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-020370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wade-Martins</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pathway of unconventional secretion for alpha-synuclein, a protein which may spread in the brain as part of the pathology of Parkinson’s disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by the deposit of clumps of protein aggregate, lipid and damaged organelles known as Lewy bodies (LBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dauer and Przedborski, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shahmoradian et al., 2019</xref>).

Grafted neurons in PD patients developed α-syn positive LBs years after surgery, suggesting host-to-graft pathology propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kordower et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2008</xref>). Based on analysis of human pathology, the Braak hypothesis posits that α-syn aggregates can spread in a stereotyped manner from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, causing neuron loss beginning in the brainstem, extending to the midbrain, and finally to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braak et al., 2003</xref>). In more recent work, Braak-like transmission of in vitro generated α-syn fibrils has been recapitulated in mice and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luk et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Less-well understood is the molecular and cellular basis for the transfer of α-syn between cells. Several mechanisms have been proposed for both monomeric and aggregated α-syn export and transfer, including unconventional exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2005</xref>), exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Danzer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Emmanouilidou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Stykel et al., 2021</xref>), and membrane nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abounit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scheiblich et al., 2021</xref>). The extracellular existence of both monomeric and oligomeric α-syn was confirmed in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borghi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">El-Agnaf et al., 2003</xref>). Packaging of different conformational forms of α-syn inside extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been reported but requires further vigorous scrutiny to differentiate membrane vesicles from secreted sedimentable aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brahic et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>DNAJC5, also known as cysteine string protein α (CSPα), is a co-chaperone of HSC70 and has been shown to control the extracellular release of many neurodegenerative disease proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fontaine et al., 2016</xref>). This process of unconventional traffic has been termed misfolding-associated protein secretion (MAPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fontaine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2016</xref>) as opposed to conventional secretion initiated by an amino-terminal signal peptide required for secretory and membrane protein translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang and Schekman, 2013</xref>). DNAJC5 contains three domains—a common N-terminal J-domain conserved among DnaJ proteins, the cysteine-string (CS) central domain which is heavily palmitoylated and anchors the protein to late endosomes, and an overall disordered C-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Deletion of DNAJC5 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mice leads to a neurodegenerative phenotype and premature death, indicating that DNAJC5 plays a neuroprotective role in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zinsmaier, 2010</xref>). Transgenic expression of α-syn appears to rescue the neurodegeneration seen on depletion of DNAJC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chandra et al., 2005</xref>). A previous study also reported that neuron-derived EVs contain DNAJC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deng et al., 2017</xref>). However, the mechanism by which DNAJC5 recognizes and translocates soluble α-syn into a membrane compartment for secretion remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we characterized the mechanism of DNAJC5-induced α-syn secretion in a cell-based secretion assay. Using biochemical characterization and imaging of internalized α-syn in enlarged endosomes as a secretory intermediate, we found previously underappreciated roles of palmitoylation and oligomerization of DNAJC5 in the regulation of α-syn secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstitution of DNAJC5-induced α-syn secretion</title><p>Previous studies have shown that α-syn secretion can be stimulated by overexpressing DNAJC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fontaine et al., 2016</xref>). The CS domain of DNAJC5 plays a role in promoting stable membrane attachment based on its overall hydrophobicity and by enabling post-translational palmitoylation catalyzed by membrane-bound Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) family palmitoyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greaves and Chamberlain, 2006</xref>). Using a common human cell line, HEK293T, we first tested the expression and subcellular localization of DNAJC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further subcellular enrichment of DNAJC5 was characterized using a C-terminal FLAG tag. Coomassie blue staining revealed two bands of low and high mobility on SDS-PAGE in the membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar migration profiles of pamitoylated (P-) and non-palmitoylated (NP-) DNAJC5 have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Greaves et al., 2012</xref>). We also transfected and fractionated DNAJC5 in other common cell lines including MDA-MB-231 and Hela cells. Compared to DNAJC5 in HEK293T cells, DNAJC5 in MDA-MB-231 and Hela cells appeared predominantly to be in a palmitoylated and membrane-associated form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The mobility of P-DNAJC5 in the membrane fraction shifted to that of NP-DNAJC5 after an overnight depalmitoylation reaction with hydroxylamine (HA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, we confirm that membrane anchoring of DNAJC5 requires palmitoylation in our assay.</p><p>We next coexpressed DNAJC5 together with α-syn to examine their secretion over time. At 16 hour (h) after transfection, we detected similar basal-levels secretion of α-syn in both DNAJC5-negative and -positive conditions. Two bands of DNAJC5 corresponding to P-DNAJC5 and NP-DNAJC5 were seen in the lysate, but only the P-DNAJC5 was secreted into the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The stimulation of α-syn secretion by DNAJC5 became obvious at a longer incubation time (36 h), and at this time point NP-DNAJC5 was also enriched in the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The release of α-syn was not caused by cell death as little to undetected levels of cytoplasmic tubulin found in the culture medium fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Cell viability was not affected by transfection of different constructs, as shown by trypan blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition to wild-type (WT) α-syn, secretion of several PD-causing α-syn mutant proteins (A30P, E46K, and A53T) was also induced to differing levels by expression of DNAJC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the stimulated secretion of α-syn produced by the expression of exogenous DNAJC5, we examined the dependence of a basal secretion of α-syn on endogenous DNAJC5.

To exclude the off-target effect of quercetin, we created a DNAJC5 CRISPR knockout (KO) cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3F</xref>).

BaFA1-stimulated α-syn secretion was confirmed in WT HEK293T cells but substantially reduced in DNAJC5 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3H</xref>).

DNAJC5 has been shown to control the release of neurodegenerative disease proteins but the mechanism of action of this protein in unconventional secretion remains elusive. In this study, we reconstituted DNAJC5-regulated α-syn secretion in cultured HEK293T cells, in RA neuronally differentiated human cells and in hiPSC-derived midbrain DA neurons. By combining this assay with medium and cellular fractionation, we demonstrated that membrane-anchoring of DNAJC5 through palmitoylation is crucial for its secretion and the secretion of α-syn as a soluble monomer. In addition, we observed the topological locations of DNAJC5 and α-syn within enlarged endosomes, presumably at an intermediate stage prior to secretion. Furthermore, DNAJC5 was found to form oligomers and the importance of the oligomerzation was highlighted by the use of a lipidated XPACK fusion peptide. Our findings on the role of DNAJC5 extend to differentiated DA neurons of human and mouse origin. Finally, we provide evidence that both palmitoylation and oligomerization are solely dependent on the CS domain, which is required for α-syn secretion. Based on our biochemical assays and imaging observations, we propose that palmitoylated DNAJC5 oligomers function at a step involving membrane translocation of cytosolic α-syn, enabling it to become competent for secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model for palmitoylated DNAJC5 oligomer-mediated α-syn secretion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recruitment of α-syn on the membrane by DNAJC5.

Using the criteria of differential sedimentation and gel filtration chromatography, we conclude that α-syn is secreted in cultures cells as a soluble monomeric species not enclosed within EVs, regardless of mutations modeled on PD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or as expressed in tandem arrays or in gene fusions to tightly folded proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In PD particularly, a recent study reported that upregulation of cellular palmitoylation decreased α-syn cytoplasmic inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ho et al., 2021</xref>). The neuropathology and behavior deficiency of Huntington disease (HD) mice can be reversed by boosting brain palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Virlogeux et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of DNAJC5, L115R, and L116Δ, the two adjacent mutations causing decreased palmitoylation of DNAJC5 monomers, lead to a familial form of NCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benitez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Diez-Ardanuy et al., 2017</xref>). Our results suggested that the secretion of neurodegenerative disease proteins is also dependent on palmitoylation, possibly alleviating the cellular burden of protein aggregate accumulation. Notably, the general inhibition of cellular palmitoylation by 2-BA led to a complete block of α-syn secretion, whereas the specific palmitoylation deficient DNAJC5 mutant L115R only partially decreased α-syn secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

In the time-lapse imaging of internalized α-syn induced by DNAJC5, both DNAJC5 and α-syn moved dynamically inside the compartment, without significant colocalization (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). This observation suggests that the separation of DNAJC5 and α-syn may occur prior to their secretion when the late endosome and plasma membrane fuse.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref> have reported a novel membrane channel, TMED10, for the unconventional secretion of IL-1β. These authors speculate an activation-on-demand oligomerization of TMED10 membrane subunits to form a conducting channel for substrate translocation, a process they refer to as THU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). α-syn was reported to not depend on TMED10 for unconventional secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).

The secretion of α-syn has been shown to be independent of CMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Without a transmembrane domain, membrane-tethered P-DNAJC5 oligomer is unlikely to be a channel for translocation. A recent report identified CD98hc, an AA transporter subunit, to be a DNAJC5 interactor that is required for α-syn secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).

In striking contrast, unfolding and size is not a limiting factor for α-syn secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As a precedent of translocation without unfolding, studies have shown the import of folded proteins into the matrix of peroxisomes and obviously through the nuclear pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim and Hettema, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin and Hoelz, 2019</xref>). DNAJC5 forms a series of extremely stable oligomers, which may provide versatile adaptors to accommodate diverse misfolded or folded substrates with different dimensions. The structure of DNAJC5 oligomers may shed light on the principle of this folding-independent translocation pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

and were confirmed by short tandem repeat (STR) profiling and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were grown at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For secretion assays, the FBS concentration was reduced to 1% for up to 36 hr during which time the growth rate of cells slowed but cells remained viable. For EV preparation and medium fractionation, we grew cells in DMEM supplemented with exosome-depleted FBS. Exosome-depleted FBS was prepared by overnight centrifugation of 30% diluted FBS in DMEM at 100,000×<italic>g</italic>. Transfection of plasmids into cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reconstitution of α-syn secretion in HEK293T cells</title><p>HEK293T cells (cultured in six-well plates) were cultured to 60% confluence and co-transfected with plasmids encoding different constructs of α-syn and DNAJC5. pCMV-GFP was used as a transfection control in all secretion experiments. At 4 hr after transfection, we replaced cell culture medium with DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS containing indicated drugs for treatment. At indicated time points, we collected media fractions which were centrifuged at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min to remove floating cells and cell debris. The media were mixed with methanol/chloroform to precipitate proteins which were collected by centrifugation (10,000×<italic>g</italic> × 10 min) and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer to achieve concentration (20-fold). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100). Both the concentrated media and cell lysate fractions were analyzed by immunoblot.</p><p>To exclude the release of cytoplasmic proteins from cell death, we monitored the viability of cells after transfection with a Countess II Automated Cell Counter (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using trypan blue staining.</p><p>For a nanoluciferase-based assay, media fractions were collected and centrifuged at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that the reviewers agreed that too much additional information would be needed to continue consideration of the present manuscript version. However, we would welcome a new submission that can address the most substantive issues raised by the reviewers as described below. The reviewers also asked me to highlight a concern related to the potential impact of the story in terms of the limitations of over-expression in a single cell line that may not be relevant to synucleinopathies (versus neurons, for instance).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this paper, the precise role of DNAJC5 in unconventional secretion of α-synuclein was studied. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of this process is not only an interesting question in basic research but is also of high relevance with regard to potential biomedical applications in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. The current state of the literature is quite heterogenous with a number of distinct pathways being proposed to play a role in α-synuclein secretion, including a potential role for exosomes and cell-connecting nanotubes, among others.</p><p>Here, the authors aimed at reconstituting α-synuclein secretion in a general human cell line, HEK293T cells. A particular focus was given to DNAJC5, a protein that has previously been demonstrated to play a role in this process. In addition, palmitoylation was already known to mediate membrane attachment of DNAJC5. The authors demonstrate that both palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated DNAJC5 are secreted alongside α-synuclein. However, while palmitoylated DNAJC5 was found associated with some kind of extracellular vesicles, non-palmitoylated DNAJC5 and monomeric α-synuclein were found as soluble proteins in cellular supernatants. The authors further show that palmitoylation of DNAJC5 is required for α-synuclein secretion.</p><p>Using imaging techniques, the authors found DNAJC5 and α-synuclein to be associated with a population of endosomes. Along with cell fractionation and protease-protection experiments, these experiments were interpreted in a way that both proteins are located in the lumen of endosomes. They were further taken as evidence that DNAJC5 mediates translocation of α-synuclein from the cytoplasm into the lumen of endosomes.</p><p>In a further set of experiments, the authors aimed at addressing the folding state of α-synuclein while it is transported into the extracellular space. Using an elegant experimental system, evidence was provided that α-synuclein remains folded during all steps of its transport route.</p><p>Finally, the authors provide evidence for DNAJC5 to oligomerize, a process that is enhanced when the J domain is deleted. They also find that the J domain is not required for α-synuclein secretion.</p><p>As a bottom line the authors suggest that palmitoylated species of DNAJC5 oligomers form or link to other components of a pore in late endosomes through which α-synuclein translocates into their lumen. This potential step of α-synuclein membrane translocation is proposed to be the critical process that targets α-synuclein into the extracellular space.</p><p>In general, I appreciate this study that uses classical methods in biochemistry and cell biology collecting a number of important insights about the unconventional secretory pathway of α-synuclein.</p><p>In the following, I would like to point out a number of questions and suggestions the authors may want to address to improve this manuscript:</p><p>– Why and how do cells secrete non-palmitoylated DNAJC5, a variant that cannot associate with membranes? And why does palmitoylated DNAJC5 end up on extracellular vesicles, a species that is proposed to be inserted as an oligomer into the limiting membrane of late endosomes? When late endosomes fuse with the plasma membrane as suggested by the authors, palmitoylated DNAJC5 should remain in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Based on the mechanism of α-synuclein secretion proposed in this study, both of these phenomena are difficult to incorporate into the concept of the authors.</p><p>– I am not sure whether the imaging experiments shown in Figure 4 and its supplements unequivocally demonstrate a luminal localization of the proteins in question. I also find the protease protection experiments to be limited in their conclusiveness since only a minor fraction of α-synuclein and DNAJC5 appear to be protected. Is there a way to produce further independent evidence for these claims? Finally, the time-lapse video provided as a supplement does not convince me with regard to the suggested role of DNAJC5 promoting membrane translocation of α-synuclein.</p><p>– To me it seems unclear whether the populations of α-synuclein and DNAJC5 found on endosomes are necessarily linked to the unconventional secretory mechanism of α-synuclein. Isn't it also possible that this material is derived from endocytosis of α-synuclein and DNAJC5? In particular with regard to the populations that are potentially in the lumen of these endosomes?</p><p>– The experimental evidence for DNAJC5 oligomers mediating membrane translocation of α-synuclein remains limited. I think this paper could contribute a major advance to the field if the observed oligomers could be characterized in more detail as has been done in other studies in the field. For example, beyond the observation of SDS-resistant oligomers in gels, FCS techniques could be used to precisely determine the oligomeric state of DNAJC5 in a native state. In addition. there are biophysical assays that allow to observe pore formation with purified proteins and artificial membrane vesicles. If there is a pore, its cut-off size could be determined and compared to the dimensions of α-synuclein. The authors indicate in the discussion that DNAJC5 might not be able to form a pore itself and that this process might be coupled to CD98. I think these aspects remain vague, however, insights into these questions would make up a true advance in the field.</p><p>– While the technique used to study the folding state of α-synuclein during its transport into the extracellular space is very elegant, in my opinion a positive control is missing, i.e. an unconventionally secreted protein whose secretion depends on an intermediate state that is unfolded. I think Interleukin 1β could serve as such a control.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Wu et al. investigate the mechanisms through which the co-chaperone DNAJC5 regulates unconventional secretion of α-synuclein. The authors have some interesting findings such as palmitoylation is important for this process, but whether DNAJC5 itself was necessary is unclear. Addressing this ambiguity could lead to meaningful insights and the study could provide a cell biological basis for α-synuclein spread in Parkinson's disease.</p><p>Several additional experiments and quantification of the data presented will greatly enhance the quality of this manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1-NP-DNAJC5 and P-DNAJC5. The palmitoylation status of P-DNAJC5 should be confirmed by treating with hydroxylamine and checking if the protein now runs at NP-DNAJC5.</p><p>Figure 1-Please rule out that expression of the various constructs is not causing cell death.</p><p>Figure 1-S1-Can the authors comment on why DNAJC5 levels in the medium is decreased when PD mutants of α-synuclein are expressed? It would be helpful to quantitate these data to see the impact of PD mutations.</p><p>Figure 1-S2-Quercetin is rather non-specific and toxic. The data would be bolstered if in Figure S2E, the luciferase data is accompanied by western blots for α-synuclein and DNAJC5 (in addition to tubulin).</p><p>Figure 1-S2F-G- The effect of the KD should be quantified. KD of DNJAC5 does not seem to impact α-synuclein secretion. Is the effect on α-synuclein secretion even significant? These data with Figure 3 would argue that DNAJC5 itself is not necessary for secretion of α-synuclein. In this regard, can you substitute DNAJC5 with any heavily palmitoylated protein?</p><p>Figure 1-S2F-G- These data suggest that PATs that palmitoylate DNAJC may be important for secretion of α-synuclein. Also, KD of HIP14 would be instructive.</p><p>Figure 3-the ratio of DNAJC5-NP/P for the various conditions should be quantified.</p><p>Figure 3-The L115R mutant is retained in the Golgi.

There may be an additional role for oligomerization of DNAJC5 in facilitating α-syn secretion, as modifications to the protein which induce oligomerization appear to rescue deficits observed in palmitoyl-deficient mutants. The authors propose that the secretion of α-synuclein proceeds through an intermediate step of localization into late endosomal compartments, which appears to be disrupted in DNAJC5 mutants. Broadly this paper uses a combination of cellular fractionation, immunoblot and immunofluorescence microscopy in HEK 293 cells overexpressing a range of DNAJC5 constructs to dissect the role of this protein in α-synuclein export.</p><p>Advance over previous work:</p><p>The observation that DNAJC5 can mediate extracellular secretion of aSyn was previously described (Fontaine et al., 2016). Similarly, the importance of palmitoylation of DNAJC5 has been extensively studied (for instance Greaves et al. 2006 and 2012). Thus, it is perhaps not altogether surprising that DNAJC5 palmitoylation is important for its facilitatory effect on aSyn secretion.</p><p>Importance:</p><p>The mechanism described in this work appears to mediate the secretion of monomeric, but not aggregated forms (beyond artificially fused tandem repeats of aSyn dimers and tetramers) of synuclein. There is a well-established role for cell-cell transmission of misfolded aSyn oligomers and fibrils in synucleinopathies, which the authors briefly describe in the introduction. However, the role of aSyn monomer secretion in disease (or physiological function) is much less clear. From the context of understanding and treating synucleinopathies, the importance of the findings in this manuscript as currently written are thus somewhat unclear.</p><p>Similarly, it would be important to know how generalizable the effects of palmitoylation are on the secretion of other proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Tau and TDP43, which like aSyn, were previously shown to be dependent on DNAJC5 (Fontaine et al., 2016).</p><p>Finally, in this work the authors primarily use a combination of western blot, differential centrifugation, imaging and the introduction of specific mutations to analyze biochemical features of DNAJC5 that contribute to aSyn secretion. While the methods are appropriate, there are limitations to the experimental design (limited technical and biological replication) and choice of model system (predominantly overexpression in a single cellular model) that limit the interpretation of the data presented.</p><p>1. A limitation of this work is that the findings appear largely to be drawn from overexpression systems in a single cell line. Only in Figure 1 -Supplement 2 do the authors attempt to determine whether the role of DNAJC5 in regulating synuclein export is conserved under endogenous expression levels, however unfortunately these data are not very convincing. The effect of DNAJC5 knockdown in particular does not appear to support a significant role of the endogenous DNAJC5 protein in α-Syn export (although there may be an effect, the experiment is likely underpowered and no statistically significant effect was reported). The data stemming from the use of quercitin are also difficult to interpret as this natural product has been reported to have multiple targets, especially when used at high doses (the authors here have used it in the micro-molar range). Additional demonstration that DNAJC5 plays a role in α-synuclein export under endogenous expression conditions and in more relevant cellular models would greatly aid the argument that the mechanisms the authors have uncovered are part of a physiologically or disease-relevant pathway.</p><p>2. An important limitation of this manuscript is the lack of information regarding replicability of the observations. In many figures only a single western blot showing 1 or 2 replicates are shown. No information is given about whether the replicates that are shown are biological or technical replicates, and no information is given about whether additional experiments were performed (i.e. if these are meant to be representative images or if this represents the sum-total of the data). In figures where quantification has been performed (e.g. Figure 1 supplement 2) error bars are shown with no indication of what they represent (SD versus SEM) or any indication of how many replicates were performed. Similarly, with most immunofluorescence panels only a single image of a single cell is shown, from which the reader is expected to draw conclusions. Showing sufficient replication of the findings (perhaps through quantification performed on the blots and images) would help argue that these data are in fact robust and reproducible. Relatedly, the authors assertion that α-synuclein internalization into endosomes requires a functional DNAJC5 seems to be based largely on visual inspection of a small number of endosomes in single cells. Even among the small number of vesicles shown, it is clear that the amount of α-syn present in vesicles is highly variable, even within a single cell. Therefore, additional (and ideally more quantitative) evidence is required to support the conclusion that endosomal localization requires DNAJC5. In light of these apparent limitations pertaining to both technical and biological replication of some key findings across independent experiments, the data presented are somewhat unconvincing.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>Most immunofluorescence figures are inadequately labelled. It is often unclear which images come from which cell lines. It is also recommended to use a color-blind friendly color scheme for all immunofluorescence images.</p><p>A methods section for Western blots is absent. This should include the antibodies used and at what dilution. In addition, the antibodies used should be denoted in the Figures or Figure legends for all Western blot panels.</p><p>Detailed section-by-section comments:</p><p>Introduction</p><p>– Several statements in the intro that describe previous findings related to aSyn export or the existence of extracellular aSyn would benefit from specification of the specific state of aSyn that is being referenced (i.e. are the authors speaking about monomeric, fibrillar or other forms of aSyn?)</p><p>– Sentence ending on line 65 should have a citation</p><p>– In the sentence ending on line 67 the authors refer to &quot;unconventional traffic&quot; but do not provide enough context for the reader to understand what is meant by &quot;unconventional&quot; (i.e. it might help to define conventional and unconventional)</p><p>– Line 65 – in previous works showing release of aSyn is mediated by DNAJC5, what form of aSyn was studied?</p><p>– Line 71 – please specify under what condition DNAJC5 was found to be neuroprotective.</p><p>– In the paragraph starting on line 42 the authors introduce the concept of pathological aSyn spreading and imply a potential role for extracellular secretion, however they later state that DNAJC5 (a protein the reader is then told is involved in this secretion) plays a neuroprotective role (line 71 and 72). Do the authors consider this to be a discrepancy in if so what might explain it? (perhaps a topic to address in the discussion)</p><p>Results</p><p>– In Figure 1, only secretion of overexpressed aSyn is studied. It might be important to show a role for this pathway in secretion of aSyn at physiological expression levels.</p><p>– Line 121: The effect of siRNA knockdown is marginal, and likely statistically insignificant and does not support the authors statements</p><p>– Line 150: this statement would be better supported if the authors had a positive control showing that aSyn oligomers can co-ip under the specific conditions used in this experiment (for example can oligomers be co-ip'ed from the cell lysate?)</p><p>– Quercitin has been reported to have multiple targets, especially at high doses. Furthermore, the dose of quercitin required to elicit a response in the paper cited by the authors to support the use of this drug is considerably higher than that used by the authors here. Potential off-target effects of the drug should be acknowledged as a limitation.</p><p>– In Figure 3 Supplement 1B the relative amount of aSyn to tubulin in cell lysate is not a clear trend. In this figure quantification of the ratio between aSyn and tubulin would assist in interpretation.</p><p>Figure 3 D and E – this and other panels showing aSyn in media would benefit from the inclusion of a loading control for EVs ◊ this might help clarify whether a global increase in secretion of EVs might contribute to the increase in aSyn and DNAJC5 observed in media.</p><p>– Figure 3 B and C – it appears that although there is a decrease in aSyn secretion following 2-BA treatment, there is no corresponding reduction in cytosolic aSyn. What could explain this discrepancy? Here again, quantifications might assist in uncovering whether small effects are present that are not obvious by visual inspection alone.</p><p>– Figure 4 – It appears here that data is shown only either for L115R mutant or WT when in fact these should both be shown side by side.</p><p>– In Figure 4 the labelling of which images come from which genetic backgrounds is somewhat unclear. For example, Panel A seems to show staining from cells expressing a wild type DNAJC5 whereas panel B seems to show the L115R mutant, however this is not clearly denoted in the figure or figure legend. It would be helpful if the images corresponding to direct comparisons of the same staining from either WT or mutant were shown side by side in the same figure.</p><p>– Figure 4: The conclusion that aSyn internalization into endosomes requires functional DNAJC5 appears to be based only on visual inspection of the 3 representative endosomes shown in panels B and C, which are derived from each from a single cell. In addition, the fractionation experiment is shown only for WT DNAJC5, and not L115R. To reach this conclusion the authors should provide more robust data supporting a difference in endosomal localization of synuclein. This could be achieved by quantifying the aSyn signal in endosomes from a larger number of endosomes, and importantly, from multiple cells derived from distinct biological replicates.</p><p>– Figure 4: Confirming the localization of DNAJC5 and aSyn ultrastructurally, for instance by immuno-EM or CLEM would help further support the authors' interpretation regarding localization and topology.</p><p>– Figure 4 supplementary video is not referred to at all in the text pertaining to Figure 4, only much later in the discussion.</p><p>– Figure 5: It appears that GFP was used as a transfection control in these experiments. In previous Western blot figures no transfection control was indicated. If one was used it should be specified.</p><p>– Line 211 should use Greek character for α</p><p>– Figure 5 Panel E+F The authors indicate that the asterisk marks a non-specific band, however this does not explain why a non-specific band would appear in only the conditions transfected with the thermostable aSyn mutants. Further, when you compare panels E and F, the location of the non-specific band appears to change relative to aSyn. Interpretation of these western blots would be assisted if molecular weight markers were shown alongside the blots.</p><p>– Figure 6: Definition of the abbreviations (PNS, M and C) used in the figure should be provided</p><p>– As stated for previous figures, the presence of aSyn in endosomal compartments could more effectively be shown with quantification across multiple replicates</p><p>– Figure 7D and Line 311. The blot presented does not provide strong justification for the statement that deletion of the J domain does not affect aSyn secretion. It seems like some mutants may in fact stimulate greater aSyn secretion compared to WT, but it is difficult to draw any conclusion from visual inspection of this blot alone.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85837.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this paper, the precise role of DNAJC5 in unconventional secretion of α-synuclein was studied. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of this process is not only an interesting question in basic research but is also of high relevance with regard to potential biomedical applications in the context of neurodegenerative disorders. The current state of the literature is quite heterogenous with a number of distinct pathways being proposed to play a role in α-synuclein secretion, including a potential role for exosomes and cell-connecting nanotubes, among others.</p><p>Here, the authors aimed at reconstituting α-synuclein secretion in a general human cell line, HEK293T cells. A particular focus was given to DNAJC5, a protein that has previously been demonstrated to play a role in this process. In addition, palmitoylation was already known to mediate membrane attachment of DNAJC5. The authors demonstrate that both palmitoylated and non-palmitoylated DNAJC5 are secreted alongside α-synuclein. However, while palmitoylated DNAJC5 was found associated with some kind of extracellular vesicles, non-palmitoylated DNAJC5 and monomeric α-synuclein were found as soluble proteins in cellular supernatants. The authors further show that palmitoylation of DNAJC5 is required for α-synuclein secretion.</p><p>Using imaging techniques, the authors found DNAJC5 and α-synuclein to be associated with a population of endosomes. Along with cell fractionation and protease-protection experiments, these experiments were interpreted in a way that both proteins are located in the lumen of endosomes. They were further taken as evidence that DNAJC5 mediates translocation of α-synuclein from the cytoplasm into the lumen of endosomes.</p><p>In a further set of experiments, the authors aimed at addressing the folding state of α-synuclein while it is transported into the extracellular space. Using an elegant experimental system, evidence was provided that α-synuclein remains folded during all steps of its transport route.</p><p>Finally, the authors provide evidence for DNAJC5 to oligomerize, a process that is enhanced when the J domain is deleted. They also find that the J domain is not required for α-synuclein secretion.</p><p>As a bottom line the authors suggest that palmitoylated species of DNAJC5 oligomers form or link to other components of a pore in late endosomes through which α-synuclein translocates into their lumen. This potential step of α-synuclein membrane translocation is proposed to be the critical process that targets α-synuclein into the extracellular space.</p><p>In general, I appreciate this study that uses classical methods in biochemistry and cell biology collecting a number of important insights about the unconventional secretory pathway of α-synuclein.</p><p>In the following, I would like to point out a number of questions and suggestions the authors may want to address to improve this manuscript:</p><p>– Why and how do cells secrete non-palmitoylated DNAJC5, a variant that cannot associate with membranes? And why does palmitoylated DNAJC5 end up on extracellular vesicles, a species that is proposed to be inserted as an oligomer into the limiting membrane of late endosomes? When late endosomes fuse with the plasma membrane as suggested by the authors, palmitoylated DNAJC5 should remain in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Based on the mechanism of α-synuclein secretion proposed in this study, both of these phenomena are difficult to incorporate into the concept of the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The secretion of DNAJC5 in extracellular vesicles has been reported before. In our new data, we also found that endogenous DNAJC5 in differentiated neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells was packaged into exosomes, demonstrated both by protease protection assay and sucrose gradient flotation (Figure 7 —figure supplement 1). We think the palmitoylated DNAJC5 (P-DNAJC5) is inserted on the cytosolic side of late endosomes, and then is packaged inside the intraluminal vesicles by membrane invagination, like many other exosome markers, e.g. CD63.</p><p>We also were curious about the secretion of non-palmitoylated DNAJC5 (NP-DNAJC5) in HEK293T cells. As the reviewer pointed out, NP- DNAJC5 does not associate with membrane. We noticed that one distinct characteristic of palmitoylation among other protein lipidation is its reversible nature. We have tested if NP-DNAJC5 is generated from depalmitoylation of packaged P-DNAJC5 in late endosomes by knocking out palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 1 (PPT1) in HEK293T cells by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). PPT1 has been reported to catalyze the deplamitoylation of P-DNAJC5 in vitro and its deficiency also causes neurodegenerative disorder. However, we did not observe a decrease of secreted NP-DNAJC5 in PPT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Given several other identified depalmitoylation thioesterases, we think there could be redundant enzymes responsible for the depalmitoylation of DNAJC5. Note we found less NP-DNAJC5 in SH-SY5Y cells (Figure 7A) and expression of a non-reversible XP-DNAJC5 also induced a-syn secretion (Figure 6). Thus we think the P-DNAJC5 is more important for this unconventional secretion pathway and the secretion of NPDNAJC5 may be result from the action of an unknown thioesterase in HEK293T cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85837-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I am not sure whether the imaging experiments shown in Figure 4 and its supplements unequivocally demonstrate a luminal localization of the proteins in question.

I think this paper could contribute a major advance to the field if the observed oligomers could be characterized in more detail as has been done in other studies in the field. For example, beyond the observation of SDS-resistant oligomers in gels, FCS techniques could be used to precisely determine the oligomeric state of DNAJC5 in a native state. In addition. there are biophysical assays that allow to observe pore formation with purified proteins and artificial membrane vesicles. If there is a pore, its cut-off size could be determined and compared to the dimensions of α-synuclein. The authors indicate in the discussion that DNAJC5 might not be able to form a pore itself and that this process might be coupled to CD98. I think these aspects remain vague, however, insights into these questions would make up a true advance in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the insights into the oligomerization of DNAJC5 and identification of other components in the translocation machineries will be the important next step in our research. However, we don’t have access to FCS in the lab and the biophysical analysis of in vitro reconstituted DNAJC5 oligomers is challenging. Our gel filtration results showed that DNAJC5 formed oligomers in a non-denaturing environment (without SDS).

After we consulted with the authors of Interleukin 1b (IL1b) secretion, they raised the concern that 3H bundle may alter the membrane localization of IL1b based on its sequence.

This will be covered in their research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in this work the authors primarily use a combination of western blot, differential centrifugation, imaging and the introduction of specific mutations to analyze biochemical features of DNAJC5 that contribute to aSyn secretion. While the methods are appropriate, there are limitations to the experimental design (limited technical and biological replication) and choice of model system (predominantly overexpression in a single cellular model) that limit the interpretation of the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified our imaging and blots, and recapitulated our findings in several neuronal cell culture lines at endogenous level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. A limitation of this work is that the findings appear largely to be drawn from overexpression systems in a single cell line. Only in Figure 1 -Supplement 2 do the authors attempt to determine whether the role of DNAJC5 in regulating synuclein export is conserved under endogenous expression levels, however unfortunately these data are not very convincing. The effect of DNAJC5 knockdown in particular does not appear to support a significant role of the endogenous DNAJC5 protein in α-Syn export (although there may be an effect, the experiment is likely underpowered and no statistically significant effect was reported). The data stemming from the use of quercitin are also difficult to interpret as this natural product has been reported to have multiple targets, especially when used at high doses (the authors here have used it in the micro-molar range). Additional demonstration that DNAJC5 plays a role in α-synuclein export under endogenous expression conditions and in more relevant cellular models would greatly aid the argument that the mechanisms the authors have uncovered are part of a physiologically or disease-relevant pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We generated a CRISPR/Cas9 DNAJC5 KO HEK293T cells and repeated the experiment. The effect of DNAJC5 is more significant with the treatment of BaFA1. We have updated the supplementary figure with the KO results accordingly.</p><p>We have recapitulated several key data in differentiated neuroblastoma cells, human patient-derived iPSC differentiated dopaminergic neurons and mouse mESC differentiate dopaminergic neurons. Please see our updated Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. An important limitation of this manuscript is the lack of information regarding replicability of the observations. In many figures only a single western blot showing 1 or 2 replicates are shown. No information is given about whether the replicates that are shown are biological or technical replicates, and no information is given about whether additional experiments were performed (i.e. if these are meant to be representative images or if this represents the sum-total of the data). In figures where quantification has been performed (e.g. Figure 1 supplement 2) error bars are shown with no indication of what they represent (SD versus SEM) or any indication of how many replicates were performed. Similarly, with most immunofluorescence panels only a single image of a single cell is shown, from which the reader is expected to draw conclusions. Showing sufficient replication of the findings (perhaps through quantification performed on the blots and images) would help argue that these data are in fact robust and reproducible. Relatedly, the authors assertion that α-synuclein internalization into endosomes requires a functional DNAJC5 seems to be based largely on visual inspection of a small number of endosomes in single cells. Even among the small number of vesicles shown, it is clear that the amount of α-syn present in vesicles is highly variable, even within a single cell. Therefore, additional (and ideally more quantitative) evidence is required to support the conclusion that endosomal localization requires DNAJC5. In light of these apparent limitations pertaining to both technical and biological replication of some key findings across independent experiments, the data presented are somewhat unconvincing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the information when applicable in our figure legends and performed the quantification of endosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>Most immunofluorescence figures are inadequately labelled.

We also showed that the secreted a-syn mediated by DNAJC5 is mainly soluble with no stress conditions.

In addition, the fractionation experiment is shown only for WT DNAJC5, and not L115R. To reach this conclusion the authors should provide more robust data supporting a difference in endosomal localization of synuclein. This could be achieved by quantifying the aSyn signal in endosomes from a larger number of endosomes, and importantly, from multiple cells derived from distinct biological replicates.</p></disp-quote><p>We quantified the ratio of a-syn containing endosomes from multiple cells.
