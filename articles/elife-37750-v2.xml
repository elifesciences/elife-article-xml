Accessing these functions is critical to productive infection, yet successful establishment of replication must also overcome cellular antiviral activity, which for larger DNA viruses includes innate immune responses, epigenetic silencing, the cellular DNA-damage response (DDR), and antiviral activity found associated with PML bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weitzman et al., 2010</xref>). Replication of many DNA viruses takes place in distinct micro-nuclear compartments termed replication centers that are rich in factors viruses must interact with - either positively or negatively - to productively replicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>). It is not fully clear, however, how nuclear-replicating viruses initiate replication centers in order to optimize access to factors and functions they need to either utilize or inactivate.</p><p>Parvoviruses are small non-enveloped icosahedral viruses that are important pathogens in many animal species including humans. Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) is an autonomously replicating parvovirus that is lytic in murine cells and transformed human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotmore and Tattersall, 2014</xref>). The viral genome is approximately 5 kb and possesses inverted terminal repeats at each end that serve as origins of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotmore and Tattersall, 2014</xref>). MVM encodes two non-structural proteins: the larger non-structural phosphoprotein NS1 performs a number of functions required for viral replication, while NS2 plays important, currently undefined, roles during infection of the normal murine host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotmore and Tattersall, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Parvoviruses are the only known viruses of vertebrates that contain single-stranded linear DNA genomes, and thus, they present novel replicative DNA structures to cells during infection. They depend heavily on cellular functions for replication, and unlike the DNA tumor viruses, do not drive quiescent cells into S-phase. However, following S-phase entry, cellular DNA polymerase δ converts the single stranded viral DNA genome into a double stranded molecule that serves as a template for transcription of the viral genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cotmore and Tattersall, 2013</xref>). As MVM infection progresses through S-phase, it induces substantial cellular DNA damage and evokes a robust, ATM-dependent DNA damage response (DDR, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemi et al., 2010</xref>]). Infection is characterized by a pre-mitotic cell cycle arrest that is both p21 and CHK1 independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adeyemi and Pintel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2014</xref>). During this block virus replication proceeds for many hours, and ATM inhibitors reduce ongoing viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Parvoviruses establish replication factories in the nucleus (termed Autonomous Parvovirus-Associated Replication, or APAR, bodies) where active transcription of viral genes and viral replication takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bashir et al., 2001</xref>). Low resolution confocal microscopy originally showed that DDR sensor and response proteins, cell cycle regulators, DNA polymerases and RNA polymerase II accumulate in MVM APAR bodies where they co-localize with replicating viral DNA and NS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bashir et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>). More recently, higher magnification microscopic studies revealed that phosphorylated histone H2A variant γ-H2AX, as well as other DDR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">[Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>] see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, below), seemed to reside adjacent to, rather than within, early APAR bodies. This gave rise to the suggestion that these DDR factors may reside on cellular DNA in the vicinity of viral replication centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>). The induction of cellular DNA damage leads to almost instantaneous recruitment of DDR factors to the break site which coordinate complex signaling cascades that recruit DNA damage sensors, repair mediators and effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hashiguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Polo and Jackson, 2011</xref>). Endogenous sites of damage are also often associated with interference between replication and transcription polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durkin and Glover, 2007</xref>). DNA breaks, therefore, serve as cellular depots of DDR proteins, and factors involved in DNA replication and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hashiguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Polo and Jackson, 2011</xref>). While it is plausible that during infection damaged cellular DNA is relocated to sites of MVM replication, it seemed possible, alternatively, that the virus initially established its replication centers at damaged cellular sites where these DDR, replication, and expression factors were already present.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37750.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The replicating MVM genome associates with cellular sites undergoing DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative confocal images of Mock versus MVM infected murine A9 cells at 16 hpi, probing MVM-NS1 (<italic>red</italic>) and the DDR factors FANCD2 and γ-H2AX, and the irrelevant transcription factor NR5A2 (<italic>green</italic>), quantified in (<bold>B</bold>).

The HPV genome was shown to be tethered to CFSs by the chromatin modifier BRD4, which facilitates subsequent integration into the host genome utilizing the cellular DDR machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Feitelson and Lee, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jang et al., 2014</xref>). These studies utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays of the HPV E2 protein to identify sites of HPV localization to cellular CFSs, which were then validated by 3D-FISH assays of the viral and cellular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jang et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with these findings, crosslinked-ChIP assays have recently demonstrated that FANCD2, required for maintaining fragile site stability and coordinating their replication, also associates with HPV genomes at replication centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Madireddy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spriggs and Laimins, 2017</xref>). However, an unbiased way to map the interaction between the viral and cellular genomes directly has been largely unavailable until recently.</p><p>The development of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technologies has enabled detailed analysis of <italic>cis</italic>-interactions between separated regions of the genome, as well as aspects of chromatin packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>). When combined with high-throughput sequencing, these techniques (termed 4C, 5C, and Hi-C assays) have become valuable tools for studying the details of nuclear configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Denker and de Laat, 2016</xref>). Specifically, 4C and Hi-C assays provide genome-wide interaction data through unbiased deep sequencing. Hi-C assays are designed to provide information on all nuclear interactions whereas 4C assays enable higher resolving power and a deeper interrogation of genomic associations by utilizing inverse PCRs to amplify only the ‘bait’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lajoie et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we report the novel adaptation of high-throughput circular chromosome conformation capture assay (4C) for use in trans which we term V3C (Viral Chromosome Conformation Capture). This assay, which should be generally adaptable, has allowed us to characterize, on a genome-wide scale, the direct association of the linear MVM genome with discreet regions of the cellular genome. These sites, termed Virus Association Domains (VADs), correlated initially with sites of cellular DNA damage that in mock-infected cells also exhibited damage as cells progressed through S-phase. As infection progressed these sites expanded, and additional sites of DNA damage were induced. MVM subsequently associated with the newly induced sites as infection amplified. Sites of association identified biochemically were confirmed microscopically, and in addition, MVM could be targeted specifically to sites of DNA damage artificially engineered into the cellular chromosome. Development of the V3C assay has allowed us to suggest the following model. Soon after nuclear entry MVM homes first to sites of pre-existing endogenous DNA damage to initiate infection at sites that provide cellular factors necessary for its replication. Subsequently, as cellular DNA damage accrues, virus spreads additionally to these sites of damage to amplify infection. The V3C-seq assay should be useful for characterizing the interaction of many DNA viruses that associate with the cellular genome, and provide a useful tool to characterize the molecular events leading to the initiation of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The replicating MVM genome localized adjacent to regions of the cellular genome undergoing a DDR</title><p>As MVM infection progresses through S-phase, it induces cellular DNA damage and evokes a robust, ATM-dependent DNA damage response (DDR) characterized by a pre-mitotic cell cycle arrest that is both p21 and CHK1 independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adeyemi and Pintel, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2014</xref>). During this block, virus replication proceeds for many hours, and ATM inhibitors reduce ongoing viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemi et al., 2010</xref>).

This was in contrast to the irrelevant transcription factor NR5A2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duggavathi et al., 2008</xref>) which exhibited a diffuse localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, confocal super resolution imaging (Airyscan) demonstrated that γ-H2AX seemingly localized to the periphery of APAR bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Super-resolution imaging using the GSD-STORM platform also demonstrated that γ-H2AX, and FANCD2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), localized to the periphery of APAR bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). γ-H2AX characteristically amplifies on damaged DNA as megabase (Mb)-sized platforms, making the possibility of marking the 5 kb MVM genome with phosphorylated histone H2AX less likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogakou et al., 1999</xref>).

(<bold>B</bold>) Associations of the MVM genome with sites on the cellular DNA mapped using V3C-seq assays are presented. Representative examples of murine chromosome 17 (<italic>top</italic>) and chromosome 19 (<italic>bottom</italic>) are shown for three timepoints post-infection: 12 hpi (<italic>red</italic>), 16 hpi (<italic>blue</italic>) and 20 hpi (<italic>green</italic>). The data represents an average of at least 2 independent experiments with y-axis values reflecting the reads per million (rpm) sequence reads averaged over 5 contiguous fragments (as described in Materials and methods). The y-axis scale is from 1 to 6 rpm, whereas the x-axis is 95 Mb for chromosome 17 (top) and 61 Mb for chromosome 19 (bottom). Large genomic regions that associate with MVM, termed Virus Associated Domains (VADs), are shown by red boxes, but this indication is not meant to restrict this nomenclature to regions of this size. (<bold>C</bold>) Genomic regions spanned by V3C-seq peaks greater than 5 total reads were selected, and the common regions between different timepoints were intersected using BEDTools (see Materials and methods). In the Venn diagrams on the left panel, the red set represents genomic regions that were covered by 12 hpi, blue represents 16 hpi and green represents 20 hpi. The regions common to 12 and 16 hpi are shown in purple (top), while 16 and 20 hpi are in yellow (bottom). The percent of genomic regions that are common are depicted in the intersected set. Statistical significance of the overlap was computed using Jaccard analysis on BEDtools (right panels, red crosses) between the top ten thousand V3C-seq peaks at 12, 16 and 20 hpi timepoints, with control comparisons permuted by determining the extent of overlap with a randomly generated peak file containing domains of equivalent V3C-seq peaks (represented by black squares). (<bold>D</bold>) 3C-qPCR was performed on synchronized murine A9 cells infected with MVM with an MOI of 5 for 16 hr, as described in Materials and methods, and then analyzed with the viewpoint on the MVM genome. The association of MVM with a HindIII site in the Chr19 VAD (at position 19qA) was quantified relative to nearest neighbor interactions of contiguous HindIII fragments on the <italic>Ercc3</italic> locus. 3C-qPCR analysis was performed in (<bold>E</bold>), parasynchronized NIH-3T3 cells infected for 12 and 16 hr with MVMp, and (<bold>F</bold>), EL4 cells with MVMi, assayed from the MVM viewpoint.

A typical time-course of MVM infection is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>. Assays utilized a viral viewpoint at a HindIII site at nucleotide 2651 and NlaIII site at 1899 in the MVMp genome, thereby capturing the interaction of the MVMp fragment containing both the viral P4 and P38 promoters upstream of the HindIII site. Clustering algorithms and visualization of interaction sites on the UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kent et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) revealed that by 12 hr post-infection and release (representing approximately 4–6 hr into S-phase) MVM genomes associated with discrete regions on most cellular chromosomes [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kent et al., 2002</xref>)]. These cellular sites served as initial amplification points for MVM, and upon progression to 16 hpi, the virus both expanded at these regions and associated with new sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We term these sites of association Virus Associated Domains, or VADs. The clusters of interacting sites on each chromosome ranged in density and in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), from approximately 1–2 Mb to larger 5–15 Mb-size domains (chromosomes 17 and 19 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). While most chromosomes contained multiple small VADS, many contained 1–3 larger VADs of 5–15 Mb size. Chromosomes 1, 13, 18, X and Y had fewer discernible interaction sites. The larger VADs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> are boxed for comparison purposes but is not meant to restrict the designation of VADs to a particular size.</p><p>Comparison of MVM interaction sites across the entire mouse genome showed that approximately 51% of VADs identified at 12 hpi were retained at 16 hpi, indicating that approximately 84% of VADs identified at 16 hpi were newly generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Approximately 39% of MVM interaction sites detected at 16 hpi were retained at 20 hpi, while only approximately 18% of the interaction sites identified at 20 hpi were newly generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Clustering analysis of MVM interaction sites in multiple replicates over the time-course of infection showed that they were reproducible across replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, MVM interaction sites clustered together at 16 and 20 hpi in a characteristic manner that was distinct from early (12 hpi), and late (24 hpi) infection. These results suggested that interactions of MVM with the cellular chromosome increased as infection progressed. By 24 hpi, MVM interaction with the host chromosome was extensive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This latter observation indicated that MVM interaction with the cellular genome at VADs during early stages of infection was not an artifact of preferential sequencing at the VAD sites, and is consistent with previously published profiling of APAR bodies by microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, at these late times, in the presence of saturating amount of MVM DNA, we observed interactions of the viral genome with sites throughout the mouse genome. This further suggested that VADs identified earlier during infection featured properties that enabled viral recruitment and replication. It is noteworthy, however, that the cellular genome undergoes substantial DNA damage by late stages of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> and as described below), likely precluding detection of some interactions effectively by V3C-seq. In addition, viral packaging would be expected to reduce available viral genomes by approximately 20 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotmore and Tattersall, 2014</xref>), which would also be predicted to contribute to the decreased interaction seen at 20 hpi in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>We chose to validate the V3C assay by confirming the association of MVM with one of these VADs, murine 19qA, using a focused Taqman-based assay, in which the frequency of novel ligation junctions were determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR). MVM association with the VAD at 19qA was readily detectable in our standard protocol using Taqman probes complementary to the MVM genome (forward) and the cellular genomic site (reverse) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This association was substantially diminished, either in the absence of intramolecular ligation, or when cross-links were reversed prior to intramolecular ligation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These experiments defined the lower limit of background levels generated by our V3C assay, and suggested that MVM associations with cellular VADs were specific, and mediated by DNA-DNA and/or DNA-protein intramolecular crosslinks.</p><p>Focused 3C-qPCR in parasynchronized NIH-3T3 fibroblasts infected with MVMp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and EL4 lymphocyte cells infected with the lymphotrophic variant MVMi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) both showed association with a subset of the VADs identified in A9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), which suggested a common mechanism may exist for the establishment of MVM replication sites in these mouse cell lines. Differential rates of MVM replication and cell cycle kinetics in A9 compared to NIH-3T3 and EL4 cells precluded performance of 3C-qPCR assays simultaneously in these systems. Together, we interpret our results as establishing that V3C-seq is a valid means to map the interaction of a lytic linear DNA virus with specific sites on the host cell genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MVM infection induced distinct sites of cellular DNA damage as demonstrated by ChIP-seq for γ-H2AX</title><p>As described above, super-resolution microscopy suggested that MVM replication centers seemingly associated adjacent to genomic sites containing factors involved in replication, expression, and the DDR.

Therefore, as we identified sites of viral interaction with the cellular genome, we looked for association with sites of cellular DNA damage.</p><p>To identify sites of cellular DNA damage, we initially performed chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Landt et al., 2012</xref>]) for γ-H2AX in parasynchronized A9 cells, either mock infected, infected with MVM, or mock infected and treated with hydroxyurea (HU). Results for algorithm-called peaks for chromosomes 17 and 19 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, and for the complete murine genome is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. Mock infected A9 cells (taken 12 hr post release, hpr) showed a significant number of sites of damage, as identified by γ-H2AX, as they passed into S-phase. These were likely ERFs, which accrue damage during replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Whole-genome peak analysis of all γ-H2AX bound regions revealed that approximately 55% of the sites identified in mock infected cells overlapped with those identified at 16 hr post-infection (hpi); approximately 55% of sites identified at 16 hpi were newly generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, peak calling using EPIC and intersection using BEDtools, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>), as described in Materials and methods). By 16 hpi, sites of damage concentrated in distribution, and expanded in number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At this point in infection MVM had begun to induce additional sites of DNA damage, as evident both by ChIP-seq and increased tail moments in Comet assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The majority of γ-H2AX-containing sites at 20 hpi were newly generated, coinciding with only 10% of the sites identified at 16 hpi, indicating the widespread induction of DNA damage by this point of infection. This can be seen more clearly in the magnified view of chromosomes 17 and 19 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>. Interestingly, the γ-H2AX ChIP-seq regions identified at 16 hpi correlated well with γ-H2AX ChIP-seq performed following 12 hr treatment with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and 16 hpi vs HU). Approximately 51% of γ-H2AX peaks detected 16 hpi were shared with those induced after 12 hr treatment with HU, and conversely, approximately 26% of the peaks identified following treatment with HU were shared at 16 hpi. In order to confirm the statistical significance of the intersection analyses, the γ-H2AX peaks at indicated time points were intersected with randomly permuted peaks across the mouse genome and visualized as a Jaccard Plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, far right).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37750.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The MVM genome initiated infection at sites of cellular DNA damage that in mock infected cells also exhibited DNA damage as the cells cycled through S-phase, and as infection progressed, localized to additional sites of induced damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative quantile normalized ChIP-seq plots of γ-H2AX binding to the cellular genome on Chromosome 17 (top) and Chromosome (19).

By the late time point of 20 hpi, approximately 70% of the γ-H2AX sites co-localized with VADs. Visualization of MVM association in the vicinity of γ-H2AX-positive sites using hierarchical clustering further revealed that MVM association with damaged sites increased from 16 hpi to 20 hpi; however, increased incidence of cellular DNA breaks after 20 hpi led to a decrease in the proportion of MVM-associated damaged sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, approximately 25% of the VADs identified at 12 hpi, and approximately 95% of VADs identified at 16 hpi, associated with the γ-H2AX sites identified following 12 hr of treatment with HU.

It is also important to note that VADs also correlated strongly with γ-H2AX ChIP-seq sites identified on cellular chromosomes of non-infected, HU-treated A9 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, red rectangles). This strongly implied, although does not prove, that the γ-H2AX identified associated with MVM during infection resides on cellular DNA. It is striking that sites of damage in uninfected cells, sites of damage induced by virus, and sites of damage induced by treatment of the DNA-damaging agent HU overlap so significantly.</p><p>Cellular sites of DNA damage also often contain BRCA1, which binds DNA and can co-localize with γ-H2AX in DNA double-strand break repair foci, although typically in a more narrow pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow et al., 2013</xref>). As expected, VADs also strongly associated with sites identified by BRCA1 ChIP-seq at 16 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, row 2). Furthermore, VADs also overlapped with BRCA1 and γ-H2AX sites in primary mouse cells induced with replication stress agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and characterized as ERFs, in previously published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barlow et al., 2013</xref>).

We tested this in two ways. First, we used laser micro-irradiation of MVM-infected A9 cells at 18 hpi to induce focused cellular DNA damage, which is evident as a γ-H2AX ‘stripe’ in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Anti-NS1 staining of these cells suggested that MVM distinctly co-localized with irradiation-induced damaged cellular DNA, and in doing so, viral replication centers adapted to the shape of the damaged DNA stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, top two panels), rather than the distinct foci characteristic of APAR bodies (representative example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, bottom panel).

Focused V3C-qPCR assays were performed in A9 cells constitutively expressing LentiCRISPRv2 which were transiently transfected with guide RNAs (nontargeting, labelled as ‘CTRL’ or specific to the 9qE1 site, labelled as ‘TGT’), and infected with MVM at an MOI for 5 for 16 hr.

The V3C-seq/NS1 ChIP-seq experiments described above suggested that NS1 was a useful surrogate for virus replication in our assays; however, we chose to further assess the direct interaction of the MVM genome with sites of artificially induced cellular DNA damage using directed cleavage of the genome by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sanjana et al., 2014</xref>). Guide RNAs were designed that targeted a gene desert in chromosome 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, cytogenetic location at 9qE1). These guides were transfected into A9 fibroblasts stably expressing CRISPR/Cas9. When these cells were then infected with MVM and assayed by focused 3C-qPCR, we detected substantially more amplicons between MVM and the DNA break site in cells transfected with 9qE1 desert-specific guide RNAs, compared to scrambled control guides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Interaction was further confirmed using complementary TaqMan probes that recognize the chromosome 9 CRISPR cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

Small DNA viruses, such as parvoviruses, require multiple cellular factors for the expression and replication of their genomes. It may be that DNA viruses set up replication centers essentially randomly, and factors necessary for replication are recruited to these sites. An alternative model, suggested by the present work, is that incoming DNA viruses can initially locate to cellular sites that maintain factors necessary for virus replication. Sites of cellular DNA damage present such an opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hashiguchi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Polo and Jackson, 2011</xref>). Using a high-throughput conformational capture assay developed here for use in trans, we show that at early times post infection MVM interacted directly with sites of cellular DNA damage that in mock infected cells also exhibited DNA damage upon entry into S-phase. As infection progressed, interaction of the MVM genome, as well as the presence of the viral replication protein NS1, increased at these sites, suggesting they were sites of ongoing viral replication. ChIP-seq analysis for γ-H2AX and BRCA1 demonstrated that DNA damage increased during infection, and MVM subsequently associated also with newly induced sites. This model is supported by our findings that MVM NS1 and the MVM genome could be re-localized to artificially induced sites of cellular DNA damage. These observations support a model consistent with the notion that MVM initially establishes replication at cellular DNA damage sites that provide replication and expression machinery, as well as other DDR factors, and as infection progresses induces additional sites of cellular DNA damage, using these to amplify infection. It should be noted, however, that even at the earliest time points examined, multiple virus genomes have accumulated at sites of replication. Thus, specific localization of input genomes remains circumstantial. Consistent with our overall model, we have previously demonstrated that an ATM inhibitor applied during infection specifically reduced virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adeyemi et al., 2010</xref>). Also, as might be expected, we find that HU pretreatment of permissive rat F111 cells, which have lower levels of endogenous DNA damage as indicated by lower levels of γ-H2AX, resulted in increased MVM replication by 20 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Because VADs correlated strongly with γ-H2AX ChIP-seq sites identified on mock-infected cells as they progressed through S-phase, and on non-infected, HU-treated A9 cells, the predominantly identified γ-H2AX signal associated with MVM during infection very likely resides on cellular DNA. However it remains possible that γ-H2AX and/or other DDR signaling proteins are directly associated with the viral genome during infection. In this regard, while there is a clear potential role in MVM replication for DNA polymerase-δ and gene expression factors potentially present at DNA damage sites, the possible roles of other DDR proteins in parvovirus replication warrants additional study.</p><p>Recently Shah and O’Shea have elegantly demonstrated a bipartite cellular DDR to adenovirus (Ad) infection that initially targets the virus while sparing the cell. The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex first inhibits adenovirus replication without inducing a global response that could interfere with cellular proliferation or viability. As Ad overcomes this block, utilizing the Ad E4Orf6/E1B 55 kDa complex, and replicates to high levels, a global DDR is subsequently induced, and cellular DNA breaks were found to sequester DDR proteins from adenovirus preventing its replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shah and O'Shea, 2015</xref>). While MVM localizes to sites of cellular DNA damage as replication ensues, the model that we propose for parvovirus infection is different. It is consistent with the parvovirus life cycle, which depends upon the induction of a cell cycle arrest, is susceptible to ATM inhibitors, and which continually induces cellular DNA damage during its infection. Additionally, in contrast to adenovirus, MVM is much more dependent on host cell factors for its replication and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cotmore and Tattersall, 2014</xref>), and it does not have an extensive genetic capacity to encode functions that inactivate the cellular DDR as does adenovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Querido et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stracker et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Chromosome conformation assays have been traditionally used to analyze the 3D folding principles of the cellular genome, including the regulation of promoter-enhancer loops and structural folding loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>). However, these assays can also serve as valuable tools to study the interaction between the host genome and invading virus. In the context of virus-infected cells, Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag Sequencing (ChIA-PET) assays have enabled the comprehensive mapping of EBV interaction with the cellular genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). These studies, which combine ChIP-seq with chromosome conformation capture techniques, utilize the proximal interaction of distally located DNA regions bound by shared protein elements. They have demonstrated that Epstein Barr Virus enhancers can regulate the expression of the cellular Myc oncogene in lymphoblastoid cells via long-range promoter-enhancer looping, thereby contributing the EBV-mediated cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>). However, mapping of the virus-host interactome by ChIA-PET experiments can be limited by the necessity of having <italic>a priori</italic> knowledge of the proteins mediating this interaction. The EBV interactome has also been characterized using in-situ Hi-C assays, which generate chromosome conformation maps that provide a snapshot of how every restriction enzyme site associates with every other site throughout the genome. These studies showed that the latent EBV episome associates with gene poor regions, but relocalizes to gene-rich regions of the genome upon reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moquin et al., 2017</xref>). While highly informative, these studies did not have the resolving power of the assays described here for MVM.</p><p>For MVM, a single inverse-PCR viewpoint was sufficient to map its interactome. Moreover, using inverse PCR using primers complementary to the viral genome to generate the sequencing library ensured that the V3C-seq assay detects only MVM-host hybrid junctions. This enabled higher resolving power and a deeper interrogation of genomic associations, allowing the detection of both frequent and infrequent MVM interaction sites. The drawback of V3C-seq, however, is that it does not assay changes in nuclear architecture in response to viral infection, which invariably is altered during parvovirus replication, particularly in late stages.</p><p>Looping interactions have previously been observed at distinct loci in genomic regions proximal to some integrated viral genomes. For example, the integrated Murine Leukemia Virus (MuLV) genome has beRen, BRen, Ben shown to influence the folding properties of its proximally located Myc promoter, which in turn contributes to cellular oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). In other studies, it has been shown in cell line models that the integrated HIV genome associates distally with an uncharacterized chromosomal region to promote reactivation of latent HIV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dieudonné et al., 2009</xref>). Chromosome conformation capture analyses focused on elucidating the topological conformation of the viral genome have also revealed the conformational structure adopted by the gammaherpesvirus Kaposi’s Sarcoma Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV), which forms distinct promoter-enhancer loops mediated by the cellular architectural proteins CTCF and Cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). In this study we have utilized chromosome conformation capture technology for the first time to map the <italic>trans</italic> interaction of a lytic virus with the cellular genome in a non-biased way. However, in addition to assaying the inter-chromosomal interaction cellular sites, long-range interactions of integrated viruses such as MuLV and HIV with distal elements, or TADs, may also be assayed using V3C-seq.</p><p>Inspection of VADs show that regions of MVM interaction vary greatly in size. The size of the peaks correlates with the number of interactions, and so indicate that some regions are more densely populated by virus than others. As can be seen in the whole-genome analysis, there is quite a variation in VADs across different chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). While most chromosomes have multiple VADS, most have only a few larger VADs of 5–15 Mb. Whether the size of the VADs correlates to the success of infection at that site is not known. There are a number of chromosomes [chromosomes 1, 13, 14, 18, X and Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>)] that have few sites of damage, as assessed by γ-H2AX ChIP-seq, as well as few VADs, reinforcing their correlation.</p><p>VADs identified by V3C-seq showed striking overlap with sites of damage in infected cells, at sites of damage incurred in uninfected cells as they progressed into S-phase, but surprisingly, also at sites in uninfected cells treated with HU. This overlap suggested that there may be a predilection in the cellular chromosome for sites sensitive to the induction of damage for which MVM has an affinity. In this vein, we find that most VADs (and by implication sites of endogenous and infection-induced damage and damage induced by HU) also overlap strikingly with Topologically Associated Domains (TADs), determined for murine CH12 B-cells, by Hi-C assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2014</xref>]). Such studies, in combination with high-resolution imaging, have shown that the mammalian genome is folded into megabase-sized cis-interacting regions (TADs). TADs have been divided into two main compartments: A (primarily euchromatin-like), and B (primarily heterochromatin-like) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2014</xref>). The A compartment is characterized by being gene dense, containing highly expressed genes, and active chromatin marks. The A1 subcompartment was seen to finish replicating at the beginning of S-phase, while the A2 subcompartment was described as continuing to replicate into the middle of S-phase. Overlaying published chromatin marks from murine 3T3 cells induced with the DNA damaging agent aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kraushaar et al., 2013</xref>) suggests that MVM associations may be with the A compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This compartment of cellular DNA would provide the necessary machinery for the expression and replication of MVM within S-phase, and would be consistent with MVM initially associating with sites that emerge as ERFs during cellular replication, which would be predicted to replicate in compartment A.</p><p>The VADs identified in our study occupy multiple adjacent TADs. This suggests that several adjacent TADs may contain the necessary environment to support MVM expression and replication. The mechanisms that maintain TAD borders are elusive, but structural proteins such as CTCF and cohesin have been implicated in these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2017</xref>). Indeed, Canela et al., have shown that CTCF and RAD21 form the anchors to cis-interacting cellular loops that are susceptible to topoisomerase TOP2B mediated DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Canela et al., 2017</xref>). The MVM NS1 protein, which also interacts at TADs, is a known DNA binding protein with double-stranded nickase activity; however, the mechanisms by which the viral genome associates with the cellular sites remains to be determined.</p><p>Our results suggest that host chromatin states may play a significant role in permissiveness to DNA damage, and thereby influence MVM localization for replication. Consistent with this model, the HPV E2 protein has been found associated with actively transcribing genes and active chromatin, presumably to facilitate expression of HPV through hijacking the host transcriptional machinery at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jang et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, profiling of sites on the cellular genomic that undergo replication stress have shown that these regions are encased in a protective chromatin environment to facilitate efficient repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). Such regions, either pre-existing prior to infection, or induced by virus, may provide the supportive environment necessary for successful infection. The generally adaptable, high-throughput V3C-seq assay allows genome-wide identification of the direct associations of viral genomes with distinct regions of the cellular chromosome. It should be useful for characterizing the interaction of many DNA viruses that associate with the cellular genome, and thus provide a useful tool to characterize the molecular events leading to the initiation of their infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (0.1% NP40, NaCl, Tris-HCl) and the resulting nuclei were resuspended in restriction enzyme buffer (NEB Buffer 2.1). The nuclei were permeabilized in 0.3% SDS for an hour, followed by sequestration of SDS in 2% Triton X-100. The samples were digested in 400U of Hind III restriction enzyme overnight. Digestion was continued with a further 300U of Hind III on the next day, before inactivating the enzyme with 1% SDS at 65°C. SDS was sequestered with 1% Triton X-100, and 3C chromatin was resuspended in 1.15X T4 DNA Ligase Reaction Buffer. 50U of T4 DNA Ligase was added to the samples.

Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected within the nucleus without traversing the nuclear membrane. Samples were processed for immunofluorescense imaging without CSK pre-extraction immediately after micro-irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>CRISPR-Induced DNA break assays</title><p>Stable A9 cells expressing LentiCRISPRv2 were co-transfected with guide RNAs targeting chromosome 9 at 9qE1 (labelled as TGT), or scrambled control guide RNAs (labelled as CTRL) and human CD4 expressing vector during parasynchronization. CD4-positive cells were purified using an EasySep CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Kit (StemCell) prior to release into complete DMEM media and MVM infection. Infected cells were harvested and processed for ChIP and 3C assays at the indicated timepoints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>3D-FISH assays</title><p>The MVMp genome and indicated cellular regions were labelled with the DNA FISH-Tag Multicolor Kit (ThermoFisher). Briefly, 1 µg of DNA was labelled with aminoallyl-modified dNTP by nick-translation using the manufacturer’s instructions before being labelled with amine-modified Alexa-Fluor dyes (AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 555). The dye combinations were resuspended at equimolar amounts in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 2X SSC, 40% dextran sulfate, 10% Denhardt’s solution) prior to hybridizing to the sample.</p><p>Parasynchronized MVMp-infected A9 cells were harvested at the indicated timepoints by pre-extracting with CSK Buffer (10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM Sodium Chloride, 300 mM Sucrose, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Magnesium Chloride) for 3 min followed by CSK Buffer with 0.5% Triton for 3 min. Cells were crosslinked with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, before being washed with PBS. The nuclei were dehydrated by sequential treatments with 50% ethanol, 70% ethanol and 100% ethanol for 3 min each. Nuclei were subsequently rehydrated with sequential treatment with 70% ethanol, 50% ethanol and PBS for 3 min each. Cells and nuclei were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, before being washed with PBS. The samples were treated with 2 μg of RNAse A (Roche) in PBS for 1 hr at 37°C. Samples were denatured in 50% formamide (Ambion) before being hybridized to the suspended fluorescently labelled probes overnight at 37°C. Samples were washed in 2X SSC with 0.1% Tritox X-100 at 37°C followed by three times for 5 min each, followed by 2 washes in 2X SSC at 37°C for 5 min each. Samples were then mounted on slides and imaged on the indicated microscope.</p><p>For GSD/dSTORM super-resolution imaging, coverslips with adherent immunostained cells were mounted on cavity microscope slides with PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) imaging buffer containing 100 mM beta-mercaptoethylamine, 10% w/v glucose, 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase and 40 µg/ml catalase. GSD super-resolution imaging was performed on a Leica SR GSD 3D microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc.) using a 560 nm (AlexaFluor 555) or a 632 nm (AlexaFluor 647) excitation lasers and a 405 nm back-pumping (activation) laser. A 160 × 1.43 NA oil-immersion objective lens was used for imaging. Two-color GSD images were acquired sequentially with an Andor iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD camera at exposure times 7–8 ms using a QGSD 561 quad filter cube and emission bandpasses 605/45 nm (AlexaFluor 555) and 695/85 nm (AlexaFluor 647). Approximately 8000 images per channel of a 18 × 18 µm field-of-view were acquired. The coordinates of single molecules were localized in all recorded raw images and high-resolution GSD images were constructed using Leica LAS X software (version 1.9).</p><p>For confocal imaging, samples were mounted on slides using Pro-Long Diamond anti-fade media with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal z-stacks were acquired using a Leica TCP SP8 confocal microscope with 488 nm (AlexaFluor 488) and 552 nm (AlexaFluor 555) excitation lasers and a 100 × 1.4 NA objective lens.</p><p>3D-FISH images were analyzed using ImageJ. Background noise was filtered out using the Kalman Stack Filter plugin to determine the coordinates (x,y,z) of the centers of the foci. The coordinates of the viral and cellular foci were measured using Sync Measure 3D. The 3D-distance was calculated by computing the displacement vector between the two locations as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shih and Krangel, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunofluorescense assays</title><p>Parasynchronized MVMp-infected A9 cells were harvested at the indicated time points processed as described above till permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS.

Samples were washed and mounted on slides with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Alkaline comet assay</title><p>Alkaline Comet Assays were performed using Trevigen Comet Assay kits. Murine A9 fibroblasts were grown on 10 centimeter dishes and mock infected, induced with Doxorubicin (200 nM) for 9 hr, or infected with MVMp at an MOI of 10 for 20 hr, before detaching them from the flask by scraping. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and resuspended at a density of 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in ice cold PBS. Cells were combined with molten LM Agarose at 37°C at a ratio of 1:10 and pipetted onto Comet Slides. Slides were placed at 4°C in the dark for 10 mins. Slides were immersed in 4°C Lysis solution for 30–60 min, before placing in Alkaline Unwinding Solution for 1 hr at 4°C in the dark. 850 ml Alkaline Electrophoresis Solution was added to the slide tray, and 21 Volts were applied for 30 min. Slides were immersed in water twice for 5 min each, followed by immersion in 70% ethanol for 5 min. Samples were dried at 37 degrees Celsius for 15 min, and subsequently stained with 100 ul of SYBR Gold for 30 min in the dark. Slides were briefly rinsed in water and completely dried at 37°C.

Furthermore, V3C-seq should be useful for characterizing viral-host interactions for other DNA viruses, making this study a valuable contribution to the virology field.</p><p>• In the Introduction, the authors state that an unbiased way to map sites of viral-host interaction has been largely unavailable until recently. However, in situ Hi-C has previously been used to map interactions between EBV, KSHV and HPV and host chromosomes (Moquin et al., 2018). The authors should emphasize why the V3C-seq method is novel, i.e. in terms of inverse PCR to yield V3C-seq DNA libraries.</p><p>• Figure 1A should include controls of NR5A2 immunostaining and immunostaining of mock-infected A9 cells to show normal levels of FANCD2 and γ-H2AX in these cells, and as a negative control for any non-specific NS1 signal. 1B is very confusing: should the Y axis read &quot;Distance from NS1 APAR bodies?

It is very difficult to see as is. Panel C, please indicate the alternative 6pA allele. Scale bars should be added. The signal for MVM FISH seems surprisingly small for 16 hours p.i. (especially compared to images of NS1 at this time point in Figure 1). There appears to be localized signal for MVM and 6pA at the nuclear border making it difficult to interpret the result. Please include additional representative image(s).</p><p>• Do VADs overlap with common fragile sites, as well as the ERFs? These are often transcriptionally active, encode long genes and are late replicating in the cell cycle.</p><p>• Authors' state in the Discussion: &quot;In this study we have utilized chromosome conformation capture technology for the first time to map the trans interaction of a lytic virus with the cellular genome in a non-biased way&quot;. Again, Moquin et al., 2018, use Hi-C to map EBV to cellular chromosomes during latent and lytic phases of the life cycle. This statement should be addressed accordingly to emphasize the novel aspects of V3C-seq relative to Hi-C for addressing viral-host interactions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this very comprehensive and rather jargon-dense paper, the authors have adapted a chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique previously used for exploring interactions between cis-related DNA sequences in chromatin to a trans configuration, in order to explore the association of intracellular forms of parvoviral DNA with host chromosomal sites undergoing DNA damage response (DDR)-initiated repair.</p><p>The description of the V3C-seq procedure given in Figure 2 and the text is quite clear in principal, and should be useable by others wishing to apply this approach in their own virus:host system. However, the details given for MVM are somewhat confusing. There are 2 HindIII sites in the MVMp genome, of which the inverse primers used target the one at nt 2651. Secondary digestion with NlaIII, which cuts at 33 sites would leave a ~750 bp MVM fragment attached to the associated cellular DNA. This fragment lies between nts 1899 and 2651, and covers the P38 promoter – it is not clear, then, why the authors refer to this as containing the P4-P38 4C inverse primers – what does this mean? How does this fragment relate to the P4 promoter? A clearer Figure 2 explaining this in detail would be helpful.</p><p>The authors present a number of experiments employing different independent methodologies to corroborate their findings with V3C-seq, that intranuclear MVM duplex genomes associate with regions that have sustained DNA damage that may, or may not, be caused by the infection. These are important additional experiments, since they help to rule out the possibility that V3C merely identifies association between MVM and host DNA because cross-linking can only occur at sites of DNA damage, perhaps as a result of local opening up of the chromatin.</p><p>There is one aspect of the discussion ongoing throughout the paper that is of concern, and that is the repeated reference to how the results indicate that incoming MVM genomes are targeted to sites of DNA damage. This important aspect of infection initiation is not addressed by either the techniques used or the timing of the experiments presented. At all the times post-release examined in this paper, there may be hundreds, if not thousands, of duplex MVM genomes present in each APAR body. Each of these molecules presents one or more terminal structure that would almost certainly be detected as a double-strand break by host DDR systems. Additionally, replication proceeds by strand-displacement, yielding hundreds to thousands of nucleotides of single-stranded DNA attached to each replicative intermediate, leading to extensive RPA2-dependent signaling. The presence of these forms of viral DNA in each developing APAR body makes it extremely difficult to ascertain the extent to which the DDR signals emanating from them are due to damage to cellular DNA. This aspect of the overall DDR observed in infected cell nuclei is not discussed.</p><p>Finally, one hopes that the software used to analyze the data generated in this paper works better than that used to generate the bibliography, which is a mess!</p><p>&quot;initial interaction points&quot; – the results presented do not address where input MVM genomes initially localize (see general comments).</p><p>Subsection “The MVM genome associated directly with discrete sites on the cellular genome”, third paragraph: while inhibition of packaging allows further accumulation of viral RF DNA molecules, packaging itself would not reduce the abundance of viral RF DNA, since the single strands destined for packaging are generated from existing RF molecules by strand-displacement synthesis.</p><p>&quot;which covalently binds to the viral genome&quot; is a confusing statement. As a consequence of replication there is one NS1 molecule covalently bound to the 5' end of each viral DNA strand, whereas there are multiple sites throughout the viral genome to which NS1 can bind non-covalently, an observation that may be highly relevant to the identity and functionality of APAR bodies.</p><p>&quot;MVM first localized&quot; – see concern in the second paragraph of the subsection “The MVM genome associated directly with discrete sites on the cellular genome”.</p><p>&quot;supported by the present work&quot; is an over reach – the current paper does not address where the incoming genomes locate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37750.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I have a few points that could improve the manuscript.</p><p>1) The VADs are fairly large as defined, ranging from 5-15 megabases.

We have also provided representative images of the MVM genome (red) with both 19qA VAD (green) and 9pA non-VAD (cyan) in the same nucleus (Figure 5D). These representative images further support our findings of MVM interaction sites at 16hpi using V3C-seq. The observation of the MVM signal in super-resolution microscopy at the nuclear border was likely due to the presence of incoming viral genomes. These observations are being investigated further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Do VADs overlap with common fragile sites, as well as the ERFs?

Focused V3C-qPCR assays have determined that MVM associates with a subset of CFSs on the human genome in NB-324K cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). We have not yet determined the transcriptional and replication status of these sites during MVM infection. However, this is an interesting question and such work will be pursued in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Authors' state in the Discussion: &quot;In this study we have utilized chromosome conformation capture technology for the first time to map the trans interaction of a lytic virus with the cellular genome in a non-biased way&quot;.

This statement should be addressed accordingly to emphasize the novel aspects of V3C-seq relative to Hi-C for addressing viral-host interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, our technique is different because is enables us to interrogate the interactome of a specific region of interest (the MVM genome in this study) in finer detail by utilizing inverse PCRs to amplify the hybrid DNA fragments. While generally similar information can be obtained using Hi-C analyses, a significantly higher level of sequencing depth would be required to reach the same level of resolution because Hi-C assays measure all of the hybrid junctions formed by the chromosome conformation capture technique (also making it significantly more cost prohibitive). Utilization of V3C-seq allows the mapping of these interactomes in replicates over timecourses of infection and provides finer, more detailed interaction data in a more cost-efficient way. As described above, we will modify the Discussion (fourth paragraph) and Introduction (last paragraph) to more clearly convey these differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The description of the V3C-seq procedure given in Figure 2 and the text is quite clear in principal, and should be useable by others wishing to apply this approach in their own virus:host system.

Chromosome conformation capture assays quantify the formation of hybrid DNA junctions that are generated between distally located DNA fragments based only upon the primary restriction enzyme used (which, in these assays, is HindIII). Any crosslinks on the 5’ end of the MVM genome between the viral left-hand end (LHE) and the viral P38 (capsid gene) promoter will enable the formation of a hybrid junction at the HindIII site at 2651. Upon formation of these libraries of HindIII junctions, NlaIII is utilized as a secondary restriction enzyme to generate a smaller DNA library for the purpose of high-throughput sequencing. We have clarified this point in the text (subsection “The MVM genome associated directly with discrete sites on the cellular genome”, second paragraph) and have provided a more detailed version of the MVM genome at the bottom of Figure 2A incorporating the details of the MVM genome.

We agree that there are likely many copies of these viral replicative forms even at these early times; however, as mentioned in the fourth paragraph of the Results subsection “The MVM genome initiate infection at sites of cellular DNA damage that in mock infected cells also exhibited DNA damage as the cells cycled through S-phase, and as infection progressed, localized to additional sites of induced damage”, third paragraph”, we find a strong association of MVM with sites that in uninfected cells exhibit DNA damage upon replication. We proposed that this suggested that MVM may initially establish replication at cellular fragile sites that are susceptible to DNA damage as cell cycle through S-phase. We did not mean to imply that we had unequivocally proven that incoming genomes themselves necessarily migrate directly to these specific sites. We will discuss the reviewer’s point about abundant genomes (Discussion, first paragraph), and we will temper our conclusion to say that our results are “consistent” with this possibility (subsection “The MVM genome initiate infection at sites of cellular DNA damage that in mock infected cells also exhibited DNA damage as the cells cycled through S-phase, and as infection progressed, localized to additional sites of induced damage”, third paragraph”, fourth and last paragraphs; Discussion, first paragraph), and that specific localization of incoming genomes remains circumstantial (Discussion, first paragraph). Additionally, we will change “initially established” to “established” in the Abstract. This is really a matter of sensitivity, currently under further characterization, and we agree that this should be presented more clearly.</p><p>The reviewer’s second point is related to the first, and certainly was a target of our attention. As the reviewer points out, because there are many replicating viral genomes at sites of their interaction with the cellular chromosome, it is difficult to distinguish DDR signaling due to virus replication from that due to damage on cellular DNA. However, until we can unequivocally address this point using either gradient separation techniques or native ChIPs to effectively isolate viral chromosomes for analysis, we have presented an experiment that strongly suggests that the damage we see is at least primarily due to damage of the cellular chromosome. As we point out in the last paragraph of the Results subsection “VM infection induced distinct sites of cellular DNA damage as demonstrated by ChIP-seq for γ-H2AX”, in addition to the association of MVM with sites that in uninfected cells exhibit DNA damage upon progression into S-phase, VADs also correlated strongly with γ-H2AX ChIP-seq sites identified on cellular chromosomes of non-infected, HU-treated, A9 cells (Figure 3A). This implies that the γ-H2AX identified associated with MVM during infection resides on cellular DNA; however, we will add the phrase “but does not prove” to our conclusion in the Results subsection “The MVM genome initiate infection at sites of cellular DNA damage that in mock infected cells also exhibited DNA damage as the cells cycled through S-phase, and as infection progressed, localized to additional sites of induced damage”, fourth paragraph”. This point is treated as non-conclusive in the Discussion (second paragraph.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, one hopes that the software used to analyze the data generated in this paper works better than that used to generate the bibliography, which is a mess!</p></disp-quote><p>The bibliography errors have been corrected.
