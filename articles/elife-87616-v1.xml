Cell coupling via connexin-43 (Cx43) GJCs is important in a wide range of cellular processes in health and disease (Churko and Laird, 2013; Liang et al., 2020; Poelzing and Rosenbaum, 2004), yet the structural basis of Cx43 function and regulation has not been determined until now. Here, we describe the structure of a human Cx43 GJC solved by cryo-EM and single particle analysis at 2.26 Å resolution. The pore region of Cx43 GJC features several lipid-like densities per Cx43 monomer, located close to a putative lateral access site at the monomer boundary. We found a previously undescribed conformation on the cytosolic side of the pore, formed by the N-terminal domain and the transmembrane helix 2 of Cx43 and stabilized by a small molecule. Structures of the Cx43 GJC and hemichannels (HCs) in nanodiscs reveal a similar gate arrangement. The features of the Cx43 GJC and HC cryo-EM maps and the channel properties revealed by molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the captured states of Cx43 are consistent with a closed state.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>connexin-43</kwd><kwd>gap junction channel</kwd><kwd>hemichannel</kwd><kwd>cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>184951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korkhov</surname><given-names>Volodymyr M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AGAUR Beatriu de Pinos MSCA-COFUND Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-BP-00177</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Acosta Gutierrez</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM structures and molecular dynamics simulations of Cx43 gap junction channel and hemichannel reveal a putative closed state.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Gap junction (GJ)-mediated intercellular communication is one of the major pathways of information exchange between the cells. GJs are specialized regions of the plasma membrane at the cell–cell interface that link two adjacent cells and establish their metabolic and electrical coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodríguez-Sinovas et al., 2021</xref>). Connexins are the building blocks of the GJ channels (GJCs) which belong to a group of large-pore channels. This group includes a number of structurally related (innexins, pannexins, and LRRC8) and unrelated proteins (CALHM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Syrjanen et al., 2021</xref>). A total of 21 connexin genes have been identified in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srinivas et al., 2018</xref>). The 43 kDa connexin-43 (Cx43, gene name <italic>GJA1</italic>) was identified as a major constituent of rat heart GJs in 1987 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beyer et al., 1987</xref>), and it is arguably one of the most extensively studied connexins. Like all connexin homologues, Cx43 monomers assemble into hexameric hemichannels (HCs), also known as connexons. HCs that reach the plasma membrane of one cell may interact with their counterparts on the neighbouring cell, forming GJCs, typically organized into hexagonal arrays at the intercellular interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robertson, 1963</xref>). GJCs enable direct metabolic and electric coupling between the cells, facilitating the passage of ions, small molecules, metabolites, peptides, and other cellular components below a size threshold of approximately 1.5 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laird and Lampe, 2018</xref>). GJCs formed by Cx43 are crucial for a wide range of physiological processes, from propagation of heart action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poelzing and Rosenbaum, 2004</xref>) to maintenance of neuro-glial syncytium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liang et al., 2020</xref>) and skin wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Churko and Laird, 2013</xref>). The clinical importance of Cx43 is highlighted by mutations linked to several genetic disorders, such as oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jamsheer et al., 2014</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Paznekas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jamsheer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paznekas et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wiest et al., 2006</xref>), hypoplastic left heart syndrome 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dasgupta et al., 2001</xref>), Hallermann–Streiff syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pizzuti et al., 2004</xref>), and atrioventricular septal defect 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dasgupta et al., 2001</xref>), and by recognition of the protein as a drug target for treatment of cancer, skin wounds, eye injury and inflammation, and cardiac arrhythmias (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laird and Lampe, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Much of what we know today about the molecular biology, electrophysiological properties, and regulation of connexin gap junctions has been derived from the studies on Cx43 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ribeiro-Rodrigues et al., 2017</xref>). Early attempts to characterize the structure of Cx43 using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of 2D crystals produced low resolution reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Unger et al., 1999</xref>). More recently, several homologous connexin GJCs and HCs have been structurally characterized at high resolution, using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. The structures of Cx26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>) and Cx46/50 GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Myers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores et al., 2020</xref>), together with the recent structure of Cx31.3 HC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) provided deep insights into the shared structural features of the connexin channels. These structures hint at the role of the N-terminal domain (NTD) in molecular gating of GJCs and HCs, with several conformations of the NTD observed in different connexin homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Myers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, biochemical evidence points to the roles in channel gating played by the link between Cx43 intracellular loop and the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ponsaerts et al., 2010</xref>). However, despite the availability of this evidence, the molecular determinants of intracellular connexin channel gating remain unclear. To shed light on the structural basis of Cx43 gating, we set out to determine its structure by cryo-EM and to analyse its dynamics with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structures of Cx43 GJC and HC in detergent micelles and in nanodiscs</title><p>Our Cx43 expression system was tested using electrophysiology in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

The exterior of the channel is decorated by several ordered detergent and/or lipid-like density elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), reminiscent of the previously observed lipids bound at the protein–bilayer interface in other connexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flores et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of Cx43, the lipid-like densities appear to decorate the protein–lipid bilayer interface at both the inner and the outer leaflet of the membrane. Comparison of the Cx43 monomers to the available structures of Cx26 and Cx46 GJCs and the Cx31.3 HC revealed a major difference in the NTD arrangement in these channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). The conformation of the NTD in the Cx31.3 HC structure appears to be the closest to that in Cx43 GJC. Analysis of the tryptic peptides revealed that most of the protein lacks the residue M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), and thus the model was built starting with G2.</p><p>To ascertain that the conformation of Cx43 GJC is not induced by the detergent present in the sample, for example through detergent binding at specific sites on the protein surface, we removed the detergent and reconstituted the protein into MSP2N2 nanodiscs, using 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) as a mimic for the native lipid environment. The reconstituted protein was subjected to the same imaging and analysis workflow as Cx43 GJC in digitonin. The 2D classes of the MSP2N2-reconstituted Cx43 showed features consistent with a mixture of GJCs and HC. Processing of the corresponding particles resulted in 3D reconstructions of the Cx43 GJC at 2.95 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>) and HC in nanodiscs at 3.98 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplements 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>).

This arrangement of the gate region is distinct from any of the previously observed states of connexin GJCs or HCs. This particular gate conformation is established through an interplay of two structural elements: the NTD and the TM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). The NTD of Cx43 is arranged near parallel to the membrane plane, in a centre-oriented conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The HC of Cx31.3 assembles in a similar manner, with a well-ordered NTD resolved by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). However, the TM2 region of Cx31.3 forms a tight seal with the NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, the TM2 of Cx43 is shifted away from the pore centre, creating six openings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Alignment of the protomers of Cx43 and Cx31.3 showed an RMSD of 1.78 Å (using cealign in PyMol). In contrast, the RMSD value for the region corresponding to the NTD and TM2 was 5.675 Å (calculated using rms_cur in PyMol, with the residue range selections of 2–47 and 2–45 for the aligned protomers of Cx43 and Cx31.3, respectively), further confirming that these two regions differ substantially between Cx43 and Cx31.3. The arrangement of the Cx43 NTD appears to be stabilized by a small molecule: a density element likely corresponding to a bound small molecule is present within this region (referred to as the ‘NTD lipid site’), wedged between the adjacent NTDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, although the conformation of the Cx43 gate features an opening, this site is blocked by a yet unidentified small molecule (which we refer to as ‘lipid-N’).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The connexin-43 (Cx43) gate adopts a closed conformation.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Analysis of the pore opening dimensions using HOLE reveals a constriction of the pore in the putative gate region.

Instead the study reporting this reconstruction compared the density map with an HC model from a Cx26 GJC structure (PDB ID: 5ERA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett et al., 2016</xref>). As this model lacks the NTD, any comparisons of the gating region in the Cx43 HC with that in the Cx26 HC are presently limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9D</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the lipid-N molecules stabilizing the NTD arrangement, the cryo-EM density of Cx43 GJC features several well resolved densities inside the pore region (lipid-1 and -2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These elements likely correspond to bound sterol molecules, such as cholesterol co-purified with the protein from the mammalian cells or cholesterol hemisuccinate (CHS) added to the solubilization mixture during protein extraction from the membrane. Similar densities are present in the Cx43 GJC reconstruction in nanodiscs, in the absence of detergent molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, it is noteworthy that the annular lipid densities are conserved in both the detergent-solubilized and the nanodisc-reconstitued Cx43 GJCs, indicating that the protein–lipid interface of Cx43 features sites where ordered lipid molecules may bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The functional significance of the ordered annular lipids for the channel activity and for GJ plaque assembly remains to be carefully investigated.</p><p>Identification of the lipid-like molecules bound to Cx43 is a significant challenge. Despite the high overall resolution of the 3D reconstruction of the Cx43 GJC (2.26 Å resolution in detergent and 2.95 Å in nanodisc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>), the cryo-EM map features in regions corresponding to the lipid densities are insufficient to assign the lipid identity unambiguously. To determine the identities of these lipids experimentally, we performed lipidomic analysis of the organic extracts prepared from the purified Cx43 samples and compared them to the mock control (extracts of prepared from eluates of the purification procedure using cells that do not overexpress the protein as starting material). The results showed that several types of phospholipids, as well as cholesterol were present in both samples. The only lipid-like compound specifically enriched in the purified sample was dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). DHEA is a most abundantly expressed neurosteroid known to modulate ligand-gated ion channels, such as GABA<sub>A</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gartside et al., 2010</xref>) or NMDA and AMPA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kimonides et al., 1998</xref>). Although we are presently not able to conclusively state that DHEA corresponds to any of the densities present in our reconstruction, its enrichment in the sample is an interesting observation that deserves detailed future investigations. While the density corresponding to lipid-N may correspond to DHEA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>), it is also possible that this density corresponds to a larger molecule that is only partially ordered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Cx43 junction interface</title><p>As in other connexins, the Cx43 GJC interface is formed by two extracellular loops, ECL1 and ECL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B</xref>).

It is noteworthy that both the amino acid sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and the interaction networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) are similar in the ECL1 for Cx43 and Cx46, and in the ECL2 for Cx46 and Cx26. The differences in these two loops, and especially in ECL2, underlie the inability of Cx43 (which has been grouped into a docking group 2) to engage in heterotypic interactions with group 1 connexins (such as Cx46 and Cx26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2018</xref>). Our structure is thus in line with the recognized consensus motif necessary for heterotypic complementarity of connexin GJCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koval et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Extracellular domain of connexin-43 (Cx43) gap junction channel (GJC) and hemichannel (HC).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The lateral views of Cx43 GJC in digitonin, indicating the positions of the extracellular loops 1 and 2.

The resolution of the HC reconstruction does not allow us to make definitive statements about the orientations of individual side chains, but it is clear that both loops engaging in junction formation move inward upon docking of the two HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This conformational change likely involves intra- and intermolecular cooperativity. The ECL1 and ECL2 are linked via several disulphide bonds, and thus the rearrangement within each molecule would require concerted movement of the whole extracellular domain (ECD). The ECD movement within one monomer is likely cooperatively coupled to the neighbouring chains within the Cx43 HC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Disease-linked mutations in Cx43</title><p>A number of disease-linked mutations associated with Cx43 can be mapped directly to three regions of interest (ROI) revealed by our structures: (1) the GJC intra-pore lipid-like site, (2) the ECD, and (3) the gating region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The interior of the channel features two lipid-like densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The observed position of lipid 1 is consistent with the previously found phospholipid-like densities inside the pore of the Cx31.3 HC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Lipid 2 inserts into the pocket formed by TM1 and TM2, parallel with the NTD. Unlike Cx31.3, where elongated densities within the pore region could be interpreted as hydrophobic tails of bound phospholipids, the density in the Cx43 GJC appears consistent with that of a sterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). The presence of a small hydrophobic small molecule in Cx43 at this site suggests a potential mechanism of lipid-based Cx43 regulation, whereby binding of a lipid could directly influence the conformation of the gating elements of the protein (such as NTD). An effect of a cholesterol analogue 7-ketocholesterol on Cx43 permeability has been observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Girão et al., 2004</xref>), and such an effect may be mediated via the binding sites within the GJC (or HC) pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The state is distinct from the previously observed structures of connexin GJCs and HCs, adding an important missing component to our understanding of connexin-mediated intercellular communication. With these structures in mind, we can now propose the existence of several structurally defined gating substates of the connexin channels: (1) a fully open gate, (2) a semi-permeable central gate, and (3) a closed gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The gating mechanisms of connexin HCs and GJC are complex and involve multiple components.

This conformation is distinct from the one captured by our cryo-EM reconstructions, and it is possible that under certain conditions the Cx43 NTD may transition from the observed conformation to a low pH Cx26-like state. It is worth mentioning that for the Cx43 HCs the open probability has been shown to be very low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contreras et al., 2003</xref>), and thus a closed conformation such as the one described here may represent the predominant state of the channel.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A structure-based view of connexin gating states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The side view of a fully open gate, as observed in Cx26 gap junction channel (GJC; PDB ID: 2zw3); the gate-forming regions of the protein, N-terminal domain (NTD; red) and TM2 (blue), are shown as cylinders.

The differences in the electrostatic properties of the gates and the pore regions in different connexin channels may reflect the differences in their selectivity for ions and small molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, it is also likely that the unstructured regions in Cx43 and other connexins, including the intracellular loop and the C-terminal domain, contribute to the electrostatic potential, substrate selectivity, and regulation of these channels. These domains are known to play important roles in connexin channel regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’hondt et al., 2014</xref>). However, as these regions are unresolved in any of the available 3D reconstructions of connexin channels, the structural basis of their action remains to be determined.</p><p>The observation of lipid-like molecules bound inside the pore is intriguing. The use of detergents and lipids is currently a prerequisite for structural analysis of membrane proteins, and it is possible that under solubilization conditions the abundance of added detergent and lipid (CHS) forces the protein to interact with these molecules. Nevertheless, these interactions may correspond to the naturally occurring interactions with the endogenous lipids present in the lipid bilayer of the cell. The presence of such molecules could have important implications for HC or GJC assembly, substrate permeation and molecular gating. It remains to be determined whether Cx43 or other connexin channels harbour intra-pore lipids in the cellular membranes in vivo.</p><p>Distinct gating modes have been shown in the literature for both Cx43 HCs and GJCs, with fast transitions from an open state to a state of residual conductance, and slow transitions from an open to a fully closed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bukauskas and Verselis, 2004</xref>). The structures of Cx43 described here may represent the closed states, based on the cryo-EM- and MD simulation-based evidence. The closed state could be stabilized by a yet unknown agent that occupies the NTD lipid site formed by the arrangement of the NTDs and TM2 regions observed in our structures. It is worth noting that the majority of Cx43 channels in a GJ plaque are closed, with only a small fraction of the channels active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bukauskas et al., 2000</xref>). Detailed investigations of Cx43 and other connexin channels will be required to determine whether the gate conformation observed here is a common feature among different GJCs and HCs, and to pinpoint the physiological circumstances that establish this gating conformation. Finally, capturing the structures of Cx43 channels in distinct conformations under a wide range of physiologically relevant conditions will be required to establish its mechanism of action, gating and regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

While structures of connexins have previously been reported, the structure of Connexin 43, which is the most widely expressed connexin and is important in many physiological processes was not known. Qi et al used cryo-EM to solve the structure of Connexin 43. They then compared this structure to structures of other connexins. Connexin gap junctions are built from two &quot;hemichannels&quot; consisting of hexamers of connexins. Hemichannels from two opposing cells dock together to form a complete channel that allows the movement of molecules between cells. N-terminal helices from each of the 6 subunits of each hemichannel allow control of whether the channels are open or closed. Previously solved structures of Cx26 and Cx46/50 have the N-termini pointing down into the pore of the protein leaving a central pore and so these channels have been considered to be open. The structure that Qi et al observed has the N-termini in a more raised position with a narrower pore through the centre. This led them to speculate whether this was the &quot;closed&quot; form of the protein. They also noted that, if only the protein was considered, there were gaps between the N-terminal helices, but these gaps were filled with lipid-like molecules. They, therefore, speculated that lipids were important in the closure mechanism. To address whether their structure was open or closed with respect to ions they carried out molecular dynamics studies, and demonstrated that under the conditions of the molecular dynamics ions did not traverse the channel when the lipids were present.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The high resolution cryo-EM density maps clearly show the structure of the protein with the N-termini in a lateral position and lipid density blocking the gaps between the neighbouring helices. The conformation that they observe when they have solved the structure from protein in detergent is also seen when they reconstitute the protein into nanodiscs, which is ostensibly a more membrane-like environment. They, therefore, would appear to have trapped the protein in a stable conformational state.</p><p>The molecular dynamics simulations are consistent with the channel being closed when the lipid is present and raises the possibility of lipids being involved in regulation.</p><p>A comparison of this structure with other structures of connexin channels and hemichannels gives another representation of how the N-terminal helix of connexins can variously be involved in the regulation of channel opening.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the authors have trapped a relatively stable state of the protein and shown that, under the conditions of their molecular dynamics simulations, ions do not pass through, it is harder to understand whether this is physiologically relevant. Determining this would be beyond the scope of the article. To my knowledge there is no direct evidence that lipids are involved in regulation of connexins in this way, but this is also an interesting area for future exploration. It is also possible that lipids were trapped in the pore during the solubilisation process making it non-physiological. The authors acknowledge this and they describe the structure as a &quot;putative&quot; closed state.</p><p>The positions of the mutations in disease shown in Figure 4 is interesting. However, the authors don't discuss/speculate how any of these mutations could affect the binding of the lipids or the conformational state of the protein.</p><p>It should also be noted that a structure of the same protein has recently been published. This shows a very similar conformation of the N-termini with lipids bound in the same way, despite solubilising in a different detergent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87616.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The authors have addressed most of the concerns. Yet, I still think the authors should at least mention in the article the residues involved in the intra-pore lipid binding pockets for further experimental validation (not only for those residues involve in disease). This is important because the lipid-like density information usually does not come integrated into the PDB structures, so it is not easily accessible for non-structural biologists. The structural data seems solid, and the MD data supports the notion that the GJC is in a putative close state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87616.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response:</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Chao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Acosta Gutierrez</surname><given-names>Silvia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lavriha</surname><given-names>Pia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Paul Scherrer Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Villigen</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Othman</surname><given-names>Alaa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lopez-Pigozzi</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padua</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bayraktar</surname><given-names>Erva</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padua</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schuster</surname><given-names>Dina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Picotti</surname><given-names>Paola</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zamboni</surname><given-names>Nicola</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>ETH Zurich</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Zurich</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bortolozzi</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Padova</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Padova</named-content></addr-line><country>Italy</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gervasio</surname><given-names>Francesco Luigi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Korkhov</surname><given-names>Volodymyr M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Paul Scherrer Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Villigen</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Revisions:</p><p>1. Although we appreciate this work was carried out independently, it would improve this paper if this structure presented here was compared to the recently published structure of Cx43 (Nat Commun 14, 931 (2023)) with the conclusions including added in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We encourage the readers to read both our study on Cx43 and the one mentioned by the reviewer. However, we believe the optimal format for such a comparison is going to be a more comprehensive review article, which is outside the scope of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Please elaborate on the lipid-binding pockets observed for lipid 1, lipid 2, and the N-lipid/PGL. For example, what are the residues involved in these lipid-protein interactions? Are these residues conserved in other connexin isoforms? Do these lipid-binding pockets match with previous structures, including the recent Cx43 structure? Please clarify what lipid sites are ambiguous due to insufficient resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>Within the scope of our study, we have shown that some of the disease-linked residues are located in close proximity to the lipid sites (Fig. 4b). This suggests a possible role of the lipid sites in diseases associated with Cx43 mutations (and possibly with the mutations in other connexins, as the structures of other connexin channels also feature bound lipids inside the pore region). We feel that a more in-depth comparison will require a careful study, beyond the analysis that we have performed here, and for this reason we would like to reserve such a detailed comparison for our future work (possibly a comprehensive review article on connexin structure and function).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The NT domain and TM2 segments are referred to as the gate region. If there is no strong evidence to support this claim then please use &quot;putative&quot; gate region.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text accordingly, referring to this region as a putative gate region where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is mentioned that there is a reorientation of extracellular loops 1 and 2 after Gap junction formation. Based on their structures, I wonder how this rearrangement alters the channel conduction pathway. For example, Do the electrostatic surface and hydrophobic properties change? Please consider adding further details as this information could be useful to understand why some properties of hemichannels differ from intercellular GJ channels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the Fig. 5 with an illustration of the Cx43 HC surface coloured according to electrostatic potential (to match the same representation of the Cx43 GJC). It is obvious that the rearrangement of the extracellular loops 1 and 2 do not dramatically alter the electrostatic properties of the HC relative to the GJC. A more obvious difference is in the local environment of the ECLs: it is radically different in a “free” HC (exposed to the solvent or to the extracellular space of a cell), compared to the ECL environment in a connexon within a GJC (which is sealed by a docked connexon from the opposite membrane).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Related to the previous point, the pore profile shown in Figure 5C shows that there is a constriction site in the extracellular part with the same diameter as the observed constriction caused by the NT domain. This constriction point seems to be associated with the high energies calculated for Cl-. Please clarify if this constriction is produced by the formation of the GJC or is also present in HC?</p></disp-quote><p>This is the same constriction zone, and the Cl- barriers are further down the channel axis where the electrostatic potential of the protein is negative. We have included a similar calculation for the HC simulation in Fig. 5 (revised Fig. 5f).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Related to the MD simulations shown in Figure 5d: if the voltage is applied across the whole GJC, the free energy under voltage should not be symmetric. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The symmetry observed in the free energies is due to the fact that the ions enter and exit from the same hemichannel. Only at very high voltages we observe some rare full GJC permeation events, slightly unbalancing the free energy at 500 mV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The scheme in Figure 6 many needs further editing. The authors propose a putative closed state in which lipids are bound next to the NT, but we suggest it should be made clearer in the figure that this is a putative model, since there is no functional evidence supporting the role of these lipids in the gating/permeation properties of Cx43. Also, please clarify what is meant by a &quot;semi-permeable gate&quot; - a channel that only permeates ions but not molecules?</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the legend of the figure 6, to clearly reflect that this is a putative model. The “semi-permeable” state of the channel is something that was suggested previously by the authors of the Cx31.3 study, and we refer to that structure in the figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. In the result section there are some statements that currently lack solid experimental support. Please consider editing or moving this text to the discussion section only. A good example of this is the Diseaselinked mutation section, specifically lines 199-206. In another example: in lines, 237-238 authors state that NT can move laterally and vertically, but this idea still requires experimental validation.</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that the original formulations of these portions of the text are appropriate. Disrupting them would interrupt the flow of the manuscript, and we prefer to stay with the original text in this case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 283. &quot;With these structures in mind, we can now establish the existence of several structurally defined gating substates of the connexin channels&quot;. Please, tone down this statement. Replace &quot;establish&quot; with &quot;propose&quot; or another more appropriate word.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the text as suggested (&quot;propose” instead of “establish”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Line 313-314. &quot; The presence of such molecules could have important implications for HC or GJC assembly, substrate permeation, and molecular gating&quot;. Currently, this entire statement does not have any support. Is there any paper that authors can discuss to suggest with some basis that lipids might have a role in assembly, permeation or gating?</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that this statement is sufficiently careful, conveying a thought that the presence of such molecules could have important implications for various HC- or GJC-related processes. It is not a particularly strong claim and seems to be appropriate in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It seems that the structure shown in panels A and C in Figure 2 are shown in opposite directions, which makes the figure confusing. If needed, please rotate the structure in panel A to show the cytosolic part of the protein as panel C. Also, in the same figure, panels G and F are wrongly labeled. Please correct.</p></disp-quote><p>For Fig. 2a, the angle is very different from anything else we show in the figure, so we would rather keep this as it is now. We have corrected the labelling for Fig. 2g-h.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Check spelling mistakes in the legend of Extended data Fig.2, Extended data Fig.9, and line 243.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for pointing out the typos, which have now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The colors for G-L isoforms are not specified in Extended Data Fig.10. Please correct this.</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the figure, removing the PGL label (the correct label is “lipid-N”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is not clear what is the difference between PGL and the N-lipid density. Does PGL refers to the lipid-like density observed in nanodiscs, as indicated in Extended Fig. 4 and 10?. Please clarify this issue in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The labeling has been corrected in like with the revised version of the manuscript (this density element is now referred to as the “lipid-N”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Page 7 line 234-235 &quot;The pore opening has a solvent-accessible radius of ~6Å (Figure 5c) very close to the effective hydrated radius of K+ (~6.6 Å) and Cl- (~7.2 Å). This makes it the most narrow pore opening...&quot;, it should be diameter, not radius.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a calculation for the HC (new Fig. 5f) and corrected the text as follows (line 234):</p><p>“The pore opening observed in our cryo-EM structures has a solvent-accessible radius of ~3 Å (Figure 2b). This makes it the most narrow pore opening observed for a connexin channel to date (a comparison of the pore openings in the cryo-EM structures of connexin channels is shown in Extended Data Fig. 12). However, the average solvent-accessible radius of the pore during molecular dynamics was ~6 Å (Figure 5c); note that the effective hydrated radius of K+ and Cl- is ~3.3 Å and ~3.6 Å, respectively.”</p><p>And line 277:</p><p>“The average pore radius during the simulations was consistent with that observed in the cryo-EM structure (Fig. 5f).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
