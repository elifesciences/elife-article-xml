continuum of populations with varying degrees of admixture among African, European, and Amerindigenous ancestries. In the United States, populations with non-European ancestry remain understudied, and thus little is known about the genetic architecture of phenotypic variation in these populations. Using genotype data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, we find that Amerindigenous ancestry increased by an average of ~20% spanning 1940s-1990s in Mexican Americans. These patterns result from complex interactions between several population and cultural factors which shaped patterns of genetic variation and influenced the genetic architecture of complex traits in Mexican Americans. We show for height how polygenic risk scores based on summary statistics from a European-based genome-wide association study perform poorly in Mexican Americans. Our findings reveal temporal changes in population structure within Hispanics/Latinos that may influence biomedical traits, demonstrating a need to improve our understanding of admixed populations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>admixture</kwd><kwd>genetic architecture</kwd><kwd>population genetics</kwd><kwd>complex traits</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HG007644</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez</surname><given-names>Ryan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HG010104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spear</surname><given-names>Melissa L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-136855</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gravel</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01184545</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ziv</surname><given-names>Elad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K24169004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ziv</surname><given-names>Elad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Admixture dynamics have recently changed over time in Mexican Americans resulting in an impact on the genetic architecture of phenotypic variation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The United States Census Bureau refers to the Hispanic/Latino ethnicity as a category for individuals who self-identify as âa person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless ofÂ raceÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">United States Government, Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 1997</xref>). As such, this broad ethnic group living in the United States is a culturally, phenotypically, and genetically diverse continuum of populations. Individuals who identify as Hispanic/Latino have varying proportions of Amerindigenous, African, and European genetic ancestries, each with their own unique continental demographic history. Demographic forces such as population bottlenecks, expansions, and migration as well as adaptation to novel environments resulted in observable differences in continental patterns of genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abecasis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auton et al., 2015</xref>). These differing patterns were shaped by many historical events of migration which included the founding of the Americas by Amerindigenous populations, the colonization by Europeans, and the African slave trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gravel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Homburger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreno-Estrada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moreno-Estrada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bryc et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conomos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Han et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baharian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jordan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Micheletti et al., 2020</xref>). However additional complexities surrounding these events remain highly understudied.</p><p>Demographic history has shaped the genetic architecture of modern human phenotypic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwala et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eyre-Walker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Simons et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Uricchio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), and is critical to consider in the search for the genetic basis of complex diseases. The demography of the United States has changed drastically over the 20<sup>th</sup> century, and by 2044 is predicted to become a âminority-majorityâ country whereby no one racial/ethnic group comprises more than 50% of the population. By 2060 Hispanics/Latinos are projected to make up 29% of the US population or 119 million individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colby and Ortman, 2015</xref>). However, to date, population-based medical genomics research [and its subsequent benefits, including polygenic risk score (PRS) profiling] have been disproportionately focused on individuals of European descent, with the findings primarily benefiting European populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bustamante et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the increases in sample sizes, rates of discovery, and traits studied, Hispanic or Latin American participation in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has continued to hover around 1% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Popejoy and Fullerton, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mills and Rahal, 2019</xref>). This trend, along with factors ranging from research abuse and community mistrust to community superstition and apathy have led to a situation where these populations (and other non-European populations) are particularly vulnerable to falling behind in receiving the benefits of the precision medicine revolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Popejoy and Fullerton, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we utilize the largest genetic study of Hispanics/Latinos in the U.S. to date -- the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conomos et al., 2016</xref>) -- to understand how patterns of genetic variation in Hispanic/Latino populations in the United States have changed over the last century, and evaluate the impact such changes may be having on complex traits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global ancestry proportions among HCHS/SOL Hispanic/Latino Populations</title><p>Using the subset of sites that overlapped with our African, European, and Amerindigenous reference panels, we called 3-way global ancestry estimates for 10,268 unrelated HCHS/SOL individuals (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> summarizes the global ancestry proportions shaded by admixture estimates in a ternary plot, recapitulating the original HCHS/SOL analysis of continental ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conomos et al., 2016</xref>). However, while several population groups appear to have overlapping ancestry proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), this analysis masks more subtle structure in subcontinental ancestry. To investigate subtle population structure across these self-identified population groups, we performed UMAP on the top three principal components (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), and find substantial structure across self-identified groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref>). We find that Dominicans, who have the highest average proportions of African ancestry, are in the middle, with Puerto Ricans and Cubans, diverging in opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) with clines of increasing European ancestry proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Further, while self-identified Mexican, Central, and South American groups appear to have overlapping ancestry proportions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâB</xref>, UMAP represents the Mexican Americans and Central/South American groups as large, separate wings that diverge from self-identified Cubans and Dominicans, with both clusters diverging with clines of increasing ancestry toward different Amerindigenous (AI) populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). When we included multiple European and African reference populations in our analyses as well as without reference populations, UMAP maintained the representation of separate clusters for each of the HCHS/SOL populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1CâG</xref>). These clusters with varying AI ancestries are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conomos et al., 2016</xref>, however the UMAP embedding consolidates the signal present in the top three PCs into a succinct two-dimensional visualization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genomic ancestry and population structure in HCHS/SOL.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ternary plot of HCHS/SOL (nÂ =Â 10,268) colored by admixture proportions.

To test this, we calculated the length of each RFMix inferred local ancestry tract in each Mexican American individual and tested for differences in the distribution of tract lengths across birth-decades using a multiple linear regression model (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). We found no significant associations between the decade bin and the proportion of AI ancestral tracts at various lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi>Î²</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>Â =Â 0.04, CI = (â0.019â0.099); p=0.19), even when testing for violations of model assumptions (e.g. normalizing the tracts per bin by the number of individuals, or excluding the 1930s and/or 1990s individuals due to the small sample size in each bin).</p><p>While there are no statistical differences in the length of admixture tracts, it is possible that local ancestry tracts have accumulated in specific regions of the genome to drive the increased global ancestry proportions over time. We used local ancestry estimates generated across the genome to perform admixture mapping in HCHS/SOL Mexican Americans to determine if younger individuals harbored excess AI ancestry in certain regions of the genome. Although we tried two different models (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), we did not find any loci to be significantly associated with birth year across the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We find that there are no changes in AI ancestry tract lengths over time nor any regions of the genome that seem to be accumulating AI ancestry at disproportionate rates, yet genetic diversity has decreased over time in the AI ancestry tracts of Mexican Americans despite rapid growth of the census population size. We therefore investigated whether this population has experienced increased haplotype homozygosity over time. We investigated this possibility by exploring runs of homozygosity (ROH) across the genomes of each of the 3622 Mexican Americans. We classified ROH into three categories: short, medium, and long, based on the length distribution in the population. Generally, short ROH are tens of kilobases in length and likely reflect the homozygosity of old haplotypes; medium ROH are hundreds of kilobases in length and likely reflect background relatedness in the population; and long ROH are hundreds of kilobases to several megabases in length and are likely the result of recent parental relatedness. Overall, we find a significant positive correlation between birth year and the total ROH (summed across size classes; ÏÂ =Â 0.0449, p=6.12e-5, Kendallâs rank correlation), but this signal becomes stronger when we restrict our analysis to ROH calls that overlap AI ancestry tracts (Ï=0.065, p=7.39e-9). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows a fitted LOESS curve to the proportion of the genome with AI (or European) ancestry covered by ROH across the genomes of Mexican Americans as a function of their birth year, broken down by ROH size class (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref> for the distribution of ROH by length classes and ancestry). When stratified by size class and normalized by AI global ancestry, the associations (all Kendallâs rank correlation) in AI ROH were primarily driven by the short (Ï=0.097, p&lt;2.2E-16), and medium (Ï=0.084, p=1.27E-13) size classes (while long ROH was insignificant after multiple testing due to the small number of long ROH across individuals; ÏÂ =Â â0.032, p=0.004). We observed the opposite pattern when ROH were restricted to European ancestry segments of the genome: there is a significant negative correlation between birth year and the total ROH that overlap European ancestry tracts (Ï=â0.089, p=1.82E-14).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Strong ancestry-related assortative mating in HCHS/SOL Mexicans</title><p>Given that short and medium length ROH have increased over time, it appears that background relatedness within AI ancestry in Mexican Americans has increased over time (but not an increase in recent parental relatedness). One way for this to occur is if individuals with similar ancestry patterns tend to mate with one another more often than expected under a model of random mating (i.e. assortative mating). To measure assortative mating, we estimated the ancestral proportions of the biological parents of each HCHS/SOL Mexican American (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). With individuals from all decades pooled together, we found the inferred biological parental AI ancestries to be significantly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, rÂ =Â 0.708, 95% CI:0.69â0.72, p&lt;2.2E-16, Pearson correlation). When stratified by decade, the distributions of the difference in parental AI overlap each other and the correlation in inferred parental AI global ancestry ranged from 0.65 to 0.74 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4</xref>), but were not statistically different from each other. This shows a consistent pattern of strong parental ancestry correlations among Mexican Americans over different generations. This signature of assortative mating is not due to recent parental relatedness, because there is no trend in long ROH with birth year (and an overall low rate of long ROH among Mexican Americans).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Population genetic factors affecting changes in ancestry proportions over time</title><p>We developed a Moran model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Moran, 1958</xref>) style simulator to evaluate how migration, assortative mating, population growth, and variance in reproduction affect ancestry proportions over the timescale shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (for details, see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Briefly, a Moran model is a forward simulation approach whereby each iteration, a single individual is replaced by another individual through a process of choosing parents.

Each iteration incorporated population growth, assortative mating, ancestry-based fecundity differences and migration.

While population growth can intensify the strength of natural selection (causing deleterious alleles to decrease in frequency and adaptive alleles to increase in frequency), population growth does not cause systematic changes in the frequency of segregating neutral alleles. Similarly, including population growth did not affect the mean ancestry proportion in a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>In our simulations, we specified the assortative mating parameter to range from 0 (random mating) to 1 (parents are chosen as nearest neighbors when sorted by ancestry proportions). Ancestry-based assortative mating can lead to increased ROH and decreased genetic diversity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), but because mating occurs from individuals proportionally across the ancestry spectrum, ancestry-based assortative mating does not induce any changes in mean ancestry proportions in the population (albeit with slight increase in variance in ancestry proportions over time, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7</xref>).

Hispanics/Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority group, and are projected to compriseÂ ~29% of the US population by 2060. They are a genetically and phenotypically diverse population as a result of extensive admixture between Amerindigenous populations and immigrants from multiple geographic locations around the world. In this study, we identified additional population substructure complexities that may contribute to phenotypic variation within Hispanics/Latinos.</p><p>Specifically, we demonstrated how the admixture composition of Mexican Americans have changed over time, resulting in an increase ofÂ ~20% Amerindigenous ancestry on average over the 50 year period studied. This change in ancestry is equivalent to a mean increase in Amerindigenous ancestry ofÂ ~0.4% per year. While the effect sizes vary to some extent, we replicate the underlying pattern across multiple data stratifications (two metropolitan cities, US-born and non-US-born) and also replicate this feature in an independent cohort of Mexican Americans. Further, we find that a similar trend holds across multiple self-identified Hispanic/Latino populations in the US (and is statistically significant in Central Americans). This effect does not appear to have a simple explanation: we do not see any statistically significant increases in Amerindigenous ancestry at individual loci, we do not see more than a negligible degree of population differentiation over time, and this increase cannot be entirely explained by very recent migration based on our analyses of non-US-born individuals.</p><p>What could be driving the increased Amerindigenous ancestry in Mexican Americans? We hypothesize that several population, cultural, and environmental factors operating in unison have altered the genetic architecture of Mexican Americans. First, we identify strong ancestry-based assortative mating. However, while assortative mating could explain the increased ROH and decreased genetic diversity we inferred over time, ancestry-based assortative mating alone should not result in mean changes in global ancestry proportions (since a proportional number of offspring should derive from high- versus low-Amerindigenous ancestry parents, see simulations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7</xref>). Second, we do infer a subtle increase in Amerindigenous ancestry among individuals who migrated to the US more recently than individuals who migrated earlier. Independent analyses have shown that migration from Mexico to the US has shifted over the years from states with less Amerindigenous ancestry to states with higher Amerindigenous ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moreno-Estrada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Terrazas, 2010</xref>). However, these subtle shifts in recent migration cannot fully explain the changes in Amerindigenous ancestry we infer, and taking them into account in our statistical model did not change the effect size that birth year has on Amerindigenous ancestry over time. Third, from US census data, we know that Hispanic/Latino is the fastest growing ethnicity (with Mexican Americans constituting the plurality). However, similar to assortative mating, population size changes alone should not drive mean changes in global ancestry proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3âfigure supplement 6</xref>). While none of these factors alone can adequately explain the temporal dynamics of Amerindigenous ancestry we have observed, simulations of the joint effects of all of these factors operating in unison can indeed drive substantial changes in global ancestry patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3âfigure supplements 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s14">14</xref>). However, more research is necessary to understand which parameters are consistent with the continuum of Mexican American populations across the US.</p><p>Regardless of the underlying mechanisms driving increased Amerindigenous ancestry in Mexican Americans, this additional source of temporal substructure within this population has substantial consequences for phenotypic variation in biomedical traits. We identify several biomedical traits that are associated with Amerindigenous ancestry, with effects comparable to the high effects of gender, and show that in the case of height, there are both ancestry and temporal effects. While we do see differences in mean height based on percentage of AI ancestry, height increases over time in all groups at similar rates. Individuals with lower percentages of AI ancestry were taller on average than individuals with higher AI ancestry pointing to the role of AI ancestry on the trait. Further study is necessary to understand whether other biomedical traits are also changing over time as a result of the change in genomic ancestry proportions, and the degree to which other socio-economic factors independently drive both ancestry patterns as well as biomedical traits.</p><p>In our study, we bring specific attention to the biases that continue to exist with using European GWAS summary statistics to calculate polygenic risk scores in admixed populations such as Mexican Americans that are comprised of European, Amerindigenous, and African genetic ancestries. In particular, in the case of height, we found that the polygenic height score (PHS) correlated with observed height only in the subset of individuals with the lowest levels of Amerindigenous ancestry (i.e. the subset of individuals with highest European ancestry). As the population dynamics of the US continue to change, it is imperative that we study diverse populations, or we risk exacerbating the health disparities that currently exist. To date, population-based medical genomics research (and its subsequent benefits) have been disproportionately focused on populations of European ancestry. In order to improve the design and implementation of medical genetics studies for the ethnically diverse U.S. population, we need detailed insights into the population history of diverse U.S. populations. This includes characterizing the admixture dynamics of Hispanic/Latino populations, as well as the evolutionary forces that shaped patterns of genetic variation of the ancestral populations that contributed to modern day Hispanic/Latino populations.</p><p>The genetic variation of the Hispanic community in the United States belies categorization under a single label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conomos et al., 2016</xref>). The events that have shaped and continue to shape this genetic diversity are complex, numerous, and nuanced, and the social history of such a diverse population is intrinsic to any genetic study. Mexicoâs society was largely defined by an established social caste system based on ancestry, which disappeared after Mexicoâs independence in 1821 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lisker et al., 1990</xref>).Â Even so, social inequalities persist today with skin color having a significant effect on wealth and education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinez, 2017</xref>).Â A multitude of factors within and outside Mexico â whether related to trade, immigration policies, or armed conflicts â acted to influence who immigrated to the United States, and the impact of each of these fluctuates over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras, 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verea and Verea, 2014</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">FernÃ¡ndez-Kelly and Massey, 2007</xref>). These changes shift the demographics of immigration, which is inherently related to the genetic ancestry of the population.</p><p>Consequently, this shapes the genetic architecture of complex traits. Diverse populations are at risk not only from underrepresentation in research, but because of poor understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics at play in genetic variation. The promise of equitable precision medicine â one of the ultimate goals of medical genomics â cannot be kept without understanding this interplay. Health disparities in the United States are fed by structural inequalities. For example, studies that use modern Artificial Intelligence techniques have already been shown to inflate existing disparities between Black Americans and White Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obermeyer et al., 2019</xref>).Â Such biases, whether from algorithms, study designs, or misunderstandings of subtleties in data, feed into the larger systemic pressures faced by minority populations in the United States.</p><p>While we have shown a dramatic shift in ancestry proportions in US Hispanic/Latinos, one of the caveats of this study is that the HCHS/SOL cohort is not representative of all US Hispanics/Latinos. HCHS/SOL participants were recruited at four primary centers: Bronx, Chicago, Miami, and San Diego. There may be additional genetic diversity that has not been captured by this dataset and trends exhibited in this dataset may not translate to Hispanic/Latino populations living in other regions of the US (though the temporal increase in Amerindigenous ancestry was replicated in an independent sample of Mexican Americans). Further, we have only assembled a reference panel with limited numbers of individuals with various Amerindigenous, European, and African ancestry. With better population genetic modeling and a deeper understanding of the social and historical aspects of Hispanic/Latino populations, we will be able to improve our understanding of the genetic and phenotypic diversity across these populations, and subsequently improve our ability to understand genetic contributions to complex traits and disease. These insights will lead to optimization of population sampling for the design of future medical genetic studies, the identification of disease risk variants, and ultimately, precision medicine for all.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study dataset and initial quality control</title><p>The HCHS/SOL study is a community-based cohort study of self-identified Hispanic/Latino individuals from four US metropolitan areas with the general goal of identifying risk and protective factors for various medical conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and sleep disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sorlie et al., 2010</xref>).

The authors find a pattern of increasing amerindigenous ancestry with birth year, which they investigate using simulations and attribute to the likely combination of several cultural and historical factors. They find amerindigenous ancestry to be associated with trait variation for several complex traits, and highlight the importance of further work in medical and population genomics across human diversity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Recent fluctuations in Mexican American genomes have altered the genetic architecture of biomedical traits&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Mashaal Sohail as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission had agreed to reveal their identity: Genevieve L Wojcik.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that some conclusions and analyses need to revised as presented in light of our comments before it is published. We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is âin revision at <italic>eLife</italic>â. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper examines population structure in a Hispanic/Latino (H/L) cohort, first highlighting genetic diversity and fine-scale population substructure via UMAP. The paper highlights an interesting temporal aspect to population substructure in H/L groups, demonstrating increasing proportions of Amerindigenous ancestry, particularly in Mexican Americans, over time. They also provide other analyses that may help interpret or follow from this observation, involving genetic diversity, assortative mating and runs of homozygosity. They show a correlation between amerindigenous ancestry and complex traits, and show that the behavior of UKB height GWAS polygenic scores in Mexican-Americans depends on the proportion of Amerindigenous ancestry.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This paper's major finding is an observation of an increase in Amerindigenous ancestry in Mexican Americans in the 1940-1990 period. The manuscript is interesting and in theory suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but after a number of points are addressed. First, the authors need to articulate clearly the factors that may have caused this primary observation, and what may be the most likely explanations outlined below. Second, they need to address that the primary explanation for the ROH increase is likely the amerindigenous ancestry increase, and in that sense, determine and clearly articulate the place of the assortative mating observation in the manuscript. Lastly, they need to clearly admit in the manuscript the importance of the un-modelled socio-economic variable in the correlation between amerindigenous ancestry and complex traits, and only present this analysis after controlling for appropriate covariates. It is a time when we are finally seeing some population genetic studies of understudied populations as they relate to complex trait variation (to which this manuscript can be an important contribution), and so the bar to be as rigorous as possible in considering alternative explanations and model all possible covariates should be set extremely high.</p><p>1) The main finding is the increase in amerindigenous ancestry in the 1940 â 1990 period in Mexican-Americans in the United States.</p><p>a) The authors state: &quot;In our non-US born individuals (N=2987), we evaluated differences in ancestry estimates over time while accounting for years in the US and sampling weight and identified a significant effect of years in the US (ð½=-0.0009; P=0.0006; SE=0.0003).&quot; If I understand correctly, this regression is amerindigenous ancestry against time and other covariates. It would be helpful if the authors add to this sentence something along the lines of, &quot;implying that individuals who arrived earlier to the US from Mexico had more European ancestry.&quot;</p><p>b) Given the above analysis, and independent migration analyses (see, for example, https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/mexican-immigrants-united-states-2), it seems that migration from Mexico to the US shifted over the years from states with less amerindigenous ancestry to states with higher amerindigenous ancestry (Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz) in the South and South-east of the country. This seems a highly likely explanation for the pattern of increasing amerindigenous ancestry that they see, and should be stated as such in the manuscript. This seems especially likely given that the signal comes primarily from non-US born individuals, or US-born individuals with parents born outside the US.</p><p>c) The authors state that &quot;It is possible that the increase in global Amerindigenous ancestry over time could be biased by changes in the specific subcontinental Amerindigenous ancestries over time (though such an effect is not visible in our UMAP analysis, Figure 1B).&quot; â It is not clear what is meant by this sentence â please re-phrase and articulate more clearly. If it alludes to the difference in migration sources over time I mention above, I don't think their analyses of Fst and genetic diversity rule that explanation out.</p><p>d) Assortative mating (Figure 2D and Supplementary figure 9). This argument is puzzling because if there is assortative mating along indigenous ancestry as they suggest, then would this not mean that there is also assortative mating along the collinear European ancestry? If this is the case, why would amerindigenous ancestry be increasing in particular? The authors do state that assortative mating would not cause an increase in one ancestry. In that case, the paper overall does not provide an explanation for why the amerindigenous ancestry is actually increasing â is the migration sources explanation the most likely explanation? Along with that individuals with higher amerindigenous ancestry must be reproducing more? The likely explanations of the primary result should be made very clear for the reader.</p><p>e) The authors state: &quot;and this increase cannot be entirely explained by very recent migration.&quot; What is the evidence backing this claim?</p><p>f) &quot;sampling weight&quot; is not actually defined in the Materials and methods. Can the authors clarify how this is defined and used to weight the major analysis?</p><p>g) Please describe the bootstrap resampling performed â is the bootstrapping performed over individuals or segments of the genome? Please justify the strategy picked. This should be described in the manuscript.</p><p>2) The pattern of ROH change over time observed.</p><p>a) What are the number of individuals in each decade? Please show this in the manuscript. If there are more individuals in later birth decades (as may be expected), you would see an increase in the ROH summed over each genome with time, simply because you are summing over more individuals at later time periods. It is not clear if the analyses for Figure 2C are normalized by the number of individuals in each decade â if not, this would be important to do, and only the normalized results should be reported.</p><p>b) The ROHsum increasing with time could simply be due to the amerindigenous ancestry increasing with time, as amerindigenous ancestry carries more short ROH segments than European ancestry (see for example Ceballos et al. Nature Review Genetics 2018). The authors should explicitly describe this, as this simplest explanation would not require assortative mating to be invoked either.</p><p>3) Correlation of amerindigenous ancestry and complex traits</p><p>Many of the traits studied would also be affected by socioeconomic status (for example, height, cholesterol). Do the authors have this variable available? If yes, it should be included in the multiple regression. If not, it should be clearly mentioned that they are not able to account for this likely important effect, leaving their estimates confounded by socio-economic differences that likely correlate with amerindigenous ancestry. For Figure 3, we don't think it is fair to show tau between only amerindigenous ancestry and traits as this analysis does not account for important covariates, and would like to see Supplementary file 3 instead to replace Figure 3 (in a figure form as the authors prefer) such that only the multiple regression effect sizes are reported in the manuscript that account for covariates.</p><p>Why do a first pass of this analysis without covariates included, and then re-run with covariates in the Bonferroni significant subset of traits only? (Given that there will be confounding between Amerindigenous ancestry and socioeconomic, environmental and other non-genetic factors, and especially age). Furthermore, looking in the Materials and methods section, we cannot seem to find the full description of how this analysis was performed i.e. what models were run, and how/if phenotypic measures used were cleaned and normalized etc. Please provide this.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for the revised submission of your manuscript, now called &quot;Recent shifts in the genomic ancestry of Mexican Americans may alter the genetic architecture of biomedical traits.&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript is significantly improved, and the addition of the new simulation analyses greatly help in the interpretation of the trends that they see. The authors have sufficiently addressed concerns about two of their main results: (1) Interpretation of ancestry change over time and (2) Interpretation of ROH change over time. I still have the following points I would ask them to consider regarding their third main result (3) the potential effects of ancestry and ancestry change over time on the genetic architecture of complex traits, and to make appropriate additions/revisions to their analyses and text before submitting a revised manuscript. Beyond that, I see that the new simulation results don't appear in the manuscript until the Discussion. I would consider them a result and would like to see the authors try to integrate the main simulation results in the Results section, when they report their empirical observed patterns.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The authors state in the manuscript that, &quot;As illustrated in Figure 4A, 20 of these traits (29%) are significantly correlated after Bonferroni correction (P&lt;0.000145), highlighting the need for increased investigation into the role of AI genetic ancestry and other unmodelled socio-economic variables in admixed populations such as Mexican Americans.&quot; As written, it understates the correlation between AI ancestry and unmodelled socio-economic variables in the United States which we know exists on the basis of historical and social science research. Given this, I would like to see the text revised to say that it is not clear what the correlation with AI ancestry implies, and while it could be reflecting genetic effects, it can also be reflecting socio-economic variables that are correlated with AI ancestry and that AI ancestry could be serving as a proxy for. The authors themselves show that AI ancestry is correlated with educational attainment levels which they state is a proxy for socio-economic status. I would like to see their model for testing the effect of ancestry on traits include as covariates: (1) educational attainment as a proxy for socioeconomic status, (2) whether they are US born or not, and whether their parents are US born or not, to help capture the effects of different environments they would have been born in, and that their parents would have created for them on various levels. I would also encourage the authors to make their model as rich as possible by adding other environmental variables they could obtain on their recruitment sites (altitude, latitude, longitude, population density, average obesity rates to name some that are likely relevant). Ideally, this kind of analysis would be done in a mixed model framework as well, correcting for the full genomic relationship matrix, and adding a random effect to account for unaccounted for environmental factors, but they should at least add covariates to their multiple regression framework that they have access to, or could access. They should also consider issues of collinearity as they may affect their estimates and study and report the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) of the different variables. They should report in the manuscript, the results for the full model, giving coefficients and p-values for not only AI ancestry but also the other test variables, and should describe these in the results as well, and report and discuss the contribution of other test variables relative to AI ancestry as estimated from their model.</p><p>Further, the authors results show three observations that I would like to see described in the Results and discussed in the Discussion, as the implications are important. The authors observe an increase in height in Mexican Americans (at roughly the same rate in all amerindigenous ancestry stratifications, see note below) with birth year. First, they do not see any trend of the polygenic height score with birth year. This suggests that while the genetic predisposition of the trait remains the same, the trait has changed significantly due to non-genetic environmental factors. Second, even though amerindigenous ancestry is negatively correlated with height, and amerindigenous ancestry is increasing over time, the trait value/height increases rather than decreases over time. This also points to the effects of non-genetic factors playing an important role in values of the trait.</p><p>Lastly, if amerindigenous ancestry is negatively correlated with height due to genetic reasons, then shouldn't we expect to see the polygenic height score decrease with birth year, as amerindigenous ancestry increases with birth year? How do the authors interpret this meta pattern across their analyses, and what implications does it have for how temporal change in ancestry can alter the genetic architecture of traits? Overall, this could mean that (1) the correlation of amerindigenous ancestry with height is at least partly due to genetic reasons. Given that, while ancestry trends (AI ancestry increasing), combined with correlations of ancestry with traits, may make you predict one thing with respect to the genetic architecture of traits (height will decrease with birth year), the way heredity interacts with the environment through the randomness of development makes the trait move in the opposite direction than the model would predict. Or (2) the correlation of amerindigenous ancestry with height is fully picking a signal of height being lower in individuals with higher amerindigenous ancestry due to primarily environmental reasons, and therefore, as environment changes, the correlation is not meaningful for prediction. I would like to see the authors consider the above, and state these patterns as they stand across analyses, and discuss their implications for their overall thesis (as it relates to height and traits in general).</p><p>Note: They say in the study, &quot;We find a similar trend in the HCHS/SOL Mexican Americans (Figure 4B). Indeed, when we stratified individuals by quartiles of global AI ancestry, we see that all quartiles have increased in height by a similar amount over the period investigated.&quot; Can the authors make this statement more specific in the manuscript â what are the rates of change in the different quartiles? Are they higher in quartiles with higher indigenous ancestry?

In contrast, we find the opposite pattern when we perform the analogous analysis with European ancestry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last, they need to clearly admit in the manuscript the importance of the un-modelled socio-economic variable in the correlation between amerindigenous ancestry and complex traits, and only present this analysis after controlling for appropriate covariates.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the previous correlative analyses, and replaced them with a more thorough statistical analysis of AI ancestry with biomedical traits while controlling for several covariates. We now further discuss unmodelled socio-economic variables in the Results as well as Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is a time when we are finally seeing some population genetic studies of understudied populations as they relate to complex trait variation (to which this manuscript can be an important contribution), and so the bar to be as rigorous as possible in considering alternative explanations and model all possible covariates should be set extremely high.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that extreme care must be taken when studying marginalized populations, lest more harm may result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The main finding is the increase in amerindigenous ancestry in the 1940 â 1990 period in Mexican-Americans in the United States.</p><p>a) The authors state: &quot;In our non-US born individuals (N=2987), we evaluated differences in ancestry estimates over time while accounting for years in the US and sampling weight and identified a significant effect of years in the US (ð½=-0.0009; P=0.0006; SE=0.0003).&quot; If I understand correctly, this regression is amerindigenous ancestry against time and other covariates. It would be helpful if the authors add to this sentence something along the lines of, &quot;implying that individuals who arrived earlier to the US from Mexico had more European ancestry.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers understand correctly, and we have changed the sentence to reflect this: âIn our non-US born individuals (N=2987), we evaluated differences in ancestry estimates over time while accounting for years in the US and sampling weight and identified a significant effect of years in the US (ð½=-0.0009; P=0.0006; SE=0.0003) suggesting that individuals who arrived earlier to the US had less AI ancestry.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Given the above analysis, and independent migration analyses (see, for example, https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/mexican-immigrants-united-states-2) , it seems that migration from Mexico to the US shifted over the years from states with less amerindigenous ancestry to states with higher amerindigeous ancestry (Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz) in the South and South-east of the country. This seems a highly likely explanation for the pattern of increasing amerindigenous ancestry that they see, and should be stated as such in the manuscript. This seems especially likely given that the signal comes primarily from non-US born individuals, or US-born individuals with parents born outside the US.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to the conclusion âIndependent analyses have shown that migration from Mexico to the US has shifted over the years from states with less Amerindigenous ancestry to states with higher Amerindigenous ancestryâ and have cited the suggested reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors state that &quot;It is possible that the increase in global Amerindigenous ancestry over time could be biased by changes in the specific subcontinental Amerindigenous ancestries over time (though such an effect is not visible in our UMAP analysis, Figure 1B).&quot; â It is not clear what is meant by this sentence â please re-phrase and articulate more clearly. If it alludes to the difference in migration sources over time I mention above, I don't think their analyses of Fst and genetic diversity rule that explanation out.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence has been simplified to âWe next explored whether the increase in global Amerindigenous ancestry over time could be biased by local changes in the specific subcontinental Amerindigenous ancestries over time.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) Assortative mating (Figure 2D and Supplementary figure 9). This argument is puzzling because if there is assortative mating along indigenous ancestry as they suggest, then would this not mean that there is also assortative mating along the collinear European ancestry? If this is the case, why would amerindigenous ancestry be increasing in particular? The authors do state that assortative mating would not cause an increase in one ancestry. In that case, the paper overall does not provide an explanation for why the amerindigenous ancestry is actually increasing â is the migration sources explanation the most likely explanation? Along with that individuals with higher amerindigenous ancestry must be reproducing more? The likely explanations of the primary result should be made very clear for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Within Appendix 1, we have added new simulations that demonstrate how different factors such as population growth, migration, fecundity and assortative mating can shape differences in global ancestry patterns. According to the simulations, migration can have a large effect on shaping patterns of Amerindigenous ancestry, but other factors can shape these patterns as well. In particular, while assortative mating does not lead to differences in Amerindigenous ancestry over time on its own, assortative mating can amplify other factors (such as ancestry-related differences in fecundity). Given these simulations and the data we have analyzed, we argue that there is no single cause for the increased Amerindigenous ancestry over time. Rather, this increase is a result of all factors: migration, ancestry-related fecundity differences, ancestry-biased assortative mating, and population growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors state: &quot;and this increase cannot be entirely explained by very recent migration.&quot; What is the evidence backing this claim?</p></disp-quote><p>This is based on our analyses discussed in the âDynamic Global Ancestry Proportions in Mexican Americansâ section. Specifically starting with, âIn our non-US born individuals (N=2987), we evaluated differences in ancestry estimates over time while accounting for years in the US and sampling weight and identified a significant effect of years in the US (ð½=-0.0009; P=0.0006; SE=0.0003) suggesting that individuals who arrived earlier to the US had less Amerindigenous ancestry. However, this did not change the effect of birth year on the proportion of global Amerindigenous ancestry (ð½ = 0.0028; P&lt;2e-16, SE=0.0003).â To clarify the conclusion, we have rephrased the sentence: âand this increase cannot be entirely explained by very recent migration based on our analyses non-US born individuals &quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) &quot;Sampling weight&quot; is not actually defined in the Materials and methods. Can the authors clarify how this is defined and used to weight the major analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the definition of the sampling weight to the âStudy dataset and initial quality controlâ section within the Materials and methods and have cited the paper. Specifically, âThe sample survey for design for HCHS/SOL has been described previously. Briefly, census block groups were selected in defined communities near each of the four recruitment centers, and households were sampled within census block groups. Households with Hispanic/Latino surnames and individuals as well as residents over 45 years old were oversampled in order to increase representation of the Hispanic/Latino target population and achieve a uniform age distribution. Sampling weights were calculated for each individual to reflect the probability of sampling.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) Please describe the bootstrap resampling performed â is the bootstrapping performed over individuals or segments of the genome? Please justify the strategy picked. This should be described in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed bootstrap resampling over individuals and this has been further described in within the manuscript. Specifically, we now say âBootstrap analyses (Figure 2B and Figure 2âfigure supplement 3) were performed by calculating relevant statistics based on repeated resampling of individuals with replacement. Bootstrap resampling results in an estimate of the variance of the statistics that we are calculating in our data, and allows us to assess the impact of outliers (who are only resampled in a subset of iterations).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The pattern of ROH change over time observed.</p><p>a) What are the number of individuals in each decade? Please show this in the manuscript. If there are more individuals in later birth decades (as may be expected), you would see an increase in the ROH summed over each genome with time, simply because you are summing over more individuals at later time periods. It is not clear if the analyses for Figure 2C are normalized by the number of individuals in each decade â if not, this would be important to do, and only the normalized results should be reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary file 2. We have clarified within the figure captions that the ROH sums are ROH sums per person, but to address the below comment as well, we show the normalized data in Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The ROHsum increasing with time could simply be due to the amerindigenous ancestry increasing with time, as amerindigenous ancestry carries more short ROH segments than European ancestry (see for example Ceballos et al. Nature Review Genetics 2018). The authors should explicitly describe this, as this simplest explanation would not require assortative mating to be invoked either.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to this point that we missed in our original analysis. We have redone this analysis by normalizing the ROH sums per person by their global Amerindigenous ancestry. We redid the analyses with the normalized data and this is reflected now within the âIncreased runs of homozygosity over timeâ Results section including Figure 3C and Figure 3âfigure supplement 3. Our prior conclusion remains. ROH increases at a rate faster than the increase in Amerindigenous ancestry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Correlation of amerindigenous ancestry and complex traits</p><p>Many of the traits studied would also be affected by socioeconomic status (for example, height, cholesterol). Do the authors have this variable available? If yes, it should be included in the multiple regression. If not, it should be clearly mentioned that they are not able to account for this likely important effect, leaving their estimates confounded by socio-economic differences that likely correlate with amerindigenous ancestry. For Figure 3, we don't think it is fair to show tau between only amerindigenous ancestry and traits as this analysis does not account for important covariates, and would like to see supplementary file 3 instead to replace Figure 3 (in a figure form as the authors prefer) such that only the multiple regression effect sizes are reported in the manuscript that account for covariates.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers, our correlation analysis was too simplistic. As suggested, we have replaced this analysis with our multiple regression model that accounts for birth year, center, sex, and sampling weight (and included all regression statistics in Supplementary file 3). While some of the particular traits that are significant after Bonferroni correction changed slightly (we are now controlling for 5*69=345 tests instead of just 69), the overall conclusion remains: nearly 1/3 of the traits are correlated with genomic Amerindigenous ancestry. While we agree that socio-economic factors can have a direct impact on biomedical traits (and can also be correlated with Amerindigenous ancestry), HCHS/SOL did not collect this variable so we cannot include it in our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why do a first pass of this analysis without covariates included, and then re-run with covariates in the Bonferroni significant subset of traits only? (Given that there will be confounding between Amerindigenous ancestry and socioeconomic, environmental and other non-genetic factors, and especially age). Furthermore, looking in the Materials and methods section, we cannot seem to find the full description of how this analysis was performed i.e. what models were run, and how/if phenotypic measures used were cleaned and normalized etc. Please provide this.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are entirely correct, the first-pass correlative analysis was unwarranted. As discussed above, we replaced this analysis with the multiple regression model that accounts for birth year (e.g. age), center, sex, and sampling weight. To compare the effect of AI ancestry across traits, we quantile normalized all traits, and include a justification for our use of quantile normalization in the main text. We also compared the p-values for Amerindigenous ancestry effects across traits when the data were untransformed vs quantile normalized, and found a strong correlation (rho=0.944; p&lt;2.2e16) with no statistical evidence for a difference in the distributions of p-values (MannWhitney U test p-value=0.857).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript is significantly improved, and the addition of the new simulation analyses greatly help in the interpretation of the trends that they see. The authors have sufficiently addressed concerns about two of their main results: (1) Interpretation of ancestry change over time and (2) Interpretation of ROH change over time. I still have the following points I would ask them to consider regarding their third main result (3) the potential effects of ancestry and ancestry change over time on the genetic architecture of complex traits, and to make appropriate additions/revisions to their analyses and text before submitting a revised manuscript. Beyond that, I see that the new simulation results don't appear in the manuscript until the Discussion. I would consider them a result and would like to see the authors try to integrate the main simulation results in the Results section, when they report their empirical observed patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the overall positive sentiment of our revision, and the focus on what additional steps would further improve our manuscript. We have now moved the simulations from Appendix 1 to the main Results section. They are now discussed after the âStrong ancestry related assortative mating in HCHS/SOL Mexicansâ section and before the âGenetic association of global AI ancestry with biomedical traitsâ section. We hope our revisions on the potential effects of ancestry and ancestry change over time on the genetic architecture of complex traits section sufficiently address the requested revisions, as we describe further below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The authors state in the manuscript that, &quot;As illustrated in Figure 4A, 20 of these traits (29%) are significantly correlated after Bonferroni correction (P&lt;0.000145), highlighting the need for increased investigation into the role of AI genetic ancestry and other unmodelled socio-economic variables in admixed populations such as Mexican Americans.&quot; As written, it understates the correlation between AI ancestry and unmodelled socio-economic variables in the United States which we know exists on the basis of historical and social science research. Given this, I would like to see the text revised to say that it is not clear what the correlation with AI ancestry implies, and while it could be reflecting genetic effects, it can also be reflecting socio-economic variables that are correlated with AI ancestry and that AI ancestry could be serving as a proxy for.

As suggested, we added covariates for educational attainment, US born status, and number of US born parents in our multiple regression as these were the variables that we had access to. These results have been updated in Figure 4A, Supplementary file 3 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 3. Supplementary file 3 specifically includes the coefficients and p-values for all test variables for each trait. Here we have included a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) to illustrate the differences in the effect size of AI ancestry before and after the additional adjustments accounting for educational attainment, US born status and number of US born parents. Notably, there was very little change. This was in additional to the original adjustments of birthyear, gender, center, and sampling weight. However, even after accounting for these additional variables, the effect sizes of AI ancestry were largely unchanged (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>=</italic> 0.984, P&lt;2.2E-16). There was one trait (% Immature granulocytes) that changed from a negative association with AI ancestry to a positive association with AI ancestry, but the AI effect on this trait was not statistically significant before or after the addition of additional covariates.</p><p>We modified the above reviewer-quoted statement to âAs illustrated in Figure 4A, 18 of these traits (26%) are significantly associated with AI ancestry (Bonferroni correction P&lt;9.1E-5) after adjusting for several factors including birth year, educational attainment, US-born, and number of US-born parents. While this suggests that genetic ancestry has an effect on several traits, other unmodeled socio-economic variables that are correlated with AI ancestry may also be contributing to these patterns. Regardless, these findings highlight the need for increased investigation into the role of AI genetic ancestry in admixed populations such as Mexican Americans.â</p><p>We have included Supplementary file 3, which includes results for all phenotypes (raw and quantile normalized) with the effect size, SE, and P-value for each covariate.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56029-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the authors results show three observations that I would like to see described in the Results and discussed in the Discussion, as the implications are important. The authors observe an increase in height in Mexican Americans (at roughly the same rate in all amerindigenous ancestry stratifications, see note below) with birth year. First, they do not see any trend of the polygenic height score with birth year.

This also points to the effects of non-genetic factors playing an important role in values of the trait.</p></disp-quote><p>This is true. Both genetic and non-genetic factors drive variation in height. Height is estimated to have a broad-sense heritability of 80% in Northern European populations, suggesting that environmental factors explain ~20% of the variation in height in these populations. It is unclear how these estimates of heritability translate to Mexican Americans. Within the Discussion, we have elaborated further on this. We have added, âWhile height increases across all groups at a similar rate, illustrating the effects of nongenetic factors having an important role in the values of the trait, we do see differences based on percentage of AI ancestry. Individuals with lower percentages of AI ancestry were taller on average than individuals with higher AI ancestry pointing the role of AI ancestry on the trait.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last, if amerindigenous ancestry is negatively correlated with height due to genetic reasons, then shouldn't we expect to see the polygenic height score decrease with birth year, as amerindigenous ancestry increases with birth year? How do the authors interpret this meta pattern across their analyses, and what implications does it have for how temporal change in ancestry can alter the genetic architecture of traits? Overall, this could mean that (1) the correlation of amerindigenous ancestry with height is at least partly due to genetic reasons. Given that, while ancestry trends (AI ancestry increasing), combined with correlations of ancestry with traits, may make you predict one thing with respect to the genetic architecture of traits (height will decrease with birth year), the way heredity interacts with the environment through the randomness of development makes the trait move in the opposite direction than the model would predict. Or (2) the correlation of amerindigenous ancestry with height is fully picking a signal of height being lower in individuals with higher amerindigenous ancestry due to primarily environmental reasons, and therefore, as environment changes, the correlation is not meaningful for prediction. I would like to see the authors consider the above, and state these patterns as they stand across analyses, and discuss their implications for their overall thesis (as it relates to height and traits in general).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very complex issue, and we have attempted to be conservative in the way we describe these patterns. For example, Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 shows that there is indeed a slight negative overall trend for polygenic height score and birth year when we accounted for additional environmental variables including educational attainment, US born status and number of US born parents. The slope is not significant (P=0.14), so the approach we take is to not draw conclusions upon it. As a further point of clarification, PHS is only correlated with observed height in the bottom two quartiles of AI ancestry (i.e., only the Mexican Americans with highest European ancestry). As AI ancestry increases over time, we expect the performance of PHS to decrease. Such a decrease in accuracy could also manifest as an elimination of signal with birth-year.</p><p>It is possible we did not see a significant trend because the of the way the polygenic height score is calculated as a metric. As we know, the majority of GWASs have been performed in populations with primarily European ancestry thus providing insight into our understanding of the genetic architecture of height. However, due to the exclusion of diverse populations, we are still limited in our full understanding of the genetics of height.</p><p>A recent study of Peruvians (1) demonstrated the role of population specific variants and their contributions to differences in height. As we do not fully understand the genetics of height in Amerindigenous or admixed populations, it is possible there may be ancestral specific variants within the AI component in Mexicans. These variants may have a significant effect on the trait but these variants would not have been captured in the PHS as these GWAS results were derived from an analysis on European individuals.</p><p>Individuals with higher AI ancestry may harbor variants that may contribute more to differences in height that would not have been detected in a European GWAS. Even for Mexican individuals with higher European ancestry, they still may have variants within the AI component that could have a significant impact on the trait. However, these analyses exceed the limitations of the data available and are therefore outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Note: They say in the study, &quot;We find a similar trend in the HCHS/SOL Mexican Americans (Figure 4B).

While this suggests that genetic ancestry has an effect on several traits, other unmodeled socio-economic variables that are correlated with AI ancestry may also be contributing to these patterns (though AI ancestry has among the strongest effects on a range of biomedical traits, comparable to the effects of gender; Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). Regardless, these findings highlight the need for increased investigation into the role of AI genetic ancestry in admixed populations such as Mexican Americans.â</p><p>Within the Discussion, we have rephrased one of the sentences, âWe identify several biomedical traits that are associated with Amerindigenous ancestry, and show that in the case of height, there are both ancestry and temporal effectsâ to âWe identify several biomedical traits that are associated with Amerindigenous ancestry, with effects comparable to the high effects of gender, and show that in the case of height, there are both ancestry and temporal effects.â</p><p>We kept the new minor additions simple as we believe the sections in the Discussion that we had previously written about the importance of studying diverse populations are solid.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have the following sentence in their Discussion &quot;While height increases across all groups at a similar rate, illustrating the effects of non-genetic factors having an important role in the values of the trait, we do see differences based on percentage of AI ancestry.&quot; Given their new estimates of the rates of change in different groups the first part of this sentence needs to be revised.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded the sentence to âWhile we do see differences in mean height based on percentage of AI ancestry, height increases over time in all groups at similar rates.â We hope this clarifies that the âdifferences based on percentage of AI ancestryâ were referring to the mean heights for each group rather than the rates.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Asgari S, Luo Y, Akbari A, Belbin GM, Li X, Harris DN, et al.
