For instance, flies show differences in foraging behavior that depend on their larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sokolowski et al., 1984</xref>), fish internally modify their startle response across life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimmel et al., 1974</xref>) and stomatogastric motor patterns are regulated across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rehm et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, fear-extinction learning is inhibited during adolescence compared to other life stages in humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pattwell et al., 2012</xref>). Long-term behavioral outputs are influenced by the changes in the internal state of individuals, as well as by their past and current environmental exposures. In particular, animals may be transiently exposed to environmental perturbations at different stages of life, but experiences during early developmental windows, which are usually referred to as critical or sensitive periods, were shown to generate long-lasting effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lorenz, 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Korosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nevitt et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Remy and Hobert, 2005</xref>). This stable imprinting of early memories has the potential to increase survival and reproduction during later life stages of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Immelmann, 1975</xref>). However, a complete temporal view of the long-term effects of early experiences on behavior throughout development, across and within all stages, is still lacking.</p><p>While long-lasting effects on behavior may be shared by many individuals, reflected by stereotypic behavioral responses following an early-life experience, individuals within the same population may also show unique patterns of long-term behavior that distinguish them from each other. This inter-individual variation in behavioral responses may be exposed even when animals are initially experiencing the same early conditions. Here we study how early-life experiences shape stage-specific behavioral patterns across development and how they affect the diversity in long-term behavioral responses among individuals. Consistent behavioral individuality within isogenic populations that were raised in the same environment has been previously described in various species, including in the pea aphid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuett et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>), clonal fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bierbach et al., 2017</xref>), and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freund et al., 2013</xref>). The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is an ideal system to study how early-life experiences shape long-term behavior and inter-individual variation across developmental timescales due to their short development time of 2.5 days and the homogeneous populations generated by the self-fertilizing reproduction mode of the hermaphrodite. It was previously shown that under normal growth conditions, <italic>C. elegans</italic> shows both stereotypic patterns of long-term behavior and consistent individual biases within the isogenic population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>By continuously tracking the locomotory behavior of single individuals following transient periods of starvation early in life throughout their complete developmental trajectory, we show that early-life starvation exposes long-term behavioral plasticity that is discontinuous over development time. Temporal differences in long-term behavioral responses to early stress are reflected by strong behavioral modifications during early and late developmental stages and the buffering of behavioral effects during intermediate stages of development. We further found that dopamine maintains the buffering of behavioral responses during mid-development and serotonin promotes behavioral sensitivity to early starvation during early and late stages of development. Moreover, by performing unsupervised analysis of patterns of individual biases across development, we identified a spectrum of temporal individuality dimensions that are dominant within stressed and unstressed populations. Both the early-life history and neuromodulatory state of the population affect variation within specific individuality dimensions. These results show how a transient early-life environment shapes a long-term behavioral structure of stereotypic and variable responses across developmental stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Early-life stress generates discontinuous and distinct behavioral effects at different stages of development</title><p>To study how stressful environments early in life influence long-term behavioral patterns across and within all developmental stages we continuously tracked the behavior of individual animals following a transient period of starvation early in development. Imaging was performed using a custom-made multi-camera imaging system across the full developmental trajectory of <italic>C. elegans</italic> individuals (55 hr), at high spatiotemporal resolution (3 fps, ~10 µm) and in a tightly controlled environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). First larval stage (L1) animals that hatch into an environment that completely lacks a food source do not grow and their development is arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenwald and Horvitz, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baugh, 2013</xref>). Following L1 arrest, when animals encounter food, they resume their normal developmental trajectory to reach adulthood. This early-stress paradigm allows us to maintain a homogeneous stress environment across individuals at their earliest stage of development, immediately after hatching.</p><p>We continuously monitored single N2 wild-type individuals grown in isolation from their first larval stage to 16 hr of adulthood (<italic>n</italic> = 456) on defined concentrations of UV-killed OP50 bacteria, following periods of stress ranging from 1 to 4 days of early starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). In parallel, we tracked the behavior of individuals grown continuously on food, without experiencing starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Animals exposed to early starvation required more time to complete their development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To align developmental trajectories of different individuals in time, we age-normalized individuals by dividing each developmental stage, detected by the lethargus period during molting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cassada and Russell, 1975</xref>), into 75 time windows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). Whilst growing in a food environment, <italic>C. elegans</italic> shifts between two behavioral states called roaming and dwelling that last seconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben Arous et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujiwara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). During a roaming episode animals explore a large area by high-speed forward movements, while in the dwelling episode they show dramatically less exploration due to low-speed movements coupled with frequent reorientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We quantified long-term patterns of locomotory behavior shown by individuals throughout development by measuring two behavioral parameters: fraction of time spent roaming, and speed during roaming episodes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Long-term behavioral tracking of <italic>C.</italic> <italic>elegans</italic> following early starvation reveals discontinuous behavioral effects across developmental stages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Multi-camera imaging system allows longitudinal behavioral tracking of multiple individual worms across all stages of development following early L1 starvation and without starvation, under tightly controlled environmental conditions.

We found that a transient exposure to early-life starvation generates alterations in long-term behavioral patterns throughout development that were distinct and discontinuous across and within developmental stages. A short early-starvation period of 1 day strongly decreased average roaming activity levels during the L1 and adult stages compared to unstressed individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, while 1 day of early starvation modified within-stage temporal behavioral structures by shifting roaming activity peaks to later time windows during the L2 and L3 stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), average roaming activity was not decreased during these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, we found that average roaming activity level was also maintained during the L4 stage, following 1-day starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Interestingly, animals exposed to longer starvation periods of 3 and 4 days further showed strong roaming decrease during L1 and adulthood, but exhibited only minor effects on average roaming activity within the intermediate L2, L3, and L4 larval stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, while the average size of animals that experienced early starvation was slightly decreased (~10%), a comparison of starved and unstarved individuals within the same size range (size-matched) showed similar stage-specific effects on roaming activity during L1 and adulthood following early starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These results indicate that, while the memory of early starvation is maintained throughout development to expose strong decrease in average roaming behavior during L1 and adulthood, behavioral effects are buffered across intermediate development times.</p><p>Similar to the stage-specific effects of early starvation on the fraction of time spent roaming, instantaneous speed during roaming episodes in individuals exposed to early starvation was affected more strongly at the L1 and adult stages, compared to the intermediate stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In summary, transient early-life starvation discontinuously reshapes long-term behavioral patterns across development time by exposing strong behavioral alterations at early and late developmental stages and buffered effects during intermediate stages.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Unsupervised analysis uncovers multiple individuality dimensions within stressed and unstressed populations</title><p>The longitudinal measurements in single animals across development allow us to further quantify long-term inter-individual diversity within stressed and unstressed populations. Following early starvation, different individuals show substantial variation in long-term behavioral responses. For instance, during L1 and adulthood, a fraction of wild-type individuals that were exposed to early stress show 8- to 10-fold decrease in roaming activity relative to the average roaming level of the unstressed population, while other stressed individuals show roaming activity which is indistinguishable from unstressed animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Behavioral individuality is usually defined as a consistent tendency of an individual to show the same behavioral bias relative to the population across long time-periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bierbach et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchanan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuett et al., 2011</xref>). However, individuals may also show alternative patterns of temporal behavioral biases relative to the population that are not random and represent more complex structures of individual biases over time. Here, we extend the ‘classic’ analysis of individuality and ask if alternative individuality dimensions coexist within <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations across development.</p><p>To analyze long-term individual biases in behavior we first systematically rank individuals based on their roaming activity compared to all other individuals within the same experiment across developmental windows (50 time bins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>). The rank approach allows us to homogeneously compare between individuals at each developmental window. To take an unsupervised approach for detecting temporal patterns of individual biases that are dominant within stressed and unstressed populations we performed principal component analysis (PCA) of the temporal behavioral ranks of all wild-type individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 456). Following PCA, each individual within the population is represented by its score (value) in each of the PC dimensions. We identified statistically significant PC dimensions by comparing the variances in PC scores within each dimension to those obtained from PCA of a randomly shuffled rank dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or to score variances of a shuffled rank dataset within the same PCA space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Unsupervised analysis of temporal individuality dimensions across development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Individual animals are ranked based on their roaming activity in each time window compared to other individuals within the same experiment.

In this work, we studied how developmental patterns of behavior and inter-individual variation are dynamically affected by early-life starvation and the neuromodulatory pathways that organize these long-term behavioral responses. The effects of transient early experiences on neuronal and behavioral states during specific developmental stages were studied across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horn, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimmel et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamori et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pradhan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Remy and Hobert, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilson and Sullivan, 1994</xref>). However, how transient environmental experiences early in development continuously reshape behavior throughout the full developmental trajectory of the organism is unknown.</p><p>Here, we utilized long-term behavioral tracking systems at high spatiotemporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>) to analyze and compare long-term alterations of behavioral patterns across and within all developmental stages of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, following transient periods of starvation early in life. As our early starvation paradigm, we let animals hatch into an environment that completely lacks a food source, which leads to developmental arrest during the L1 stage. The L1 arrest state is distinct from the dauer state which is an alternative developmental stage to L3, generated by a combination of environmental stimuli such as overcrowding or limited food availability.</p><p>Our results show that early L1 starvation induces stage-specific behavioral responses that are discontinuous across development, manifested by stronger decrease in roaming activity during early and late stages, compared to intermediate developmental stages. These variable influences of early starvation across development time suggest that while the memory of early experiences is maintained to adulthood, behavioral changes are buffered during mid-development.</p><p>As imprinting of early memories was shown to have an adaptive value for later stages of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Immelmann, 1975</xref>), we hypothesized that neuronal mechanisms actively buffer behavioral alterations at specific development times so as to support the exploratory activity of individuals during critical developmental windows. Building on this idea, we further analyzed the contribution of neuromodulatory pathways for shaping the stage-specific patterns of behavioral responses across development. Neurotransmitters and hormones were shown to regulate behavioral patterns across development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sisk and Foster, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Truman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wigglesworth, 1936</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Park and Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rehm et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> populations grown continuously on food, neuromodulators show both consistent and time-dependent behavioral effects at specific developmental windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). We found that following early transient stress, dopamine and serotonin control of long-term behavioral responses are opposite and temporally segregated over development time. Dopamine was required for behavioral buffering during intermediate developmental stages and serotonin established behavioral responses to early stress during early and late developmental stages. In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> dopamine is produced in four pairs of neurons: CEPV, CEPD, ADE, and PDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sulston et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lints and Emmons, 1999</xref>) and was shown to be required for controlling locomotory patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Omura et al., 2012</xref>) and coupling of behavioral programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cermak et al., 2020</xref>). In particular, dopamine was shown to decrease the instantaneous speed of worms grown on food, compared to non-food environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sawin et al., 2000</xref>). We found that following early-life starvation, dopamine is required for buffering roaming decrease during intermediate developmental stages. These diverse behavioral effects on different locomotory parameters suggest that dopamine function is variable under different environmental contexts and at different timescales.</p><p>By analyzing single dopamine receptors (DOP-1, DOP-2, and DOP-3), we found that their functions are differentially distributed during intermediate developmental stages. We further found that a combination of multiple dopamine receptors is required for establishing behavioral buffering across all intermediate developmental stages (L2–L4). The modular regulation by each of the receptors and their cooperative function imply that dopamine receptors’ temporal requirement may be super-imposed in time to mediate buffering of behavioral responses at specific developmental windows. Interestingly, the expression patterns of the three dopamine receptors within the <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system are partially overlapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsalik et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chase et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanyal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suo et al., 2003</xref>), raising the possibility that different subnetworks within the nervous system function to temporally regulate behavioral buffering across development. Similarly, the function of serotonin receptors in maintaining patterns of roaming activity in unstressed individuals was also shown to be modular across developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a common principle of temporal regulation of behavior by neuromodulatory receptors.</p><p>In contrast to dopamine function during intermediate developmental stages, we showed that serotonin promotes behavioral responses to early stress during L1 and adulthood. Under normal growth conditions, serotonin is known to regulate roaming behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> across all developmental stages, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flavell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>) and is required for long- and short-term associative olfactory memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). In rodents, serotonin and dopamine interact to establish motor patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki-Adams and Kelley, 2001</xref>). It is plausible that the complexity of long-term behavioral responses to early stress reflects a time integration of the function of multiple neuromodulators, each of them acting at different development times and with different intensity.</p><p>Long-term individuality in behavior is observed across species, even within genetically identical populations that were raised in the same environment. However, the effects of early stressful experiences on patterns of individual biases within isogenic populations are less explored. The long-term behavioral tracking of single animals allowed us to ask how early-life stress modifies patterns of inter-individual behavioral variation and whether neuromodulation controls the structure of individuality under stress. Individuality is classically defined as the tendency of an individual to show the same behavioral bias relative to the population over long timescales. We hypothesized that within isogenic populations, individuals may show alternative modes of temporal behavioral biases across development that are not random and represent alternative individuality dimensions.</p><p>By using an unbiased approach of dimensionality reduction, we found multiple individuality dimensions that coexist within stressed and unstressed populations. While the main PC1 individuality dimension recaptured a known individuality dimension of consistent individual biases over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>), other PCs identified alternative individuality dimensions that are significant within populations and represent individuals that show switching of behavioral bias, relative to the population, at specific developmental times. These results further extend the view of long-term behavioral individuality, implying a wide spectrum of alternative individual biases within populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Werkhoven et al., 2021</xref>). A plausible explanation for the coexistence of multiple individuality dimensions is that, upon stress or another unpredictable environment, it will be beneficial for the population to dynamically reshape the variation across a spectrum of individuality dimensions so as to modify individual strategies and increase the population’s chance of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper and Kaplan, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Honegger and de Bivort, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Neuromodulation was previously shown to affect levels of consistent individual biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Honegger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pantoja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>). We tested how early-life experiences and neuromodulation shape the identified individuality dimensions across development. Interestingly, we found that inter-individual variation in specific dimensions depends on both the early experience of the population and its neuromodulatory state. An open question is what are the sources of variation within the nervous system that give rise to variation across different individuality dimensions? Underlying differences among individuals may include diversity in gene-expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Casanueva et al., 2012</xref>), nervous system structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Witvliet et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brittin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linneweber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churgin et al., 2021</xref>), and underlying persistent differences in neuromodulatory parameters that have phenotypic effects under specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marder et al., 2022</xref>). It is plausible that some of this variation, which is partially stochastic by nature, may generate different behavioral biases of individuals within isogenic populations. While we quantify proportional behavioral effects in neuromodulatory mutants following starvation, relative to the baseline levels in the unstarved population, these behavioral effects may potentially reflect a more complicated interaction between neuromodulation and stress, altering baseline levels and deviations from baseline. More generally, taking into consideration the complex relationship between different effects within a non-linear system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Félix and Barkoulas, 2015</xref>), part of the temporal- or inter-individual variation in behavior may not directly rely on differences in neuromodulatory states over time or across individuals, but rather on the modification of behavioral sensitivity to underlying variations by specific neuromodulatory and environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maloney, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The behavioral patterns explored in this study represent only a small fraction of the behavioral space available to the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahamed et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Perona, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and de Bivort, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, while we were able to extract behavioral changes in specific roaming parameters across all developmental stages, the lower spatial imaging resolution during the L1 stage may limit our ability to detect smaller modifications in behavior during this stage. We anticipate that an extended supervised and unsupervised behavioral classification across development will shed light on the overall reorganization of individuality dimensions and the contribution of both internal neuronal states and external environments to the diversity in long-term behavioral structures within populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth conditions and starvation protocol</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> worms were maintained on NGM agar plates, supplemented with <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 bacteria as a food source.

For each developmental stage, we examined the two-dimensional probability distribution of the whole population and changed the slope of the diagonal to classify roaming and dwelling appropriately (slopes: 5, 2.5, 2.3, 2, and 1.5 for the L1, L2, L3, L4, and adult stages, respectively). Based on these roaming and dwelling classifications we further quantified the average instantaneous speed of the animal during roaming episodes (μm/s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Unsupervised quantification of temporal individuality dimensions</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Ranking and behavioral bias</title><p>Individuals within the population were ranked based on their roaming behavior in 50 time bins (10 per stage), relative to the population measured within the same experiment.

This test identifies which PCs account for a higher fraction of variance than expected by chance. Inter-individual variance in each PC score was calculated as a dispersal parameter of the population for each PC individuality dimension. These score variances were compared to the same-numbered PC in each shuffled dataset in two ways: (1) by performing PCA on the shuffled dataset and computing PC scores of the shuffled dataset in its PCA space and (2) by computing PC scores of the shuffled dataset in the PCA space of the original dataset.</p><p>To quantify significant differences in PC score inter-individual variance between conditions, we used a permutation test where individuals in each pair of conditions were randomly reassigned to two populations of the same size. Significance values were computed from 1000 such reassignments for each pair of conditions. The test was repeated multiple times to verify the robustness of the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>Quantification of individual consistency index</title><p>Individuals within the population were ranked based on their behavior in 50 time bins (10 per stage). We then quantified the homogeneous consistent bias in the individual’s behavior relative to the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stern et al., 2017</xref>) by calculating for each individual the log<sub>2</sub>(number of time bins in which the individual’s roaming fraction is higher than the population median/number of time bins in which the individual’s roaming fraction is lower than the population median) (consistency index). This measure gives positive values to individuals that tend to have positive bias (higher than median roaming fraction) across time, negative values to individuals that tend to have negative bias across time, and values close to 0 for individuals that do not show any bias toward higher or lower roaming fraction. Inter-individual variance in consistency index was calculated as a dispersal parameter of the population which indicates the overall consistent behavioral bias in the population. To quantify significant differences in inter-individual variance of behavioral consistency between conditions, we used a permutation test, as used for comparing variance of PC scores (see ‘Identification of temporal bias patterns’).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of worm size</title><p>To measure the worm’s size in each frame, a cropped image of size 151 by 151 pixels around the detected center of mass was used.

While this provides a good basis to address how early life experience may shape development, the authors stopped shortly of deeper mechanistic investigations such as the critical tissue/cell types of dopamine/serotonin's effects as well as the temporal windows of their necessity/sufficiency. For example, the authors can conduct cell-specific rescue/depletion experiments of cat-2/dop-2/dop-3 to address the spatial requirement/necessary circuit for dopamine, while supplementation or AID (auxin-induced degron) experiments can address the temporal requirement of dopamine/serotonin. These results will provide deeper mechanistic insights and a better understanding of how these neurotransmitter systems contribute to the effects of early-life starvation on roaming behavior.</p><p>2) The study largely focuses on a single aspect of behavior: roaming vs. dwelling. How early starvation affects this one behavior parameter and how dopamine/serotonin play a role in it may not be broadly applicable to other behavioral parameters. This was even demonstrated in the manuscript itself, as the authors also looked another related behavioral parameter, speed during roaming, and found different effects of early-life starvation and of dopamine/serotonin on this parameter compared to their effects of average roaming fraction (most prominently demonstrated in Figures S4D vs. C and S7C vs B, but also in Figures S1E vs D and S3C vs. B). The authors are using a very unique technique to be able to capture the entirety of the animal's development, and there are likely many other parameters that can be extracted from this valuable resource. The examination of many different parameters will lead to a better overall picture of how behavior is influenced by early life experiences.</p><p>3) There are some confounding factors/technical limitations that are not considered or clearly presented in the manuscript that may alter overall interpretation of the data/conclusions.</p><p>a. It is unclear from the current presentation of data that the authors have sufficient resolution to accurately calculate the behavioral parameters of younger, smaller worms, particularly those at the L1 stage. This was evident in the authors' own data that cat-2 mutation did not increase the speed of the L1 worms but at all other stages, and could be as a result of decreased sensitivity/resolution at this stage. The authors should provide evidence that their analysis provides sufficient resolution to measure behavioral features of L1 animals by comparing their analysis/results to more high resolution approaches to validate some of their results. For example, control and cat-2 mutant L1 in their approach vs. a higher resolution approach.</p><p>b. Somewhat related to a, the animals change dramatically in size from L1 to the adult stage. This was not taken into account of the calculation of roaming vs. dwelling behavior. Does altered size affect roaming vs dwelling behavior? If so, does starvation and dopamine/serotonin affect size of the animals at different stages, and does this fully or partially explain their effects on roaming/dwelling behavior? The authors should be able to extract length/width data from their recordings and address these questions. This would significantly affect the interpretation of the current manuscript.</p><p>4) By the title and abstract of the manuscript, the authors promises to answer the question of how early life starvation affects individuality. However, there is no clear presentation/conclusion in the text/figures of how early life stress affect individuality. For example, are there more/less variation across different principal components after early-life starvation as shown in Figure 2/S2? Rather the authors focused on how dopamine/serotonin affect individually, which was already previous reported in a previous manuscript (Stern et al., 2017). The authors already have many of these analyses presented in the current manuscript (Figure 2, 6, S2, S8), but need to directly compare whether starvation affects variation/individuality in roaming behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84312.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers find your paper to be interesting and a potentially valuable contribution to the field.

In fact, in the discussion we clearly note that the behavioral parameters that we quantified in this study represent only a subset of the behavioral repertoire available to the organism. While quantifying how the full behavioral space across development may be modified under different experiences and neuromodulatory states is not the current focus of this study, it is a major long-term theoretical/computational research direction in our lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are some confounding factors/technical limitations that are not considered or clearly presented in the manuscript that may alter overall interpretation of the data/conclusions.</p><p>a. It is unclear from the current presentation of data that the authors have sufficient resolution to accurately calculate the behavioral parameters of younger, smaller worms, particularly those at the L1 stage.

For example, control and cat-2 mutant L1 in their approach vs. a higher resolution approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly states that lower spatial resolution in younger L1 worms may potentially limit the ability to detect small behavioral changes. However, using our imaging system, we were able to extract multiple behavioral effects in L1 individuals, such as an increase in roaming activity and roaming speed during L1 in <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants, respectively (this paper and Stern et al. 2017), and a decrease in roaming activity during L1 following starvation (this paper). However, we agree with the reviewer that it is possible that milder/smaller behavioral effects may be harder to detect. We have now added a statement about this spatial resolution limitation in the discussion (p. 16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Somewhat related to a, the animals change dramatically in size from L1 to the adult stage. This was not taken into account of the calculation of roaming vs. dwelling behavior. Does altered size affect roaming vs dwelling behavior? If so, does starvation and dopamine/serotonin affect size of the animals at different stages, and does this fully or partially explain their effects on roaming/dwelling behavior? The authors should be able to extract length/width data from their recordings and address these questions. This would significantly affect the interpretation of the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>For quantifying roaming vs. dwelling episodes during different developmental stages in which animals have different sizes we used a calibrated parameter of roaming/dwelling threshold that is specific to each developmental stage (methods section of this paper and of Stern et al. 2017) and that we found to robustly define roaming episodes across different developmental stages. In addition, in the revised manuscript we include new analyses of size and roaming/speed data in single animals (based on individual size extracted from images) and compare behavior across size-matched individuals (within the same size window) across conditions/genotypes. In particular, these analyses show that while the average size in the starved populations is slightly decreased (~10%), size matched individuals across conditions/genotypes (within the same size range) show similar stage-specific behavioral effects to the ones shown using a comparison of the whole population (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1F; Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D; Figure 5 —figure supplement 1D). Furthermore, these analyses demonstrate, as previously shown, an increase in roaming fraction in sized-matched <italic>tph-1</italic> individuals compared to wild-type (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1B), as well as an increase in roaming speed in the L2-Adult stages in size-matched <italic>cat-2</italic> individuals compared to wild-type (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) By the title and abstract of the manuscript, the authors promises to answer the question of how early life starvation affects individuality. However, there is no clear presentation/conclusion in the text/figures of how early life stress affect individuality. For example, are there more/less variation across different principal components after early-life starvation as shown in Figure 2/S2? Rather the authors focused on how dopamine/serotonin affect individually, which was already previous reported in a previous manuscript (Stern et al., 2017). The authors already have many of these analyses presented in the current manuscript (Figure 2, 6, S2, S8), but need to directly compare whether starvation affects variation/individuality in roaming behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As the reviewer suggested, in the revised manuscript we include a systematic and direct comparison of inter-individual variation between stressed and unstressed populations across multiple PC individuality dimensions. These analyses directly show modifications in inter-individual variation in specific PC individuality dimensions (PC1, PC3, PC6) following early-life stress, within wild-type and neuromodulatory mutant populations (Figure 6; Figure 6 —figure supplement 1). In addition, we also made textual edits (abstract and main text, p. 11-12) to provide clearer description of the effects of early-life stress on variation in specific PC dimensions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
