Here, we found that targeted disruption of the entire <italic>Cables2</italic> locus (<italic>Cables2d</italic>) caused growth retardation and enhanced apoptosis at the gastrulation stage and then induced embryonic lethality in mice. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed disruption of <italic>Cables2</italic>, 50% down-regulation of <italic>Rps21</italic> abutting on the <italic>Cables2</italic> locus, and up-regulation of p53-target genes in <italic>Cables2d</italic> gastrulas. We further revealed the lethality phenotype in <italic>Rps21</italic>-deleted mice and unexpectedly, the exon 1-deleted <italic>Cables2</italic> mice survived. Interestingly, chimeric mice derived from <italic>Cables2d</italic> ESCs carrying exogenous <italic>Cables2</italic> and tetraploid wild-type embryo overcame gastrulation. These results suggest that the diminished expression of <italic>Rps21</italic> and the completed lack of <italic>Cables2</italic> expression are intricately involved in the embryonic lethality via the p53 pathway.

The ICM is characterized as pluripotent stem cells, from which the epiblast and primitive endoderm are derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chazaud et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Kaufman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rossant et al., 2003</xref>). Epiblast cells give rise to all cell types of the fetal tissues. The primitive endoderm produces the visceral endoderm (VE) extraembryonic yolk sac lining. Following implantation, Wnt, Nodal, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways are essential and coordinately control formation of the proximal–distal (P–D) axis during the egg cylinder stage and the subsequent conversion of this axis into the anterior–posterior (A–P) axis early in gastrulation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkell and Tam, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robertson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ten Berge et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Winnier et al., 1995</xref>). Nodal and Wnt activity levels are dependent upon the BMP pathway interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robertson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tam and Loebel, 2007</xref>). The epiblast undergoes rapid cell proliferation and is sensitive to DNA damage, which may lead to p53-dependent checkpoint activation and result in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heyer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kojima et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Farrell et al., 2004</xref>). The primitive streak is formed by regional regulated expression of lineage-specific markers including <italic>Brachyury</italic> (<italic>T)</italic> and <italic>Wnt3</italic> via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, to initiate the gastrulation stage. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rivera-Pérez and Magnuson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tam et al., 2006</xref>). While some murine axis and gastrulation signaling events are known, many other processes remain undiscovered.</p><p>Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 1 (Cables1, also known as ik3-1) founded the Cables protein family, each member of which has a C-terminal cyclin box-like domain. Cables1 physically interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), Cdk3, Cdk5, and c-Abl molecules, and is phosphorylated by Cdk3, Cdk5, and c-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsuoka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamochi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zukerberg et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, in primary cortical neurons, c-abl phosphorylation of Cables1 augments tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk5 to promote neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zukerberg et al., 2000</xref>). Cables1 also functions as a bridging factor linking Robo-associated Abl and the N-cadherin-associated β-catenin complex in chick neural retina cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rhee et al., 2007</xref>). Notably, <italic>Cables1</italic>-null mice show increased cellular proliferation resulting in endometrial hyperplasia, colon cancer, and oocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirley et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zukerberg et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, the corpus callosum development in mice may rely on a dominantly acting, truncated version of Cables1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mizuno et al., 2014</xref>). During zebrafish development, <italic>Cables1</italic> is required for early neural differentiation and its loss subsequently causes apoptosis of brain tissue and behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groeneweg et al., 2011</xref>). Zebrafish have only one Cables gene (Cables1), whereas the mouse and human genomes contain the paralogue, Cables2 (also known as ik3-2). The C-terminal cyclin-box-like region of Cables1 and Cables2 share a high degree of similarity. Cables2 has been shown to physically associate with Cdk3, Cdk5, and c-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sato et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, forced expression of Cables2 induced apoptotic cell death in both a p53-dependent manner and a p53-independent manner in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuoka et al., 2003</xref>). In human, CABLES2 was recently found as a new susceptibility gene or tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo et al., 2021</xref>).

We demonstrated that <italic>Cables2</italic> is expressed widely during early embryonic development and full <italic>Cables2</italic> locus deletion caused defective PS formation, increased apoptotic cells, growth retardation, and post-gastrulation embryonic lethality. Many other mouse mutants with impaired A–P axis or PS formation either become highly dysmorphic or complete gastrulation without growth retardation but exhibit patterning defects. The divergent phenotype resulting from entire <italic>Cables2</italic> deletion suggests multiple faulty processes during early mouse development. Further, transcriptome profiling comparison showed <italic>Cables2</italic> and <italic>Rps21</italic> impairments enhanced Wnt and p53 signaling pathways, possibly contributing to peri-gastrulation arrest in entire locus <italic>Cables2d</italic> embryos. Notably, the heterozygous <italic>Rps21<sup>+/d</sup></italic> mice showed the semidominant <italic>Bst</italic> phenotype and almost died before two months old and no homozygous mutants were obtained, indicating embryonic lethality. The deletion of exclusive <italic>Cables2</italic> by removing critical exon one in <italic>Cables2<sup>e1</sup></italic> model resulted in live and fertile mice versus the lethal phenotype of entire locus <italic>Cables2d</italic> mice. However, the tetraploid complementation experiments demonstrated that the A–P axis was formed normally with the wild-type VE and trophoblast compartment, and the growth retardation in the epiblast can be rescued by overexpressing Cables2. Thus, the <italic>Cables2/Rps21</italic>-impaired genotype is lethal during gastrulation, and novel interaction of Cables2 with Wnt/β-catenin and p53 pathways can rescue mouse development.</p><p>Importantly, lack of <italic>Cables2</italic> transcription itself does not disrupt gastrulation in mice, as <italic>Cables2<sup>e1/e1</sup></italic> mice survive. Conventional full gene locus deletion may affect <italic>Rps21</italic> located in the proximity. Diminished expression of <italic>Rps21</italic> was observed when the entire <italic>Cables2</italic> locus was deleted. <italic>Rps21</italic> belongs to the ribosome family. In mammals, the ribosome family includes 79–80 ribosomal proteins and four ribosomal RNAs that play a vital role in ribosome biogenesis, a fundamental process for cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maguire and Zimmermann, 2001</xref>). Ribosomal proteins function not only in protein synthesis but also in genetic diseases and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lai and Xu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Some ribosomal proteins are demonstrated in vivo as necessary factors for mouse development such as <italic>Rplp1, Rpl24, Rpl38, Rps3,</italic> and <italic>Rps6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondrashov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oliver et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Panić et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perucho et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, <italic>Rps21</italic> was described as a human oncogene, especially in prostate cancer and osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arthurs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, Rps21 in vivo function remains unknown. Our results revealed that the <italic>Rps21</italic> mutant model showed the semidominant phenotype of pleiotropic abnormality including postnatal lethality. This study is the first report of <italic>Rps21d</italic> mouse and describe the essential function of Rps21 for pre- and post-natal development in mice.</p><p>We found upregulation of p53 signaling pathway-related genes, such as <italic>Ccng1</italic>, <italic>Trp53inp1</italic> and <italic>Cdkn1a</italic>, in full locus <italic>Cables2d</italic> gastrulas that accompanied with decreased expression of <italic>Rps21</italic>. The transcription factor p53 is well-known to function in DNA damage responses and tumor suppression in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zilfou and Lowe, 2009</xref>). P53 activates checkpoint regulation in ribosomal protein deficiency, rather than ribosome dysfunction. Interestingly, genetic deletion of p53 can rescue the lethal <italic>Rps6</italic> phenotype. The <italic>Rps6</italic> haploinsufficiency embryo exhibited peri-gastrulation lethality after E5.5 but can be rescued until E12.5 by genetic inactivation of p53 (Panic, et al., 2006). As mentioned before, heterozygous mutation in the <italic>Rpl24</italic> gene causes the <italic>Bst</italic> phenotype. Homozygous <italic>Rpl24</italic> deficiency shows early embryonic lethality. The abnormal postnatal phenotypes are largely caused by the aberrant up-regulation of p53 protein expression during embryonic development including the gastrulation stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barkić et al., 2009</xref>). These reports support that diminished expression of <italic>Rps21</italic> attenuates embryonic growth by reinforced induction of p53-dependent checkpoint response in entire locus <italic>Cables2d</italic> mice.</p><p>Heterozygous deficiency of <italic>Rps21</italic> showed the <italic>Bst</italic> phenotype similar to that of <italic>Rpl24</italic>, but not that of <italic>Rps6</italic>. Interestingly, although expression of <italic>Rps21</italic> was maintained at a half level in <italic>Cables2d</italic> gastrulas compared with wild-type gastrulas, they caused early embryonic lethality that was different abnormality from heterozygous <italic>Rps21d</italic> mice. Further, we generated <italic>Cable2<sup>d/e1</sup></italic> mutant embryos by intercrossing between <italic>Cables2<sup>+/d</sup></italic> and <italic>Cables2<sup>+/e1</sup></italic>. The compound <italic>Cable2<sup>d/e1</sup></italic> embryos showed normal development by E9.5 with Mendelian ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) and maintained at approximately 75% on expression levels of <italic>Rps21</italic>, suggesting that a threshold level of <italic>Rps21</italic> expression is required for early mouse embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, it is thought that phenotype discrepancy between <italic>Cables2<sup>d/d</sup></italic> and <italic>Rps21<sup>+/d</sup></italic> would be attributed to the complete loss of Cables2 function, in addition to the hypofunction of Rps21. Actually, the impaired <italic>Rps21/Cables2</italic> epiblast can be rescued and developed to the early organogenesis period through the gastrulation stage by inducting ubiquitous overexpression of exogenous <italic>Cables2</italic> throughout embryonic development. Therefore, our results imply that Cables2 itself could play the role of fetal growth by resisting activation of p53 signaling pathway which results from a decrease in Rps21.</p><p>Genetic experiments that ablate <italic>Wnt3</italic> activity in either the VE or epiblast alone (and therefore reduce overall posterior Wnt signal) have shown that this activity regulates the timing of PS formation. Embryos in which VE <italic>Wnt3</italic> function is ablated have delayed primitive streak formation but by E9.5 are indistinguishable from wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoon et al., 2015</xref>). When <italic>Wnt3</italic> function is removed from the epiblast, PS formation is delayed and by mid-gastrulation the embryos are highly dysmorphic with the PS bulging toward the amniotic cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tortelote et al., 2013</xref>). In entire locus <italic>Cables2d</italic> embryos, the WISH analysis with gastrulation markers showed that PS formation is retarded or delayed at gastrulation initiation with the reducing of <italic>Wnt3</italic> expression and activity. However, the cellular apoptosis was increased afterward and caused the growth failure. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>, TUNEL-positive cells were abundantly observed in the epiblast of <italic>Cables2d</italic> embryos at E7.5, but not in the visceral endodermal cells. The result suggests that diminished Wnt/β-catenin signaling with <italic>Cables2</italic> deficiency might be involved in retardation of AVE and/or PS formation rather than diminished level of Rps21. In addition, Rps21 expression is not reported in embryo endoderm and mesoderm by MGI database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org">http://www.informatics.jax.org</ext-link>), further supporting our hypothesis.</p><p>Cables1 is widely studied in cancer research. It is generally thought that <italic>Cables1</italic> is a tumor suppressor gene. Loss of Cables1 expression is found with high frequency in human cancer such as lung, colon, ovarian, and endometrial cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnason et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirley et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirley et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zukerberg et al., 2004</xref>). In mouse model, genetic inactivation of <italic>Cables1</italic> leads to an increased incident of endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zukerberg et al., 2004</xref>) and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnason et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirley et al., 2005a</xref>). <italic>Cables1</italic>-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblast cells exhibit an increased growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirley et al., 2005b</xref>). Further, Cables2 shows involvement of in both p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic pathway by using in vitro analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsuoka et al., 2003</xref>). Given that Cables family share the identity of amino acid more than 70% at C-ter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sato et al., 2002</xref>), although we expected that Cables2 may have similar function with Cables1 in mouse and human, the present study provided us controversial observation on the physiological role of Cables2. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2015</xref> reported that Akt (Ser/Thr kinase)-phosphorylation-mediated 14-3-3 binding prevents the apoptosis-inducing function of Cables1 for cell growth. Emerging evidence reveals that Cables1 can interact with a variety of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnason et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirley et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirley et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zukerberg et al., 2004</xref>). Cables1 changes physiological phase dependent on counter partner protein. This study also demonstrated that Cables2 physically interacted with β-catenin. Moreover, we are understanding that Cables2 has the ability to physically interact with one kind of self renewal/pluripotent factor in vitro (data not shown). Therefore, it seems that Cables family protein is a signaling hub for the regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth, cell death and differentiation. However, how Cables2 controls temporal, spatial and physical interaction in vivo for resisting p53 signaling pathway during gastrulation remains unknown and needs further investigation.</p><p>Lastly, this study highlights the need to validate target knock-out genes as well as nearby genes in lethal phenotypes. In conclusion, our results suggest that <italic>Rps21</italic> expression is essential for gastrulation and <italic>Cables2</italic> assists it in case of decreased ribosomal biogenesis, via an unknown mechanism. Furthermore, Cables2 functions together with Wnt/β-catenin and p53 pathways in early embryonic development. These novel interactions should be expanded in future studies to give insight into the function of the Cables protein family and uncover additional roles for this protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

embryonic development via the p53 pathway, is detailed and well-executed and brings diverse genetic and genomic evidence to bear on the mechanism of action of a locus with previously confusing knockout phenotypes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;<italic>Cables2</italic> is a novel Smad2-regulatory factor essential for early embryonic development in mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Eisen as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Isabelle Migeotte (Reviewer #2).</p><p>This manuscript describes the phenotype of Cables2 (Cdk5 and Abl enzyme substrate 2) mutant embryos. Cables2 is a mammal-specific protein that belongs to the Cables family whose members have a C-terminal cyclin box-like domain, and whose founding member, Cables1, is known for interacting with cyclin-dependant kinases. Cables1 deficient mice have a rather mild phenotype related to cellular proliferation in distinct organs. Cables2 deficient mutants have a much more severe phenotype as embryos arrest around E7.5 and die at mid-gestation with peri-gastrulation abnormalities.</p><p>The results are well documented, and the reviewers point to several important claims, including a completely new gene essential for early patterning, novel mechanistic insights into integration of TGF-β and Wnt signalling in the early embryo</p><p>However the reviewers feel some additional validation studies are needed, and point to an aspect of the phenotyping that was possibly misinterpreted leading to erroneous conclusions.</p><p>Specifically, the review raised the concern that the phenotype of Cables2 mutant embryos is likely the result of improper development of the conceptus brought about by defects in cell proliferation. These defects appear to have a greater effect in the epiblast, a tissue that undergoes rapid cell proliferation at pre-gastrulation and during gastrulation stages. Since gastrulation cannot proceed until a certain threshold number of cells is available in the conceptus (see Kojima et al., 2014. Sem. Cell and Dev. Biol.), this process will be delayed. Therefore, developmental events at post-implantation stages will advance at a slower rate depending on the number of cells available and in the order that they normally occur; first axial specification, then gastrulation and so on, until the embryo cannot sustain further development. Cables2 mutants appear to have undergone axial specification and begin gastrulation but then fail to develop much further. This possibility, as well as those raised below, should be addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Comments on paper not needing response:</p><p>Cables2 expression is well documented and supports the author's conclusions that it is ubiquitously expressed. Although no negative controls are presented in wholemount in situ hybridization experiments in Figure 1, this data is nicely supported by expression analysis of wild-type and mutant E6.5 embryos shown in Supplementary Figure 1B.</p><p>The phenotype of the mutant embryos is clearly illustrated in Figure 2 and in the marker analysis of subsequent figures. As the authors state, mutant embryos are smaller than littermates and have peri-gastrulation abnormalities.</p><p>The mutant embryos have a smaller embryonic region that appears to represent only one third of the proximodistal length of the egg cylinder. That is, the length of the egg cylinder from the base of the ectoplacental cone to the tip of the epiblast. This is revealed by comparing the position of the boundary between the extra-embryonic ectoderm and the epiblast in mutant and control embryos (i.e. Figure 3. C, F, L and others). Mutant embryos have similar egg cylinder length as controls, but the length of the embryonic region is smaller, with a 1:2 ratio while controls have approximately a 1:1 ratio between the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions. This can be easily visualized in Figure 6F which shows a mutant embryo hybridized with Oct4, a marker of the epiblast (Perea-Gomez, et al., 2004. Curr. Biol).</p><p>Issues to address:</p><p>Cables2 mutant mice were generated using targeted ES cells obtained from KOMP repository but there is no description of the kind of mutation generated. A diagram detailing the mutation is necessary to illustrate the nature of the mutation for readers of the article.</p><p>The authors report no difference between cell proliferation and cell death levels in embryos at E6.5. However, no statistical analysis is provided to support these claims. In fact, the levels of cell proliferation, as shown in Supplementary Figure 2C, appear to differ in the embryonic region of mutant and control embryos.</p><p>Contrary to the authors' assertion, the expression of Brachyury is not normal in E6.5 mutant embryos. Previous to the appearance of the primitive streak, Brachyury is expressed as a ring in the extra-embryonic ectoderm and subsequently in the posterior epiblast (Perea-Gomez, et al., 2004. Curr. Biol; Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, 2005. Dev. Biol.). This is evident in the control embryo shown in Figure 3A. In figure 3B, Brachyury expression is clearly evident as a band in the extra-embryonic ectoderm but it is missing in the posterior epiblast. Therefore, even before the appearance of the primitive streak, Cables2 mutant embryos seem to be developmentally delayed. At E7.5, Brachyury is expressed in the primitive streak region of Cables2 mutants showing that the anteroposterior axis of mutant embryos has been properly established even though the morphology of the embryos is clearly abnormal.</p><p>Judging by morphology, the embryo hybridized with Wnt3 in Figure 3D does not appear to be a Cables2 mutant embryo. This is evident by looking at the ratio of the length of the embryonic and extra-embryonic regions. This ratio is close to 1:1 as in the control embryo shown in Figure 3C. It is likely that this is a wild-type or heterozygous embryo that is delayed in development rather than a Cables2 mutant embryo.</p><p>The authors state: &quot;….expression of Wnt3 was also impaired in the proximal-posterior part of epiblast and the PVE of E6.5 Cables2-/- mutants although the expression remained in the proximal epiblast adjacent to the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE)….&quot; Apart from the previous comment, no evidence is provided to support this claim. A cross section of Cables2 mutant embryos hybridized with Wnt3 in necessary to support this claim.</p><p>The authors state: &quot;WISH analyses showed that Bmp4 was similarly expressed in the ExE of Cables2-/- embryos compared with wild-type embryos at E6.5 (Figure 3K and L), suggesting that the ExE is normally developed in mutant embryos at least until E6.5. These findings are consistent with Cables2 promoting the formation of Wnt3-expressing PVE to induce and maintain PS formation.&quot; There appears to be a contradiction, if expression of Bmp4 and extra-embryonic ectoderm are normal, why do the authors mention that Wnt3 expression is impaired?</p><p>The authors conclude that Cables2 depletion impairs the correct formation of the AVE (Anterior Visceral Endoderm). This is incorrect, expression of Lefty2 and Cer1, two markers of the AVE, is located on one side of the epiblast indicating correct positioning of the AVE. The small/weak area of expression described can be explained by the small embryonic region as described in point 5 above. In addition, the correct position of Fgf8 and later Brachyury indicate correct positioning of the anteroposterior axis of the Cables2 mutant embryos.</p><p>The chimera analysis in which Cables2 mutant ES cells were aggregated with wild-type tetraploid embryos shows only partial rescue of the mutant chimeric embryos suggesting a role for Cables2 in visceral endoderm for embryo development but not an essential requirement in this tissue. If this were the case, the mutant chimeras should have been rescued to stages when the function of visceral endoderm is no longer required for embryo development, likely past placental stages when this organ takes over the function of visceral endoderm in the yolk sac. The results of chimeras in which Cables2 is ectopically expressed in ES cells does not provide evidence about the requirement of Cables2 in the epiblast, since in these chimeras the visceral endoderm layer is wild type. These chimeral only provide evidence of rescue of the function of Cables2 in the epiblast. The proper experiment would be to generate chimeras containing wild-type epiblast and mutant visceral endoderm.</p><p>As embryos are slightly smaller from E6.5, and then really abnormal at E7.5, it seems like a possible impact on proliferation should be explored at later time points than E6.5, particularly as the role of Cables2 on embryo growth is not elucidated. Several approach, including Brdu, Phh3 staining, or Fucci reporters might help reveal a possible role on proliferation. Should this be the case, it would be interesting to explore Cables2 interaction with cyclin-dependant kinases in the embryo.</p><p>Mutant embryos are smaller, but evidently neither cell proliferation nor apoptosis are significantly different.

It is not clear how many sections/slide and how representative. The authors should have looked at more embryos and attempted to make measurements within the entire embryo (or at least, all the sections for a particular embryo). Moreover, the statistical test could be more robust, something like a nested Anova rather than T-test, because sections (and division/apoptotic events) from the same embryo are not independent.

The mutation is a large deletion of 13.4 Kb that removes the entire coding sequence of the gene. Homozygous mutants are embryonic lethal and have a gastrulation phenotype that is characterized by delayed development and a reduced epiblast region of the conceptus. Expression profiling revealed up-regulation of p53 that coincides with increased apoptosis in the embryos. A second mutation in Cables2 that deletes exon1 and is likely a null allele, however, leads to viable and fertile offspring. This contradicts the conclusions of the authors that attribute the gastrulation phenotype to absence of Cables2.</p><p>Expression profiling revealed down regulation of Rps21, a gene abutting the Cables2 locus. Therefore, an alternative explanation is that the large deletion generated in the Cables2 locus leads to misregulation of Rps21. One possibility is the removal of a regulatory region that controls Rps21 expression.</p><p>The authors have generated a mutation of Rps21 using CRISPR-Cas9, however, it appears that only founder mice were assessed in their study. This complicates the analysis of the mutation since founders are likely mosaics composed of wild-type cells and cells carrying different mutations in Rps21. The authors also conducted Cables2 epiblast rescue experiments using chimeras generated by aggregation of tetraploid embryos and Cables2 mutant ES cells. These studies are ambiguous since they do not distinguish between rescue of epiblast or of extra-embryonic tissues.</p><p>In summary, there are multiple caveats that cast doubt in the conclusions of the article. The generation of compound heterozygous between the two Cables2 null alleles and careful analysis of inactivating mutations in Rps21 should help differentiate the roles played by Cables2 and Rps21 genes in gastrulation. Determining if transcripts of Cables2 are present in Cables2 exon1 mutants during gastrulation can also help clarify the results.</p><p>The authors have addressed my previous critiques satisfactorily. However, a significant amount of new data has been added to the original manuscript. Although this is commendable, it has led to new challenges to the original conclusions of the manuscript.</p><p>1. The authors have provided straightforward whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) data of E6.5 of mutant embryos that clearly illustrates the phenotype of the original Cables2 mutant allele (Cables2d herein). However, WISH data for Oct4 and Nodal that highlight the reduced size of the epiblast in Cables2d mutants has been removed. This is essential data for understanding the phenotype that should be reinstated.</p><p>2. The cell proliferation and apoptosis assays at E6.5 have been replaced by analyses at E7.5. This was done to illustrate the high levels of apoptosis in Cables2d mutants that were not evident at E6.5. This is not a proper comparison since the Cables2d mutants are clearly less developed than E7.5 controls. Showing cell proliferation and apoptosis assays at E6.5 and then showing the increase in apoptosis as the mutant embryos progress in development is a better way to illustrate the point.</p><p>3. The authors need to stress the presence of primitive streak markers in the posterior epiblast at E6.5 (before morphological appearance of the primitive streak) and establishment of the anteroposterior axis rather than focus on the low levels of expression (or absence of expression in the case of T).</p><p>4. Expression profiling of Cables2d mutants showed that Rps21 expression is decreased. This is very intriguing since the deletion of Cables2 encompasses 13.4 kb and it is located right next to Rps21. It is possible that this deletion removed a regulatory region that affects the expression of Rps21 rather than indicate down-regulation of the gene caused by the absence of Cables2. The absence of phenotype in a Cables2 allele that removes exon 1 (Cables2d1 herein), a null allele as indicated by the authors, further suggest that the removal of Cables2 is not responsible for the phenotype observed in Cables2d mutants. Compound heterozygous containing the two mutant alleles of Cables2 (Cables2d/Cables2d1) can help address this possibility.</p><p>5. The authors used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate a null mutation of Rps21 that removes exons 2-6. They report the generation of heterozygous animals with a semidominant lethal or sterile phenotype characterized by white belly spotting, kinky tail and small size. However, it appears that the analysis was restricted to founder animals. Founders generated using the CRISPR-Cas9 system are generally mosaic animals. Thus, they can be composed of an amalgam of heterozygous, homozygous and wt cells. Also, they may contain a variety of indels apart from the intended mutation. Therefore, these results need to be re-evaluated after germline transmission and confirmation of the genotype. In addition, the phenotype may be compounded by defects in a miRNA gene (Mir3091, as per ensembl genome browser) located in intron 1 of Rps21.</p><p>6. The authors generated chimeras using mutant Cables2 ES cells that carry fluorescent markers and express Cables2 under the CAG promoter. These chimeras provide evidence of rescue of the Cables2 mutation in the epiblast. However, these chimeras also carry tetraploid wt extra-embryonic tissues and the authors showed that these tissues also rescue the phenotype in chimeras. Therefore, it is not clear if the rescue is due to rescue of Cables2 in the epiblast or rescue of Cables2 function in extra-embryonic tissues.</p><p>7. Lines 149-152. &quot;Prior to gastrulation, T transcripts are first detected in a ring at the embryonic/extraembryonic junction, whereas once gastrulation is initiated they are found in the PS and nascent mesoderm and subsequently in the axial mesendoderm (Wilkinson et al., 1990).&quot;</p><p>T expression is first detected as a ring in extra-embryonic ectoderm and then in the posterior epiblast before the appearance of the primitive streak. Please correct this paragraph and add the following references (Perez-Gomez et al., Curr. Biol. 2004; Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, Dev. Biol. 2005).</p><p>8. Lines 160-161.

Line 164-165. &quot;The ExE of the post-implantation mouse embryo expresses Bmp4 whereby promoting Wnt3 expression in the proximal epiblast for PS formation.&quot;</p><p>Expression of Bmp4 in extra-embryonic ectoderm does not prove that Bmp4 promotes expression of Wnt3 in proximal epiblast for PS formation.</p><p>11. Lines 168-169. &quot;These findings are consistent with Cables2 promoting the formation of Wnt3-expressing PVE to induce and maintain PS formation in the Bmp4-independant manner&quot;</p><p>This conclusion overstretches the results.</p><p>12. Lines 178-180. &quot;The combined results of WISH analyses suggested the AVE and PS formation are retarded and impaired at the onset of gastrulation in the Cables2-null model.&quot;</p><p>I agree that PS formation is delayed but no evidence is provided to show that AVE formation is delayed too. Certainly, markers of AVE are expressed weakly but they are present at the right place at the right time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript is quite different from the first version, as additional inquiry has shown an important role for the diminished expression of Rps21, a gene partially located on the cables2 locus in the opposite orientation. The authors provide a detailed description of the Cables2 locus mutant, the Rps21 mutant, and the Cables2 only mutant, as well as dissect Cables2 roles in distinct embryo germ layers.</p><p>The study is interesting and technically very well executed. The authors have addressed the previous review's requests.</p><p>However, since the additional experiments led to such a change of message, I feel the current narrative of the manuscript a bit confusing. It would seem easier for the readers to re-write the story as a clear dissection of the interaction between the defects related to ablating one or the other genes or both.

Previous to the appearance of the primitive streak, Brachyury is expressed as a ring in the extra-embryonic ectoderm and subsequently in the posterior epiblast (Perea-Gomez, et al., 2004. Curr. Biol; Rivera-Perez and Magnuson, 2005. Dev. Biol.). This is evident in the control embryo shown in Figure 3A. In figure 3B, Brachyury expression is clearly evident as a band in the extra-embryonic ectoderm but it is missing in the posterior epiblast. Therefore, even before the appearance of the primitive streak, Cables2 mutant embryos seem to be developmentally delayed. At E7.5, Brachyury is expressed in the primitive streak region of Cables2 mutants showing that the anteroposterior axis of mutant embryos has been properly established even though the morphology of the embryos is clearly abnormal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for pointing out. We modified the description of <italic>T</italic> in line 153-154 following your comment.

Therefore, these results need to be re-evaluated after germline transmission and confirmation of the genotype. In addition, the phenotype may be compounded by defects in a miRNA gene (Mir3091, as per ensembl genome browser) located in intron 1 of Rps21.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank reviewer for this comment. We indeed confirmed the germline transmission and <italic>Bst</italic> phenotype in F1 mice. However, there is difficult for mouse colony maintenance in this strain, because of extremely low fertility. In this study and manuscript, we focus to <italic>Cables2</italic> gene locus and its mutant phenotype. Therefore, we would like not show the Rps21 phenotype data but described the F1 phenotype in line 282-283. In null <italic>Rps21</italic>, we designed to knock-out <italic>Rps21</italic> only and refrain to disrupt <italic>Mir3091</italic>. There is no report of <italic>Mir3091</italic> KO mice so far. Furthermore, there was no significantly change of <italic>Mir3091</italic> expression by RNAseq analysis in <italic>Cables2d</italic> embryos.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors generated chimeras using mutant Cables2 ES cells that carry fluorescent markers and express Cables2 under the CAG promoter. These chimeras provide evidence of rescue of the Cables2 mutation in the epiblast. However, these chimeras also carry tetraploid wt extra-embryonic tissues and the authors showed that these tissues also rescue the phenotype in chimeras. Therefore, it is not clear if the rescue is due to rescue of Cables2 in the epiblast or rescue of Cables2 function in extra-embryonic tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated for this comment. Our data of chimeras confirmed the lethal phenotype of <italic>Cables2d</italic> mutant embryo and the important of <italic>Cables2</italic> locus exclusively in epiblast. Therefore, we modified the name of strategy in this revised manuscript. The name of “<italic>Cables2</italic> VE rescue chimera” was changed to “<italic>Cables2d</italic> Epi KO chimera”. Generally, this result provides evidence of overexpressed Cables2 in the epiblast can rescue the lethal phenotype of <italic>Cables2d</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

The authors provide a detailed description of the Cables2 locus mutant, the Rps21 mutant, and the Cables2 only mutant, as well as dissect Cables2 roles in distinct embryo germ layers.</p><p>The study is interesting and technically very well executed. The authors have addressed the previous review's requests.</p><p>However, since the additional experiments led to such a change of message, I feel the current narrative of the manuscript a bit confusing. It would seem easier for the readers to re-write the story as a clear dissection of the interaction between the defects related to ablating one or the other genes or both. As the first half was not modified, the reader is confronted to a complete description of the Cables2 phenotype before realising the genetic complexity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciated reviewer #2 for your kind comments and we are glad to hear that we could address all your requests.

In addition, we gave more information in all figures of gene construction (Figure 2A, 7A, 8A), which indicated <italic>Rps21</italic> abutting to <italic>Cables2</italic> locus.

The authors should have looked at more embryos and attempted to make measurements within the entire embryo (or at least, all the sections for a particular embryo).

About the histology, basically, 2-3 sections were embed per slide and 2-3 slides containing the biggest vertical sections were selected and stained. We avoided the adjacent sections as trying to report independent observations. We also used the 3-4 slides for genotyping embryos, therefore we could not measure the entire embryos. Instead, we increased the number of embryos in each group, n=6 at E6.5 and n=7 at E7.5. As your recommendation, we performed two-way ANOVA statistical test and combined data of both E6.5 and E7.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 624-625: Need to give more details on how cell number (I assume it was nuclear number) was counted – what plug-in, what parameters etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion.
