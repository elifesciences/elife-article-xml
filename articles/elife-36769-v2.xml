This requires the animal to derive allocentric spatial information from egocentric sensory and motor experience. The neural mechanisms underlying this transformation are mostly unknown. We addressed this problem in electric fish, which can precisely navigate in complete darkness and whose brain circuitry is relatively simple. We conducted the first neural recordings in the <italic>preglomerular complex</italic>, the thalamic region exclusively connecting the <italic>optic tectum</italic> with the spatial learning circuits in the <italic>dorsolateral pallium</italic>. While tectal topographic information was mostly eliminated in preglomerular neurons, the time-intervals between object encounters were precisely encoded. We show that this reliable temporal information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate estimation of the distance between encounters, a necessary component of path-integration that enables computing allocentric spatial relations. Our results suggest that similar mechanisms are involved in sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36769.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Finding their way around is an essential part of survival for many animals and helps them to locate food, mates and shelter. Animals have evolved the ability to form a 'map' or representation of their surroundings. For example, the electric fish <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic>, is able to precisely learn the location of food and navigate there. It can do this in complete darkness by generating a weak electric field. As it swims, every object it encounters generates an ‘electric image’ that is detected on the skin and processed in the brain.</p><p>However, all the cues the fish comes across are from its own point of view – the information about its environment is processed with respect to its location. And yet, the map that it generates needs to be independent of the fish’s position – it has to work regardless of where the animal is. The way animals translate ‘self-centered’ experiences to form a general representation of their surroundings is not yet fully understood.</p><p>Now, Wallach et al. studied how internal brain maps are generated in <italic>A. leptorhynchus</italic>. Information about the fish's environment passes through a structure in the brain called the preglomerular complex. Measuring the activity of this region revealed that the preglomerular complex does not process much self-centered information. Instead, whenever the fish passed any object – regardless of where it was in relation to the fish – the event triggered a brief burst of preglomerular activity. The intensity of the activity depended on how recently the fish had encountered another object. This information, combined with the dynamics of the fish's movement, could be what allows the fish to convert a sequence of encounters into a general spatial map.</p><p>These findings could help to inform research on learning and navigation. Further research could also reveal whether other species, including humans, generate their mental maps in a similar way. This may be relevant for people suffering from diseases such as Alzheimer’s, in which a sense of orientation has become impaired.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>path integration</kwd><kwd>electrosensation</kwd><kwd>time-coding</kwd><kwd>spike frequency adaptation</kwd><kwd>renewal process</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>121891-2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longtin</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>49510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Longtin</surname><given-names>André</given-names></name><name><surname>Maler</surname><given-names>Len</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>147489-2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maler</surname><given-names>Len</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel neural mechanism for precise, unbiased estimation of time intervals in the thalamus of electric fish is likely used for computing distance between object encounters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning to navigate within the spatial organization of different habitats is essential for animals’ survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geva-Sagiv et al., 2015</xref>). Electric fish, for example, occupied a lucrative ecological niche by evolving the ability to navigate and localize food sources in complete darkness using short-range electrosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jun et al., 2016</xref>). The spatial acuity that they exhibit, along with their reliance on learned landmark positions, strongly suggest that they memorize the relative arrangement of the landmarks and the environmental borders. The information animals use to generate such <italic>allocentric</italic> knowledge include sensory experiences collected during object encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petreanu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Save et al., 1998</xref>) and motor actions (heading changes and distance traveled) executed between such encounters; utilization of these motor variables in spatial learning and navigation is termed <italic>path integration</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collett and Graham, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etienne and Jeffery, 2004</xref>). This acquired information, however, is always <italic>egocentric</italic> in nature. Fittingly, the primary brain regions dedicated to sensory and motor processing, such as the <italic>optic tectum</italic> (OT) of all vertebrates and many cortical regions in mammals are topographically organized along an egocentric coordinate system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knudsen, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sparks and Nelson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stein, 1992</xref>). Unravelling the neural operations underlying the transformation of egocentric sensory and motor information streams into an allocentric representation of the environment has been a central theme in studies of spatial learning and navigation. Recent studies in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peyrache et al., 2017</xref>) have suggested that the key computations include vestibular input that defines the animal’s head direction (head direction cells, egocentric) and external sensory input that signals the presence of stable environmental features (i.e., landmarks). Linking the head directions that orient the animal to different environmental features are then hypothesized to generate an allocentric representation of those features. The neural circuits that have been hypothesized to implement these computations are, however, exceedingly complicated and include thalamic (head direction) and cortical (external sensory) input to the hippocampal formation. The proposed wiring diagrams are highly speculative and very far from providing a well-defined mechanistic model of how spatial maps are created.</p><p>Equivalent computations appear to be carried out in Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seelig and Jayaraman, 2015</xref>). Visual orientation to landmarks and body direction via path integration are combined in the ellipsoid body with dynamics suggestive of a ring attractor. While these studies in the simpler nervous system of the fly are now closer to providing a mechanistic explanation of how egocentric and external (visual) inputs are combined, it is not clear if the fly has a full representation of the allocentric relations of different environmental features. It is also not at all clear that the dynamics of the ellipsoid body can be mapped onto the cortical and hippocampal circuitry of mammals.</p><p>Teleost fish offer an attractive model for studying this question, as their related brain circuitry is relatively tractable: lesion studies point to the dorsolateral pallium (DL) as the key telencephalic region required for allocentric spatial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Broglio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodríguez et al., 2002</xref>), similarly to the medial cortex in reptiles and the hippocampus in mammals (see Discussion). DL has strong excitatory recurrent connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elliott et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giassi et al., 2012b</xref>). Importantly, DL receives sensory and motor information related to electrosensory and visual object motion from OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastian, 1982</xref>) via a single structure – the diencephalic preglomerular complex (PG, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giassi et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The tectal recipient portion of PG projects solely to DL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giassi et al., 2012a</xref>) in agreement with the lesion studies. Importantly, PG receives very little feedback from areas associated with DL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giassi et al., 2012b</xref>) and therefore functions as an exclusive feed-forward bottleneck between OT and the pallium. DL in turn projects to the central pallium (DC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giassi et al., 2012b</xref>); DL also has reciprocal connections with the dorsal pallium (DD) and DD itself has strong recurrent connectivity. DC is the only route by which DL can control motor activity and it does so solely via its projections to the OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giassi et al., 2012b</xref>). We hypothesize that egocentric object-related information (OT) conveyed by PG to DL, is converted to a learned allocentric spatial map by the recurrent circuitry of DL, DD and DC; DC, in turn, then controls the fish’s spatial behavior via its projections to OT.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36769.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neural recordings in PG.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrosensory pathways from periphery to telencephalon.

PG has been considered part of the fish thalamus, based on simple anatomical criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giassi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller, 2012</xref>).

In this contribution, we show a radical conversion of the topographic spatial representation in OT into a reliable non-topographic temporal representation of encounter sequences. We then use a computational model to demonstrate that this temporal information is readily accessible for decoding and that it is sufficiently accurate to account for spatial precision during naturalistic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We characterized the responses of 84 electrosensory PG cells of the weakly electric fish <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic> to moving objects; several motion protocols were used and the sample size for each protocol is mentioned in context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Neuronal activity was recorded extracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) in immobilized fish while objects (brass or plastic spheres) were moved relative to the skin using a linear motor (Methods). Cells responding to this stimulation were predominantly found in the lateral nucleus of the PG complex, PGl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Topographic spatial information is abolished in PG</title><p>We first examined the spatial representation in PG cells by measuring their receptive fields (RFs; measured in 27 cells). The OT electrosensory cells driving PG have spatially-restricted, topographically organized RFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastian, 1982</xref>), and thus provide labeled-line information on the egocentric position of objects. In PG, by contrast, only 11% of the cells (3/27) were topographic with a spatially restricted RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); the majority of PG cells (89%, 24/27) responded across most or all of the fish’s body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, PG activity does not convey a topographic ‘labeled-line’ code of object position. We also checked whether object location is encoded by the firing-rate of PG neurons (i.e., a rate code). The firing-rate was significantly correlated with object position only in one non-topographic cell (4%, 1/24 neurons; p &lt; 0.05, random-permutations test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, mutual information between object position and firing-rate was significant only in two non-topographic cells (8%, 2/24 neurons; p &lt; 0.05, random-permutations test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Most PG cells responded both to conductive and non-conductive objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and would therefore not discriminate between different object types, for example, plants versus rocks. We can, therefore, infer that during active exploration of the environment, PG reports to the dorsal pallium whenever the fish encounters or leaves a prey or a landmark (e.g., root mass or rock) or alters its swimming trajectory near a landmark.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36769.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>PG response to conductive/non-conductive objects.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Top: object location (distance from the tip of the nose) during longitudinal object motion; middle: spike raster; bottom: PSTH.

Many of the PG cells exhibited pronounced adaptation to repeated motion (45%, 15/33 neurons tested with repeated-motion protocol; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We delivered a sequence of object encounters (motions in and out of the RF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>); time-intervals between sequential encounters were drawn randomly and independently (in the range of 1–30 s). The response intensity (number of spikes within an individually determined time window) of these adapting cells to each encounter was strongly correlated with the time-interval immediately prior to that encounter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). By contrast, there was no significant correlation with intervals prior to the last one (inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

A Maximum-Likelihood Estimator (MLE, see Materials and methods) was used to decode the most recent interval from the population response to each encounter. To demonstrate this approach, we used a homogeneous population of identical memoryless neurons (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf40"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The error increased with the decoded time interval <italic>T</italic> and baseline spontaneous activity <italic>c</italic> and decreased with population size <italic>N</italic> and response gain <italic>a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E-G</xref>).

We conclude that the response of the majority of PG adapting cells to an encounter can be used to estimate the time interval elapsed prior to that encounter, using a simple, memoryless decoder.</p><p>It is important to note that the population model mentioned above assumes that the responses of individual cells are statistically independent given the interval sequence. This assumption may not hold in certain scenarios, such as the existence of a latent state variable (e.g. arousal) modulating the overall population responsiveness. Such correlations across the population, if not taken into account in the decoding algorithm, would degrade the estimation accuracy. One possible solution to this could be based on the population of <italic>non-adapting cells</italic> (55%, 18/33) which, by definition, are not significantly affected by the temporal pattern of stimulation but might be affected by such global modulations. Thus, this population may convey sufficient information to enable estimation of such confounding variables and correct the temporal estimation accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PG activity corresponds to observed path integration acuity</title><p>Can PG activity be used to explain features of spatial behavior in freely-swimming electric fish? To check this possibility, we must first measure the time-intervals being memorized by fish conducting a spatial learning task, as well as the error in the fish’s estimation of these intervals. To this end we used previously published data from spatial learning experiments conducted in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jun et al., 2016</xref>). In these experiments fish were trained to find food in a specific location in complete darkness. This was performed either with or without the aid of landmarks. Since only the short-range electrosense was available to the fish, they had to use path-integration from the encountered objects to the food location. In other words, the fish had to memorize the intervals/distances between these encounters in order to improve its behavioral performance and find the food more efficiently. Therefore, we measured the time-interval and the distance traveled by the trained fish from the last encounter with an object (tank wall or landmark) to the food in each trial, either with (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) or without landmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Thus, this behavioral analysis yielded the relation between the memorized time-intervals and the estimation error of this variable in two different scenarios.</p><p>PG is the only source of sensory information for the dorsolateral pallium (DL), the likely site of spatial memory (Rodriguez et al., 2002). Therefore, we hypothesized that the history-independent adapting PG cells provide DL with one <italic>necessary</italic> component for path integration: the temporal sequence of object encounters (the two other components are heading-direction and linear velocity). How many adapting PG cells are required to achieve the behavioral temporal acuity observed as described above? We constructed a heterogeneous population model using the empirically obtained parameters (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf44"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was set to 0 for all neurons to simplify the simulations). This model was then stimulated at random time-intervals, which were then decoded from the population response using MLE. This estimation was approximately unbiased across the entire range tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We compared the simulated estimation error, as well as the analytically computed CRLB for the heterogeneous population, to the behavioral temporal results obtained with and without landmarks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). We also performed the comparison in spatial terms by using the fishes’ average velocity to convert the model’s results into units of distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The simulated PG population yielded temporal and spatial estimation errors comparable to those displayed in behavior (boxplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, C</xref>), both with and without landmarks, using only ~500 adapting cells. The lateral subdivision of PG (PGl), in which most motion-responsive cells were found, contains about 60,000 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Trinh et al., 2016</xref>). Based on our data, we can estimate that over 9,000 of these are memoryless adapting cells (a conservative estimate using only strictly history-independent cells with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf45"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>, 5/33 or 15%). Thus, we hypothesize that the number of PGl cells is <italic>sufficient</italic> to attain the observed behavioral precision, even when additional encoding errors (e.g. in heading and velocity estimation) are taken into account. Taken together, our simulations suggest that time-interval encoding in PG can consistently account for the observed behavioral precision of spatial learning. It should be noted that the validity of this computational analysis relies on our (admittedly simple) model correctly capturing the neuronal response dynamics. Finer details, such as the inter-dependency between the model’s various parameters, were not taken into account in this study. However, it seems reasonable to suggest that the plentitude of PGl cells provides a large margin of error to accommodate such extensions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results suggest the following space-to-time transformation scheme: PG derives a sequence of discrete novelty events (encounters) from OT activity. The remarkable history-independent adaptation process provides an accessible, accurate and unbiased representation of the time intervals between encounters. We have found visually-responsive PG cells displaying similar adaptation features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism is implemented across multiple sensory modalities. The elimination of egocentric topographic information in PG – both in the response itself and in its adaptation – ensures that the encoding of time is invariant to the specific body part encountering the object. This temporal information is then transmitted to DL, which can use it to integrate the fish’s swim velocity to obtain distance-traveled, a key allocentric variable. For fish, the necessary velocity information may be provided by the lateral-line system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chagnaud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2017</xref>); several lateral-line responsive PG units were encountered in our recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, DL can combine the distance information with instantaneous heading-direction (vestibular system, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Straka and Baker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoder and Taube, 2014</xref>) to yield the animal’s allocentric spatial position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Etienne and Jeffery, 2004</xref>). A recent study in zebrafish suggests that DL neurons can indeed process temporal information on the long time-scales discussed here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Our computational analysis demonstrates that the PG temporal information is sufficient to account for the spatial acuity displayed in behavioral studies of gymnotiform fish utilizing electrosensory information alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36769.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>PG simulation explains animals’ spatial and temporal behavioral accuracy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distribution of estimated time interval vs. actual time interval using a heterogeneous population (<italic>N</italic> = 500 cells).

Short-range sensing, used by ancestor species living in low-visibility environments, necessitated the perception of space through temporal sequences of object encounters. With the evolution of long-range sensory systems such as diurnal vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">MacIver et al., 2017</xref>), simultaneous apprehension of the spatial relations of environmental features became possible. The neural mechanisms implementing sequential (space-to-time) spatial inference and simultaneous spatial inference presumably both exist in mammals, for example, we can acquire a map of relative object locations by looking at a scene from afar, or by walking and sequentially encountering landmarks with our eyes closed. Whether the sequential or the simultaneous spatial-inference is more dominant may depend on the species (e.g., nocturnal or diurnal) and on context (e.g., open field or underground burrows). However, it is not clear whether sequentially versus simultaneously-acquired spatial knowledge is processed in a common circuit. Indeed, clinical case studies on the regaining of eyesight in blind humans indicate that sequential and simultaneous spatial perceptions are fundamentally different, and may therefore involve two distinct computations and neuronal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sacks, 1995</xref>). The population of thalamic neurons that we discovered may provide an essential component underlying one of these two major computations – the encoding of sequential temporal information – and we hypothesize that such neurons underlie sequential spatial learning in all vertebrates.</p><p>There is substantial evidence indicating that the pathway studied here indeed has parallels in other vertebrates, and specifically in mammals. PG’s homology to posterior thalamic nuclei is supported by previously published anatomical and developmental findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giassi et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller, 2012</xref>), as well as by physiological (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) and molecular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) results presented here. The thalamic pulvinar nucleus is particularly similar to PG in that it receives direct tectal input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman and Wurtz, 2011</xref>). Its involvement in visual attention and saliency in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson and Petersen, 1992</xref>) corresponds to PG’s involvement in novelty detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, pulvinar lesions are associated with saccadic abnormalities and deficits in the perception of complex visual scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arend et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting a link to the sequential mode of spatial learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Komura et al. (2001)</xref> demonstrated that posterior thalamic regions (including the rodent equivalent of the pulvinar) can implement interval timing computations over long time-scales (&gt;&gt;1 s); however, the mechanistic basis for these computations has not been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simen et al., 2011</xref>) and potential contributions to path integration have not been explicated. A recent paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>) reviewed models of temporal encoding based on recurrent neural networks. Further studies will be required to determine whether the novel adaptation encoding mechanism in PG engages the downstream recurrent networks of DD and DL to produce refined estimates of the time interval between salient sensory and/or motor events. Finally, a recent study in rodents demonstrated spatially non-specific adaptation in VPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jubran et al., 2016</xref>), a posterior thalamic nucleus responding to vibrissal object encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yu et al., 2006</xref>). Taken together, we hypothesize that thalamic space-to-time mechanisms akin to those presented here play an important role in mammalian sequential spatial learning, especially in nocturnal animals relying on sparse sensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Save et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The telencephalic target of PG, DL, resembles the mammalian hippocampus not only in function, as revealed in lesion studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodríguez et al., 2002</xref>), but also in development, gross circuitry and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elliott et al., 2017</xref>). The role of the hippocampus in spatial learning and navigation is well established, and hippocampal neural correlates of allocentric spatial variables have been exquisitely described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry and Burgess, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>). There is also evidence for the importance of time coding in the mammalian hippocampus: ‘Time cells’ responsive to elapsed time have been reported and, in some cases, these cells also respond at specific spatial loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eichenbaum, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study on the representation of goals in the hippocampus found cells encoding the length/duration of the traveled path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sarel et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanism we have found may therefore contribute to creating temporal coding in the hippocampus, not just in the context of egocentric-to-allocentric transformations but rather whenever expectations associated with specific time intervals need to be generated. It should be noted, however, that unlike DL’s direct thalamic input via the PG bottleneck, the hippocampus receives sensory and motor information primarily via the cortex. Furthermore, multiple bi-directional pathways connect the mammalian sensory and motor cortical regions with the hippocampal network. Pinpointing the exact loci where egocentric-to-allocentric transformations may take place in the mammalian brain is therefore extremely challenging. We propose that this transformation is initiated in the mammalian thalamus where history-independent adaptation also encodes time between encounter events. Finally, we propose that this thalamic output contributes to the generation of an allocentric spatial representation in the mammalian hippocampus.</p><p>In this contribution, we propose a hypothesis about how gymnotiform fish, and perhaps vertebrates in general, generate their representation of position relative to the environment. Future experiments could test the predictions entailed by this hypothesis. Behaviorally, our model implies that the fish's sense of position is critically dependent on its last encounter with an object. Further behavioral studies of spatial learning could elucidate this relationship, for example, by manipulating the objects' arrangement relative to the navigation target. Combining these studies with chronic recordings of PG and its pallial targets in freely navigating fish will permit testing of our proposed space-to-time neural transformation scheme.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental model</title><p>All procedures were approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care and follow guidelines established by the Society for Neuroscience. <italic>Apteronotus leptorhynchus</italic> fish (imported from natural habitats in South America) were kept at 28°C in community tanks.

Each electrode was manually glued to a pulled filamented glass pipette (P-1000 Micropipette Puller, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA); the glass pipette provided mechanical rigidity that allowed advancing the tetrode to the deep-lying PG. Prior to recording, tetrode tips were gold-plated (NanoZ 1.4, Multi Channel Systems, Reutlingen, Germany) to obtain 200–300 kOhm impedance at 1 kHz. The electrode was positioned above the brain according to stereotaxic brain atlas coordinates (150–300 µm caudal to T26 and 800–1000 µm lateral to midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maler et al., 1991</xref>]), and lowered using a micropositioner (Model 2662, David Kopf Instruments, Tujunga, CA) while delivering visual and electrosensory stimuli.

A plastic or brass sphere (1.21 cm diameter) was connected to an electromechanical positioner (Vix 250IM drive and PROmech LP28 linear positioner, Parker Hannifin, Cleveland, OH), which was pre-programmed for the appropriate motion sequence and initiated by outputs from our data acquisition software (Spike2, Cambridge Electronic Designs, Cambridge, UK). Typically, a trapezoidal velocity profile was used with 150 cm/s<sup>2</sup> acceleration and 5 cm/s peak velocity, and total distance in either direction of 8 cm (longitudinal) or 5 cm (transverse); due to technical limitations, each cell was recorded using only one direction of motion (longitudinal or transverse). For protocols involving motion in two axes (receptive field sampling, Oddball), the object was attached to a second electromechanical positioner (L12-100-50-12-P linear actuator, Firgelli Technologies, Ferndale, WA), which was mounted perpendicularly to the first one. In order to measure the receptive field (RF) size, we used one motor to repeatedly perform transverse object motion (towards and away from the fish) while a second motor was used to randomly change the longitudinal position between repetitions. This protocol was performed on a total of 27 cells. To check the spatial specificity of the adaptation process (i.e. if it is affecting only the body location experiencing the encounters or a whole-body effect), we performed a spatial oddball experiment: First, a series of N ‘standard’ encounters (in and out transverse object motion, N = 5–9) were given in rapid succession at one location (e.g. the head); the (N + 1)<sup>th</sup> encounter was given at a different location (e.g. the trunk) while maintaining the same time-interval between encounters (3–5 s, the second motor was used to quickly switch positions). Each such series was followed by a long recovery period ( ≥ 30 s) and then repeated in the opposite direction. This was performed on a total of 14 cells, out of which six were found to be adapting (in either direction).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology</title><p>In the initial experiments the location of PG was verified by preparing histological sections and locating the electrode track marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Briefly, South American weakly electric fish (<italic>Gymnotus</italic> sp.) were trained to find food (a mealworm restrained to a suction cup) in complete darkness, at a specific location within a 150 cm diameter custom made circular arena. In experiments with landmarks, four acrylic objects (two square prisms, 5.6 and 9.0 cm/side and two cylinders, 7.6 cm and 10.2 cm diameter) were placed in fixed locations within the arena. In each daily session, each fish was given four trials to find the food. After a 12-session training stage, animal performance stabilized, and four test sessions were performed in which food was omitted in one randomly assigned ‘probe’ trial. Only data from these four last sessions were analyzed here. A total of four fish were used with landmarks and eight fish were used without landmarks. Fish behavior was video recorded and tracked as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jun et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The cruising time/distance from the last encounter (with either a landmark or the tank wall) to the location of the food is the epoch/trajectory the fish had to memorize in order to perform path integration. This was measured in each of the ‘food’ trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>); the segment from the last encounter (3 cm from a landmark or 6 cm from the arena wall) to the detection of food (3 cm from food location) was found and the trajectory’s total length and duration were computed. The spatial ‘decoding’ errors were obtained by measuring where the fish searched for the missing food in the probe trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>); the normalized histogram of the visiting frequency across space (heat map) was fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function:<disp-formula id="equ18"><mml:math id="m18"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math></disp-formula>where μ<sub>x</sub> and μ<sub>y</sub> are mean parameters; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf91"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf92"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are variance parameters; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf93"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is a gain parameter and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf94"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is the cross correlation parameter.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Catherine Emily Carr as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew A Wilson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper contains the first recordings from neurons in the periglomerular complex (PG) in weakly electric fish. This structure receives input from the optic tectum and projects to the dorsolateral pallium (DL). DL is hypothesized to be the site of spatial memory, and thus its input from this thalamic complex is important. The authors have recorded from PG, and show that, despite the topographic nature of the input from the optic tectum, responses are non-topographic. They use a model to support the hypothesis that what occurs in PG is a temporal representation of spatial sequences.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were divided about your manuscript. Two felt there was sufficient merit in this being the first report of activity in the periglomerular complex, while a third felt that both the analysis and the presentation of data were insufficient. All three reviewers agreed that the conclusions of the paper were not satisfactorily supported by the data. From the Senior Editor: &quot;We note an increasing tendency in submitted manuscripts for authors to &quot;overhype&quot; their results to &quot;sell&quot; their work. We strongly encourage you to let your data speak for themselves and to present the data in a way that the reader can see exactly what you have done and why.&quot;</p><p>The manuscript lacks the information required to assess the strength and significance of many statements, with a need for substantial improvement in the presentation of results.</p><p>The presentation and analysis of the electrophysiological data require careful revision, potentially with a table, to show which cells were evaluated with which stimuli, and where they were located. In many cases the numbers mentioned appear inconsistent.

This is incorrect. Even though much is still unknown, a lot has been learned about the emergence of an allocentric representation of position and especially heading – in rodents and in other organisms. Some notable recent examples include the discoveries related to representation of orientation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; or the recent work by Peyrache et al., reporting on the existence of a conjunctive representation of allocentric heading and egocentric proximity to borders, which may serve as a building block for the allocentric border cells observed in the entorhinal cortex.</p><p>There are many assertions throughout the manuscript that appear unsupported. For example, &quot;making PG a feed-forward information bottleneck between egocentric and allocentric spatial representations&quot; could be reconsidered. Just because temporal information, combined with a speed signal, can permit accurate path-integration, does not mean that it does. The authors should critically review all assertions to differentiate between what is shown and what is hypothesized.</p><p>Results section:</p><p>Further information is required about the PG responses and their analysis in the manuscript. Questions raised in the reviews are summarized below. Part of the confusion experienced when reading the manuscript may emerge from the separation of figures and supplementary figures. These should be integrated to support a logical flow of results. For example, why does Figure 4—figure supplement 2 contains navigation behavior and lateral line physiology?</p><p>– What is the relationship between a cell's properties as shown in Figure 2A-C to those shown in Figure 2D-F, to those shown in Figure 3? What are the parameters that characterize the population of time-interval encoding cells, as extracted from the procedures described in the Materials and methods section?</p><p>How were the cells, shown in Figure 2 and discussed in subsection “PG cells respond to object encounters”, classified into the different categories?</p><p>It is unclear how the various sample pools of cells were selected and how they overlap. 84 cells were recorded, but across how many animals? I assume each animal was implanted with single electrodes (stereo or tri -trodes), and that only single penetrations were made for each animal although this is not stated explicitly.</p><p>Of the 84 cells, it is reported that 27 had receptive fields mapped in Figure 1. They then describe 28 cells tested with longitudinal motion. I assume that these are a separate group of cells measured in a separate group of animals, although again not explicitly stated. This is followed by description of 40 cells showed looming-receding responses described in Figure 2. This is slightly confusing given that the receptive field mapping of the 27 cells in Figure 1 used a looming-receding protocol. Did the 40 cells shown in Figure 2 simply go through a more extensive mapping protocol allowing the different detection types (proximity, encounter, change) to be identified (although no such description is given in the methods)? Again, is this a separate pool of cells in a separate group of animals?</p><p>Given that the numbers here don't quite add up (27+40+28 = 95) there is something that I am missing. Perhaps there is some overlap between the 27 receptive field mapped cells and the 40 looming-receding cells, and then the question is why the subset?</p><p>Figure 3 then describes 33 cells subjected to repeated motion protocols. Again, unclear how this pool of cells relates to the other pools.</p><p>Perhaps a summary table in the supplemental information listing the all of the animal/cells/protocol would clarify things.</p><p>It would be useful to include data regarding the receptive fields as a function of body position for the units shown in Figure 1 to get a sense of the response distributions along the body.</p><p>If the cells are drawn from different animals/recordings, how confident are the authors that the 3 topographic cells shown are drawn from the same pool as the non-topographic and are not the result of sampling from a different site due to variation in electrode placement across implants. This is not essential to the overall interpretation, but it would be important to know whether this reflects an accurate estimate of the relative representational heterogeneity in PG.</p><p>I did not understand the terminology used in the manuscript. Most of the cells described in PG exhibit invariance to the heading of an object relative to the animal, but they are selective to the distance of an object from the animal (and they do not acquire selectivity to the animal's heading relative to the environment). Why, then, claim that egocentric spatial information is abolished in PG?</p><p>In addition, how do the results in the manuscript show that the time interval encoding observed in PG produces an allocentric spatial representation, as announced in the title? The results of the manuscript only hint at the possibility that the activity in PG might serve as an input to this computation.</p><p>The conclusions drawn from the model should, in my opinion, be taken with a great deal of caution, because of the assumptions that were made: first, the memory variable was set to zero (is this justified based on the fits?) Even more importantly, the model assumes independent noise in the different neurons. There are various reasons why this might be incorrect, possibly leading to a greatly reduced ability to decode the interval duration from a large population: one of them is correlated stochasticity. Another reason is that the activity might depend on some latent variables other than the history of time intervals. Overall, I am not convinced that the population activity in PG can be probed to generate a robust readout of the time interval between encounters.</p><p>I would also like to comment that the computational analysis in the paper is not strong. I appreciate that the model of neural response is simple but the fit of the data to this simple model is not demonstrated convincingly. The neural readout analysis suffers from technical issues (see below), but even more importantly it relies on assumptions that may be incorrect, and these limitations are not acknowledged or discussed.</p><p>The assessment of readout precision is performed by simulating spiking activity (based on the model) and application of a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. This is unnecessary. Given the assumptions of independent Poisson noise and no history dependence, it is possible to evaluate the Fisher Information analytically, which would clarify how the results scale with various parameters. Considering the large number of cells postulated, this analysis is expected to provide precise agreement with the ML simulation results. However, I also expect to see some assessment for how the observed distribution of the history dependence parameter <italic>β</italic> might affect decoding precision. This aspect of the analysis may be more difficult to achieve with a full analytical approach, hence simulations can be helpful. A simple estimator that ignores the history dependence might be significantly influenced by the history dependence, as this is a source of variability that is shared across the population. Perhaps a more sophisticated decoder might do better, but this would require a reasonable proposal for implementation by neural circuitry. A decoder that takes into account the history dependence may need to maintain memory of the response from the previous encounter, and it's important to understand whether this is necessary.</p><p>The analysis of the behavioral data is not explained with sufficient clarity (for example, what are the parameters theta and A mentioned in subsection “Analysis of behavioral data”?). How the model of neural readout relates to the behavior is even less clear. Finally, in in subsection “PG activity explains path integration acuity” it is stated that &quot;the number of PGI cells is sufficient to attain the observed behavioral precision, even when additional encoding errors e.g. in heading and velocity estimation are taken into account&quot;. Where is this demonstrated?</p><p>3) Title: The title is a bit misleading given that the egocentric-allocentric transformation is not explicitly demonstrated but rather suggested through simulation. Perhaps qualifying it with &quot;A novel time-stamp mechanism could transform egocentric encounters into allocentric spatial representations&quot;.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A time-stamp mechanism may provide temporal information necessary for egocentric to allocentric spatial transformations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

DL is hypothesized to be the site of spatial memory, and this input is hypothesized to transform egocentric encounters into allocentric spatial representations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There remains concern about how well the neural response model captures the measured neural responses. Figure 6—figure supplement 1 demonstrates that the predictions of the model and the measurements are positively correlated, and that this correlation is statistically significant; but this on its own is a relatively weak statement, and it is difficult to interpret the reported values of correlation coefficients. We would like to see a word of caution that the analysis relies on an assumption that the model correctly captures the neural responses.</p><p>2) The mathematical analysis of temporal encoding precision assumes that <italic>β</italic> = 0, and accurate readout using the naive ML estimator requires approx. <italic>β</italic> &lt; 0.2. Hence, it's relevant to know, what are the characteristic properties of cells with zero or small <italic>β</italic>: one can imagine a scenario in which these particular cells have very small gains, or short time constants, and are thus less useful for the computation than expected from panels A-C.</p><p>3) The authors propose a hypothesis about how animals generate their representation of position relative to the environment, and could discuss how this prediction might be tested in future experiments, either behaviorally or in terms of neural activity in other brain areas. Behaviorally, the model implies that the animal's sense of position is critically dependent on the last encounter with an object. Does this make sense? Another interesting prediction is that there may be a cutoff in the durations of swimming without encounters, over which the animal can estimate its position – determined by the distribution of adaptation time constants.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A time-stamp mechanism may provide temporal information necessary for egocentric to allocentric spatial transformations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We'd like to accept your paper, but first suggest you revise the paragraph excerpted below because it does not really address the reviewer's question.</p><p>What we asked for in point 3 was &quot;The authors propose a hypothesis about how animals generate their representation of position relative to the environment, and could discuss how this prediction might be tested in future experiments, either behaviorally or in terms of neural activity in other brain areas.

All response types were observed in adapting cells (e.g. of the 11 tested with radial motion, 8 displayed proximity, 6 encounter and 4 motion change responses, with 4 displaying more than one response type). However, the numbers are too small to say anything conclusive and so we believe that including this breakdown in the paper will not contribute to the readers’ understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the parameters that characterize the population of time-interval encoding cells, as extracted from the procedures described in the Materials and methods section?</p></disp-quote><p>A new figure supplement was added (Figure 6—figure supplement 1) showing the empirically obtained CDFs of all model parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How were the cells, shown in Figure 2 and discussed in subsection “PG cells respond to object encounters”, classified into the different categories?</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial submission, categorization was performed manually, by observing the PSTH of the neuronal response. Following the reviewer’s comment, we performed this analysis with precisely defined criteria (now described in Materials and methods section). While this slightly changed the cell counts, it did not alter any of the paper’s main claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear how the various sample pools of cells were selected and how they overlap. 84 cells were recorded, but across how many animals? I assume each animal was implanted with single electrodes (stereo or tri -trodes), and that only single penetrations were made for each animal although this is not stated explicitly.</p><p>Of the 84 cells, it is reported that 27 had receptive fields mapped in Figure 1. They then describe 28 cells tested with longitudinal motion. I assume that these are a separate group of cells measured in a separate group of animals, although again not explicitly stated. This is followed by description of 40 cells showed looming-receding responses described in Figure 2. This is slightly confusing given that the receptive field mapping of the 27 cells in Figure 1 used a looming-receding protocol. Did the 40 cells shown in Figure 2 simply go through a more extensive mapping protocol allowing the different detection types (proximity, encounter, change) to be identified (although no such description is given in the methods)? Again, is this a separate pool of cells in a separate group of animals?</p><p>Given that the numbers here don't quite add up (27+40+28 = 95) there is something that I am missing. Perhaps there is some overlap between the 27 receptive field mapped cells and the 40 looming-receding cells, and then the question is why the subset?</p><p>Figure 3 then describes 33 cells subjected to repeated motion protocols. Again, unclear how this pool of cells relates to the other pools.</p><p>Perhaps a summary table in the supplemental information listing the all of the animal/cells/protocol would clarify things.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree, and new supplementary tables were prepared as the reviewer suggested (now Figure 1—figure supplement 2). These tables show which protocols were used on each of the neurons reported in this study, which were used on each animal reported in this study, and the sum total of cells per protocol is displayed. We also list the number of penetrations, recording sites and single units in each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to include data regarding the receptive fields as a function of body position for the units shown in Figure 1 to get a sense of the response distributions along the body.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and a figure depicting these data was added (now Figure 2—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the cells are drawn from different animals/recordings, how confident are the authors that the 3 topographic cells shown are drawn from the same pool as the non-topographic and are not the result of sampling from a different site due to variation in electrode placement across implants. This is not essential to the overall interpretation, but it would be important to know whether this reflects an accurate estimate of the relative representational heterogeneity in PG.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid question- do the few topographic cells found represent an anatomically distinct sub-structure or are they evenly distributed in PGl? Not all of the 3 cells found were encountered in the same place (2 were recorded in a single location while the third in another fish). We feel that it is unlikely that we missed any subnucleus in PG because we attempted to thoroughly explore the entire 3D spatial span of PG:</p><p>For the dorsal-ventral axis, we advanced from the edge of nE to the ventral edge of the brain. nE can be readily identified via the responses of its neurons to only electrocommunication signals (we cite the relevant papers). We found object motion related responses throughout most of lateral PG (PGl); towards its ventral edge we found a small number of neurons responsive to visual input only (reported and illustrated in a Supplementary figure); after this, we exited the brain.</p><p>We routinely sampled the full medio-lateral extent finding numerous cells responsive to electrocommunication signals medially (within PGm, not reported in this study); these cells were deep were located deeper than nE and responded differently than nE cells.</p><p>Finally, we sampled rostro-caudally; rostrally we found cells responsive to exogenous electric signals that are encoded by ‘ampullary receptors’ (PGr, not reported) followed by the cells responsive to object motion caudal to this rostral PG region; as we progressed caudally in our search we finally ended up with no response to any stimulus we presented and we assumed that we were out of PG.</p><p>Hence it is unlikely that one of the currently recognized large subdivisions of PG (PGl, PGm or PGr) is entirely dedicated to topographic representation. We cannot reject the possibility of a smaller such structure, but with the small number of topographic cells found, nothing can be said for certain one way or another. We added a sentence in the manuscript relating to this open question (subsection “Topographic spatial information is abolished in PG”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I did not understand the terminology used in the manuscript. Most of the cells described in PG exhibit invariance to the heading of an object relative to the animal, but they are selective to the distance of an object from the animal (and they do not acquire selectivity to the animal's heading relative to the environment). Why, then, claim that egocentric spatial information is abolished in PG?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this point- indeed, the variance in sensitivity to object distance across the PG population provides egocentric information on object proximity. The coding of this information, however, is fundamentally different than that of ELL (the only region so far where this aspect was studied, see below). We now acknowledge this point in the relevant section in the text (subsection “PG cells respond to object encounters”). To clarify our terminology, we now use wherever possible the term <italic>topographic egocentric information,</italic> which relates to the directional egocentric mapping that characterizes all upstream electrosensory regions (ELL, nP, TS, OT) and is largely abolished in PG.</p><p>Explanation of the difference:</p><p>In ELL, coding for electrosensory object location with respect to the body surface (nose to tail, back to belly) is via a classic topographic projection from electroreceptors to ELL. Coding for distance from the body is via a standard firing rate code – firing rate of ON/OFF ELL pyramidal cells increases smoothly as a metal/plastic sphere is moved closer to the fish (the responses of tectal cells to such ‘looming’ signals has not been studied). This response of ELL cells is very different from that of PG cells. PG cells do not respond with (in)de-creasing firing rate as objects are moved closer (looming) or further (receding) from the body. Instead they respond in three different modes and typically ignore the metal/plastic stimulus dimension: they discharge when the objects are very close to the body (1 cm), when they very far away (4 cm) or when they suddenly begin to move at any location within their receptive range. In other words, this is not a simple egocentric map of distance from body; we do not understand and have no hypothesis on how these responses are used by the PG target in pallium (DL) and so did not expand on our simple description of these responses. We feel that this change in representation of ‘distance from body’ is off-topic for our manuscript and so did not elaborate on this point in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, how do the results in the manuscript show that the time interval encoding observed in PG produces an allocentric spatial representation, as announced in the title? The results of the manuscript only hint at the possibility that the activity in PG might serve as an input to this computation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and changed the wording to indicate that we hypothesize that the temporal representation described in our Results section, is used for the purpose of generating an allocentric spatial representation, e.g. the Title and Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conclusions drawn from the model should, in my opinion, be taken with a great deal of caution, because of the assumptions that were made: first, the memory variable was set to zero (is this justified based on the fits?)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effect of the memory parameter is indeed an important issue to explore- see below where we show results that suggest how non-zero memory leaves our basic conclusions unchanged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even more importantly, the model assumes independent noise in the different neurons. There are various reasons why this might be incorrect, possibly leading to a greatly reduced ability to decode the interval duration from a large population: one of them is correlated stochasticity. Another reason is that the activity might depend on some latent variables other than the history of time intervals. Overall, I am not convinced that the population activity in PG can be probed to generate a robust readout of the time interval between encounters.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important assumption. Testing for the validity of this assumption is not feasible using our dataset. However, one relatively straightforward solution to this complication relies on the large sub-population of <italic>non-adaptive</italic> cells (55% of cells tested with the random interval protocol). Assuming that these cells are affected by the same correlations/latent variable, their response may provide an easy indicator to the underlying state of the system. A downstream network may thus use this information to correct its temporal estimation derived from the adaptive sub-population. We are currently computationally exploring the possible roles of these non-adaptive cells. While we can demonstrate this mechanism here with additional simulations, we feel that this extends beyond the scope of this contribution and prefer addressing this issue in a future theoretical paper. In the revised manuscript, we now restate the independence assumption explicitly and suggest the non-adaptive population as a possible solution (subsection “PG cells convey readily accessible temporal information”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also like to comment that the computational analysis in the paper is not strong. I appreciate that the model of neural response is simple but the fit of the data to this simple model is not demonstrated convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 6—figure supplement 1 now includes a panel showing the correlations of the data with the model, all of which were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05, random permutations).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The neural readout analysis suffers from technical issues (see below), but even more importantly it relies on assumptions that may be incorrect, and these limitations are not acknowledged or discussed.</p><p>The assessment of readout precision is performed by simulating spiking activity (based on the model) and application of a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. This is unnecessary. Given the assumptions of independent Poisson noise and no history dependence, it is possible to evaluate the Fisher Information analytically, which would clarify how the results scale with various parameters. Considering the large number of cells postulated, this analysis is expected to provide precise agreement with the ML simulation results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more thorough exploration of the computational model and the readout mechanism is required. We added a new section, after the adaptation results and before the behavioral ones (subsection “PG cells convey readily accessible temporal information”), where we explore the Fisher information issue following the reviewer’s suggestions. We use a model of a homogeneous population (identical parameters for all cells) to demonstrate the scaling of estimation error with the various parameters. While the MLE is only approximately unbiased for short time-intervals, it indeed demonstrates perfect agreement with the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound across a wide range of stimuli. We then compute the CRLB also for the heterogeneous population used in comparison with the behavioral data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, I also expect to see some assessment for how the observed distribution of the history dependence parameter β might affect decoding precision. This aspect of the analysis may be more difficult to achieve with a full analytical approach, hence simulations can be helpful. A simple estimator that ignores the history dependence might be significantly influenced by the history dependence, as this is a source of variability that is shared across the population. Perhaps a more sophisticated decoder might do better, but this would require a reasonable proposal for implementation by neural circuitry. A decoder that takes into account the history dependence may need to maintain memory of the response from the previous encounter, and it's important to understand whether this is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this important comment. First, we note that 33% (5/15) of the adapting cells were best modeled with no memory at all, i.e. <italic>β</italic>=0 (this was not stated anywhere in the previous version of this paper; we now added Figure 6—figure supplement 1, which shows the empirically obtained CDFs of all parameters). Thus, even the strictly memoryless sub-population appears to be quite large. However, the reviewer is correct in that the effects of non-zero <italic>β</italic> are important to analyze. We therefore checked the scaling of bias and RMSE when <italic>β</italic> is increased for the entire homogeneous population. The MLE was constructed by fitting the model’s activity with a zero memory model (i.e. assuming the data were generated by a population with <italic>β</italic>=0). Despite the population-wide history-dependence introduced, the mean bias of the model remained negligible up to <italic>β</italic>=0.5, and the RMSE up to <italic>β</italic>=0.2. Thus, the time intervals may be decoded with a simple memoryless-based MLE using most of the adapting PG units. (median <italic>β</italic>=0.12) These results are now explained in the new modeling and decoding section (subsection “PG cells convey readily accessible temporal information”) and in Figure 6H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The analysis of the behavioral data is not explained with sufficient clarity (for example, what are the parameters theta and A mentioned in subsection “Analysis of behavioral data”?).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree; explanation of the experimental procedures and rationale (subsection “PG activity corresponds to observed path integration acuity”), as well as the figure illustrating these procedure (Figure 7), are now in the main text. We also added the fitted Gaussian expression to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How the model of neural readout relates to the behavior is even less clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. To make this clearer and easier to follow, the neural readout mechanism and the behavioral results are now explained separately in new sections, each with its own figure (Figure 6 and Figure 7). Only then are the two combined in the final Results section and Figure 8. We also expand on our description of the behavioral results and how they related to our data and analyses (subsection “PG activity corresponds to observed path integration acuity”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in in subsection “PG activity explains path integration acuity” it is stated that &quot;the number of PGI cells is sufficient to attain the observed behavioral precision, even when additional encoding errors e.g. in heading and velocity estimation are taken into account&quot;. Where is this demonstrated?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a hypothesis that currently cannot be demonstrated, as we have no data on speed and heading coding in this pathway. ‘We hypothesize that’ was added to the sentence to clarify this point (subsection “PG activity corresponds to observed path integration acuity”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Title: The title is a bit misleading given that the egocentric-allocentric transformation is not explicitly demonstrated but rather suggested through simulation. Perhaps qualifying it with &quot;A novel time-stamp mechanism could transform egocentric encounters into allocentric spatial representations&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and the title now reads: ‘A time-stamp mechanism may provide temporal information necessary for egocentric to allocentric spatial transformations’.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This paper contains the first recordings from neurons in weakly electric fish that project to the dorsolateral pallium (DL).

Figure 6—figure supplement 1 demonstrates that the predictions of the model and the measurements are positively correlated, and that this correlation is statistically significant; but this on its own is a relatively weak statement, and it is difficult to interpret the reported values of correlation coefficients. We would like to see a word of caution that the analysis relies on an assumption that the model correctly captures the neural responses.</p></disp-quote><p>A panel was added to Figure 6—figure supplement 1, namely panel A, to show examples of the measurements and the model’s prediction for an adapting and non-adapting cell.</p><p>In the panel depicting the distribution of correlation coefficients (now panel B), we added boxplots showing the control distribution for each cell (generated using random permutations).</p><p>Cautionary statement was added as suggested to the end of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mathematical analysis of temporal encoding precision assumes that β = 0, and accurate readout using the naive ML estimator requires approx. β &lt; 0.2. Hence, it's relevant to know, what are the characteristic properties of cells with zero or small β: one can imagine a scenario in which these particular cells have very small gains, or short time constants, and are thus less useful for the computation than expected from panels A-C.</p></disp-quote><p>We added plots of the timescales, gains and baselines vs. <italic>β</italic> for all the cells as insets in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. Gain is negatively correlated with <italic>β</italic>, and hence memoryless cells have stronger responses which improves their temporal representation. Baseline activity c is not significantly correlated with <italic>β</italic>. The timescale is positively correlated with <italic>β</italic>, and so most cells with <italic>β</italic>&lt;0.2 have 𝜏 in the range 1-10s. We added a cautionary note stating that we did not take into account the inter-relations between the model parameters (Results section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors propose a hypothesis about how animals generate their representation of position relative to the environment, and could discuss how this prediction might be tested in future experiments, either behaviorally or in terms of neural activity in other brain areas.

E.g., we report ~55% 'non-adaptive' cells, but this may very well include cell with 𝜏 &lt;1s that our motor is too slow to probe. Likewise, cells with 𝜏 &gt;30s simply stopped responding before we were able to record them. In other words, since our protocol tested intervals 1-30s long, it is no wonder this is the timescale range we encountered. To clarify this important point, a caveat regarding the time-scale distribution was added to the Results section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We'd like to accept your paper, but first suggest you revise the paragraph excerpted below because it does not really address the reviewer's question.</p><p>What we asked for in point 3 was &quot;The authors propose a hypothesis about how animals generate their representation of position relative to the environment, and could discuss how this prediction might be tested in future experiments, either behaviorally or in terms of neural activity in other brain areas.
