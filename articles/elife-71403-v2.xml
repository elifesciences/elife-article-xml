Previously we have shown that heparan sulfate (HS) plays an active role in RAGE oligomerization. To understand the physiological significance of HS-induced RAGE oligomerization in vivo, we generated RAGE knock-in mice (<italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup>) by introducing point mutations to specifically disrupt HS-RAGE interaction. The RAGE mutant demonstrated normal ligand-binding but impaired capacity of HS-binding and oligomerization. Remarkably, <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice phenocopied <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in two different pathophysiological processes, namely bone remodeling and neutrophil-mediated liver injury, which demonstrates that HS-induced RAGE oligomerization is essential for RAGE signaling. Our findings suggest that it should be possible to block RAGE signaling by inhibiting HS-RAGE interaction. To test this, we generated a monoclonal antibody that targets the HS-binding site of RAGE. This antibody blocks RAGE signaling in vitro and in vivo, recapitulating the phenotype of <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice. By inhibiting HS-RAGE interaction genetically and pharmacologically, our work validated an alternative strategy to antagonize RAGE. Finally, we have performed RNA-seq analysis of neutrophils and lungs and found that while <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice had a broad alteration of transcriptome in both tissues compared to wild-type mice, the changes of transcriptome in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice were much more restricted. This unexpected finding suggests that by preserving the expression of RAGE protein (in a dominant-negative form), <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mouse might represent a cleaner genetic model to study physiological roles of RAGE in vivo compared to <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>heparan sulfate</kwd><kwd>RAGE</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>oligomerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR07017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL094463</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Buffalo Accelerator Funds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Ding</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM125095</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Eric P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114179</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Dhaval K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI138195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Dhaval K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA246785</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Dhaval K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Heparan sulfate-RAGE interaction is essential for normal function of RAGE in osteoclastogenesis and drug-induced liver damage, which can be targeted to curb RAGE activation as a new opportunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Receptor for Advanced Glycation End-Products (<italic>Ager</italic> gene) encodes RAGE, a transmembrane protein belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of receptors. RAGE has attracted tremendous interest in the last two decades given its involvement in many disease conditions including diabetes, Alzheimer’s, atherosclerosis, cancer, and many other inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hudson and Lippman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). RAGE binds a wide array of ligands including advanced glycation end products, amyloid β-peptide, S100 family proteins, and high mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1). In most pathological conditions, diseased tissues show a dramatically enhanced expression and activation of RAGE. Ablation of RAGE signaling in these conditions, either by neutralizing RAGE ligands or by using RAGE knockout mice, has resulted in greatly improved outcome in murine models, which strongly suggests that RAGE can be pursued as a promising therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Harja et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hofmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huebener et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Park et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Taguchi et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>While many pathological roles of RAGE have been well established, the homeostatic role of RAGE remained a mystery until 2006, when it was found that RAGE plays an essential role in regulating osteoclast differentiation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). While unchallenged RAGE null mice display normal homeostasis in all other aspects, they demonstrated increased bone mineral density. Mechanistically, it was revealed that HMGB1 secreted by preosteoclasts activates RAGE in an autocrine fashion, and HMGB1-RAGE interaction plays a critical role in establishing the sealing zone, a structural feature of osteoclasts essential for bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Recently, HMGB1-RAGE signaling has been shown to also play a key role in drug-induced liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huebener et al., 2015</xref>). Following acetaminophen (APAP) overdose, hepatocytes undergoing necrosis release HMGB1 as a danger signal to promote tissue repair. However, when extensive tissue necrosis occurs, the exaggerated inflammation, mediated by HMGB1-driven, RAGE-dependent neutrophil infiltration, often leads to secondary liver damage with worsened disease outcome. In a mouse of APAP-induced liver injury, we and others demonstrated that <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were greatly protected from liver damage chiefly due to suppression of neutrophil infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Huebener et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Like many cell surface receptors, RAGE signaling depends on receptor oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Xie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Popa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zong et al., 2010</xref>). However, the exact mechanism by which RAGE oligomerizes remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Moysa et al., 2019</xref>). Historically, RAGE has been hypothesized to undergo ligand-dependent oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xue et al., 2016</xref>). We have proposed an alternative hypothesis: that prior to ligand binding, RAGE preassembles into an oligomeric complex by interacting with heparan sulfate (HS), a negatively charged polysaccharide widely expressed at the cell surface. This alternative hypothesis is supported by in-depth structural analyses, where we showed by both crystal and solution structures that HS oligosaccharides induce RAGE to form a stable hexamer in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in the same study, we showed that in endothelial cells, activation of RAGE signaling by all tested RAGE ligands, including HMGB1, S100A8/A9, S100A12, S100B, and AGE, depended upon the presence of HS at the cell surface. Based upon these findings, we propose that HS functions as a main driver of RAGE oligomerization, assembling RAGE into an oligomeric complex at cell surface without activating it. Only this oligomeric complex can serve as a functional receptor, which can then be activated by RAGE ligands to initiate signaling. As virtually all mammalian cells express HS, HS-dependent RAGE oligomerization is likely a universal requirement for RAGE signaling regardless of cell types and ligands involved.</p><p>To investigate the physiological significance of HS-RAGE interaction and HS-dependent RAGE oligomerization, we generated a novel RAGE knock-in (<italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup>) mouse model by introducing point mutations into residues that are involved in HS binding. Remarkably, when bone morphometric indexes and susceptibility to APAP-induced liver injury were examined, we found that the <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice phenocopy <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice precisely. Our findings strongly suggest that HS-RAGE interaction is required for normal function of RAGE in multiple cellular systems and that targeting HS-RAGE interaction could represent a new opportunity to curb RAGE activation. By developing a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically targets part of the HS-binding site of RAGE, we demonstrated that this novel targeting strategy was indeed effective in inhibiting osteoclastogenesis and APAP-induced liver injury. Finally, we discovered that compared to <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, alterations in global transcriptome were much more restricted in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice, which suggest that <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice might be a better murine model to study RAGE-dependent biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of RAGE-AHA mutant and generation of <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> knock-in mice</title><p>RAGE is a multidomain protein consisting of three extracellular immunoglobulin domains (V-C1-C2, also known as sRAGE), a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dattilo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Koch et al., 2010</xref>). We previously reported that HS can induce RAGE to form a hexamer (trimer of dimers) with 1:2 stoichiometry, and that the interaction involves five basic residues in the V domain and two residues (R216 and R218) in the C1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we prepared a triple mutant of mouse RAGE VC1 domain bearing R216A, R217H, and R218A mutations (mVC1-AHA). As expected, the binding capacity of mVC1-AHA to the heparin Sepharose column was reduced significantly compared with wild-type mouse RAGE VC1 domain (WT-mVC1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, mVC1-AHA was unable to form stable hexamer in the presence of HS dodecasaccharides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, mVC1-AHA maintains WT-like binding affinity to RAGE ligand HMGB1 (apparent binding affinity 9.9 nM vs. 11.7 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which is expected because binding of RAGE ligands predominantly occurs at the V domain. To generate a murine model to specifically disrupt HS-RAGE interaction, we introduced R216A-R217H-R218A triple mutations into the <italic>ager</italic> (synonymous with <italic>rage</italic>) locus by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). <italic>Ager<sup>AHA/AHA</sup></italic> mice were born with normal litter size and grew normally without gross morphological abnormalities.

To this end, we developed a rabbit monoclonal antibody (mAb B2) to specifically target HS-RAGE interaction. The epitope of B2 includes the HS-binding residues R216 and R218. Compared to the apparent binding affinity between B2 and WT RAGE (0.1 nM), the affinity between B2 and R216A-R218A mutant was dramatically reduced to 4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

To address this gap, we generated a <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> knock-in mice to specifically disrupt HS-RAGE interactions. As the HS-binding site and the ligand-binding site of RAGE are spatially separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), we were able to create a RAGE variant (R216A-R217H-R218A) with normal ligand binding, but impaired HS-binding capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This novel mouse model allowed us to dissect the specific contribution of HS-RAGE interaction to RAGE signaling in both physiological and pathological conditions for the first time.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2006</xref> first reported that <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice display enhanced bone mineral density due to impaired osteoclastogenesis. Examination of the bone morphometric indexes of <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice found that they also display an osteopetrotic bone phenotype in both trabecular and cortical bones, with a severity that was equivalent to <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Natural history study of the bone phenotype found that for both strains, the bone was largely normal at 4 weeks old (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting the osteoclastogenesis during the bone modeling phase is not dependent on RAGE signaling. The osteopetrotic phenotype became full-fledged when mice reach 10 weeks old (for both sexes), and the phenotype remained when mice reach 4 months of age. It is interesting that while the bone phenotypes of <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> and <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were indistinguishable at 10 weeks for both males and females, their phenotypes at 4 weeks and 4 months were somewhat different. It is unclear what factors contributed to this, but we suspect that the extensive transcriptomic changes experienced by <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) might have modified the bone phenotype in an age-dependent manner. The fact that RAGE signaling regulates bone density in mature bones only, and that it regulates both trabecular and cortical bone homeostasis suggests that RAGE would be an attractive therapeutic target for treating diseases involving abnormal bone remodeling.</p><p>The fact that the <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/+</sup> mice are haploinsufficient suggests that RAGE<sup>AHA</sup> mutant protein plays a dominant effect on WT RAGE. The dominant negative role of RAGE<sup>AHA</sup> mutant can only be explained in the light of RAGE oligomerization. In heterozygous <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/+</sup> mice, the chance of assembling a functional dimer with intact HS-binding site would be merely 25% (50%×50%). This represents a 75% loss of functional RAGE signaling complex compared to WT mice, which apparently was sufficiently severe to impair normal osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice, because all expressed RAGE are WT, they have a 100% of chance to form functional RAGE signaling complex. The fact that male <italic>Ager</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice displayed slightly elevated bone density (although not significant) could be attributed to somewhat reduced overall expression level of RAGE, which can be reasonably expected from heterozygous mice. Interestingly, this gene dosage effect was in full play in 10-week-old female mice, where the <italic>Ager</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice did show significantly increased bone volume (49%), which was identical to the increase observed in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/+</sup> mice (51%). In summary, our analysis has shown for the first time that mice are highly sensitive to the quantity of functional RAGE oligomeric complex, and that female mice appeared to be more sensitive to this regulation than males.</p><p>Our genetic manipulation of HS-RAGE interaction has provided clear evidence that disrupting HS-RAGE interaction pharmacologically would be an effective means to block RAGE signaling. To validate this novel concept, we developed a mAb (B2) that specifically targets the HS-binding site of RAGE. The epitope of B2 includes R216 and R218, the exact residues that we mutated in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice. Accordingly, B2 treatment of WT BMMs precisely copied the osteoclastogenesis phenotype of <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7A–C ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C–D</xref>). Similarly, B2 treatment also provided significant protection against APAP-induced liver injury, and the extent of protection in liver damage and suppression in neutrophil infiltration was highly similar to what was observed in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7D–E ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Combined, these data show that HS-RAGE interaction can be effectively targeted pharmacologically.</p><p>From a pharmacological point of view, targeting the HS-binding site of RAGE bears two main advantages over strategies targeting the ligand-binding site of RAGE. First, targeting the HS-binding site of RAGE can in principle block the signaling of all RAGE ligands because HS-dependent RAGE oligomerization is a common mechanism of RAGE signaling irrespective of the ligands involved. This is difficult to achieve for inhibitors that target the ligand-binding site of RAGE because the binding sites for different RAGE ligands are not identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Koch et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Xue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ostendorp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leclerc et al., 2007</xref>). Second, inhibitors that target the HS-binding site of RAGE leave the ligand-binding site of RAGE unoccupied, which would be free to interact with its multiple ligands that are overexpressed in disease states. Such inhibitors may thus turn RAGE into a decoy receptor, which is able to soak up ligands without transducing signal. In principle, this would greatly lower the risk of undesirable side effects by preventing spillover of unbound RAGE ligands to other inflammatory receptors such as TLR4, with which RAGE share many ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vogl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Foell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Esposito et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>By comparing transcriptomes of neutrophils and lung tissues from <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> and <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice, we present here clear evidence that complete deficiency of RAGE had much broader impact on global gene expression compared to point mutations of RAGE. Under the assumption that RAGE signaling is abolished in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice, which was true in both animal models we tested, we predict that most of the additional DEGs found in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice were perhaps not associated with RAGE signaling. Presumably, the expression levels of these genes were changed due to certain compensatory mechanisms for the sheer loss of RAGE protein. Because some of the changes in expression level were truly dramatic in both mRNA and protein level, it is highly plausible that some of these changes will manifest as phenotypes in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in certain disease models, but in reality might have little to do with RAGE signaling. While it can be argued that the additional DEGs found in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice are due to HS-independent RAGE signaling, such position cannot be well defended for the following reason. If RAGE signaling really consists of HS-independent and HS-dependent RAGE signaling (which is abolished in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice), one would expect that the DEGs in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice are fully encompassed by the DEGs found in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. However, this was not the case, especially for the downregulated genes (in both neutrophils and lungs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and F</xref>), where many more downregulated genes are found uniquely in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice than the ones that overlap with the downregulated genes in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Based on the scope of the inflammatory genes that are differently regulated in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neutrophils (and most likely in other leukocytes as well), we believe caution will need to be taken when using <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice in inflammatory models. In many cases, the <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice might be a cleaner model for investigating the role of RAGE signaling.</p><p>The fact that most of the downregulated genes in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice are not found in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice is highly curious. Taking Gbp2b and Ifi44L as examples, the expression levels of both were completely abolished in neutrophils and lungs in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice, but they maintained WT-like expression levels in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). If Gbp2b and Ifi44L (both are interferon γ responsive genes) were truly associated with RAGE activation, the only logical explanation would be that the activation of these genes was somehow preserved in <italic>Ager</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice. Taking into considerations that many RAGE ligands can also cross-activate TLR4, it is plausible that in the absence of RAGE, certain RAGE ligands activate TLR4 instead, resulting in induction of Gbp2b and Ifi44L. In contrast, because RAGE<sup>AHA</sup> mutant behaves essentially like a decoy receptor, being able to still bind the ligand without transducing signal, spillover of RAGE ligands to TLR4 would be unlikely. Indeed, LPS has been shown to be able to induce Gbp2b (synonymous with Gbp1) expression, which suggests that in theory activation of TLR4 with another ligand would also induce Gbp2b expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Ongoing research in our lab seeks to establish the connection between RAGE signaling and Gbp2b-mediated defense signaling.</p><p>In summary, by using <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice, we presented strong evidence for an essential role of HS-RAGE interaction in bone remodeling and drug-induced liver injury. We further presented a new strategy in treating RAGE-associated diseases by blocking the HS-binding site of RAGE using mAb. Based on our RNA-seq study, we expect that HS-RAGE interaction would play essential roles in many inflammatory responses that involve other types of leukocytes. The <italic>Ager</italic><sup>AHA/AHA</sup> mice and the anti-RAGE mAb antibody we reported here would certainly be invaluable tools to further our understanding of the pathophysiological roles of RAGE. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of mAb B2, we plan to determine its efficacy in a number of inflammatory and tumor models and is in the process of humanization of B2 for testing in primates. A limitation of our study is that we only focused on a small portion of the HS-binding site located on C1 domain. It is perceivable that mAbs that target other epitopes within the HS-binding site would also effectively block RAGE signaling and we are hoping to identify more such mAbs to fully realize the therapeutic potential of RAGE antagonism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

The rabbit hybridomas were generated at Epitomics Inc (now part of Abcam). The hybridoma line 240 E-W3 was used to fuse with rabbit splenocytes. Out of the 4000 hybridoma clones that were screened, around 100 were able to detect mVC1 by direct ELISA. The supernatants of the positive clones were then screened for mAbs that specifically interacted with the HS-binding site. In this screening, instead of using WT mVC1, various mVC1 mutants (K43A-K44A, K39A-R104A, K107A, and R216A-R218A) were immobilized to ELISA plates. These mutants bear alanine mutations in the HS-binding residues. In this assay, mAbs were sought that show reduced binding to the mutants compared to the WT mVC1. In principle, the reduced binding would only occur if the residues that we mutated belong to the epitope recognized by the mAb. In this assay, the epitopes of B2 were found to include R216 and R218.

RAGE) has garnered great interest over the past 20 years for its role in the complications of diabetes mellitus and in Alzheimer's disease, atherosclerosis and other inflammatory disorders. RAGE has several ligands. This paper explores the role of heparan sulfate in the oligomerization of RAGE and the role of oligomerization in vivo function using mouse knockout models. The authors report that knock-in mice, with RAGE is mutated at sites responsible for heparan sulfate binding and oligomerization, phenocopy RAGE knockout mice. They further validate the idea that this knock-in mouse, which preserves expression and binding of RAGE, may be a valuable model for studying this important molecule in disease pathogenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71403.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Shoback</surname><given-names>Dolores</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Francisco</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lianchun</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Heparan Sulfate-dependent RAGE oligomerization is indispensable for pathophysiological functions of RAGE&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors started by producing a triple mutant of RAGE with point mutations in the HS binding site. This mutant protein displayed normal binding to a known RAGE ligand (HMGB1) but reduced binding to heparin-Sepharose and impaired oligomerization when incubated with an HS oligosaccharide. Subsequently, they generated a novel CRISPR knock-in mouse model containing the same point mutations in RAGE (RageAHA/AHA) to specifically disrupt its interaction with HS in vivo. Strikingly, their RAGE knock-in mouse showed defects in bone remodeling and response to liver injury similar to the RAGE knockout mouse. They show that RageAHA/AHA mice display increased bone mass and volume compared to wild-type mice (≥10 weeks of age), and RAGE gene dosage studies showed the dominant negative impact of RAGE-AHA on bone remodeling. In addition, the RAGE-AHA mutation caused a reduction in osteoclastogenesis in vivo and in vitro. In a model of neutrophil-mediated injury using a sublethal dose of acetaminophen, RageAHA/AHA mice displayed a reduction in neutrophil infiltration and liver damage markers similar to the RAGE knockout model. RNA-sequencing of isolated neutrophils and lung tissue from all three genotypes revealed large disparities in differential gene expression between the Rage-/- and RageAHA/AHA mice, suggesting that specifically disrupting RAGE-HS interactions may be a cleaner model for investigating the physiological role of RAGE signaling. To follow up on their findings, the authors generated a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the HS-binding site of RAGE and demonstrated that pharmacological targeting of RAGE-HS interactions phenocopies the RAGE knockout mouse strain and decreases liver injury and modulates bone remodeling.</p><p>Overall, this study nicely follows up on the authors' previous work and reveals the essential role and physiological significance of HS-RAGE oligomerization, which impacts RAGE signaling in vivo. The mouse model and antibody developed here are the main strengths of this study, which provides new innovative tools for studying and pharmacologically targeting RAGE signaling. Importantly, this work presents a new strategy to inhibit RAGE signaling without affecting other RAGE-ligand interactions, which may have direct application to helping patients dealing with relevant inflammatory disorders.</p><p>Although the work is well done overall, to support the conclusions made in this study, the following issues would need to be addressed:</p><p>(1) It is important to characterize the impact that the introduced point mutations have on RAGE protein stability and folding, which can affect protein function. This is particularly important since the authors compare their RAGEAHA mouse model to RAGE knockout mice in multiple assays and biological systems. While western blot data are included showing equal protein expression in WT and RageAHA/AHA mice, this does not address protein function and stability. Techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and/or CD spectroscopy should be used to compare WT and RAGEAHA protein stability/folding for the RAGE VC1 proteins.</p><p>(2) In previous work (Xu et al. 2013), the authors showed that an HS 16-mer is unable to induce oligomerization of the RAGE R216A-R218A mutant (Suppl.

Also, can the authors include the structure and sulfation pattern of the HS dodecasaccharides used in these experiments? Is this a mixture of heparin-derived polysaccharides?

In this paper, the authors used two important tools (RAGE knock-in mice, RageAHA/AHA and blocking HS-RAGE antibody) to address this issue and found that RageAHA/AHA mice (point mutations to disrupt HS-RAGE interaction) phenocopied Rage-/- mice in deficits of bone remodeling and neutrophil-mediated liver injury.

RAGE functions as an oligomer on the cell surface. Extending from their previous work showing heparan sulfate (HS) functions to maintain RAGE oligomerization on the endothelial cell surface in vitro, this research group has directed further work toward understanding the physiological significance of the HS-mediated RAGE oligomerization in vivo. They have generated and examined novel RAGE knock-in (RageAHA/AHA) mice, in which point mutations were introduced to specifically disrupt HS-RAGE interaction. The introduced mutations do not affect ligand binding, but specifically, disrupt HS-RAGE interaction and HS-mediated RAGE oligomerization in vitro. The RageAHA/AHA mice appear normal but develop an osteopetrotic phenotype associated with impaired osteoclastogenesis and are protected from neutrophil-mediated liver injury induced by APAP overdose, phenocopying the Rage-/- mice. The authors also generated a monoclonal antibody B2 that targets the HS-binding site of RAGE. B2 blocked RAGE-dependent osteoclastogenesis and APAP-induced liver injury, phenocopying the RageAHA/AHA mice. The RNAseq analysis of neutrophils and lungs determined the changes of the transcriptome in RageAHA/AHA mice were much more restricted than the Rage-/- mice. These results clearly show that HS-induced RAGE oligomerization is essential for RAGE signaling and suggest that targeting the HS-RAGE interaction as an alternative strategy to antagonize RAGE. However, the RNAseq experiments did not reveal any functional alteration associated particularly with AHA mutations in mice. In addition, some experiments may need additional controls to better support the major conclusions in the manuscript. In general, the findings of this study are novel and may impact multiple related fields. The manuscript is well written.</p><p>1. mVC1-AHA still has 5 basic residues in the V domain involved in the HS interaction. As shown in Figure 1B, mVC1-AHA still binds to HS, although at a lower binding than mVC1-WT. It will be important to determine their relative binding affinity to HS or heparin. The remaining HS-binding-related residues may be a partial reason for the minor phenotype difference between RageAHA/AHA and Rage-/- mice. Such new data might strengthen the Discussion too.</p><p>2.

CRISPR gene manipulation, even using single-stranded donor oligonucleotide, might introduce out-off target mutations resulting in a phenotype unrelated to RAGE.

The phenotype displayed in the RageAHA/AHA mice are more related to osteoclasts and neutrophils, it will be more relevant to check RAGE expression level in these two cell populations in addition to whole lung tissue (Figure 1F).</p><p>5. Figure 1D detected the binding of mVC1-AHA to HMGB1, how about other ligands? It would be important to have a second method, such as SPR, to confirm the induced mutations only affect RAGE`s interaction with HS, not its ligands. Furthermore, how about the ligand-RAGE binding in the presence of HS or heparin – expecting HS/heparin will not affect the binding of mVC1-AHA to its ligands?</p><p>6. In the RAGE gene dosage study, in the RageAHA/+ cells only 25% RAGE forms functional dimers with intact HS-binding site, and in the Rage+/- cells, 100% RAGE forms functional dimers. It is important to determine if the Rage+/- cells indeed express 50% reduced cell surface RAGE. This data will strengthen the discussion of the levels of functional RAGE dimer formation.</p><p>7. In Figure 6A, antibody B2 showed a binding affinity of 4 nM, appearing to have a good binding affinity to RAGE.

It will be helpful to determine if RAGE ligand levels are altered in Rage-/- and RageAHA/AHA mice. This is mentioned in the discussion without any experimental data.
