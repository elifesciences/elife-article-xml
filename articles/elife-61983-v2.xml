morphological changes, but their physiological purpose is unknown. To characterize the role of apoptotic cell contraction, ROCK1 was rendered caspase non-cleavable (ROCK1nc) by mutating aspartate 1113, which revealed that ROCK1 cleavage was necessary for forceful contraction and membrane blebbing. When homozygous ROCK1nc mice were treated with the liver-selective apoptotic stimulus of diethylnitrosamine, ROCK1nc mice had more profound liver damage with greater neutrophil infiltration than wild-type mice. Inhibition of the damage-associated molecular pattern protein HMGB1 or signalling by its cognate receptor TLR4 lowered neutrophil infiltration and reduced liver damage. ROCK1nc mice also developed fewer diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumours, while HMGB1 inhibition increased HCC tumour numbers. Thus, ROCK1 activation and consequent cell contraction are required to limit sterile inflammation and damage amplification following tissue-scale cell death. Additionally, these findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for acute sterile inflammation as an efficient tumour-suppressive mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group

cell death and the efficient clearance of cell corpses are essential for the normal development, growth and maintenance of every tissue in the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Elliott and Ravichandran, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boada-Romero et al., 2020</xref>). The biochemical events leading from the sensation of intrinsic or extrinsic apoptotic stimuli to the execution of cell death have been thoroughly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elmore, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nagata, 2018</xref>). And yet, the purpose of the apoptotic morphological events of cell contraction, membrane blebbing and apoptotic body formation, which are the most obvious, earliest observed and defining hallmarks of apoptotic cell death, remains elusive. It has long been assumed that these apoptotic morphological changes are required for efficient clearance of apoptotic cell debris by phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orlando et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wickman et al., 2012</xref>), and that they limit the release of cellular contents that could provoke acute inflammatory responses and the development of autoimmunity over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagata et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this concept, defects in the recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanayama et al., 2004</xref>) result in autoimmune diseases in genetically modified mouse models. However, whether the apoptotic morphological responses are similarly essential for tissue homeostasis and organismal health have not been conclusively established.</p><p>Apoptotic cell death results from the activation of the cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases (caspases) that cleave target proteins at specific recognition sequences. We and others previously discovered that during apoptosis caspase cleavage of the ROCK1 protein kinase, at a highly conserved DETD sequence (amino acids 1110–1113) not found in the close homologue ROCK2, removes a C-terminal autoinhibitory domain to produce a constitutively active fragment with increased phosphorylating activity towards substrates including regulatory myosin light chains (MLCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sebbagh et al., 2001</xref>). MLC phosphorylation enhances actin-myosin contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Torgerson and McNiven, 1998</xref>), and both intact actin filaments and MLC phosphorylation are required for apoptotic membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mills et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman and Olson, 2002</xref>). Importantly, pharmacological inhibition revealed that ROCK contributed to MLC phosphorylation, cell contraction, membrane blebbing and nuclear fragmentation in apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croft et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wickman et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To establish the physiological importance of apoptotic ROCK1 activation by caspase cleavage, and the associated morphological events (e.g. contraction, blebbing), a genetically modified mouse was established in which a single amino acid in the ROCK1 caspase cleavage site was mutated (D1113A) to render the protein caspase-resistant. Analysis of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing wild-type ROCK1 (ROCK1wt) or non-cleavable ROCK1 (ROCK1nc) revealed that caspase-mediated ROCK1 activation was essential for increased MLC phosphorylation and the generation of contractile force during apoptosis. While apoptotic ROCK1wt MEFs underwent typical contraction and membrane blebbing, ROCK1nc MEF death morphologically resembled necrosis, which was associated with greater release of cellular contents during late apoptosis. Surprisingly, ROCK1nc mice manifested no overt indications of autoimmunity, including glomerulonephritis, haemolytic anaemia, cytopenia, splenomegaly or splenic hemosiderin deposition, indicating that the altered morphological changes during the basal apoptotic turnover of cells in adult tissues were insufficient to provoke phenotypic differences. However, following tissue-scale chemical induction of hepatocyte apoptosis, ROCK1nc mice had significantly more liver damage and greater levels of neutrophil infiltration. Inhibition of the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) protein high-mobility group B1 (HMGB1) or blocking signalling by its cognate pattern recognition receptor (PRR) toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment and liver damage in ROCK1nc mice, indicating that the ROCK1nc mutation led to greater sterile inflammation that amplified the initial hepatotoxin-induced injury. Interestingly, ROCK1nc mice developed fewer genotoxin-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumours than ROCK1wt mice, while HMGB1 inhibition concomitant with genotoxin administration increased tumour numbers. Although injury amplification may exacerbate the toxic effects of ingested xenobiotics, these findings reveal long-term benefits of acute sterile inflammation as an effective mechanism to suppress liver cancer. This study is the first to demonstrate that there is a critical role for ROCK1 cleavage and associated morphological events in limiting the deleterious effects of apoptotic cell death on tissue health.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ROCK1 cleavage is essential for increased MLC phosphorylation during apoptosis</title><p>Although it had previously been shown that a ROCK1 fragment equivalent to the caspase-cleaved form was more active than full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>), and that the increased MLC phosphorylation in apoptotic cells could be blocked by ROCK or caspase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sebbagh et al., 2001</xref>), direct ROCK1 activation solely by caspase cleavage had not been formally demonstrated. A recent study reported that ROCK2-specific activity was not affected by deletion of the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Truebestein et al., 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that in apoptotic cells ROCK1 cleavage plus an additional post-translational modification might be required for ROCK1 activation. While immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged kinase-dead (KD) ROCK1 K105M did not phosphorylate recombinant MLC in vitro, the ability of wild-type ROCK1 (ROCK1wt) to phosphorylate MLC was significantly increased approximately fivefold following in vitro cleavage by recombinant caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although basal activity of caspase-resistant non-cleavable ROCK1 D1113A (ROCK1nc) was equivalent to wild-type ROCK1, it was neither proteolyzed nor activated by recombinant caspase 3. Consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishizaki et al., 1997</xref>), a constitutively active (CA) ROCK1 fragment (ROCK1Δ2; amino acids 1–727) efficiently phosphorylated MLC. Thus, caspase-mediated removal of the autoinhibitory C-terminus is sufficient for ROCK1 activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ROCK1 cleavage is essential for increased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation during apoptosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative western blot showing Myc-tagged ROCK1 immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293T cells assayed in vitro for MLC phosphorylation (pMLC) without (-) or with (+) cleavage by recombinant active caspase 3.

The cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in conditioned media can be assayed as a proxy for cell death, but more accurately reflects loss of membrane integrity and cytoplasmic protein release. Eight hours after serum starvation, TNFα plus CHX or anti-CD95 antibody plus CHX treatment, there were no significant differences in LDH release from ROCK1nc relative to ROCK1wt MEFs for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, there was significantly more LDH released from ROCK1nc relative to ROCK1wt MEFs in each condition after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, 4 hr after treatment of ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc MEFs with TNFα plus CHX resulted in comparable cleavage of the well-characterized caspase substrate PARP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soldani and Scovassi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Over the 4 days after DEN treatment, F4/80-positive cell numbers were comparably reduced in ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, S100A9-positive neutrophils were present at significantly higher numbers in ROCK1nc livers 72 hr after DEN administration relative to ROCK1wt livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This difference in neutrophil recruitment to ROCK1nc livers was not replicated in an acute peritonitis model in which zymosan, a polysaccharide cell wall component derived from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cash et al., 2009</xref>), was injected into the peritoneal cavity of ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc mice to induce acute inflammation. At either 24 or 72 hr following zymosan injection, the numbers of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), white blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) or lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>) were equivalent in ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc mice. These results are consistent with the greater neutrophil numbers in ROCK1nc livers being a result of differences in the level of recruitment signal(s), rather than differing responses of neutrophils.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Higher neutrophil infiltration in chemically damaged ROCK1nc livers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with F4/80 antibody of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver sections from homozygous ROCK1wt (WT) or ROCK1nc (NC) mice 72 hr after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection.

In fact, release of the HMGB1 DAMP protein from necrotic hepatocytes was shown to recruit neutrophils that amplified the original injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huebener et al., 2015</xref>). HMGB1 is a chromatin-associated protein that translocates from nucleus to cytoplasm, from which it may undergo extracellular release during cell stress or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Khambu et al., 2019</xref>). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis 72 hr after DEN injection revealed significantly greater HMGB1 cytoplasmic translocation in ROCK1nc liver sections relative to ROCK1wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The ability of HMGB1 to recruit neutrophils to sites of injury stems from its interactions with DAMP receptors including TLR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabroe et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with HMGB1-mediating neutrophil recruitment in ROCK1nc livers, HMGB1 inhibition with glycyrrhizin (GLZ), which binds directly with HMGB1 and antagonizes its chemoattractant activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mollica et al., 2007</xref>), or the TLR4 intracellular signalling inhibitor CLI095 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ii et al., 2006</xref>) each significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment 72 hr after DEN treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Inhibition of HMGB1 and TLR4 also led to significantly fewer TUNEL-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and reduced serum ALT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, neither treatment affected the numbers of F4/80-stained macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results are consistent with the interpretation that the ROCK1nc mutation shifts hepatocyte cell death towards a more necrotic-like form that results in greater HMGB1-TLR4-dependent neutrophil recruitment and consequent amplification of DEN-induced liver damage.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of high-mobility group B1 (HMGB1) signalling reduces diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with anti-HMGB1 antibody of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver sections from homozygous ROCK1wt (WT) or ROCK1nc (NC) mice 72 hr after DEN injection.

The fewer number of liver tumours in ROCK1nc mice were clearly evident in macroscopic views of isolated livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which were confirmed by the significant differences in tumour numbers after 6 or 9 months determined by counting tumour numbers in H&amp;E-stained ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc liver sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

To test this hypothesis. ROCK1nc mice were treated with GLZ or DEN alone, or with the combination as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> over the 4-day tumour initiation period, which recapitulates the GLZ dosing regimen that reduced neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), hepatocyte death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and liver damage as determined by serum ALT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). After 9 months, during which there were no further treatments with either DEN or GLZ, the number of liver tumours induced by DEN plus GLZ was significantly higher than DEN alone, with GLZ treatment alone having no effect on tumour numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). There were no significant differences in the number of lung metastases between DEN or DEN plus GLZ-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), nor in the liver masses or liver/body mass ratios between three treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that the acute injury amplification associated with higher levels of neutrophil recruitment observed in DEN-treated ROCK1nc mice had a long-term benefit in reducing HCC tumour numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Furthermore, the ability of GLZ to attenuate neutrophil recruitment in DEN-treated ROCK1nc livers was associated with more HCC tumours, resembling the situation in ROCK1wt livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, the benefit from the ability of ROCK1 activation and consequent cell contraction to limit sterile inflammation and damage amplification during acute xenobiotic-induced tissue-scale cell death comes at the long-term cost of less efficient tumour suppression due to the survival of potential tumour-initiating cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Glycyrrhizin (GLZ) increases diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumour number in ROCK1nc mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline of the DEN-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and GLZ treatment protocol.

In fact, the dramatic contraction of apoptotic cells, and likely the formation of apoptotic bodies, was first identified in the livers of yellow fever patients by the Johns Hopkins Hospital pathologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Councilman, 1890</xref>. These eosin-stained ‘acidophilic bodies’ became known as Councilman bodies, which have been used for decades as a diagnostic feature of liver pathologies. Despite this long-standing awareness of the morphological changes that cells undergo during apoptotic death, their physiological roles in tissue homeostasis and organismal health have remained unclear. Cell-based experiments suggested that the forceful breaking of cells into pieces was important for efficient clearance by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orlando and Pittman, 2006</xref>). In addition, apoptotic cell death was proposed to limit inflammatory responses due to cellular contents being enclosed in membranes, in contrast to the robust inflammation induced by necrotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kerr et al., 1972</xref>). Despite the prevalence of these concepts, there had not been a direct in vivo model system that allowed for an evaluation of the importance of apoptotic cell morphologies.</p><p>The universal conservation of the ROCK1 second aspartate residue (D1113 in humans) within the caspase cleavage sequence in vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) is suggestive of caspase activation of ROCK1 being important such that it was conserved through evolution. Additional regulators of actin cytoskeleton organization have been reported both as being caspase cleaved and influencing apoptotic cell morphologies, including p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rudel and Bokoch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 1997</xref>), Lim kinase 1 (LIMK1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tomiyoshi et al., 2004</xref>) and the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) of the myosin phosphatase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iwasaki et al., 2013</xref>). As a result, despite the ability of ROCK inhibitors to block apoptotic cell contraction, nuclear disruption and membrane blebbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref

Importantly, this single amino acid change blocked the ability of apoptotic cells to generate contractile force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and altered the morphology of cells undergoing apoptotic death such that the typical pattern of contraction and membrane blebbing was shifted to a necrosis-like form of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that was more prone to the release of cellular contents over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results demonstrate the critical and central role of caspase-mediated ROCK1 activation in the manifestation of typical apoptotic cell morphological changes.</p><p>Despite the presumed importance of proper morphological events during apoptotic cell death, homozygous ROCK1nc mice were apparently healthy and reproduced normally over multiple rounds. Crosses of ROCK1wt/nc heterozygous breeding pairs resulted in offspring at expected Mendelian ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Adult mice aged for up to a year showed no overt signs of autoimmunity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>), indicating that the ROCK1nc mice tolerated any effects that the ROCK1nc mutation might have had on apoptotic cell death during the normal cell turnover in developing and adult tissues that occurs at a low but constitutive rate. It remains an open possibility that autoimmunity could spontaneously develop with low penetrance, with or without prolonged ageing, which would require very large mouse cohorts to detect. To determine whether typical morphological effects were important in response to a strong apoptotic stimulus, mice were treated with DEN, which acts in a liver-selective manner due to the need to be metabolized to a reactive compound by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakiri and Wagner, 2013</xref>). In this model of tissue-scale-induced apoptosis, the ROCK1nc mutation amplified the initial DEN-induced liver damage, which could be significantly reduced by inhibition of HMGB1-TLR4 signalling, key mediators of the pathogen-free sterile inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Nuñez, 2010</xref>). These observations are the first indication of a physiological role for ROCK1 activation by caspase cleavage, and the apoptosis-associated morphological events, in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis.</p><p>Chronic inflammation has well-documented roles in positively contributing to all stages of tumour initiation, growth and progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greten and Grivennikov, 2019</xref>). However, the lower number of liver tumours in ROCK1nc mice relative to ROCK1wt mice reveals a significant role of acute sterile inflammation as a mechanism for tumour suppression. This function may be particularly apropos in the liver where xenobiotic metabolism by P450 enzymes may inadvertently convert relatively inert compounds into reactive molecules with toxic and mutagenic actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wogan et al., 2004</xref>). Although the majority of cells exposed to these agents would likely be so damaged as to induce apoptosis, a subpopulation with altered genomic DNA might survive and replicate, thus passing on their acquired mutations that could eventually contribute to tumour initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulte-Hermann et al., 1999</xref>). In this context, neutrophil-mediated injury amplification would serve a useful purpose; the collateral damage they inflict in proximity to cells that died as a consequence of exposure to toxic mutagens would also eliminate many potential liver cancer-initiating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Zhu, 2019</xref>). A fine balance between the level of injury amplification that can be tolerated and the benefits from long-term tumour suppression has likely been achieved through evolution, including a role for ROCK1 cleavage to limit the extent of sterile inflammation.</p><p>Previous studies have evaluated the contribution of key apoptosis effector proteins by deleting them in genetically modified mice, such as deletion of the caspase-activated DNAse (CAD), which revealed a role for apoptotic DNA degradation in thymic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kawane et al., 2003</xref>). There are very few examples in which the importance of caspase cleavage of target proteins has been evaluated in vivo. A recent report showed that a D325A mutation in the caspase 8 cleavage site of the receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) resulted in embryonic lethality in homozygous mutant mice that was associated with hypersensitivity to TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lalaoui et al., 2020</xref>). This study revealed a role for caspase activation of ROCK1 in liver homeostasis when challenged with a strong apoptotic stimulus and a previously unknown role for sterile inflammation as a mechanism of tumour suppression. Future studies will likely reveal additional important contributions of the proper development of apoptotic cell morphological changes to the health of other tissues and organs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>In vitro ROCK1 caspase cleavage and kinase assay</title><p>ROCK1 kinase assays were performed with immunopurified full-length Myc-tagged wild-type, D1113A, KD K105M and CA Δ2 ROCK1 plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coleman et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ishizaki et al., 1997</xref>) that had been expressed in HEK293T cells.

IHC for F4/80 and S100A9 was performed by the Histology Service using the following conditions: F4/80 (Abcam), antigen retrieval with Proteinase K at room temperature for 10 min, primary antibody staining for 35 min at room temperature at 1:400 dilution; S100A9 (Santa Cruz), antigen retrieval with citrate buffer pH 6 at 98°C for 20 min, primary antibody staining for 35 min at 1:1000 dilution at room temperature. For secondary antibody staining, either ImmPRESS kits (Vector Labs) or Envision Reagents (Dako) were used by the Histology Service.</p><p>HMBG1 staining was performed as follows: sections were deparaffinized in xylene (three washes of 5 min each) and rehydrated through decreasing concentrations of ethanol (two washes of 3 min each in 100% ethanol, one wash for 3 min in 70% ethanol). Slides were then washed in distilled water (dH<sub>2</sub>O). To unmask antigen, slides were boiled at 98°C in a water bath for 20 min in citrate buffer pH 6. Slides were left to cool down to room temperature for at least 30 min and then rinsed in distilled water. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating sections in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in PBS for 10 min. After slides were rinsed once in distilled water and once in TBST, the sections were blocked using blocking solution containing 5% goat serum in Tris-buffered saline/Tween-20 (TBST; 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibody (Rabbit monoclonal anti-HMGB1, Abcam) diluted 1:100 in blocking solution was added to the slides and kept in a humidified chamber overnight. Slides were rinsed three times in TBST to remove excess/unbound primary antibody. HRP-labelled polymer anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Dako) was added to the slides and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Slides were rinsed again three times in TBST before staining with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB), as chromogen. Sections were incubated with DAB solution until brown colour developed and the slides immediately transferred to TBST to stop the reaction. For counterstaining, slides were rinsed in distilled water, then stained with haematoxylin for 1 min. In all antibody staining experiments, omitting the primary antibody on one slide served as a negative control.</p><p>Collagen deposition in liver sections was detected using Sirius Red and Fast Green as a counterstain as it binds to non-collagenous proteins.

Surprisingly, disrupting apoptotic blebbing has minimal effects in mice.

This is presumably due to the increased DAMPs that promote clearance of necrotic cells, since markers of apoptosis are not altered.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the reviewers found this paper interesting for a wide-readership, they felt that the conclusions could be better supported with clearer analysis (see below). One of the main points is that it is not clear how disrupting blebbing may cause secondary necrosis and the measurements for this were not completely convincing, as highlighted by Reviewer #2. The tumor studies also seem to require more statistical power and sufficient explanation, as they are currently counter intuitive and confusing. In the long-term, is there a physiological impact on death from cancer? For greater clarity and because we only have two reviewers, I have left the specific comments below to help you address these points, which we do not believe should create undue workload.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors have generated a mouse in which ROCK1 is not cleaved during apoptosis, owing to mutation of the caspase-cleavage site (ROCK1nc). They have confirmed that this cleavage is necessary for cell contraction during apoptosis. in vivo, the mice seem to have no phenotype, but do seem to show increased liver damage in response to DEN, with some effect on numbers of tumors. While there are some important weaknesses in the data, as noted below, much of the work is robust and the observations are reported appropriately. I do have issues with the interpretation, also noted below.</p><p>1. The data in Figure 1 are convincing and the experiments are well performed and interpreted, with the exception of the interpretation of Figure 1F. The rather small differences in LDH release are readily attributable to different cell lines (it is unclear how many times this was repeated with cells prepared from different animals). The main point, though, is that LDH is released in all cases (as expected at this time point) and there may be a little more when ROCK1 is not cleaved. It is possible that this effect might be more robust at earlier time points, but I don't see why ROCK1 cleavage should have anything to do with preventing secondary necrosis, per se, and LDH release is not necessarily the best indication of this (for example, while AnnV staining is unaffected, is the loss of plasma membrane integrity actually accelerated?). I would say simply tone down the interpretation, except it is at the center of their later conclusions, and this reviewer is not convinced.</p><p>2. Figure 2 is overall very nice, and the effects convincing. However, it seems that the difference reported in 2E is predominantly due to two WT cells (two others are in the same range as all the other cells). More numbers are needed here to make this convincing.</p><p>3. In Figure 3, the numbers are from &quot;3-11&quot; mice per group in 3A. It would be helpful if the data were presented as individual measurements with mean{plus minus}SD overlayed. This would help us see how many animals are represented at the most relevant time points. This applies to Figure 4 as well. These figures are integral to the paper, as they represents the data that support one of the key conclusions.</p><p>4. Figure 5A is meant to imply that the cleavage of ROCK1 prevents cytosolic localization of HMGB1 during apoptosis. This is potentially interesting, but clearly, if this is important, it should be readily demonstrated in vitro, where HMGB1 localization can be much more quantitatively evaluated. Since they wish to conclude that increased release of HMGB1 is responsible for the increased neutrophil infiltration, I have to ask-is more HMGB1 released from the ROCK1nc cells than WT during apoptosis? Again, this is readily evaluated in vitro.</p><p>5. While Glycyrrhizin binds to HMGB1 with low affinity (in the range of 0.15 mM) and may inhibit its immunostimulatory effects, this extract of black licorice (also present in many traditional Chinese medicines) is by no means a specific inhibitor of HMGB1. That it has an anti-inflammatory effect is known and is clear in the presented data, but this result is wildly over-interpreted. The effect of TLR4 inhibition by CL1095 is also clear, but there are many explanations for this, in vivo, beyond the conclusion that it is blocking HMGB1 activation of TLR4. Please do not over-interpret this result.</p><p>6. Why should GLZ or CL1095 inhibit apoptosis in the ROCK1cn mice treated with DEN? (Figure 5c). I can think of no rationale for this, unless the TUNEL positivity is predominantly from dying neutrophils.</p><p>7. Tumor number but not volume appear to be decreased in DEN treated ROCK1nc mice (Figure 6C,D), and this experiment is sufficiently powered to draw this conclusion (at least at 9 months). The authors also suggest that numbers of lung mets at 6 (but not 9) months are reduced (Figure 6E) however it is not clear that this result is sufficiently powered (5 mice/group) to claim a p value of less than 0.0001 when the difference is a mean of 3.5 vs 1.5 (this looks like classic type 2 statistical error). These latter results should not be over-interpreted--there are no evidence that numbers of mets are reduced based on these data.</p><p>8. The results in Figure 6 and 7 are interesting, but also confusing. Increased inflammation, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration would be expected to increase, not decrease HCC. Neutrophils are reportedly required for HCC in the DEN model (e.g. PMID 25879839). The author's suggestion is that increased tumors arise from cells that engage enough active caspase-3 to cleave ROCK1 but somehow survive, and if ROCK1 cannot be cleaved these cells die. I know it is speculation, but it is without basis. The evidence (including that of the authors) is clear that ROCK1 cleavage does not affect the propensity for cell death during apoptosis. Are the authors suggesting that ROCK1 cleavage is necessary for survival? (This relates to the phenomenon of anastasis, which is somewhat controversial, but I guess it is possible). I understand that the authors are only trying to explain their somewhat paradoxical results, but I suggest they should pitch another explanation if possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript, 'Defective apoptotic cell contractility provokes sterile inflammation leading to liver damage and tumour suppression' by Julian et al. reveals interesting physiological roles for apoptotic blebbing in response to liver damage and cancer growth. Blebbing of apoptotic cells is a conserved process but its role is not very clear and they examine the impacts in cell culture and in a mouse model. They show very beautifully that a mutation at Asp 1113 in ROCK1 prevents the caspase cleavage-dependent but not normal ROCK1 activity, resulting in a lack of blebbing. Surprisingly, this mutation in a mouse causes little to no phenotypes, suggesting that its role is subtle.</p><p>However, in response to liver damage, there is a pronounced increase in neutrophils and, over the long-term, this translates to fewer hepatocellular carcinomas. This is presumably due to the increased DAMPs that promote clearance of necrotic cells, since markers of apoptosis are not altered. I think that this is an interesting story and well-written. While I enjoyed the historical perspective, overall, I felt that there was a bit too much data and some of the results that showed no difference could be shifted to supplement to tighten up the story.</p><p>I have only a few other questions:</p><p>1. In figure 1, although the graphs show that there is no significance from the mutant, there does seem to be a surprising trend of having higher, Annexin V, capase and LDH in the NC mutant. Could there be some reason for this. Do they accumulate more over time?</p><p>2. In Figure 3 B, the H&amp;E, the mutant seems to have higher cellularity. I can't really tell because it is so low mag but is there some other difference in the structures outside of the Steatosis?</p><p>3. Why is there a different neutrophil response between zymosan and DEN? I am not sure what the point of this is in the paper.</p><p>4. In Figure 6 A, are the livers in the WT always smaller but more tumour filled?</p><p>5. Figure 7B could be moved into supplement, as there are no differences, however, I would like to see examples of the tissues for each score.</p><p>6. At the end of the day, does it matter that there are fewer tumours in the liver? Does it change the Kaplan-Meier curve? If not, I might limit what you say about its relevance to cancer. You might expect that it could help launch more of an immune response but since over time they develop the same number of metastases, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Defective apoptotic cell contractility provokes sterile inflammation leading to liver damage and tumour suppression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Unfortunately, the isolation of primary hepatocytes from ROCK1nc and ROCK1wt mice did not yield sufficient numbers of viable cells to perform this biochemical experiment.</p><p>New comment: I do not see why this experiment would require the use of primary hepatocytes (although nice, even showing this in MEF would be helpful). The authors conclude that the failure to cleave ROCK1 leads to more release of HMGB1 from cells during apoptosis, and provide no evidence that this is the case. As this is a major conclusion of the paper, it requires more evidence to support it.</p><p>Previous comment: The results in Figure 6 and 7 are interesting, but also confusing. Increased inflammation, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration would be expected to increase, not decrease HCC. Neutrophils are reportedly required for HCC in the DEN model (e.g. PMID 25879839). The author's suggestion is that increased tumors arise from cells that engage enough active caspase-3 to cleave ROCK1 but somehow survive, and if ROCK1 cannot be cleaved these cells die.

I understand that the authors are only trying to explain their somewhat paradoxical results, but I suggest they should pitch another explanation.</p><p>Response: In order to clarify the hypothesis that was being tested, the manuscript has been amended on page 15 lines 332-341. &quot;Given that acute DEN treatment resulted in greater liver damage and hepatocyte cell death in ROCK1nc mice relative to ROCK1wt mice (Figure 4), a possibility was that more mutated hepatocytes that might have given rise to liver tumours were killed by DEN in ROCK1nc livers than in ROCK1wt livers. To test this hypothesis. ROCK1nc mice were treated with GLZ or DEN alone, or with the combination as shown in Figure 8A over the 4 day tumour initiation period, which recapitulates the GLZ dosing regimen that reduced neutrophil recruitment (Figure 5B), hepatocyte death (Figure 5C) and liver damage as determined by serum alanine transaminase levels (Figure 5D). After 9 months, during which there was no further treatment with either DEN or GLZ, the number of liver tumours induced by DEN plus GLZ was significantly higher than DEN alone, with GLZ treatment alone having no effect on tumour numbers (Figure 8B).&quot;</p><p>New comment: The issue I continue to have is with this statement: &quot;a possibility was that more mutated hepatocytes that might have given rise to liver tumours were killed by DEN in ROCK1nc livers than in ROCK1wt livers. To test this hypothesis, ROCK1nc mice were treated with GLZ or DEN alone, or with the combination.&quot; This does not test the hypothesis. The data show that there is less death upon treatment with GLZ or the TLR4i (Figure 5b), and therefore it is not the DEN that kills the hepatocytes but apparently the neutrophils (unless, as I mentioned, they are actually scoring apoptotic neutrophils, which I cannot assess from these images). As I continue to maintain, there is no good reason to think that a failure to cleave ROCK1 would prevent apoptosis to result in survival of the cells, and no data are presented to even suggest this possibility. I would ask that the authors consider an alternative hypothesis, or simply leave this as a paradox (since, as noted, neutrophil recruitment might be expected to exacerbate, not reduce tumor numbers in this model). As currently stated, I think that readers will be confused by the reasoning here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61983.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this paper, the authors have generated a mouse in which ROCK1 is not cleaved during apoptosis, owing to mutation of the caspase-cleavage site (ROCK1nc). They have confirmed that this cleavage is necessary for cell contraction during apoptosis. in vivo, the mice seem to have no phenotype, but do seem to show increased liver damage in response to DEN, with some effect on numbers of tumors. While there are some important weaknesses in the data, as noted below, much of the work is robust and the observations are reported appropriately. I do have issues with the interpretation, also noted below.</p><p>1. The data in Figure 1 are convincing and the experiments are well performed and interpreted, with the exception of the interpretation of Figure 1F. The rather small differences in LDH release are readily attributable to different cell lines (it is unclear how many times this was repeated with cells prepared from different animals). The main point, though, is that LDH is released in all cases (as expected at this time point) and there may be a little more when ROCK1 is not cleaved. It is possible that this effect might be more robust at earlier time points, but I don't see why ROCK1 cleavage should have anything to do with preventing secondary necrosis, per se, and LDH release is not necessarily the best indication of this (for example, while AnnV staining is unaffected, is the loss of plasma membrane integrity actually accelerated?). I would say simply tone down the interpretation, except it is at the center of their later conclusions, and this reviewer is not convinced.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included data from 8 hr post-induction of apoptosis for comparison with the 24 hr data originally included (Figure 1F). What is apparent is that there are no significant differences between ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc cells in each condition at 8 hr, which contrasts with the significant differences observed at 24 hr. This does suggest that the loss of membrane integrity is somewhat accelerated given the differences between the 8 to 24 hour time points, but we would prefer to leave the interpretation on manuscript page 7 lines 159-161 “that the inability of caspases to activate ROCK1 and to induce MLC phosphorylation result in morphological differences favouring secondary necrosis during late apoptosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 2 is overall very nice, and the effects convincing. However, it seems that the difference reported in 2E is predominantly due to two WT cells (two others are in the same range as all the other cells). More numbers are needed here to make this convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify these findings, the box and whiskers plots have been re-configured as bar charts indicating means ± SD. It is now clearer that greater than 50% of the apoptotic ROCK1wt cells produced more contractile force than all but one of the apoptotic ROCK1nc cells. It has also been indicated that the force generated by apoptotic ROCK1nc cells was not significantly different from non-apoptotic ROCK1nc cells, in marked contrast to apoptotic ROCK1wt cells that produced more contractile force than any other experimental condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 3, the numbers are from &quot;3-11&quot; mice per group in 3A. It would be helpful if the data were presented as individual measurements with mean{plus minus}SD overlayed. This would help us see how many animals are represented at the most relevant time points. This applies to Figure 4 as well. These figures are integral to the paper, as they represents the data that support one of the key conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>All panels in Figures 3 and 4 have been re-drawn to indicate the individual measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 5A is meant to imply that the cleavage of ROCK1 prevents cytosolic localization of HMGB1 during apoptosis. This is potentially interesting, but clearly, if this is important, it should be readily demonstrated in vitro, where HMGB1 localization can be much more quantitatively evaluated. Since they wish to conclude that increased release of HMGB1 is responsible for the increased neutrophil infiltration, I have to ask-is more HMGB1 released from the ROCK1nc cells than WT during apoptosis? Again, this is readily evaluated in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>This suggested experiment is very good, and we did attempt to address this question. Unfortunately, the isolation of primary hepatocytes from ROCK1nc and ROCK1wt mice did not yield sufficient numbers of viable cells to perform this biochemical experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. While Glycyrrhizin binds to HMGB1 with low affinity (in the range of 0.15 mM) and may inhibit its immunostimulatory effects, this extract of black licorice (also present in many traditional Chinese medicines) is by no means a specific inhibitor of HMGB1. That it has an anti-inflammatory effect is known and is clear in the presented data, but this result is wildly over-interpreted. The effect of TLR4 inhibition by CL1095 is also clear, but there are many explanations for this, in vivo, beyond the conclusion that it is blocking HMGB1 activation of TLR4. Please do not over-interpret this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We have qualified the conclusions of these experiments from line 299 as follows “These results are consistent with the interpretation that the ROCK1nc mutation shifts hepatocyte cell death towards a more necrotic-like form that results in greater HMGB1-TLR4 dependent neutrophil recruitment and consequent amplification of DEN induced liver damage.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Why should GLZ or CL1095 inhibit apoptosis in the ROCK1cn mice treated with DEN? (Figure 5c). I can think of no rationale for this, unless the TUNEL positivity is predominantly from dying neutrophils.</p></disp-quote><p>Neutrophil-mediated injury amplification has been reported in numerous publications, including [Huebener et al. The HMGB1/RAGE axis triggers neutrophil-mediated injury amplification following necrosis. J. Clin. Invest. 125, 539–550 (2015).] The interpretation that we presented on manuscript pages 13-14 is that the significantly reduced neutrophil recruitment in mice treated with GLZ or CLI095 in addition to DEN (Figure 5B) resulted in less liver damage, as indicated by fewer apoptotic cells (Figure 5C) and reduced serum alanine transaminase release (Figure 5D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Tumor number but not volume appear to be decreased in DEN treated ROCK1nc mice (Figure 6C,D), and this experiment is sufficiently powered to draw this conclusion (at least at 9 months). The authors also suggest that numbers of lung mets at 6 (but not 9) months are reduced (Figure 6E) however it is not clear that this result is sufficiently powered (5 mice/group) to claim a p value of less than 0.0001 when the difference is a mean of 3.5 vs 1.5 (this looks like classic type 2 statistical error). These latter results should not be over-interpreted – there are no evidence that numbers of mets are reduced based on these data.</p></disp-quote><p>The observations that tumour volumes and number of metastases were not significantly different between ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc mice at both 6 and 9 month time points was indicated on manuscript page 14 lines 312-316. The conclusion to this section on manuscript page 15 lines 329-331 was amended as follows “These results indicate that the principal difference between the liver tumours in ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc mice was related to their initiation rather than growth or progression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The results in Figure 6 and 7 are interesting, but also confusing. Increased inflammation, necrosis, and neutrophil infiltration would be expected to increase, not decrease HCC. Neutrophils are reportedly required for HCC in the DEN model (e.g. PMID 25879839). The author's suggestion is that increased tumors arise from cells that engage enough active caspase-3 to cleave ROCK1 but somehow survive, and if ROCK1 cannot be cleaved these cells die. I know it is speculation, but it is without basis. The evidence (including that of the authors) is clear that ROCK1 cleavage does not affect the propensity for cell death during apoptosis. Are the authors suggesting that ROCK1 cleavage is necessary for survival? (This relates to the phenomenon of anastasis, which is somewhat controversial, but I guess it is possible). I understand that the authors are only trying to explain their somewhat paradoxical results, but I suggest they should pitch another explanation if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to clarify the hypothesis that was being tested, the manuscript has been amended on page 15 lines 332-341. “Given that acute DEN treatment resulted in greater liver damage and hepatocyte cell death in ROCK1nc mice relative to ROCK1wt mice (Figure 4), a possibility was that more mutated hepatocytes that might have given rise to liver tumours were killed by DEN in ROCK1nc livers than in ROCK1wt livers. […] After 9 months, during which there was no further treatment with either DEN or GLZ, the number of liver tumours induced by DEN plus GLZ was significantly higher than DEN alone, with GLZ treatment alone having no effect on tumour numbers (Figure 8B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript, 'Defective apoptotic cell contractility provokes sterile inflammation leading to liver damage and tumour suppression' by Julian et al. reveals interesting physiological roles for apoptotic blebbing in response to liver damage and cancer growth. Blebbing of apoptotic cells is a conserved process but its role is not very clear and they examine the impacts in cell culture and in a mouse model. They show very beautifully that a mutation at Asp 1113 in ROCK1 prevents the caspase cleavage-dependent but not normal ROCK1 activity, resulting in a lack of blebbing. Surprisingly, this mutation in a mouse causes little to no phenotypes, suggesting that its role is subtle. However, in response to liver damage, there is a pronounced increase in neutrophils and, over the long-term, this translates to fewer hepatocellular carcinomas. This is presumably due to the increased DAMPs that promote clearance of necrotic cells, since markers of apoptosis are not altered. I think that this is an interesting story and well-written. While I enjoyed the historical perspective, overall, I felt that there was a bit too much data and some of the results that showed no difference could be shifted to supplement to tighten up the story.</p><p>I have only a few other questions:</p><p>1. In figure 1, although the graphs show that there is no significance from the mutant, there does seem to be a surprising trend of having higher, Annexin V, capase and LDH in the NC mutant. Could there be some reason for this. Do they accumulate more over time?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that the apparently greater, albeit not significant, Annexin V staining in ROCK1nc MEFs in Figure 1D is related to the reduced contractile force generation shown in Figure 2, but that would be speculative. In addition, we previously showed that pharmacological inhibition of ROCK activity did not affect Annexin V staining in NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts [Coleman, M. L. et al. Membrane blebbing during apoptosis results from caspase-mediated activation of ROCK I. Nat. Cell Biol. 3, 339–345 (2001)]. As a result, this is more likely to be biological variability. Caspase activation was slightly higher in response to anti-CD95, but lower in response to TNFα in ROCK1nc MEFs, but neither difference in activity was significantly different, again suggesting that this is biological variability. On the other hand, LDH release was significantly higher in response to nutrient starvation, TNFα or anti-CD95 after 24 hours for ROCK1nc MEFs relative to ROCK1wt MEFs. This observation is likely biologically relevant, and have included the interpretation on manuscript page 7 lines 159-161 that “that the inability of caspases to activate ROCK1 and to induce MLC phosphorylation result in morphological differences favouring secondary necrosis during late apoptosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 3 B, the H&amp;E, the mutant seems to have higher cellularity. I can't really tell because it is so low mag but is there some other difference in the structures outside of the Steatosis?</p></disp-quote><p>On manuscript pages 11-12 lines 244 to 256, the histopathological features were described as follows: “At 24 hours post DEN treatment, H&amp;E stained ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc liver sections exhibited comparable hepatocyte ballooning and mild microvesicular steatosis around the centrilobular regions. […] However, ROCK1nc livers continued to have significantly larger necrotic areas relative to ROCK1wt livers (Figure 3B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Why is there a different neutrophil response between zymosan and DEN? I am not sure what the point of this is in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The point of comparing DEN-induced neutrophil recruitment to livers with zymosan-induced recruitment to the peritoneal compartment was to determine whether the observed difference between DEN-treated ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc livers in Figure 4B was likely due to recruitment versus the responsiveness of the neutrophils. Given that zymosan induced the same neutrophil responses in Figure 4D, this indicates that the neutrophils (as well as whole blood cells, monocytes and lymphocytes) respond to the zymosan stimulus comparably in each genotype. The interpretation is that the differences in Figure 4B are due to the way that the hepatocytes die in ROCK1nc livers and release signals that recruit neutrophils. This interpretation is consistent with the differences in HMGB1 translocation shown in Figure 5A. On manuscript page 13 lines 279-282, the conclusion we included was “These results are consistent with the greater neutrophil numbers in ROCK1nc livers being a result of differences in the level of recruitment signal(s), rather than differing responses of neutrophils.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 6 A, are the livers in the WT always smaller but more tumour filled?</p></disp-quote><p>The livers in Figure 6A are representative examples 9 months after tumour initiation with DEN. The liver mass and liver/body mass ratios in Figures 7A and 7C are also for samples collected 9 months after DEN treatment. These data reveal that there are no significant differences between the ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc livers, thus the apparent differences in the photos are merely a reflection of sample to sample variability within the genotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 7B could be moved into supplement, as there are no differences, however, I would like to see examples of the tissues for each score.</p></disp-quote><p>Assuming that it’s Figure 7D that is being referenced, examples of the histopathological features of DEN-induced HCC that were used to score tumours have now been included in a new Supplementary file 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. At the end of the day, does it matter that there are fewer tumours in the liver? Does it change the Kaplan-Meier curve? If not, I might limit what you say about its relevance to cancer. You might expect that it could help launch more of an immune response but since over time they develop the same number of metastases, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>At the commencement of the tumour studies, a decision was made to use fixed endpoints (6 and 9 months) to evaluate the influence of the ROCK1nc mutation, based on numerous previous publications that have utilized DEN and other chemically induced models (reviewed in: Carlessi et al. Chapter 4. Mouse Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma. In: Tirnitz-Parker, editor. Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Codon Publications; 2019 doi: 10.15586/hepatocellularcarcinoma.2019.ch4). Fixed endpoints do not allow for evaluation of the effect of the experimental conditions on survival, but do reveal other important cancer-relevant aspects, including potential influence on tumour initiation, growth and progression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>My review is based on the previous review and the authors' responses.</p><p>Previous comment: Figure 5A is meant to imply that the cleavage of ROCK1 prevents cytosolic localization of HMGB1 during apoptosis.

As this is a major conclusion of the paper, it requires more evidence to support it.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we examined HMGB1 release from ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc MEFs. Data shown in a new Figure 1G (and accompanying Figure 1—figure supplement 1D) reveals that cleavage of the well-validated caspase substrate PARP1 is equivalent in cell lysates 4 hours after treatment with TNFα + cycloheximide in ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc MEFs, and yet there is markedly more HMGB1 released into conditioned media 24 hours after the induction of apoptosis. These results are consistent with Figure 1F that shows significantly greater release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in ROCK1nc MEFs 24 hours after the induction of apoptosis. The manuscript has been revised on lines 162-170 as follows:</p><p>“Furthermore, four hours after treatment of ROCK1wt and ROCK1nc MEFs with TNFα plus CHX resulted in comparable cleavage of the well-characterized caspase substate PARP1 (Figure 1G and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D).

To test this hypothesis. ROCK1nc mice were treated with GLZ or DEN alone, or with the combination as shown in Figure 8A over the 4 day tumour initiation period, which recapitulates the GLZ dosing regimen that reduced neutrophil recruitment (Figure 5B), hepatocyte death (Figure 5C) and liver damage as determined by serum alanine transaminase levels (Figure 5D). After 9 months, during which there was no further treatment with either DEN or GLZ, the number of liver tumours induced by DEN plus GLZ was significantly higher than DEN alone, with GLZ treatment alone having no effect on tumour numbers (Figure 8B).&quot;</p><p>New comment: The issue I continue to have is with this statement: &quot;a possibility was that more mutated hepatocytes that might have given rise to liver tumours were killed by DEN in ROCK1nc livers than in ROCK1wt livers. To test this hypothesis, ROCK1nc mice were treated with GLZ or DEN alone, or with the combination.&quot; This does not test the hypothesis. The data show that there is less death upon treatment with GLZ or the TLR4i (Figure 5b), and therefore it is not the DEN that kills the hepatocytes but apparently the neutrophils (unless, as I mentioned, they are actually scoring apoptotic neutrophils, which I cannot assess from these images). As I continue to maintain, there is no good reason to think that a failure to cleave ROCK1 would prevent apoptosis to result in survival of the cells, and no data are presented to even suggest this possibility.

The reviewer is correct in pointing out that all the</p><p>data collected indicates that ROCK1 cleavage does not make cells intrinsically more or less sensitive to apoptotic stimuli. Our suggestion is that the amplification of the DEN-induced damage by neutrophils in the acute 3-4 day period following administration has a longer term consequence on the number of tumours formed. Specifically, the greater numbers of neutrophils recruited in ROCK1nc livers results in more cell death because of damage amplification that is greater than the direct effect of DEN. The fact that there is more death results in there being fewer tumours 9 months later. GLZ addition reduced the acute neutrophil recruitment and tissue damage, as indicated by the reductions in S100A9 stained cells, TUNEL positive cells and serum alanine transaminase levels (Figure 5B-D). Looking 9 months later, that tissue protective effect of GLZ allows for more tumours to develop from cells that survived and which were mutated by DEN. It isn’t expected that neutrophils would persist over time, the data in Figure 4B shows that the numbers normalize 4 days after DEN treatment. Since DEN administration is done as a single dose, there wouldn’t be a chance for neutrophils to affect tumour development beyond the first few days following drug treatment.</p><p>The sentences on lines 344-347 have been amended to: “Given that acute DEN treatment resulted in greater liver damage and hepatocyte cell death in ROCK1nc mice relative to ROCK1wt mice (Figure 4), a possibility was that more mutated hepatocytes, which might have given rise to liver tumours, were killed following DEN administration in ROCK1nc livers than in ROCK1wt livers.”</p><p>In addition, the following has been added to lines 358-366: “Taken together, these results indicate that the acute injury amplification associated with higher levels of neutrophil recruitment observed in DEN treated ROCK1nc mice had a long-term benefit in reducing HCC tumour numbers (Figure 8D). […] Thus, the benefit from the ability of ROCK1 activation and consequent cell contraction to limit sterile inflammation and damage amplification during acute xenobiotic-induced tissue-scale cell death comes at the long-term cost of less efficient tumour suppression due to the survival of potential tumour initiating cells.”</p><p>A new Figure 8D schematic diagram has been added to illustrate the interpretation of the results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
