pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34469.001</object-id><p>Transport of biologically active molecules across tight epithelial barriers is a major challenge preventing therapeutic peptides from oral drug delivery. Here, we identify a set of synthetic glycosphingolipids that harness the endogenous process of intracellular lipid-sorting to enable mucosal absorption of the incretin hormone GLP-1. Peptide cargoes covalently fused to glycosphingolipids with ceramide domains containing C6:0 or smaller fatty acids were transported with 20-100-fold greater efficiency across epithelial barriers in vitro and in vivo. This was explained by structure-function of the ceramide domain in intracellular sorting and by the affinity of the glycosphingolipid species for insertion into and retention in cell membranes. In mice, GLP-1 fused to short-chain glycosphingolipids was rapidly and systemically absorbed after gastric gavage to affect glucose tolerance with serum bioavailability comparable to intraperitoneal injection of GLP-1 alone. This is unprecedented for mucosal absorption of therapeutic peptides, and defines a technology with many other clinical applications.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34469.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To work properly, drugs need to be absorbed efficiently into the body. Medications that are injected directly into the bloodstream are often quickly transported to the organs or tissues they target. But injections are not always convenient, and many patients would instead prefer to swallow a pill or tablet. If a drug is swallowed, however, it must first be absorbed through the gut before it can enter the bloodstream.</p><p>The lining of the gut consists of tightly linked layers of cells that readily take up small molecules, such as water and simple nutrients, but exclude almost all larger ones. Since several important types of drugs are large or poorly absorbed molecules, such as proteins, finding methods to help them cross the gut barrier is a major part of drug development.</p><p>Originally from bacteria, cholera toxin is an example of a large, naturally occurring protein that does cross the gut lining. To do this, the toxin specifically attaches onto GM1, a type of lipid molecule that is found on the outer surface of gut cells, and hijacks the system that moves this lipid within cells. Previous studies identified several key features of GM1’s structure that enable this movement; and, in 2014, researchers tested GM1 as a ‘carrier’ to help the gut to absorb large therapeutic molecules. This approach was successful in cells grown in the laboratory, but not when the drugs were fed to animals.</p><p>To overcome this issue, Garcia-Castillo, Chinnapen et al. – who include some of the researchers involved in the earlier studies – set out to further boost GM1’s ability to transport drugs across the gut lining. First several hybrid molecules were made, consisting of different structures of GM1 (the ‘carrier’) fused to a reporter peptide (the ‘cargo’). Laboratory experiments with human intestinal cells and dog kidney cells, both of which form tightly-linked layers much like the actual lining of the gut, revealed specific structural variations of the GM1-derived carrier that transported the cargo across the cell barrier more efficiently.</p><p>Garcia-Castillo, Chinnapen et al. went on to test the efficiency of these carriers further by switching the reporter cargo to a therapeutic hormone called GLP-1. This hormone is used to treat people with type II diabetes but is currently given via an injection. The same structural variants of GM1 that enhanced delivery of the reporter cargo also worked for the larger GLP-1 hormone. Garcia-Castillo, Chinnapen et al. then fed the GM1-GLP-1 fusions to mice, and measured the amount of GLP-1 hormone absorbed into the blood. Crucially, the mice fed GM1-GLP-1 molecules absorbed the drug just as well as mice injected with the GLP-1 that is normally given to diabetes patients.</p><p>Together these findings represent a major contribution to the pharmaceutical toolbox. They may also ultimately lead to more drugs that can be given as a patient-friendly pill or tablet, readily cross the gut barrier and achieve widespread drug delivery around the body.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glycolipids/gangliosides</kwd><kwd>lipid sorting</kwd><kwd>drug delivery</kwd><kwd>GLP-1/ diabetes</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK111072-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia-Castillo</surname><given-names>Maria Daniela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK104868</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chinnapen</surname><given-names>Daniel J.-F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lencer</surname><given-names>Wayne I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK048106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lencer</surname><given-names>Wayne I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK31036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kahn</surname><given-names>C.

In the case of epithelial cells lining mucosal surfaces, the pathway for absorption of large solutes is by transcytosis – a process of transcellular endosome trafficking that connects one surface of the cell with the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tuma and Hubbard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mostov et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garcia-Castillo et al., 2017</xref>). The same is true for transport of protein and peptide cargoes across tight endothelial barriers that separate blood from tissue - typified by the blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pardridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Preston et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lajoie and Shusta, 2015</xref>). Here, we address these problems by testing structure-function of the glycosphingolipids for their intracellular trafficking in transcytosis, and for their use as vehicles to enable transcellular transport of therapeutic peptides.</p><p>These studies were informed by our findings that the structure of the ceramide (lipid) domain plays a decisive role in the intracellular trafficking of the glycosphingolipid GM1, the lipid receptor responsible for cholera toxin entry into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of host cells and required for disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinnapen et al., 2012</xref>). GM1 species containing ceramides with ‘kinked’ <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated C18:1 or C16:1 fatty acids, or non-native ‘short chain’ C12:0 fatty acids, enter the sorting/recycling endosome of epithelial cells allowing for transport to various intracellular destinations: including the recycling pathway and retrograde pathway to the Golgi and ER. These lipids do not efficiently traffic into the late endosome-lysosome pathway. In contrast, GM1 sphingolipids with long saturated fatty acid chains (C16:0 or longer) sort almost exclusively into late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinnapen et al., 2012</xref>). The sorting step separating the intracellular distributions of these closely related lipids emerges from the early sorting endosome, and we find it robust across all cell lines so far tested. Our observations are consistent with the two major models for lipid sorting: one by molecular shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mayor et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mukherjee et al., 1999</xref>) and the other by membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brown, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Simons and Ehehalt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Simons and Vaz, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In polarized epithelial cells, another pathway emerges from the sorting endosome and leads to membrane transport across the cell by transcytosis. The same GM1 species with <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated or short-chain fatty acids that efficiently enter the recycling endosome also sort into this pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Saslowsky et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">te Welscher et al., 2014</xref>). By analogy with the bacterial toxins and viruses that bind glycosphingolipids for trafficking into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinnapen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Spooner and Lord, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ewers and Helenius, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cho et al., 2012</xref>), this result suggested a means for enabling the uptake and transepithelial transport of protein or peptide therapeutic cargoes for mucosal delivery. Our first attempt to test this idea showed that these glycosphingolipid species were capable of sorting a therapeutic cargo into the transcytotic pathway. But release into solution to effect transport across epithelial barriers in vitro, or absorption into the systemic circulation in vivo was not detectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">te Welscher et al., 2014</xref>). To solve this problem, we conducted additional structure-function studies for the glycosphingolipids in intracellular sorting and discovered modifications of the ceramide and oligosaccharide domains that enable the lipids to act as molecular carriers for mucosal absorption of therapeutic peptides, achieving levels of bioavailability comparable to that of intraperitoneal injection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure-function studies on the ceramide domain of GM1</title><p>To test if GM1 glycosphingolipids can be harnessed for biologic drug delivery, we first developed a non-degradable all D-isomer reporter peptide for structure-function studies on the ceramide domain. The reporter peptide was designed to contain two functional groups, a biotin for high-affinity streptavidin-enrichment, and an alkyne reactive group for chemical ligation to fluorophore molecules and quantitative detection. A C-terminal reactive aminooxy was used for coupling the reporter peptide to the oligosaccharide domain of the different GM1 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">te Welscher et al., 2014</xref>). The functional groups on the reporter peptide, that is biotin, alkyne, fluorophore and combinations of, were tested to verify the absence of confounding effects on GM1 trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This was assessed by confocal microscopy for endosome sorting and transcytosis, using fluorescent cholera toxin B-subunit to label the GM1-peptide fusion molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In all cases, the peptide-coupled GM1 species containing <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated or short fatty acid ceramide domains sorted into small cytoplasmic vesicles and basolateral membranes consistent with the recycling and transcytotic pathways, whereas the peptide-coupled GM1 species containing saturated long fatty acid ceramide domains did not; they were sorted into larger cytoplasmic puncta consistent with the late endosome/lysosome instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Both events were blocked at 4°C consistent with uptake by endocytosis.

Apical membranes of MDCK cell monolayers were loaded at 10°C with equal amounts of C12:0 and C6:0-GM1-peptide fusions, washed, and then incubated at 37°C and imaged by live-cell confocal microscopy over time. Transcytosis was measured as fluorescence at basolateral membranes. By this method, we found no detectable difference among the two GM1 species in the rate of transcytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In both cases, basolateral membranes were fluorescent after a 10 min chase. At longer chase times, however, we observed a dramatic difference between the C6:0- and C12:0-peptide fusion molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Monolayers loaded with the C12:0-GM1 peptide fusion stained brightly at both the apical (bottom left panel) and basolateral membranes (bottom right panel). In stark contrast, monolayers loaded with the C6:0-GM1 peptide fusion showed no fluorescence (middle panels). We interpreted this result as indicating a higher rate of release from cell membranes to the basolateral solution and emptying the cell of the peptide-GM1 fusion over time. To test this idea, we quantified the rate of release from cell membranes for the fluorescent GM1-peptide fusion molecules (Material and Methods). We studied the rate of GM1 release into DMEM media alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as into DMEM containing defatted bovine albumin (BSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pagano, 1989</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

These are structurally diverse and operate in a variety of biologic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantù et al., 2011</xref>). In all cases, however, the oligosaccharide head group acts to trap sphingolipids in the outer leaflet of cell membranes, thus rendering the lipids dependent on membrane trafficking for their distribution across the cell. To test if the effects of ceramide structure on transcytosis and membrane-release were specific to GM1 glycosphingolipids, or could be generalized to other glycosphingolipid species, we fused our reporter peptide to a GM3 ganglioside synthesized to contain ceramide domains with either C12:0 or C6:0 fatty acids. The oligosaccharide domain of GM3 differs from GM1 by the absence of two sugars and thus lacks the terminal galactose (and GalNAc) that functions strongly as a lectin-binding site in GM1. When tested for transcytosis, we unexpectedly found that the GM3-C12:0-peptide fusion molecule crosses epithelial monolayers far more efficiently that the closely related GM1-C12:0-peptide; and as efficiently as the GM1-C6:0 and C2:0 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Similarly, transepithelial transport for the GM3-C6:0-peptide was approximately 2-fold greater than that observed for the GM1-C6:0-peptide when compared directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Transport was strongly inhibited by pretreatment with the dynamin inhibitor Dyngo-4A, implicating active transcellular trafficking by transcytosis. In membrane-release studies, we found a higher rate of release to solution for the C12:0-GM3-peptide fusion (green curve) when compared to the GM1 fusion molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Thus, the GM1 glycosphingolipid species appear to be retained in the membrane more tightly than the GM3 species containing the same ceramide domains. Because GM3 lacks a free terminal galactose, we hypothesized the GM1 lipids, which contain the terminal galactose, might be further tethered to the membrane by a form of lectin-binding at the cell surface. To test this idea, we studied the rate of membrane release for the C12:0-GM1 species in the presence or absence of 100 mM lactose (Glc-Gal disaccharide) as a competitive ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These studies show enhanced release from the membrane in the presence of excess free lactose, but not excess mannitol, implicating interaction with a galactose-specific lectin membrane tether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To confirm this idea, we studied the rate of membrane release for the C12:0-GM3 species that lacks the terminal disaccharide galactosyl N-acetyl galactosamine (Gal-GalNAc) contained in GM1 linked (1→4) to the central galactose. Here we find that lactose at high 100 mM concentrations competed both the GM1 and GM3 species off the membrane (not shown) but at lower doses (5 mM) lactose released only the GM1-fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). Likewise, Gal-GalNAc (5 mM) was effective at enhancing release of only the GM1-fusion molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Thus, the oligosaccharide domain of the glycosphingolipids can also affect the efficiency of transport across epithelial barriers, we propose by interacting with lectin-like molecules at the cell surface. The results also strengthen the implications and general principles for how the oligosaccharide head group of native glycosphingolipids may affect sorting and retention in specific regions of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Glycosphingolipid-mediated absorption across epithelial barriers in vivo</title><p>To test for glycosphingolipid-mediated transport across the intestine in vivo, the unfused reporter peptide or the C4:0-GM1-peptide fusion molecule were intragastrically gavaged to mice at equal doses (0.5 nmol/kg) and absorption into the blood analyzed after 15 and 30 min using the streptavidin-capture assay.

We first studied transport across intestinal T84 cell monolayers in vitro to test if GM1 glycosphingolipids could transport such a larger cargo. In these studies, GLP-1 transport was quantified by luciferase bioassay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">te Welscher et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Here, we find an even greater effect of the glycosphingolipids on transepithelial GLP-1 transport (20–100-fold above controls). This is explained by a much lower rate of paracellular leak for the larger sized 40-residue GLP-1 peptide. Such size-exclusion from tight junctions is a well-known determinant of paracellular solute diffusion across intact epithelial barriers.</p><p>To test for absorption and biologic incretin activity in vivo, we gastrically gavaged equal doses (10 nmol/kg) of the C6:0-GM1-GLP-1 fusion, the unfused GLP-1 peptide (GLP-1 oral), or vehicle into wild-type mice and measured effects on glucose metabolism by glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Here, we find a lower peak and more rapid return of blood glucose to normal levels in the animals gavaged the C6:0-GM1-GLP-1 fusion molecules compared to animals gavaged GLP-1 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). The effect on glucose tolerance by gastrically administered C6:0-GM1-GLP-1 was similar to the effect achieved by the intraperitoneal injection of GLP-1 peptide alone, implicating an equally high level of bioavailability for the gastrically-delivered GM1-fusion molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>We confirmed intestinal absorption of the C6:0-GM1-GLP-1 into the systemic circulation in two ways. First, we measured GLP-1 activity in blood samples by streptavidin capture and quantitative luciferase bioassay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The results show absorption of the GM1-GLP-1 fusion molecule into the blood, but not for unfused GLP-1. In a second approach, we synthesized an all D-amino acid (non-degradable) isomer of GLP-1 coupled to AF488 to allow for direct quantitative measurement of the 40-residue isomer in the blood using the same streptavidin capture assay as described for our reporter peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Again, we find evidence for absorption of the GLP-1 cargo when fused to the C6:0-GM1 transport vehicle, but no absorption for the unfused GLP-1 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These experiments were performed in two different laboratories, using two different animal facilities with the same results. In all assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–5F</xref>), we find the efficiency of intestinal absorption enabled by fusion to C6:0-GM1 was again almost as efficient as for IP injection of the peptide alone, implicating a high level of bioavailability for the GM1-fusion molecules applied by gastric gavage.</p><p>Notably, however, the C2:0-GM1-GLP-1 fusion molecule had no effect on glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and was not detectably absorbed after gastric gavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), even though this molecule was readily transported across epithelial monolayers in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This may be explained by lower affinity of the C2:0- (and lyso-) ceramide domains for incorporation into cell membranes, as inferred from membrane loading and release assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The difference in biology (transcytosis in vitro versus absorption in vivo) becomes apparent only in vivo where the conditions for epithelial uptake and transport are not optimized as they are in vitro. Thus, although it seemed at first glance that further shortening of the fatty acid beyond C4:0 should amplify transepithelial transport and thus clinical utility, this was not the case and the result informs further development of the technology.</p><p>In summary, we find that fusion of therapeutic peptides to GM1 and GM3 glycosphingolipids with short fatty acids enables their active transport across tight epithelial barriers by transcytosis. In the case of the incretin hormone GLP-1, fusion to the lipid carriers allows for gastric (oral) absorption with high bioavailability and the expected effects on blood glucose, highlighting the potential use of this technology in clinical applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings delineate a novel synthetic method for enabling absorption of therapeutic peptides across mucosal surfaces in vivo. The approach is based on the natural biology of lipid sorting for the glycosphingolipids, which depends primarily on the structure of the ceramide domain to allow for trafficking in the transcytotic pathway, and thus active transport across mucosal surfaces without barrier disruption. For applications requiring systemic drug delivery, non-native glycosphingolipid carriers with ceramide domains containing short-chain fatty acids are required to allow for efficient release from cell membranes into the circulation after transcytosis. The apparent high level of intestinal bioavailability enabled by the glycosphingolipid carriers is unprecedented.</p><p>The mechanism(s) for transcellular trafficking co-opted by the <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated or short chain fatty acid glycosphingolipids are not fully understood. The most robust sorting event for GM1 glycosphingolipids appears to occur in the early endosome where long saturated chain ceramides are trafficked to the late endosome/lysosome, and the <italic>cis</italic>-unsaturated and short-chain glycoceramides are not ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chinnapen et al., 2012</xref>] and Schmieder and Lencer unpublished results). It is possible the unsaturated and short-chain ceramide domains engage sorting mechanisms that dictate their trafficking to the recycling endosome and elsewhere, but we suggest it also possible that their trafficking might be stochastic after escape from the lysosomal pathway, essentially tracking along with bulk membrane flow. In other words, the robust sorting event may occur only for the long chain saturated glycosphingolipids, directing them to the lysosome.</p><p>Another key structural feature enabling this technology must be the oligosaccharide head group. This domain traps the ceramide lipid in the outer membrane leaflet, preventing flip-flop between leaflets and thus rendering the molecule dependent on membrane dynamics for movement throughout the cell – an essential feature for a trafficking vehicle. As shown by our studies using GM3, the extracellular oligosaccharide can in some cell types also affect the efficiency of transepithelial transport. One way, we suggest, may be by binding to adjacent membrane lectins, thus enhancing the tethering of the lipid to the membrane surface. Differences have also been reported between GM1 and GM3 with respect to plasma membrane localization and bilayer/curvature dynamics in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cantù et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Janich and Corbeil, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In the case of transport across mucosal barriers, we envision several applications for the glycosphingolipids of relevance to clinical medicine. One would be as vehicles for systemic delivery of peptide hormones as demonstrated here, or for topical delivery of agonist or antagonist peptides to specific mucosal surfaces. Another would be for delivery of antigens or adjuvants to enable mucosal vaccination or oral tolerance. It is possible that these glycosphingolipids will transport therapeutic proteins in the same way. Finally, while the biology of endosomes in endothelial cells is much less well understood, we believe at least some of the basic principles for lipid sorting in epithelial cells will apply to this cell type; and the glycosphingolipid carriers defined here may also be used to enable transport of biologics across tight endothelial barriers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>T84 cells and MDCK cells were both obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection).

The reaction was quenched by addition of glycerol (5% final). The reaction was desalted by Bond Elut SepPak C18 cartridge (Agilent, MA) and methanol used to elute from the column was removed by Speed Vac concentration (Savant).

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ilya Levental (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary: Garcia-Castillo have investigated the utility of glycosphingolipid conjugates as vehicles for delivering macromolecules across cultured cell monolayers and murine mucosal epithelia. The foundation of the strategy lies in published work that established fatty acid-based inter-organelle trafficking determinants of ceramides and ceramide conjugates which showed that unsaturated or short chain unsaturated fatty acid moieties confer sorting into recycling and transcytosis pathways. This study demonstrates that the head group of such ceramide molecules can be substantially modified, including by conjugation to a bioactive molecule, and still retain intracellular sorting characteristics, including transcytosis to the basolateral membrane of cultured cells and in a murine model.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found this to be a superbly conducted, innovative study that establishes a potentially useful therapeutic drug delivery strategy. There is one point (#1) that the reviewers agreed was not substantiated and this will need to be resolved. We note that the point does not challenge the main conclusion of the manuscript.</p><p>1) The premise of the lactose experiment shown in Figure 3E is problematic. Both GM1 and GM3 have a lactose core, so any putative lectin affected by lactose should recognize GM1 and GM3 similarly, so the experiment does not directly address the role of a terminal galactose on release from the membrane. The reviewers feel that your conclusion should be tested with an additional competition experiment that examines a GM1-specific sugar (e.g., GalNac), or less directly, neuraminidase treatment to convert GM1 into a different structure, which should therefore affect lectin binding. In addition, it is advisable to include a test the effect of lactose on a GM3-based lipid in Figure 3E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34469.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found this to be a superbly conducted, innovative study that establishes a potentially useful therapeutic drug delivery strategy.

Both studies were completed and the results are consistent with our original interpretations.</p><p>In the first experiment, we repeated the lactose competition studies, this time comparing the GM1-peptide and GM3-peptide fusion molecules as suggested. We found that at very high doses, lactose (100 mM) enhanced membrane release of both GM1- and GM3-based peptide fusions. At lower doses, however, lactose (5 mM) was specific for the GM1-peptide fusion molecule (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D). The result is consistent with the idea that the terminal galactose of GM1 (absent in GM3) may interact with a membrane bound lectin to retain the lipid-peptide fusion in the membrane.</p><p>In the second experiment we used the disaccharide galactosyl N-acetyl galactosamine (GalGalNAc) as competing ligand – using the same experimental format. This disaccharide matches the two extra sugars contained in GM1 and absent in GM3. We found the galactosyl N-acetyl galactosamine disaccharide competed the GM1-peptide fusion molecules off the membrane as predicted, but had no effect on the GM3-peptide fusion molecules (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-F).</p><p>These results confirm the original explanation that the terminal galactose (or galactosyl N-acetyl galactosamine dissacharide (Gal-GalNAc)) of GM1 (absent in GM3) may interact with a membrane bound lectin to retain the lipid-peptide fusion in the membrane. They also strengthen the implications and general principles for how the oligosaccharide head group of native glycosphingolipids may affect sorting and retention in specific regions of the cell.</p><p>The text has been revised:</p><p>“These studies show enhanced release from the membrane in the presence of excess free lactose, but not excess mannitol, implicating interaction with a galactose-specific lectin membrane tether (Figure 3E). […] The results also strengthen the implications and general principles for how the oligosaccharide head group of native glycosphingolipids effects may sorting and retention in specific regions of the cell.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
