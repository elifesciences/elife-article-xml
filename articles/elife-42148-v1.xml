To understand how pHFOs differ from normal oscillations in overlapping frequency bands and potentially perturb hippocampal processing, we performed high-density single unit and local field potential recordings from hippocampi of behaving rats with and without chronic epilepsy. In epileptic animals, we observed two types of co-occurring fast oscillations, which by comparison to control animals we could classify as ‘ripple-like’ or ‘pHFO’. We compared their spectral characteristics, brain state dependence, and cellular participants. Strikingly, pHFO occurred irrespective of brain state, were associated with interictal spikes, engaged distinct subnetworks of principal neurons compared to ripple-like events, increased the sparsity of network activity, and initiated both general and immediate disruptions in spatial information coding. Taken together, our findings suggest that events that result in pHFOs have an immediate impact on memory processes, corroborating the need for proper classification of pHFOs to facilitate therapeutic interventions that selectively target pathological activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epilepsy</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>place field</kwd><kwd>pathological high frequency oscillations</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>100349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leutgeb</surname><given-names>Jill K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>084324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leutgeb</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001605</institution-id><institution>Epilepsy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>157927</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leutgeb</surname><given-names>Jill K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010336</institution-id><institution>Hellman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leutgeb</surname><given-names>Jill K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>086947</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leutgeb</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRSA-MH096526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ewell</surname><given-names>Laura A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel framework for separating normal and pathological high-frequency oscillations in animals with epilepsy uncovers new mechanisms for impaired hippocampal network function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In epilepsy, transient fast oscillations in local field potentials called pathological high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs) are observed in brain regions near the seizure focus and are hypothesized to play a role in epileptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bragin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Staba et al., 2002</xref>). In the clinical setting, interictal pHFOs are used as a biomarker for the location of seizure generating zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Worrell et al., 2004</xref>) and are utilized by neurosurgeons to select which tissue to resect in surgical treatments of refractory epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haegelen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frauscher et al., 2017</xref>). The possible role of pHFOs in epileptogenesis and their use as a biomarker of disease highlight the necessity of being able to properly identify and classify physiological high frequency oscillations, which can be difficult in brain regions that also normally generate physiological high-frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In temporal lobe epilepsy, seizure-genic circuits are located in brain regions that support memory formation such as the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions. In these regions, the healthy brain generates physiological high frequency oscillations or ‘ripples’, which are necessary for memory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axmacher et al., 2008</xref>). Ripples overlap in frequency range with pHFOs, which presents a challenge for algorithms to distinguish the two types of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Engel et al., 2009</xref>). In human studies that have separately classified normal physiological ripples and pHFOs, the two event types were recorded from different electrode locations in segregated brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Matsumoto et al., 2013</xref>), leaving the question of whether physiological ripples persist within seizure-genic networks that are producing pHFO, such that the same network generates both event types. Furthermore, it is difficult to know whether ripples observed in humans with epilepsy are normal or altered because there are no control data from healthy brains available and because of the difficulty in humans to simultaneously record the activity of many single neurons within a collective brain network. Here, we address these questions in an animal model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy, in which we can record high-frequency oscillations and the neuron ensembles that participate in them from both epileptic and control rats.</p><p>Since the discovery of ripples in the rat hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buzsáki et al., 1992</xref>), there has been extensive study of their mechanisms and function (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>). Ripples occur predominantly during sleep and immobility. Interestingly, the neuronal activation during ripples reflects a compressed version of the sequential activation of neurons during wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>). When rats are awake and mobile, the hippocampal local field potential shows a theta rhythm, a sustained low amplitude oscillation that ranges between 5 and 12 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vanderwolf, 1969</xref>). During ongoing theta, individual principal neurons burst theta rhythmically when the rat is in the neuron’s spatial receptive field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Muller et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ylinen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Csicsvari et al., 1999</xref>). As a result of each neuron being theta-rhythmically active within spatially restricted fields, principal neurons are sequentially activated within theta cycles when animals transverse a space. These emerging theta sequences are then compressed and replayed during ripples, which is thought to be important for consolidation of memory during sleep as well as for decision-making and path planning during behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ólafsdóttir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfeiffer and Foster, 2013</xref>). These direct links between behavior and neural network dynamics underscore the importance of ripple dynamics in healthy cognitive processes. In epilepsy, it is known that CA1 ensembles are activated during high frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ibarz et al., 2010</xref>), while sequence coding is likely disrupted due to non-specific activation of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valero et al., 2017</xref>). To date, however, no study has compared CA1 dynamics between pathological and more physiological (ripple-like) high-frequency oscillations in the same animal to test whether memory-related neural computations persist in seizure-genic networks. Using high-density single-unit recording, we compare the neural dynamics of high-frequency oscillations between control rats and those with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. In animals with epilepsy, we find that the CA1 network of the same animal can generate pHFO and ripple-like oscillations. Here, we compare the brain state dependencies, cellular participation, and functional role of pHFO and ripple-like oscillations with control ripple oscillations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ripple-like oscillations and pHFOs occur in CA1 of the same animal</title><p>We first determined whether the hippocampus of animals with chronic epilepsy is capable of engaging in two types of high-frequency oscillations, pathological and more normal, ripple-like events. Given that brain states differ between foraging and rest and that normal ripple oscillations are dependent on select brain states, we reasoned that recording across immobile and mobile behavioral states would be useful for assessing the pathology of high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy. Furthermore, recording during foraging behavior would also facilitate the study of the interplay between place coding and high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy. Recording sessions were thus comprised of two to four 10 min foraging epochs during which rats actively searched for food in an open arena, separated by rest periods during which rats quietly rested in a small box before and after foraging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (n = 4 control, n = 4 with chronic epilepsy). For recording local field potential (LFP) and single units, tetrodes were positioned in the dorsal CA1 cell layer, where ripple oscillations are routinely recorded in healthy animals. Using identical event detection parameters, we isolated high-frequency oscillations (&gt;140 Hz) in control animals (example traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and in animals with epilepsy (example traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Given that filtering can be problematic for detection of ripples in epileptic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bénar et al., 2010</xref>), we confirmed that our filter did not induce spurious detection of artifact or interictal spikes with no associated high-frequency oscillations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In control animals, the peak amplitudes of the high-passed ripple oscillations were similar in amplitude across an entire recording session and therefore recording sessions were associated with small coefficients of variation. In contrast, in animals with epilepsy the amplitudes of high-frequency oscillations within recording sessions varied more substantially (ctrl, n = 4; mean ± SEM, 0.3 ± 0.01; epileptic, n = 12; mean ± SEM, 0.5 ± 0.05) (Unpaired t-test, p = 0.04, tstat = −2.2, d.f. = 14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42148.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High-frequency oscillations in animals with epilepsy compared to control animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each recording session consisted of a sequence of rest epochs (grey blocks) and foraging epochs (white blocks).

A 4000 μV signal was added to the second half of a LFP trace recorded from the CA1 cell layer.

(<bold>D</bold>) Similarly, when introducing a biphasic artifact (−3000 μV to 3000 μV), a false oscillation was introduced after filtering, but again the oscillation was not detected as a HFO event as it did not reach our criteria for number of large amplitude cycles (see Materials and methods section).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42148-fig1-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>The larger variability in high-frequency oscillation amplitude observed in recordings from animals with epilepsy suggested that the pathological CA1 network can engage in different types of fast oscillations, even within the same recording period. It is well known that fast oscillations in epileptic networks can co-occur with interictal spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salami et al., 2014</xref>), leading to the question whether heterogeneity in fast oscillations could be explained by co-occurrence with interictal spikes. In our data, we observed that fast oscillations co-occurred with two distinct types of comparatively slower voltage deflections or ‘envelopes’. Some co-occurred with large voltage envelopes that resembled interictal spikes, whereas others co-occurred with smaller voltage deflections that appeared similar to normal ‘sharp waves’ observed in control animals. We therefore analyzed the relationship between the amplitude of the envelope and the peak frequency of the fast oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Plotting the relationship between the two shape parameters for each event revealed that events from control animals (‘ripples’) clustered into one area and events from animals with epilepsy indeed clustered into two areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A &amp; B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating the presence of two types of high-frequency oscillations in the CA1 region in our animal model of epilepsy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42148.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Classification of two types of high-frequency oscillations in animals with epilepsy.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Density plot of high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) recorded from all sessions in control rats (n = 4 rats, n = 4 sessions).

First, k-means clustering was used to segregate high frequency oscillations from the CA1 of epileptic animals into two groups. Interestingly, one group, which we refer to as ‘ripple-like’, had substantial overlap with control ripples for both peak frequency and envelope amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C &amp; E</xref>) (ctrl ripple n = 1414; peak frequency median, 185.8 Hz; inter-quartile range (IQR), 175.8–197.8 Hz; envelope median, 244.9 μV; IQR, 169.6–380.2 μV; ripple-like n = 1616; peak frequency median, 184.9 Hz; IQR, 168.7–199.1329 Hz; envelope median 253.8 μV; IQR, 148.9–377.2 μV). The other group, which we refer to as ‘pathological high-frequency oscillations (pHFOs)’, were associated with large amplitude envelopes (interictal spikes) and had minor overlap with control ripples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C &amp; E</xref>) (pHFO n = 923, peak frequency median, 245.9 Hz; IQR, 233.7–264.1 Hz; envelope median, 520.0 μV; IQR, 407.3–647.4 μV). Both groups were present in individual epileptic rats, even in the same recording session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). A binary classifier was able to distinguish pHFOs from control ripples with high accuracy, as shown by a receiver operator curve (ROC) in the far left quadrant of the ROC plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D &amp; F</xref>, red line). In contrast, the classifier was unable to distinguish ripple-like from control-ripple, as shown by the curve along the identity line that indicates equal numbers of false positive and true positive classifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D &amp;F</xref>, blue line). Together, these data show that in animals with epilepsy the CA1 network of the hippocampus engages in two types of fast oscillations, one of which resembles the sharp wave ripples in controls. </p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>pHFOs are not brain state dependent and occur during foraging epochs characterized by movement-related theta oscillations</title><p>To further investigate the extent to which ripple-like events are normal and pHFOs are abnormal we studied their occurrence in relation to ongoing behavior. When animals are mobile, the hippocampal LFP is characterized by sustained theta oscillations that range from 5 to 12 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vanderwolf, 1969</xref>). Typically, movement-related theta states preclude ripple oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vandecasteele et al., 2014</xref>) such that ripple oscillations are rarely reported to co-occur with theta in healthy animals. Given the direct relationship between movement and theta states and immobility and non-theta slow wave states, we used running speed as an indirect measure of brain state. We analyzed foraging sessions in which the animal’s position was tracked allowing calculation of animal running speed at the time of high-frequency oscillations. As expected, ripple events in control animals preferentially occurred during periods of immobility – associated with high slow wave activity and low theta power. Ripple-like events in epileptic animals retained the same association with immobility as observed in the healthy brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (ctrl ripples n = 691; median speed, 0.8 cm/s; IQR, 0.6–1.9 cm/s; ripple-like n = 293; median speed, 0.5 cm/s; IQR, 0.2–3.1 cm/s). In contrast, pHFOs occurred over the entire range of running speeds (pHFO n = 490; median speed, 4.7 cm/s; IQR, 1.9–7.4 cm/s) (p = 5.3×10<sup>−74</sup>, Chi-sq = 337.4, d.f. = 2, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer multiple comparison test with p &lt; 0.05; control ripple compared to ripple-like, n.s.; ctrl compared to pHFO, p &lt; 0.05). The lack of dependence on immobility of pHFOs was not a consequence of gross differences in behavior between epileptic and control rats, as the two groups ran at similar speeds during foraging periods (ctrl n = 13 10 min foraging periods, median speed 5.6 cm/s; IQR, 5.1–6.9 cm/s; epileptic n = 35 10 min foraging periods, median speed 6.4 cm/s; IQR 4.4–7.6 cm/s, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test; n.s., p = 0.7, z-value = −0.4). Furthermore, when event rates were calculated for the time in the rest box and for different speeds in the arena, high rates of ripple and ripple-like events were observed only during periods of immobility and rest, whereas rates of pHFOs were at approximately the same level during rest as over the entire range of running speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42148.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>pHFOs occurred during movement-associated theta rhythm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cumulative distributions of the running speed at times when a high-frequency oscillation occurred.

Several hundred milliseconds of the two traces are enlarged in (<bold>a</bold>) to illustrate the prominence of theta rhythm in the raw data and the phase shift between the two layers.

One possibility is that pHFOs occur during movement related theta, without altering ongoing theta oscillations. Alternatively, theta rhythm might be suppressed when pHFOs are generated, which would mean that theta is decoupled from running in animals when pHFOs occur. To distinguish between these two possibilities, a wavelet analysis was performed on LFP recordings during the seconds prior to and following pHFOs that occurred when animals were moving quickly (running speeds of 5 cm/s or faster, n = 231). Even though running speed was consistent around the time of the pHFO (median speed change from baseline to before the pHFO 0 cm/s; IQR −2–3 cm/s; from baseline to after the pHFO, 0 cm/s; IQR −3–3 cm/s), LFP recorded in stratum radiatum was characterized by robust theta oscillations leading up to the pHFO (median power change between baseline and the period immediately preceding the pHFO, 10.9 μV<sup>2</sup>; IQR, −51.5–74.6 μV<sup>2</sup>, n.s., p = 0.08, z-value = 1.6, Wilcoxon signed rank test) followed by a transient suppression of theta oscillations for several hundred ms after the event (median reduction from baseline, 98.0 μV<sup>2</sup>; IQR, 21.3–206.2 μV<sup>2</sup>, p = 4.7×10<sup>−29</sup>, z-value = 11.2, Wilcoxon signed rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C &amp; D</xref>). These results are consistent with previous reports that observe theta suppression after interictal spikes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, in stratum radiatum, the most prominent feature of the interictal event is the interictal spike, consistent with the notion that the interictal spike/pHFO complex also suppresses theta in the rat model. We wondered whether pHFOs preferentially occurred at specific phases of theta, which could have implications of involvement of other brain regions (e.g. entorhinal cortex). Although a phase preference was observed, the exact phase preference differed between animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The suppression of theta after each event implies that pHFOs and the associated inter-ictal spikes disrupt ongoing theta oscillations. The transient interruption in theta occurs even while animals continue to explore their environment, and thus could have negative impacts on the temporal coordination of hippocampal ensembles during exploration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sparse activation of CA1 principal cells during high frequency oscillations in animals with epilepsy</title><p>Our results thus far indicated that in chronic epilepsy, networks were still capable of generating ripple-like events even though they concurrently generated pHFOs, which suggested that some normal physiological processes could be maintained in these highly pathological networks. In control animals, ripple oscillations in the LFP coincide with activation of ensembles of neurons in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>). We therefore asked whether ripple-like and pHFO events in animals with epilepsy would show similar participation by principal neurons in CA1 that were recorded over an entire recording session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A &amp; B</xref>, example from an animal with chronic epilepsy and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> for more examples and cluster quality metrics). In control animals, most principal neurons were ripple-modulated, increasing their firing rate during ripples (32/35, or 91%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which is consistent with reports from other rat strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Csicsvari et al., 1999</xref>). In striking contrast, in animals with chronic epilepsy, a smaller proportion of principal cells were modulated by ripple-like events (59/127, or 46% compared to 91%, p = 2.1 *10<sup>−6</sup>, chi-sq = 22.5, Chi-square test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Thus, in animals with epilepsy, fewer CA1 neurons were engaged during ripple-like oscillations. One possible explanation for fewer neurons being modulated by ripple-like events is that neurons have been ‘hijacked’ and now participate in pHFO events instead of ripple-like events. This was not the case, however, as an even sparser activation of neurons was observed during pHFOs, with only 34/153, or 21% participating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Others have reported that there is strong recruitment of inhibitory neurons during interictal spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muldoon et al., 2015</xref>), which could partially explain the sparser activation of principal cells in pHFO events.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42148.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CA1 principal neurons increase firing rates during control ripple, ripple-like events, and pHFOs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coronal section through the area of the hippocampus with tetrode tracks in the CA1 area.

For our analysis, we considered epochs with good foraging behavior (100% coverage of the spatial arena, 177 CA1 pyramidal neurons in animals with epilepsy, 35 CA1 pyramidal neurons in control animals). Exploration of the environment did not differ between the two groups of animals (mean time spent in each spatial bin ± SEM; Ctrl, 2.1 ± 0.03 s, n = 2560 spatial bins; Epilepsy, 2.2 ± 0.03 s, n = 6656 spatial bins; n.s., p = 0.08, d.f. = 9214, Unpaired t-test).

Interestingly, several parameters used to quantify place coding were comparable between neurons modulated by ripple-like versus those modulated by pHFOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> – G). Generally, all neurons in animals with epilepsy that were active during foraging had reduced spatial information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), reduced stability of place-related activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), and larger more dispersed place-related activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) compared to neurons recorded in control animals) (p = 1.4×10<sup>−13</sup>; 4.2 × 10<sup>−15</sup>, 3.9 × 10<sup>−12</sup>; Chi-sq = 59.1, 66.2, 53.0; d.f. = 2; 2; 2 Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer multiple comparison test with p &lt; 0.05) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> – source data for numerical details). Our results thus reveal that functional impairments of hippocampal networks in epilepsy extend beyond the cellular ensembles that participate in pathological activity patterns. Overall, the physiology that underlies place coding is generally perturbed in animals with epilepsy, as fewer neurons encode place relevant information and those that do are less precise and less stable.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>pHFOs during foraging partially disrupt hippocampal place coding</title><p>Given our results that pHFOs can be generated while animals are actively running while foraging for food, and that a proportion of CA1 pyramidal neurons increase their firing rates during pHFOs, we asked whether pHFOs during running might contribute to spatial coding deficits. First, we tested whether pHFOs occurred in specific locations, which could be the case if pHFOs were driven by neurons that had place specific activity. For each foraging session with a sufficient number of pHFOs (&gt;15 events), we constructed maps of where pHFOs occurred relative to animal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). From these maps, we calculated the spatial information carried by pFHO events. To determine a ‘chance level’ spatial information that would account for the number of events, we randomly shuffled when pHFOs occurred (1000 shuffles per session), and calculated the distribution of spatial information values for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In 9 out of 11 sessions, pHFOs occurred randomly throughout the environment, and thus carried the same amount of spatial information as when pHFO times were shuffled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). To then test whether ongoing pHFOs would acutely perturb place coding, we first compared the spatial information of individual neuron’s maps from foraging epochs when pHFOs occurred to maps that were free of pHFOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). No difference was observed between these two conditions. However, consistent with the results above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), both distributions from epileptic animals were significantly different than from control animals (p = 1.1×10<sup>−19</sup>, chi-sq = 87.4, Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA followed by Tukey Kramer multiple comparison test with p &lt; 0.05) (ctrl n = 93 maps, median spatial information = 1.7 bits; IQR = 1.1–2.2 bits; w/pHFOs, n = 83 maps med. = 0.5 bits; IQR = 0.3–0.9 bits; pHFO free, n = 59 maps, med. = 0.5 bits; IQR = 0.3–0.9).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42148.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The spiking of neurons during pHFOs reduce spatial information.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The animal’s path is depicted in grey with the positions where pHFO events occurred overlaid as red dots.

Thus, we examined specifically neurons that spiked during pHFOs and asked whether these cells would show reduced spatial tuning. We selected the subset of neurons with at least 1% of spikes occurring during pHFOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) (n = 21, median number of spikes occurring during pHFOs = 14; IQR, 8–20) and examined their place maps. We removed spikes that occurred during pHFOs, and calculated the spatial information after the targeted down-sample. As a control for reducing the number of spikes, we calculated the spatial information when a random set of spikes equal to the number that occurred during pHFOs were removed (random down-sampling was done 1000 times for each map). For 10/21 maps, the improvement in spatial information after removing spikes that occurred during pHFOs was greater than could be expected by random down-sampling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). For the remaining 11/21 maps, the improvement in spatial information after removing spikes during pHFOs could be explained by random down-sampling. When considering all 21 maps after removing spikes during pHFO, there was a small but significant increase in spatial information (increase of 0.02; IQR 0.01–0.08; p = 9.2×10<sup>-5</sup>, z-value = 3.9, Wilcoxon Sign Rank Test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Not surprisingly, for the neurons in which targeted down sampling led to an improvement in spatial information, there was a positive relationship between the improvement in spatial information and the percentage of total pHFO-related spikes that were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.82, p &lt; 1.6 * 10<sup>−8</sup>). Therefore, spikes during pHFOs can have a negative effect on place coding in individual neurons, and negative effects are stronger in neurons with a large number of spikes that occur during pHFOs. Collectively, these results indicate that pHFOs, as they occur randomly with respect to relevant stimuli (in this case spatial location) can reduce the information that is conveyed by CA1 place cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings highlight that in individual animals with epilepsy, the hippocampus is capable of engaging in two types of high-frequency oscillations: pHFOs and ripple-like events, both of which involve distinct subnetworks of hippocampal neurons. Ripple-like events in epileptic animals are similar to ripples observed in the healthy brain of control animals in that they are characterized by similar oscillation frequencies and slow envelope amplitudes (‘sharp waves’) as well as by an increased prevalence during non-theta brain states. In contrast, pHFOs are only observed in the epileptic brain, exhibit faster oscillation frequencies than ripples, are associated with interictal spikes, and are not brain state dependent. The preservation of ripple-like events in parallel with the occurrence of pHFOs suggests that memory-related neural computations are at least partially preserved in animals with epilepsy. Therefore, we investigated to what extent ripple-like events corresponded to control ripples with respect to network dynamics during behavior. In the epileptic brain, strikingly, a much smaller proportion of total CA1 neurons were participating in ripple-like events compared to the proportion that are ripple-modulated in controls. The reduction in the number of neurons that engages in network activity during ripples during immobility extends to spatial activity patterns in theta states during movement. During foraging, we also found a smaller proportion of active neurons in animals with epilepsy compared to healthy controls. Across behavioral states, activation of cell assemblies was therefore sparser in the epileptic compared to the control hippocampus. When neurons were active during foraging in epileptic animals, they did have place fields, although their fields were less precise and more unstable. We found that the general decline in hippocampal spatial information was further enhanced by the immediate effects of pHFOs on the network. Immediate effects included a transient reduction in hippocampal theta power, as well as a further reduction in spatial precision for place cells that were activated by the pathological oscillation. Therefore, the proper classification and selective therapeutic targeting of events that result in pHFOs has the potential to normalize hippocampal function in the epileptic brain.</p><p>Clinical practices, which use pHFOs to determine ictal-genic areas in the brain, depend on proper classification of pathological high frequency oscillations. We found that combining frequency and slow envelope amplitude (interictal spike in epilepsy, sharp wave in physiological events) of high-frequency oscillations facilitated separation of two distinct event types in animals with epilepsy. Similar classification approaches have been successfully implemented in human epilepsy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nonoda et al., 2016</xref>), and others have proposed that the association between high-frequency oscillations and concurrent interictal spikes is indicative that the oscillations are pathological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schevon et al., 2009</xref>). However, we are the first to show that such waveform-based classification could separate events recorded at the same electrode. Interestingly, we found that pHFOs occurred during periods of active exploration characterized by robust theta oscillations. We therefore propose that brain state dependence could be added as an additional criterion for classification of pathological oscillations in hippocampus in epilepsy. Contrary to our result, there are reports that fast oscillations in epilepsy are more rare during awake and REM sleep states and instead occur predominantly during non-REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagshaw et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frauscher et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is important to consider that if physiological ripples were not properly separated and removed from the analysis; fast oscillations would appear to be most frequent during non-REM sleep compared to other brain states because of the prevalence of ripple-like events during this brain state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with our results of the occurrence of pHFOs irrespective of brain state, one study in human patients found that pHFOs can occur during theta states (REM sleep), but only when recording in the ictal onset zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakuraba et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that only pHFOs occur independent of brain state in ictal-genic networks, underscoring the potential for using brain state dependence to improve classification.</p><p>It was previously unclear whether pathological and physiological ripple events could coincide in the same seizure-genic network. Modeling has suggested that the same network of neurons would be able to flexibly transition between activity modes that are either lower frequency and therefore normal and higher frequency and therefore pathological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fink et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we confirmed that both pHFO and ripple-like events can co-occur in memory circuits. In support of computational models, we observed a small number of CA1 principal cells that participated in both event types (28%). However, the activity of the majority of CA1 neurons were modulated by only one event type or the other. This segregation suggests that tracking single-unit activity could improve separation of oscillation types in epilepsy, but more importantly motivates future experiments aimed at more selective therapeutic interventions designed to target pathological sub-networks in the hippocampus.</p><p>Tracking large numbers of single-units across pHFOs and ripple-like events in behaving animals not only allowed for the identification of additional criteria to better classify pathological and physiological high-frequency activity, but also provided more precise insights into the general and immediate effects pathological oscillations have on hippocampal circuits. The idea that interictal spikes (and co-occurring pHFOs) would disrupt memory processing is widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holmes and Lenck-Santini, 2006</xref>). Most studies have found that interictal events disrupt memory consolidation processes, as interictal spikes have negative impacts when they occur during retrieval versus encoding phases of memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kleen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kleen et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, during sleep, interictal spikes inappropriately initiate spindle activity in cortex, and therefore disrupt memory consolidation processes that engage cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gelinas et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, a recent study uncovered a cellular mechanism of the perturbed dynamics during CA1 high-frequency oscillations in epilepsy, involving improper inhibition resulting in non-specific recruitment of CA1 neurons during fast ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Valero et al., 2017</xref>). In their study they exclude sessions that had ongoing interictal spikes, whereas in our study, we define pHFOs as those associated with large amplitude envelopes (i.e. interictal spikes), and it is unclear whether the cellular dynamics they report during fast ripple would be similar to those during interictal spike associated pHFO. A better comparison between our two data sets would be made between our ripple-like events and their fast ripples, although in our hands ripple-like events were spectrally more similar to control than their fast-ripples, perhaps because of differences in time-points of recordings. Importantly, we report fewer CA1 neurons are active during ripple-like events compared to control, so in both studies high-frequency oscillations that are not associated with interictal spikes have abnormal dynamics, which could negatively influence memory consolidation.</p><p>Given that most studies of interictal activity focus on the effect on consolidation processes, which occur during sleep, our finding that pHFOs occur during active exploration are provocative when considering the effects on memory encoding. We are the first to record from large cell populations during pHFOs while animals are freely exploring, which allowed us to ascertain whether networks generating awake-pHFOs would have specific deficits with regard to place coding. In line with previous reports, we confirmed that place coding is generally disrupted in animals with temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenck-Santini and Holmes, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to this general change in place field size, we observed that the place code was generally more ‘sparse’, both during encoding and during consolidation periods. During foraging epochs (encoding), fewer neurons had place fields, and in subsequent resting periods (consolidation), fewer neurons were active during ripple-like oscillations compared to control animals. A reduction in the place-related activity of CA1 neurons in a rat model of epilepsy has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2003</xref>), but we are the first to observe that place field networks are also more sparsely activated during behavior as well as during ripple-like events in rest. The reduced number of neurons with place-related as well as memory-related activity may exacerbate the consequence of the reduced spatial precision of the remaining active neurons. It is widely believed that neural networks can overcome high variability in individual neurons by implementing population coding schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</xref>). Conversely, as individual neurons become more variable, the size of the population required for optimal decoding increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yarrow and Seriès, 2015</xref>). For place coding in temporal lobe epilepsy – individual place cells become more variable, and the population size encoding animal position is reduced, which would collectively deteriorate spatial information coding in cell assembles. Moreover, the reduced number of neurons participating in ripple events would also worsen the efficacy of memory consolidation and readout. Therefore, the association of pHFOs with a higher network sparsity and a decrease in information coding serves as potential mechanisms for memory impairment in epilepsy.</p><p>Our findings also suggest that pHFOs have an immediate impact on an already compromised hippocampal network. Despite most studies focusing on interictal events during consolidation, a few studies have shown that interictal spikes can impact perception at the moment that the spikes occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shewmon and Erwin, 1988a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shewmon and Erwin, 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shewmon and Erwin, 1988c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shewmon and Erwin, 1989</xref>). Our data support the possibility that pHFOs associated with interictal spikes occurring during wakefulness could also confer immediate negative effects on the place code. We observed that pHFOs occur at random locations in environments and modulate a subset of cells that should otherwise not be active at those locations. Such aberrant recruitment could influence the formation of neuronal sequences that are established during exploration and thus compromise memory-guided behavior and navigation. A potential further disruption in neural computations could also be related to the observation that pHFOs have an immediate effect on hippocampal theta power. Theta timing and the organization of hippocampal phase precession has been shown to be generally impaired in temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lenck-Santini and Holmes, 2008</xref>). We show that unlike ripple-like oscillations, pHFOs occur during theta states in behavior when hippocampal sequences are established. In immediate response to the pHFO, we observed a sustained suppression in hippocampal theta despite a lack of change in ongoing behavior and running speed. During this period of time, spatial navigation would not be accompanied by the standard spatial encoding schemes that have been described in the CA1 network during spatial exploration, which are dependent on the local theta rhythm. A lack of hippocampal theta has previously been shown to be associated with a severe reduction in hippocampal-dependent memory and pathfinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chrobak et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizumori et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). It should be noted, however, that our data suggests that immediate effects of pHFO are relatively subtle – few neurons are active during them and when they occur during exploration, theta suppression is short lived. Therefore, longitudinal studies to address the long-term effects of pHFO activity on hippocampal network activity are essential to motivate whether early stage intervention of pHFO activity could have a positive impact on preserving healthy levels of network sparsity and spatial coding. For example, such studies would reveal whether neuronal activation during pHFO becomes sparse over time as part of a compensatory mechanism. Furthermore, it remains to be explored how the acute effects of pathological activity differs with distance from the epicenter of epileptic activity, a problem better addressed by simultaneous recordings of cell ensembles across multiple brain regions including hippocampus.</p><p>Given the negative effects of epilepsy on cognition, it is of interest that ripple-like oscillations persist in epileptic networks even though they are associated with a smaller proportion of participating cells, suggesting remnants of a healthy network. Furthermore, ripple-like oscillations engage unrelated neurons from those active during pHFOs, which suggests that the event types are supported by distinct network mechanisms. Future research is needed to determine whether neurons participating in the two event types correspond to different classes of CA1 pyramidal cells, as there is heterogeneity within CA1 and certain classes are more likely to be active during normal ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cembrowski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciocchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Valero et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, due to the non-overlapping populations of CA1 cells recruited by each event in the same network, the development of selective manipulations that target specific types of pathological activity are possible. Such experiments could directly test the causal role of observed changes in network function for memory comorbidities in epilepsy and have the potential to lead to a reduction in seizures along with a recovery in memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type (species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background</td><td>Wistar rats; Crl:WI</td><td>Charles River Labs</td><td>Strain Code: 003; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_13508588">RGD_13508588</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Kainic acid; kainate</td><td>Tocris</td><td>Cat # 0222</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Isoflurane</td><td>MWI</td><td>Cat #: NDC 13985-528-60</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Buprenorphine</td><td>MWI</td><td>Cat #: 29308</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Chloroplatinic acid for platinum plating</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat #: 206083; CAS 18497-13-7</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Sodium pentobarital</td><td>MWI</td><td>Cat #: 15199</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Formaldehyde</td><td>EMD</td><td>Cat #: FX-0415–4; CAS 50-00-0</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Cresyl violet</td><td>EMD</td><td>Cat #: M-19012; CAS 10510-54-0</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Matlab v2015b</td><td>Mathworks</td><td>MATLAB, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MClust</td><td>AD Redish</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/MClust/MClust.html">http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/MClust/MClust.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Chronux</td><td>Partha Mitra</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chronux.org/">http://chronux.org/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Hyperdrive</td><td>Custom built; Designed by B McNaughton</td><td>US Patent: US5928143 A</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Platinum- Iridium tetrode wire</td><td>California fine wire company</td><td>Cat #: CFW0011873</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Freezing microtome</td><td>Leica</td><td>Model: SM 2000R</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Digital Neuralynx recording system</td><td>Neuralynx</td><td>Model: Digital Lynx SX</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All experimental procedures were performed as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Diego and according to National Institutes of Health and institutional guidelines.

Once two or more motor seizures of class III or greater on the Racine scale were observed, the animal was considered epileptic. Four epileptic rats (6–12 months old) and four control rats that were not injected with kainate (6–12 months old) were used for electrophysiological experiments.

The filter was designed to have: first stopband = 0–140 Hz, amplitude 0; passband = 150–800 Hz, amplitude 1; second stopband = 810 Hz – Nyquist Frequency, amplitude 0. The first and second stopband attenuation were set to 5.6 × 10<sup>−4</sup>. The passband attenuation was set to 2.8 × 10<sup>−2</sup>. These led to error minimization weights of 51.2 and 1, respectively. Putative high-frequency events were detected as periods when the RMS signal deviated from the mean RMS by greater than 3.5 x the standard deviation of the RMS. Putative high frequency events within 6 ms of each other were merged. Events were required to have at least five peaks (cycles of oscillation) that each had amplitudes greater than 3 x the standard deviation of the rectified band-passed LFP signal. After initial detection, 20 randomly selected events from each recording session were visually inspected by the experimenter to determine whether detected high-frequency events were not artifacts (also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for further validation of detection). Furthermore, to confirm that the high-frequency events were not misidentified fast gamma rhythm or noise artifact, the FFT for each event was calculated, and only events for which the peak power for frequencies greater than 150 Hz were larger than the peak power from 75 to 125 Hz were included for further analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Classification of high-frequency oscillations in animals with chronic epilepsy</title><p>Peak slow wave amplitude and peak frequency were calculated for each event. To calculate the slow wave amplitude, 500 ms segments of data centered on the high-frequency event were band-pass filtered between 0.2 Hz and 40 Hz, and the maximum absolute amplitude of the filtered data was taken. To calculate the peak frequency, the FFT of the data segment was calculated over the frequency range of 40 Hz to 600 Hz. The peak in power for frequencies greater than 150 Hz was taken as the peak frequency. Peak slow wave amplitude and peak frequency were each normalized to the maximum across the entire data set, and the resulting data were clustered into two populations using a k-means algorithm. For clustering, initial starting centroids were given by user input based on by-eye estimation of the center of masses (highest density of points) in the feature plot. Clustered distributions were then compared to the distribution recorded from control animals using ROC analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>ROC discrimination</title><p>To compare the degree of similarity of oscillation shape parameters between events recorded in animals with epilepsy compared to events recorded in control animals we performed a discrimination using receiver operating characteristics analysis (ROC). Comparisons were made between (1) maximum frequency of events in epilepsy cluster one compared to events in control, (2) maximum frequency of events in epilepsy cluster two compared to events in control, (3) envelope amplitude of events in epilepsy cluster one compared to events in control, and (4) envelope amplitude of events in epilepsy cluster two compared to events in control. The true positive rate (ranging from 0 to 1; rate of correct classification of data from distribution A as belonging to distribution A) and false positive rate (ranging from 0 to 1; rate of misclassification of data from distribution B as belonging to distribution A) is plotted for ranges of criteria thresholds (across values of (1) frequency or (2) envelope amplitude). As an example, imagine sliding a vertical line (criterion threshold) from left to right along the x axis of the histograms of the two distributions being compared (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and E</xref>). For each x position of the line, consider the probability of data to the right of the line to come from one distribution (true positive rate) as opposed to a second distribution. When distributions have no overlap, all thresholds between the two distributions would yield true positive rates equal to one. Distributions with complete overlap would yield true positive rates equal to 0.5 for all criteria thresholds because it would be equally likely for data to belong to either distribution along the entire range of x. For each ROC, the area under the curve (a.u.c.) was used to evaluate discrimination quality – values greater than 0.8 are considered as acceptable discrimination. Analyses were performed in Matlab (2015b) using the built in functions ‘patternnet’ and ‘roc’.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of theta oscillations</title><p>For each detected pHFO that occurred when animals were running at least 5 cm/s or faster, four seconds of LFP signal (recorded in stratum radiatum) that were centered on the pHFO event were taken. The large voltage spike (the interictal spike) associated with the pHFO was removed by setting the 200 ms at the center of the signal to the mean of the entire 10 min LFP recording. The spike was removed to avoid distortion of time frequency plots by the large voltage change associated with the interictal spike. Time frequency plots of the four seconds were generated using Morlet wavelets over a frequency range of 4–20 Hz. Mean power over the frequency range of 7–11 Hz was calculated for three time windows: ‘baseline’ defined as the 1 s between 2.0 and 1.0 s before the pHFO, ‘before’ defined as the 500 ms between 0.6 and 0.1 s immediately before the pHFO, and ‘after’ defined as the 500 ms between 0.1 and 0.6 s immediately after the pHFO. To determine the phase that pHFO occurred, the two seconds of LFP data (recorded from stratum radiatum) previous to the time of the pHFO event were taken for further analysis. A threshold was determined by multiplying the standard deviation over the first second (std) by 5, and only interictal spikes that exceeded the threshold were included in analyses (excluded 45 events of the 231). To determine the phase of theta rhythm when the pHFO/interictal spike was generated, the onset of the interictal spike (envelope) was determined with user input to make sure that the calculated onset was not early (which would cut out partial theta cycles) or late (which would add large voltage deflections at the end of the signal and distort filtering). The signal was truncated at the onset of the interictal spike; therefore, the theta phase associated with the last point in the truncated segment was our estimation of the theta phase at the time of pHFO initiation. To determine the phase at the end of the signal we determined the theta phase of the whole signal by a Hilbert transform on the band-pass filtered LFP using both a zero-phase and a causal butterworth filter (4–12 Hz). The causal filter can be applied until the end of the signal just before the pHFO, because it only uses information from past sampling points, but provides incorrect phase estimates that include phase distortions introduced by the asymmetry of the filter kernel. Conversely, the symmetric zero-phase filter provides correct phases but cannot be applied until the end of the signal because it includes samples perturbed by the pHFO. We used the unperturbed time interval to estimate the phase difference between causal and zero-phase filter and used this phase offset to linearly extrapolate the theta phase at the pHFO over the last six cycles from the causally filtered trace.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Neuron modulation by high-frequency oscillations</title><p>Only neurons that were recorded during a period in which at least 10 high-frequency oscillations occurred were included in the analysis of neuron modulation by HFO. Spike times that fell within 1 s of each high-frequency oscillation (500 ms before, 500 ms after) were binned into 20 ms bins. The number of spikes that occurred within each bin was divided by 20 ms to calculate a binned firing rate vector. For statistical analysis, the binned firing rate vector associated with each high-frequency oscillation was treated as an independent observation. Paired comparisons between baseline rates (mean from 500 ms to 400 ms before HFO) and ‘during HFO rates’ (mean of 100 ms centered on the HFO) were done with a Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and neurons that had p-values less than 0.05 were considered to be significantly modulated by the high-frequency event.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Neuronal firing rate map</title><p>For each neuron, we constructed firing rate maps for each behavioral session by summing the total number of spikes that occurred in a given location bin (5 × 5 cm), dividing by the total amount of time that the rat occupied the bin, and smoothing with a 5 × 5 bin Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of approximately one bin:</p><p>[0.0025 0.0125 0.0200 0.0125 0.0025;</p><p>0.0125 0.0625 0.1000 0.0625 0.0125;</p><p>0.0200 0.1000 0.1600 0.1000 0.0200;</p><p>0.0125 0.0625 0.1000 0.0625 0.0125;</p><p>0.0025 0.0125 0.0200 0.0125 0.0025].</p><p>Bins that were never within a distance of less than 2.5 cm from the tracked path or with total occupancy of less than 150 ms were regarded as unvisited and were not included in the rate map.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Proportion of active neurons</title><p>The total number of single units was determined as the number that were tracked across resting and foraging behavior.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from Ewell and Colleagues investigates normal and pathological high frequency oscillations (ripples vs. pHFOs, respectively) and their network effect on kainic acid rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy. The scope of the manuscript is important since it focuses on an electrophysiological signal (pHFOs) that is potentially considered as a biomarker of the epileptogenic zone.</p><p>Authors show several results but the most novel ones are that 1) PHFos can be observed during locomotion, which is never the case with normal ripples; 2) PHFos during locomotion decrease theta rhythm amplitude; 3) there is little overlap between neurons activated by pHFO and those activated during ripples; 4) PHFO occurrence decrease spatial information of hippocampal neurons that are in pHFO modulated, as well as instability and blurring of place fields. There is also some mechanistic investigation included, e.g. demonstration that interictal discharges/pHFOs disrupt hippocampal theta oscillations, and evidence that only some CA1 neurons are &quot;hijacked&quot; to participate in pHFOs.</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and contains a trove of results that altogether make a very interesting paper. The methods and experimental design are sound, so are the interpretation of results. There are however a few points that deserve attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors must clearly highlight novel findings compared to previous studies, particularly from Dr. Menendez de la Prida's laboratory (Valero et al., 2017) on HFOs and ripple relationships and their contribution to cognition. This should be clearly stated in the Discussion.</p><p>2) pHFOs and interictal spikes are reported to often co-occur. This is well known (Jacobs et al., 2008; Salami et al., 2014 for example) and raises a specific point. To grasp the significance of the current results, it is important to know what the relative contribution of pHFOS vs. IS here. By themselves, IS have been found to alter ongoing oscillations, information processing and performance. Since pHFOs and IS often co-occur, it is possible that the effects reported on place cells and EEG are just due to the spikes and not the pHFO. For instance, it is not clear whether the disruption of theta activity can be observed when pHFOs occur without interictal spikes (see Kleen et al., 2010, 2013; Chauviere et al., 2009; Fu et al., 2018).</p><p>3) Related to this, HFOs can easily be confused with the filtered signal from interictal spikes. Indeed, interictal spike waveforms can be steep, leading to ripples in all frequency bands, including those that we focus on while detecting HFOs (see Benar et al., 2010). Restricting analysis to events with 6 cycles may not be sufficient if the filter used leads to ringing artifacts. The authors should describe the precautions taken to rule out filter artifacts. Please provide details of the filter used (type, order, frequency/amplitude response etc.), as ripple events could result from filtering population action potentials, and pHFOs could be a result of high-pass filtering a sharp wave. The authors allude to this issue in the first paragraph of the Discussion, but need to ensure this is not the case. Supplementary figures are helpful for this since they show unfiltered data, but authors need to comment on this in the main text.</p><p>4) A large chunk of the paper is devoted to the association between neural firing and pHFOs, which appear to be a proxy for interictal discharges in this model. The observation of sparse neuronal activity during high amplitude very high frequency events (up to 700 Hz, well into the range of multiunit activity) seems self-contradictory, and this needs to be resolved. There are some obvious possible explanations. First, extensive gliosis and cell death are well known to occur with the kainate model. Second, it is likely that the pHFOs are being recorded at a distance from the origination of the epileptiform activity. Finally, there is the possibility of filter artifact causing spurious pHFO detection (see point 3, above).</p><p>5) How did the authors guarantee that the same neurons were recorded across sessions? Changes in neuronal waveshape during epileptiform activity and over time have been reported in continuous recordings. Was there an analysis of waveshape drift that would support the contention that a given neuron was identified correctly across sessions? Also, please provide statistics for number of sessions of recording and total number of days from first to last recording per animal.</p><p>6) Please describe and appropriately cite how wake/sleep state is determined. Also, it is incorrect to state that pHFOs &quot;do not occur during awake and REM sleep states.&quot; They are simply less common in some (not all) patients, and likely depend on the temporal pattern of interictal discharges which are often (not always) increased during sleep. Some of the papers cited by the authors provide data on pHFOs during wakefulness, as do several studies employing long-term, round the clock automated detection.</p><p>7) The authors should report test statistics, degrees of freedom, and actual p-values for statistical tests. It's not clear that their across-animal statistics were adequately powered. Some evidence of sufficient power would greatly support the early claims. Also, in some cases statistics are presented far removed from the accompanying claim, which is confusing to the reader. When dealing with multiple groups and ANOVA, could the authors provide the global statistical effect before comparing individual groups (CTR vs. ripple like, CTRL vs. pHFO etc.). Did authors adjust for multiple comparisons?</p><p>8) The conclusion that different neuronal populations could be selectively targeted ventures too far into speculation, as the authors did not show that the ripple vs. pHFO neurons came from different classes. This section should be removed or limited to a brief comment.

This should be clearly stated in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for providing the opportunity to better highlight the critical differences between our data and that of Valero et al. In the original version of our Discussion we cite Valero et al., 2017 in the context of highlighting previous work on how HFO and ripple affect cognition. However as noted by the reviewer, our original version did not clearly point out how our work reinforces/differs from this important previous work. There are two key differences between our data and that of Valero et al: we are both studying HFO, but in their case they exclude sessions with interictal spikes, and in our case we use the association with interictal spikes to define pHFO – therefore we are focusing on fundamentally distinct types of HFO. Furthermore, we track individual CA1 unit activity between HFOs associated with interictal spikes (pHFO) and those that are associated with sharp waves (ripple-like events), which they do not. The differential responses of units to these two HFO types support our novel claim that these high frequency events are fundamentally distinct. We have revised this paragraph to point out these differences, and more clearly compare our results (Discussion, fourth paragraph). We have also tried to better emphasize the novelty of our findings with respect to previous work throughout the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) pHFOs and interictal spikes are reported to often co-occur. This is well known (Jacobs et al., 2008; Salami et al., 2014 for example) and raises a specific point. To grasp the significance of the current results, it is important to know what the relative contribution of pHFOS vs. IS is here. By themselves, IS have been found to alter ongoing oscillations, information processing and performance. Since pHFOs and IS often co-occur, it is possible that the effects reported on place cells and EEG are just due to the spikes and not the pHFO. For instance, it is not clear whether the disruption of theta activity can be observed when pHFOs occur without interictal spikes (see Kleen et al., 2010, 2013; Chauviere et al., 2009; Fu et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>We edited multiple sections of the manuscript to address these comments:</p><p>a) We now cite (Jacobs et al., 2008; Salami et al., 2014) when we first raise the concept that one population of HFO in our study co-occur with interictal spikes (subsection “Ripple-like oscillations and pathological high frequency oscillations occur in CA1 of the same animal”, second paragraph). Our original version cites Kleen et al., and we did not include Chauvier et al., 2009 because it did not address interictal spikes and theta. For Fu et al., 2018 see (d) below.</p><p>b) In our data we describe two types of HFO’s in the CA1 cell layer of epileptic rats that are classified as either associated with interictal spikes (pHFOs) or associated with normal size sharp waves (ripple-like). The first time the two events are defined, the association of pHFO with interictal spikes is stated:</p><p>“The other group, which we refer to as ‘pathological high frequency oscillations (pHFOs)’, were associated with large amplitude envelopes (interictal spikes) …”</p><p>For our recordings from the CA1 cell layer, pHFOs are thus defined as associated with interictal spikes, and vice versa, we do not observe interictal spikes without pHFOs at this recording location. However, simultaneously with the pHFO-interictal spike complex in the CA1 cell layer, we observe large interictal spikes without HFOs at recording locations in stratum radiatum (see also our response to Question 3 below). We believe these signatures in the cell layer and the radiatum to be components of the same event in the CA1 network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>).</p><p>The co-occurrence of pHFOs and ictal spikes is stressed more frequently in this version of the manuscript. For example, a new supplemental figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) has been added that shows simultaneously recorded signal from the cell layer and stratum radiatum. Rhetorically we chose to refer to the pattern as pathological HFO (pHFO) because the event was detected based on frequency and much of our manuscript deals with comparisons of these events with normal HFO in the healthy brain and the second class of HFO in the epileptic brain (ripple-like) (5 of 7 main figures), in which only pHFOs differ in both amplitude and brain state dependence. Indeed, since pHFOs are the only class of HFOs in our study to regularly occur during theta states, they are the only HFO event with the potential to influence ongoing theta oscillations. However, to be clear, in our study pHFO and interictal spikes are two parts of one activity pattern, just as ripple and sharp waves are part of one activity pattern in the healthy hippocampus, i.e. ‘sharp wave ripples’.</p><p>c) With that said, we do think that more emphasis should be placed on the possible role of the interictal spike component in disrupting theta (given that we analyze theta effects from tetrodes positioned in radiatum where theta is stronger, and where interictal spikes dominated the interictal pattern). We reasoned that if the interictal spike were the key component, there might be a relationship between its magnitude and the strength of theta suppression. At our stratum radiatum recording sites, many events were saturated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), occluding their true magnitude. However, we found that the maximum slope of the IS was a good proxy for IS amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). We found no relationship between IS slope (proxy for magnitude) and theta suppression. Furthermore we found no evidence for a relationship for any other parameter (IS amplitude in the cell layer, pHFO power, and pHFO frequency, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1C-E</xref>). As this new analysis did not reveal any clear relation between pHFO/IS features and the degree of theta suppression, we have not added these results to the current version of manuscript but would of course include the additional analysis and figures if deemed critical by the reviewers and editor. Instead, we now more clearly make the point that the IS along with the associated HFOs in the cell layer could be an important factor for suppressing theta (subsection “pHFOs are not brain state dependent and occur during foraging epochs characterized by movement-related theta oscillations”, last paragraph).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42148.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>No relationship between IS /pHFO parameters and magnitude of theta suppression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example event recorded simultaneously in the cell layer (stratum pyramidale) and radiatum during movement related theta oscillation.

However, they sample at 256 Hz, and therefore it is unclear whether the interictal spikes in their study are associated with high frequency oscillations that could not be resolved or whether their recording locations were distant from a cell layer where HFOs would not be detected. We gather that this brings us full circle – the complexity of the distinction between interictal spike and HFO is likely underappreciated. It is our impression that recording location is fundamental, and without simultaneous recordings at multiple sites, the full extent of the co-occurring events may not be evident. Indeed, in our own experiments, if we had been recording in radiatum only, we would have falsely detected interictal spikes without associated pHFOs. While our manuscript does not indicate that one part of the complex is more important for disruption of normal network dynamics, it does highlight that in many cases, it is most parsimonious to think of these two patterns as a single event, at least within the hippocampus. We believe that emphasizing this result is a valuable and novel addition to our manuscript, and we appreciate that the reviewer comments pointed us in this direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to this, HFOs can easily be confused with the filtered signal from interictal spikes. Indeed, interictal spike waveforms can be steep, leading to ripples in all frequency bands, including those that we focus on while detecting HFOs (see Benar et al., 2010). Restricting analysis to events with 6 cycles may not be sufficient if the filter used leads to ringing artifacts. The authors should describe the precautions taken to rule out filter artifacts. Please provide details of the filter used (type, order, frequency/amplitude response etc.), as ripple events could result from filtering population action potentials, and pHFOs could be a result of high-pass filtering a sharp wave. The authors allude to this issue in the first paragraph of the Discussion, but need to ensure this is not the case. Supplementary figures are helpful for this since they show unfiltered data, but authors need to comment on this in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for asking us to include details about our HFO detection. This is fundamental to our study, and we are happy to provide these details (please note the detection code will also be published). We designed an Equiripple Bandpass Filter using the FIRPM function in the Signal Processing Toolbox of Matlab. The filter has an order of 477 (as we understand it, the order of digital filter is its length – please correct us if this is wrong). Our filter was designed to have the following features:</p><p>First stopband = 0 – 140 Hz, amplitude 0</p><p>Passband = 150 – 800 Hz, amplitude 1</p><p>Second stopband = 810 Hz – Nyquist Frequency, amplitude 0</p><p>The first and second stopband attenuation were set to 5.6 X 10<sup>-4</sup>. The passband attenuation was set to 2.8 X 10 <sup>-2</sup>. These led to error minimization weights of 51.1689 and 1 respectively. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> we have plotted the magnitude response of the filter.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42148.021</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Magnitude response of the Equiripple Bandpass Filter.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-42148-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig><p>The details of our filter have been added to the Materials and methods (subsection “Detection of high frequency oscillations”).</p><p>The reviewer is right to point out that great care needs to be taken to avoid misidentifying either interictal spikes or noise artifacts as HFOs. When we designed our detection algorithm, we were aware of these problems and took care to convince ourselves that our detection was not picking up false positives. First, for every session we visually evaluated the raw signals of candidate HFOs – we visualized at least 20 randomly selected events from each session. We have added this detail to the Materials and methods (see the aforementioned subsection). We found that in rare cases certain artifacts were detected as candidate HFO (large spikes or DC shifts were meeting the criteria – though this is rare, see below). Importantly, in those cases, our second criteria in which we calculated the fft of the raw signal eliminated these artifacts because they had high power between 75 – 125 Hz (see example Rejected events in Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Still, the point by the reviewer is important enough that we have added a second supplementary figure (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) to explore these issues more deeply. In our discussion of these data, we have also cited Benar et al. (subsection “Ripple-like oscillations and pathological high frequency oscillations occur in CA1 of the same animal”, first paragraph) to increase awareness of these important considerations when analysing HFO.</p><p>In our analysis, we detect HFO recorded on tetrodes located in the cell layer. This is where the HFO was strongest, and the concurrent interictal spike was smallest. In our experiments, other tetrodes located in stratum radiatum had simultaneously occurring interictal spikes that were larger (and unfortunately typically saturated). In one case, we have a recording session in which the simultaneously occurring interictal spikes in stratum radiatum were not saturating, and also had no visible HFO. This small data set serves as a well-suited control to test whether our HFO detection code would erroneously detect HFO when there are interictal spikes but no visible HFO. In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, we show examples of simultaneously recorded signal from the cell layer (A) and stratum radiatum (B). Despite the presence of large interictal spikes (&gt; 2000 microvolts – even larger than spikes in the cell layer), no HFO were detected in the signal recorded from stratum radiatum. We also simulated troublesome artifacts such as large DC shifts (C) or fast biphasic artifacts (D). In both of these cases, our filter introduced some false oscillation into the signal, however there were not enough high powered cycles to meet our criteria of number of high power cycles (amplitude &gt; 3 S.D). In preparing these figures, we determined that our original method description had an error. The cycle inclusion criteria for HFO is that it has at least 5, not 6, high power cycles. During initial testing we used 6, but found it was too stringent for control ripple detection. We apologize for this error and have corrected it in the Materials and methods and in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. We reran detection to verify that the variable was set to 5 for all recording sessions, which it was. In summary, in line with our previous validation, we have found that our filter is not introducing false oscillations in our data set. Interictal spikes are not causing oscillation artifact. Very fast artifacts cause some oscillatory artifact upon filtering, but in most cases the amplitudes are too small to reach criteria and in other cases the false positives were removed using further criteria based on an fft of the raw signal. These reasons combined with visual inspection of the raw signals give us confidence that our false positive rate is low.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A large chunk of the paper is devoted to the association between neural firing and pHFOs, which appear to be a proxy for interictal discharges in this model. The observation of sparse neuronal activity during high amplitude very high frequency events (up to 700 Hz, well into the range of multiunit activity) seems self-contradictory, and this needs to be resolved. There are some obvious possible explanations. First, extensive gliosis and cell death are well known to occur with the kainate model. Second, it is likely that the pHFOs are being recorded at a distance from the origination of the epileptiform activity. Finally, there is the possibility of filter artifact causing spurious pHFO detection (see point 3, above).</p></disp-quote><p>We may not have sufficiently clearly stated that the pHFOs we characterize in this study do not have peak frequencies above 320 Hz. We filtered with a much wider band (140 – 800 Hz), but we did not detect events with frequencies greater than 320 Hz. The frequency is reported in the Results, ‘pHFO n = 923, peak frequency median, 245.9 Hz; IQR, 233.7- 264.1 Hz’</p><p>Also please see Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1. We wonder whether the frequencies could be mixed up with the amplitude of the envelope – which in the case of pHFOs are associated w/ interictal spikes that have amplitudes in the 700 microvolt range (so perhaps, this is where the 700 value could have been read). We revisited the sections in the Materials and methods and Results where the frequency range is described and did not find any obvious erroneous description.</p><p>Even though we were not able to trace the comment to a particular statement, the spirit of the comment is well taken – it is counterintuitive that unit activity would be sparse during high frequency events. We think that the most likely scenario is that the high frequency oscillation in the LFP corresponds to fast synaptic inhibition (similar to what is hypothesized for normal ripple). This is consistent with a report from Muldoon et al. (which we now cite, subsection “Sparse activation of CA1 principal cells during high frequency oscillations in animals with epilepsy”, first paragraph) that shows that interneurons are strongly activated during interictal activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) How did the authors guarantee that the same neurons were recorded across sessions? Changes in neuronal waveshape during epileptiform activity and over time have been reported in continuous recordings. Was there an analysis of waveshape drift that would support the contention that a given neuron was identified correctly across sessions? Also, please provide statistics for number of sessions of recording and total number of days from first to last recording per animal.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to provide more detail about our manual cluster cutting practices. As mentioned by the reviewer, waveform shapes change during epileptiform activity, however in the current study neurons were never tracked across seizure events, and we found waveform shape to be robust against interictal activity. We did not track neurons across days – only within recording sessions which comprised resting and foraging behavior (Figure 1A). Our lab has extensive expertise in tracking the cell identities of individual hippocampal neurons within large populations across days (Mankin et al., 2012; Mankin et al., 2015, Neuron) and we have utilized the same methods and procedures for tracking individual neurons across recording sessions in our current submission. We have added an additional supplemental figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) which provides more detail of our cluster cutting, as well as generally reported cluster quality measures (L-Ratio and Isolation Distance) for neurons recorded in control and epileptic animals. Furthermore, per the reviewers request (and in our opinion, a good idea), we have included an analysis of waveform drift across recording sessions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F) which shows that drift is minimal and not different between control and epileptic animals. We have added clarifying text to the Materials and methods section and details about recording session per animal (subsection “Cell sorting and cell-tracking”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please describe and appropriately cite how wake/sleep state is determined.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the opportunity to clarify our language. In this study, we do not determine wake/sleep. Rather we compare epochs recorded in different environments which promote different types of behavior. During foraging epochs, animals are well trained to run continuously and we use running speed to qualify behavioral brain state. During resting epochs, animals are in a small comfortable container – we can only say that animals are comparatively immobile – however we do not distinguish between awake immobile and sleeping. In normal rodents, ripples occur in both of these restful states, so we did not think it necessary to delineate between the two for this study. We have gone through the text to make sure we are clear in our description of the animal’s behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is incorrect to state that pHFOs &quot;do not occur during awake and REM sleep states.&quot; They are simply less common in some (not all) patients, and likely depend on the temporal pattern of interictal discharges which are often (not always) increased during sleep. Some of the papers cited by the authors provide data on pHFOs during wakefulness, as do several studies employing long-term, round the clock automated detection.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to this over simplification and have changed this sentence to read</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>‘Contrary to our result, there are reports that fast oscillations in epilepsy are more rare during awake and REM sleep states and instead occur predominantly during non-REM sleep (Bagshaw et al., 2009; Frauscher et al., 2015).’</p><p>7) The authors should report test statistics, degrees of freedom, and actual p-values for statistical tests. It's not clear that their across-animal statistics were adequately powered. Some evidence of sufficient power would greatly support the early claims. Also, in some cases statistics are presented far removed from the accompanying claim, which is confusing to the reader. When dealing with multiple groups and ANOVA, could the authors provide the global statistical effect before comparing individual groups (CTR vs. ripple like, CTRL vs. pHFO etc.). Did authors adjust for multiple comparisons?</p></disp-quote><p>We now report exact p-values, test statistics, and where relevant, degrees of freedom. Furthermore, when dealing with multiple groups we now provide global statistics followed by a description of post hoc multiple comparisons. We have adjusted for multiple comparison – and state the post hoc test in the text where relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The conclusion that different neuronal populations could be selectively targeted ventures too far into speculation, as the authors did not show that the ripple vs. pHFO neurons came from different classes. This section should be removed or limited to a brief comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the comment about selective targeting, but we think that the discussion of possible different classes participating in ripple-like versus pHFO warrants discussion, given the knowledge that in the normal brain only superficial CA1 cells are thought to be active during ripple. Furthermore, we have shifted the emphasis of intervention away from targeting based on cell-type specificity, and instead raised the point that pHFOs could be selectively manipulated using closed-loop approaches that don’t depend on cellular identity, but take advantage of the fact that different networks are involved in the two oscillation types (Discussion, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, it is too much of a reach to propose that suppressing pHFOs would improve cognition, as the pHFOs are likely a manifestation of an interictal discharge and may also reflect other epilepsy-related abnormalities that contribute independently to the observed effects.</p></disp-quote><p>This conclusion has been altered in the discussion to highlight that ripple-like events are maintained in epileptic networks, which highlights the possibility for successful therapy (i.e. there is something normal-like left). Further, the network dynamics during interictal events (pHFOs/spikes) are segregated from network dynamics during ripple-like events. We believe that pointing out that this segregation allows for intervention that selectively targets pathological activity and speculating whether this could be beneficial is appropriate for the Discussion (Discussion, last paragraph). We believe a strength of our manuscript is a careful description of hippocampal network mechanisms that are generally impaired in the epileptic brain, versus acute effects of pHFO to ongoing information processing. We have added text highlighting the subtle effects that pHFO had on ongoing network coding in our study (point 10 below) which puts our discussion of intervention in the proper context (Discussion, sixth paragraph). However, we do raise the point that long-term effects of pHFO frequency on hippocampal connectivity, function and cognition is an important area of research needed for motivating the use of long-term pHFO suppression for therapeutic intervention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The supplementary information shows many individual examples from each recorded animal, and this inclusion extensive raw data is quite laudable. This could be improved by showing in panels A and B of Figure 2—figure supplement 1 single examples of each of the ripples, ripple-like events, and pHFOs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful that our effort to include ample amounts of raw data has been appreciated. In response to the point raised we have added examples of each event type as panels A – C of Figure 2—figure supplement 1. This new inclusion is extremely helpful for visualizing how the combination of the frequency of the high frequency oscillation and the amplitude of the envelope (voltage deflection between 0.2 – 40 Hz) distinguishes pathological from ripple-like events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) It is striking that pHFOs occur all the time, and yet have relatively modest effects on behavior, and that they don't appear to &quot;hijack&quot; normal circuits in any reliable way.

We have kept the addition short as our discussion was lengthened by adding a direct comparison with the Valero paper (Major point 1).</p></body></sub-article></article>
