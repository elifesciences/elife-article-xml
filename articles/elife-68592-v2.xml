A striking characteristic of Als proteins originally identified in the pathogenic <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is to form functional amyloids that mediate <italic>cis-</italic>interaction leading to the formation of adhesin nanodomains and <italic>trans</italic>-interaction between amyloid sequences of opposing cells. In this report, we show that flocculins encoded by <italic>FLO11</italic> in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> behave like adhesins in <italic>C. albicans</italic>. To do so, we show that the formation of nanodomains under an external physical force requires a threshold number of amyloid-forming sequences in the Flo11 protein. Then, using a genome editing approach, we constructed strains expressing variants of the Flo11 protein under the endogenous <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter, leading to the demonstration that the loss of amyloid-forming sequences strongly reduces cell-cell interaction but has no effect on either plastic adherence or invasive growth in agar, both phenotypes being dependent on the N- and C-terminal ends of Flo11p. Finally, we show that the location of Flo11 is not altered either by the absence of amyloid-forming sequences or by the removal of the N- or C-terminus of the protein.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell surface</kwd><kwd>amyloids</kwd><kwd>cell adhesion</kwd><kwd><italic>FLO11</italic></kwd><kwd>AFM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Region Occitanie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09003813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>François</surname><given-names>Jean Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lallemand SAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAIC2016/048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>François</surname><given-names>Jean Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lallemand SAS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SAIC 2018/010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>François</surname><given-names>Jean Marie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The role of amyloid-β-aggregation sequence and of the various domains in the physiological function of the <italic>FLO11</italic>-encoded adhesin in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are disclosed in this report.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The yeast cell wall is a highly dynamic structure that is not only an armour separating cell from its surrounding but that is endowed of surface properties including adherence to inert material leading to biofilm formation, cell-cell adhesion that can yield to flocculation, hydrophobicity which may result in buoyant biofilms. These properties are mediated by a variety of surface proteins called adhesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipke et al., 2018</xref>), among which flocculins are adhesins encoded by the <italic>FLO</italic> genes family (<italic>FLO1, FLO5, FLO9, FLO10,</italic> and <italic>FLO11</italic>) in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verstrepen and Klis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brückner and Mösch, 2012</xref>). In the pathogenic yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, it has been reported that these adhesins can be organized into clusters of hundreds of proteins at the cell surface leading to adhesion nanodomains. This 3D organization of adhesins into nanodomains has been shown to be triggered by an external physical shear force, such as the extension force of single molecules stretched by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip, which then propagates across the cell surface at a speed of about 20 nm/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsteens et al., 2010</xref>). This unique phenomenon was explained by the presence of small amyloid-core sequences of five to seven residues (IVIVATT) in adhesin proteins that are also characterized by a high content of β-branched aliphatic Ile, Val, and Thr forming β-aggregates structures as predicted by the β-aggregate predictor TANGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernandez-Escamilla et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipke et al., 2018</xref>). The formation of these nanodomains is therefore an emergent property of adhesin primary sequence that promotes cell-cell aggregation, resulting in the formation of robust biofilms and eventually promotes fungal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lipke et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, Lipke, Dufrêne, and colleagues developed a new pipette technology called fluidic force microscopy enabling to measure forces between single cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dehullu et al., 2019b</xref>). Using this methodology, these authors showed that amyloid-forming sequences have a dual role, namely in the formation of adhesin clusters (nanodomains), which correspond to <italic>cis</italic>-interactions between molecule of the same cell, and in homophilic adhesion between adhesins on opposing cells (<italic>trans</italic>-interaction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehullu et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>In a previous work aiming to investigate the impact of autolysis process on the nanomechanical properties of the cell wall of different <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, we identified by AFM the presence of abundant patches with a mean diameter of 140 nm at the surface of an industrial wine yeast strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiavone et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, we found that these patches were formed from highly mannosylated proteins as they interacted strongly with a concanavalin A functionalized AFM tip, showing distances rupture ranging from 50 to 500 nm. Overall, these nanostructures were reminiscent of the adhesion nanodomains formed by the clustering of Als5 adhesins on the surface of <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsteens et al., 2010</xref>). In this work, we addressed the question of whether the formation of these patches could result from the aggregation of flocculins, and if this is the case, then which of the flocculins could be responsible, taking into account that a transcriptomic analysis carried out in L69 strain revealed notably a high expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, although <italic>FLO10</italic>, <italic>FLO5,</italic> and <italic>FLO1</italic> were also expressed albeit at lower levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiavone et al., 2015</xref>). These flocculins share a common three-domain structure. The C-terminal part (C-domain) contains a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring site for covalent attachment of the protein to β (1,6)-glucans of the inner cell wall network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bony et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kapteyn et al., 1999</xref>). The middle part, stalk-like B-domain, contains serine and threonine enriched tandem repeats (TRs) encoded by conserved DNA sequences that serve as a source of variability triggered by frequent recombination events by which new adhesion/flocculin alleles could be generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Verstrepen et al., 2005</xref>). The N-terminal part (A-domain) which protrudes from the cell surface allows to classify these flocculins into two groups based on their phenotypic properties. The first type includes Flo1, Flo5, Flo9, and Flo10 proteins, which mediates flocs formation. This phenotype is brought about by the A-domain that harbours a unique Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding motif DcisD for carbohydrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Veelders et al., 2010</xref>). The other group is represented only by Flo11p, which is implicated in several phenotypes including filamentation, flor and biofilm formation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brückner and Mösch, 2012</xref>). Like <italic>C. albicans</italic> adhesins, these <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> flocculins contain β-aggregation sequences of five to seven amino acids length that are rich in Ile, Val, and Thr. However, the distribution of these repeats along the flocculins sequence enables to distinguish Flo1p, Flo5p, and Flo9p from Flo10p and Flo11p. For the three former proteins, the β-aggregation-positive sequences predicted by TANGO software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tango.crg.es/">http://tango.crg.es/</ext-link>) revealed a large number of ‘T(V/I)IVI’ motifs that are widely distributed over the B-domain (see details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Interestingly, a synthetic peptide ‘TDE<underline>TVIVI</underline>RTP’ containing this motif was shown to form amyloid fibers in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramsook et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, β-aggregation-prone sequences are less abundant in Flo10p and Flo11p and they are all located in the C-terminus. Nevertheless, it was reported that a 1331-residue soluble Flo11p can assemble into amyloid fibers in vitro and this feature was ascribed to the presence of the amyloid-β-aggregation-prone sequences ‘VVSTTV’ and ‘VTTAVTT’ at the C-terminus of Flo11p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramsook et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The purpose of this work was therefore to investigate the molecular basis and the physiological function of these patches formed on the cell surface of this industrial wine yeast strain. This study was furthermore motivated by the fact that such abundant nanostructures have never been physically observed before in <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species, despite the finding that cell-cell aggregation are potentiated under hydrodynamic shear forces and these interactions are antagonized by anti-amyloid dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramsook et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Lipke, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan et al., 2016</xref>). Collectively, the reported results lend support to the model that amyloid-forming sequences play a dual role in Flo11p-mediated cell-cell adhesion, namely promoting <italic>cis</italic>-interaction between Flo11p molecules in the same cell, leading to adhesive nanodomains, and contributing to <italic>trans</italic>-interaction between opposing cells. They further showed that this dual role is highly dependent on the number of amyloid-core sequences present in the Flo11 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biophysical characterization of the nanostructures at the cell surface of L69 strain</title><p>The presence of abundant patches at the cell surface of a wine yeast L69 strain under the contact of an AFM bare tip described in a previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiavone et al., 2015</xref>), which were totally absent on the surface of the laboratory strain BY4741 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), prompted us to examine in detail the physical properties of these nanosized patches using AFM in quantitative imaging (QI) mode as this technique enables to image at high resolution and to quantify adhesive properties of the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chopinet et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> reports height and adhesion images of a single cell from this L69 strain trapped in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchamber. The high-resolution height image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) revealed a multitude of small aggregates on the cell surface with an average diameter of 100 nm and a height above the cell surface in the range of 15–20 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These dots are even more visible on the adhesion image at high resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), whereas image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> illustrates the stiffness of the cell. A total of 1024 force-distance curves were collected from the surface of this cell to quantify the nanomechanical properties, namely adhesion forces which correspond to the retraction of the AFM tip from the surface and stiffness as the slope of the linear portion of the force versus indentation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These two physical parameters were reported as a function of the frequency of the interaction of the tip on the surface. Data of this analysis reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref> showed a bimodal distribution of adhesion forces and stiffness, indicating the existence of two types of interactions. This bimodal distribution was a general feature of all cells since we collected 1024 force-distance curve for an additional 24 cells from three independent experiments, leading to similar bimodal distribution. The maximal values of adhesion forces and stiffness calculated from each cell were reported as boxplots, confirming the occurrence of two components in these patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I &amp; J</xref>). The first interacting component that exhibits a high adhesion force (750 ± 150 pN) and low stiffness likely corresponds to hydrophobic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dague et al., 2007</xref>), whereas the other component characterized by a weaker adhesion forces and higher stiffness could be attributed to cell surface proteins that unfold upon retraction of the AFM tip. In summary, this AFM analysis showed that the nanoscale spots on the cell surface of strain L69 exhibit nanomechanical characteristics very similar to those of adhesin nanodomains in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alsteens et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Formosa et al., 2015b</xref>), and raised the question of whether a same cell wall component is responsible for formation of these patches, as it is the case in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cell surface analysis of the L69 strain using silicon nitride (Si3N4) atomic force microscopy (AFM) cantilevers.</title><p>AFM height images (<bold>A</bold>) of a single yeast cell from L69 strain embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microtimber are shown.

Accordingly, a treatment of the yeast cell with the disrupting peptide ‘VASTTVT’, which is the mutated motif of the native ‘VVSTTV’ of Flo11p from BY4741 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ramsook et al., 2010</xref>), for 90 min resulted in a complete disappearance of the high adhesion component of the nanodomains, while the low adhesion component was still present although reduced by about 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Taken together, these data support the idea that the patches on the surface of L69 cells are nanodomains formed by two components, one is weakly adhesive and independent of amyloid-forming sequences, and the other is highly adhesive and dependent on amyloid sequences.

To this end, the two copies of <italic>FLO11</italic> was deleted using the CRISPR-Cas9 toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mans et al., 2015</xref>) since L69 strain is diploid (data not shown), and this genomic deletion was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) since L69<italic>flo11Δ</italic> expressed any longer <italic>FLO11</italic> transcript (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, loss of <italic>FLO11</italic> function completely abrogated the formation of nanodomains on the surface under the action of the AFM tip. This result also indicated that the two physical components that characterized these nanodomains are mainly due to the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. These data could also explain the lack of nanodomains formation in the laboratory BY4741 strain (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) since <italic>FLO11</italic> is not expressed in this strain. To find out whether the absence of Flo11p explains the lack of nanodomains formation in the BY4741 strain, the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene of this strain was cloned into the high copy pYES2.1 plasmid under the dependence of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. However, contrary to expectation, the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> did not lead to the formation of nanodomains under the action of the AFM tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), although this gene was highly expressed as determined by qRT-PCR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This failure could be ascribed either to the lack of translation of the <italic>FLO11</italic> transcript or more likely to the fact that FLo11p in strain L69 differed from that of strain BY4741. To validate this suggestion, the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene from strain L69 whose genome was recently sequenced (Lallemand Inc, unpublished data) was retrieved in order to be expressed in BY strain from a 2µ copy plasmid as above. Interestingly, we noticed that the sequence of <italic>FLO11</italic> gene (provisional GenBank accession number BankIt2416107 Seq1MW448340) of strain L69 was 1.06 kbp longer than that of BY4741 (i.e. 5.16 vs. 4.10 kbp).

However, this analysis revealed major differences between the Flo11p of strain L69 and that of other yeast strains. In particular, Flo11p of strain L69 contains more repeats (TRs) than the proteins of BY4741 and 1278b, but slightly fewer (46 vs. 49) than the Flo11p of flor strain 133d. Quite interestingly, the 49 TRs in Flo11p of this flor strain are composed of the same 81 nucleotides (nt), as indicated by sequence analysis using EMBOSS TANDEM software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durbin et al., 2000</xref>), whereas the other Flo11p have four types of intragenic repeats of different nt size that score differently each (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2a</xref> that provides details on intragenic repeats and corresponding sequence for each Flo11p in this study). Another major difference is the presence of an additional sequence of ~200 amino acids length near the C-terminus of Flo11p<sup>L69</sup> and which is highy enriched in β-aggregation-prone sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for TANGO predictor analysis). This additional sequence most likely originated from a twofold repetition of a sequence of about 90–100 amino acids near the C-terminus that is present in all other Flo11p (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

We also decided to construct additional variants of this protein that lack the A-domain, the C-terminus, and about half of the TRs of the B-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) to further investigate the role of these domains in the physiological function of Flo11p. All constructs were verified by PCR and by sequencing that the region where the genome editing has been carried out to ensure that it was done in both copies of the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene. According to this approach, the different Flo11p variants were expressed from the endogenous <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter like the wild-type protein, and therefore strains carrying these mutated <italic>FLO11</italic> could be used for direct comparative phenotypic analyses. However, to validate this approach, we had to verify that these genes were indeed expressed, that the encoded protein was present in similar quantities between the different strains and, above all, that the mutated proteins were still located at the cell wall. The expression of the genes encoding the different variants of Flo11p<sup>L69</sup> was determined by qRT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, they were expressed at comparable levels, except for the gene encoding Flo11-ΔNter protein, whose transcripts were approximately twofold lower than those of the other transcripts. To determine whether the wild-type and mutated forms of Flo11p are localized in the cell wall, we conducted an immunofluorescence assay using the Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated monoclonal antibody anti-6x-His-tag which cross-reacts with the 6x-His-tag sequence present at the C-terminus of Flo11p and its variants that have been inserted into the corresponding genes by CRISPR-Cas9 technology as described in Materials and methods. The results of this experiment clearly showed the presence of several fluorescent spots at the cell periphery that correspond to Flo11p localized in the cell wall, in line with previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fidalgo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2000</xref>). Similar location was observed with Flo11p in which RR1, RR2 region, or even A-domain (Nter deletion) has been removed. More remarkably, removal of the C-terminus that carries the remnant GPI anchor allowing covalent binding of Flo11p to β-1,6 glucans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frieman and Cormack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douglas et al., 2007</xref>) did not abolish the localization of Flo11p to the cell wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, we wished to quantify Flo11p directly in the cell by proteomic analysis. To do so, we prepared cell wall/cell membrane prepared according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sarode et al., 2011</xref>. Although several cell wall (i.e. Fks1p, Fks2p, Crh1p, Gas1p, Exg1p, Ygp1p, etc.) and cell membranes proteins (i.e. Pma1p, Hxt6p, etc.) were detected in strain L69, Flo11p as well as other flocculins whose expression was validated by transcriptomic were not found (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> reporting a typical proteomic analysis of cell wall/cell membrane sample prepared from L69 strain). In addition, detection of the Flo11p bearing 6x-His-tag at the C-terminus by Western blotting using anti-His antibody in these cell wall/cell membrane preparations was also unsuccessful.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The cell wall localization of Flo11p is not impaired by removal of C-terminus, as well as of N-terminus or ablation of RR2 region bearing amyloid-core sequences.</title><p>Localization of Flo11p and its variants was visualized by confocal microscopy in strain L69 that expressed a 6x-His-tag at the C-terminus of the Flo11 or its variants from the endogenous <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter grown on YPD% and taken at the exponential phase of growth.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68592-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The amyloid-core sequences in Flo11p from strain L69 are responsible for nanodomains formation</title><p>The cell surface of yeast strains expressing the different Flo11 protein variants (i.e. L69<italic>flo11-∆Nter</italic>, L69<italic>flo11-∆Cter</italic>, L69<italic>flo11-∆RR1,</italic> and L69<italic>flo11-∆RR2</italic> strain) were imaged by AFM using bare tips. As height images of individual cell trapped in the PDMS microchamber from each of these strains were similar, this argued that the expression of the different Flo11p<sup>L69</sup> variants had no impact on the global surface topology of the yeast cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). From these adhesion images, it can be clearly seen that the ablation of the RR2 region resulted in the inability of the Flo11p variant to produce nanodomains under the AFM tip. In contrast, yeast cells from L69 strain expressing a Flo11p variant lacking either the N- or the C-terminus still showed the formation of nanodomains at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, the morphology and nanomechanical properties of these patches were different from those obtained by the wild-type Flo11p. Indeed, the nanodomains on the surface of yeast cells expressing the Flo11-ΔNter variant showed a unimodal distribution of low adhesion forces and thus they have lost the high adhesive component (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Likewise, the patches on the surface of L69<italic>flo11-ΔCter</italic> cells had only the low-adhesion component but they exhibited a needle-shaped morphology with a height that was three times greater than those formed on the surface of L69 cells expressing the normal Flo11p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, formation of small aggregates of less than 10 cells was observed upon ectopic overexpression of the endogenous <italic>FLO11</italic><sup>BY</sup>. However, the size and abundance of these aggregates were dramatically increased in BY<italic>Δflo11</italic> that overexpresses <italic>FLO11<sup>L69</sup></italic>, reaching same capacity of cell-cell aggregation that of strain L69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and presenting huge aggregates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the insertion of RR2 sequence in <italic>FLO11<sup>B</sup></italic><sup>Y</sup> allowed to enhance the formation of cell aggregates as compared to expression of <italic>FLO11<sup>BY</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Complementary to this experiment, the role of amyloid-core sequences in cell-cell adhesion could be assessed using amyloid perturbants. We found that aggregates formed in L69 strain or in BY<italic>Δflo11</italic> that overexpressed <italic>FLO11<sup>L69</sup></italic> were largely disrupted upon incubation with the amyloid disruptor thioflavine S (see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas, as expected, this drug had no effect in strain lacking Flo11p (strain L69 <italic>Δflo11</italic>, data not shown) or in strain L69<italic>flo11-ΔRR2</italic> that expressed a Flo11p variant lacking amyloid-forming sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). On the contrary, cell-cell aggregation in YSWT3α strain was not disturbed upon incubation with thioflavin S (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the phenotype which is otherwise dependent to a large extent on Flo11p (see data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) does not imply amyloid-forming sequences. Collectively, these results indicated that amyloid-core sequences contribute to cell-cell adhesion but are not essential for this phenotype.</p><p>To further illustrate the contribution of amyloid-core sequences in cell-cell adhesion, we removed the RR2 region from Flo11p<sup>L69</sup> and found that this ablation resulted in a 75% reduction of the cell-cell interaction, and this reduction was statistically higher than that of the removal of the A-domain (Flo11-ΔNter) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). The contribution of the other domains of Flo11p to this phenotype was also evaluated. The percentage of cell aggregates dropped by approximately 50% upon deletion of the C-terminus, which could be accounted by the loss of two out of the four amyloid-forming sequences (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A 50% reduction of cell aggregates was also observed in the strain that expresses Flo11p lacking part of the B-domain (RR1 sequence). Altogether, these results indicated that the in vivo efficiency of cell-cell interaction requires the full Flo11 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Investigation of domains of Flo11p required for adherence and surface hydrophobicity properties</title><p>The contribution of the amyloid-core sequences and of various Flo11p domains on adherence and hydrophobicity properties was then assessed using the dedicated strains constructed above, which expressed Flo11p variants from the endogenous <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter. Adherence of cells as assayed on polystyrene surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reynolds and Fink, 2001</xref>) was, as reported earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>), strongly affected by pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, this pH effect was not comparable between yeast strains. While adherence to plastic of strains L69 and BY4741 was significantly reduced by raising the pH from 5.0 to 8.0, the opposite was found for strain YSTWα. However, this property did not rely exclusively on the presence of Flo11p since this phenotype was observed in BY4741 strain that does not express this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 1996</xref>), whereas the deletion of <italic>FLO11</italic> in strain L69 and YSTWα did not completely abrogate adherence to polystyrene. On the other hand, our data showed that the potency of cells to adhere to plastic was dramatically enhanced by overexpression of <italic>FLO11</italic> as found with BYΔflo11 cells that ectopically overexpressed this gene from a high copy plasmid carrying <italic>FLO11</italic> under <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, it is worth noticing that cells overexpressing <italic>FLO11<sup>L69</sup></italic> had higher adherence to plastic than those expressing <italic>FLO11<sup>BY</sup></italic>, whether the assay was carried out at pH 5.0 or 8.0 (p-value &lt; 0.005). This more potent effect of <italic>FLO11<sup>L69</sup></italic> could probably due to the strongest expression of this gene compared to <italic>FLO11<sup>BY</sup></italic> in the BY<italic>Δflo11</italic> cells rather than to the additional presence of amyloid sequences in Flo11p<sup>69</sup> as indicated by our transcript analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the overexpression of the chimeric construct <italic>FLO11<sup>BY</sup>-RR2<sup>L69</sup></italic> in BY<italic>flo11Δ</italic> cells resulted in a similar adherence as overexpression of <italic>FLO11<sup>BY</sup></italic>. Further analysis of the domains of Flo11p that are implied in adherence to polystyrene showed that the C-terminal domain contributed the most to this property at pH 5.0, whereas at pH 8.0, the removal of the N-terminus of Flo11p<sup>L69</sup> resulted in a drop of adherence equal to that obtained upon deletion of <italic>FLO11</italic> gene. This result is, on the one hand, in line with the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref> that the N-terminus of Flo11p is essential for cell adhesion to polystyrene, but on the other hand, it did not support their claims that this mediation is only effective at low pH. To sum up, these results indicate that the rate of cell adherence to plastic is dependent on the amount of Flo11p produced on the cell surface while the ability to adhere to these surfaces is influenced by the sequence of this protein.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Adherence to plastic is strongly impacted by pH and does not solely depend on the A-domain of Flo11p.</title><p>Adherence of yeast cells was carried out a 96-well polystyrene plate as described in Materials and methods.

Our data also showed that each domain of Flo11p contributed to this phenotype, with the N-terminal carrying the higher contribution and the C-terminal the lowest. Since surface hydrophobicity is critical in the formation of buoyant biofilm that is strictly dependent on Flo11p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fidalgo et al., 2006</xref>), we examined whether L69 strain, which is a wine yeast, could exhibit this phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre, 2013</xref>).

This phenotype is commonly assessed by agar invasion assay that consists in cultivating yeast cells on agar plates containing rich or synthetic sugar medium for several days and then examining those cells that remained sticky on the agar plates after extensive washing under a stream of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roberts and Fink, 1994</xref>). Applying this assay to L69 strain, we found that this strain exhibited massive invasion in agar on both rich (YPD) and synthetic (YNGal) sugar medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The finding that invasiveness on agar occurred in this strain, which is diploid, may be attributed to the relatively high expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> measured in this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiavone et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, agar invasion was also observed for the haploid YSWT3αstrain, a derivative of Σ1278b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dowell et al., 2010</xref>), whereas it was totally absent in BY4741 strain, likely because <italic>FLO11</italic> is not expressed in this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 1996</xref>).

This sequence probably originates from a twofold repeat of a 90–100 amino acids sequence present near the C-terminus of all Flo11 flocculins that contains the amyloid-forming sequence ‘VVSTTV’ followed by ‘ITTTFV’. This repeat provides therefore two additional amyloid-core sequences to the Flo11p of strain L69, which are clearly determinant in the process of nanodomains formation. Indeed, we showed that the insertion of this RR2 sequence into the Flo11p of BY4741 allowed this strain to form adhesion nanodomains with nanomechanical properties similar to those formed on the cell surface of strain L69.</p><p>Our AFM analysis revealed that these nanodomains encompass two components: a first one characterized by a high adhesion force, which corresponds to amyloid nanodomains as they are disrupted under the action of anti-amyloid agents, while the other component has low adhesion force which likely corresponds to isolated Flo11 proteins and possibly other cell wall proteins that may unfold under the action of the AFM tip. This behaviour is fully reminiscent to the nanodomains formed by adhesins on the cell surface of the pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Formosa et al., 2015b</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Formosa et al., 2015b</xref>). This analysis also highlighted that, while the amyloid-core sequences are essential in the formation of adhesion nanodomains, other parts of the Flo11p sequence also contribute to their production. In particular, the removal of about half of the TRs in the B-domain almost completely abolished nanodomains formation, while the highly adhesive component of these nanodomains was no longer observed after removal of the N- or C-terminus of Flo11p. These results indicated that the whole Flo11 protein is needed to acquire the right production of adhesion nanodomains and support the model of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lipke et al., 2012</xref> suggesting that upon the traction of an AFM tip or any other physical stretch, the adhesins are unfolded through their TRs, which expose amyloid-core sequences for interaction between neighbouring molecules.</p><p>The existence of the unique RR2 sequence in Flo11p of strain L69 led us to investigate the role of amyloid-forming sequences in the physiological function of this protein in relation to the role of other domains of this protein. For this purpose, we used CRISPR-Cas9 technology to create Flo11p variants specifically defective in these domains or sequences and whose expression is strictly dependent on the endogenous <italic>FLO11</italic> promoter. This approach should allow us to perform comparative phenotypic analyses under conditions where the expression of these proteins is physiologically comparable. While our qRT-PCR fully confirmed this assertion, proteomic analysis carried out on cell wall/cell membrane preparation from L69 strain failed to detect Flo11p although other relevant cell wall proteins were identified. A likely explanation of this failure is the fact that Flo11p as well as other flocculins are not abundant cell wall proteins. Nevertheless, immunofluorescence experiments enabled to clearly identify Flo11p at the cell periphery and remarkably, same localization was found for all different Flo11p variants, leading to conclude that they are all in the cell wall. This result calls into question the fact that the modified GPI anchor at the C-terminus of Flo protein is essential for these flocculins to be retained at the cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bony et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kapteyn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douglas et al., 2007</xref>). However, the finding of Flo11 protein in the extracellular medium when the GPI anchor was removed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Douglas et al., 2007</xref>) could be explained by the fact the corresponding gene was expressed from a high copy plasmid under the strong <italic>PGK1</italic> promoter, which likely resulted in the production of a huge amount of protein that exceeds its ability to be entirely retained in the cell wall. Our immunofluorescence assays are also consistent with AFM data suggesting that Flo11 variants lacking C- or N-terminus are expressed at the cell surface, although firm demonstration of this cell surface localization should require further experiments using ligands, such as antibodies, recognizing specifically these truncated forms of Flo11p.</p><p>Cell-cell adhesion is a major cell wall property of Flo11p which is translated into either the sedimentation of cells as flocs at the bottom of the culture medium (flocculation phenotype), the formation of biofilm at the air-liquid interface (flor phenotype), or even biofilms on abiotic surface (adherence to plastic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Verstrepen and Klis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brückner and Mösch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexandre, 2013</xref>). Based on their work, Mösch and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brückner et al., 2020</xref>) proposed a Flo11p-dependent model of cell-cell adhesion that can furthermore allow for discrimination between cells from the same and from a different kind (kin discrimination). In a first model, it is proposed that Flo11 molecules cluster in <italic>cis-</italic> via amyloid β-sheet interactions sequences followed by interactions in <italic>trans</italic> between clusters of Flo11p of opposing cells. An alternative model was to suggest a simple bi-molecular Flo11p-Flo11p <italic>trans</italic>-interaction. Whatever the model, these authors showed an essential role of the A-domain, which encompasses 185–240 aa length at the N-terminal after the secretion signal of Flo11p, in cell-cell adhesion and indicated that this interaction is promoted at acidic pH and reduced at alkali pH. While our data did not reproduce very well those from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref> with respect to the importance of A-domain in the formation of cell aggregates and adherence to polystyrene, they however could support the models of cell-cell adhesion proposed by these authors. Indeed, the removal of amyloid-forming sequence in Flo11p of the L69 strain resulted in 70% drop in cellular aggregation, whereas loss of Flo11p abrogated this phenotype, indicating that the remaining aggregation can be due to simple bi-molecular interactions of isolated Flo11p between cells. Conversely, cell-cell interaction was reduced by 50% in a strain expressing Flo11p defective of the A-domain, suggesting that amyloid-forming sequences could in part overcome this defect and thus mediate interaction in <italic>trans</italic>. The finding that cell-cell aggregation was higher in BY4741 expressing a chimeric Flo11<sup>BY</sup>-RR2<sup>L69</sup> protein than in the same strain expressing its own endogenous Flo11p also supports this suggestion, as well as the fact that huge aggregates seen in BY4741 strain overexpressing <italic>FLO11<sup>L69</sup></italic> are cancelled by incubation with anti-amyloidophilic agents. Collectively, our results could be put in perspective with the recent work of Lipke and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ho et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehullu et al., 2019a</xref>) which used an innovative fluidic force microscopy enabled to manipulate and measured force at the single cells level to show that homotypic interactions between opposing cells can be mediated by amyloid-forming sequences. Nevertheless, the implication of amyloid-forming sequence is likely not an absolute requirement for cell-cell aggregation as witnessed by the finding that strain Σ1278b, which is known to only express Flo11p, forms huge aggregates that are resilient to the treatment with anti-amyloidophilic agents. These data could therefore agree with a model of Flo11p <italic>trans</italic>-interaction only mediated by A-domain.</p><p>Another dominant phenotype brought about by the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> is the ability of haploid yeast cells to undergo invasive growth in agar or pseudohyphal growth for a diploid cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gancedo, 2001</xref>). In this work, we found that strain L69 exhibited a very intense invasive growth phenotype, which was at first glance surprising since this strain is diploid. This phenotype is commonly not expressed in diploid cells unless <italic>FLO11</italic> is highly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lo and Dranginis, 1998</xref>). However, it is unlikely that this pronounced agar invasion of L69 strain was solely due to high expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> since our proteomic analysis failed to detect Flo11p. In addition, it should be noticed that the so-called high expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> in L69 strain was made in reference with BY4742 strain that does not express this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiavone et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, other yet unclear mechanisms must exist in this strain to account for this peculiar phenotype. Beside this open question, we showed that the N- and C-terminus of Flo11p are indispensable to elicit agar invasion phenotype, whereas amyloid-forming sequences have no role in this process. Our data are consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraushaar et al., 2015</xref> who previously showed that the deletion of the A (N-terminal) domain of Flo11p abrogates agar adhesion, and also highlight a role for the C-terminus in this phenotype. This latter result could be explained by the inability of the cell to remain trapped in agar due to the fact that Flo11p, in the absence of its C-terminus, is still localized at the cell wall as indicated by our immunofluorescence assay, but loosely retained in this external structure. The invasive growth in agar was also strongly diminished upon deletion of repeat sequences in the B-domain, which can be explained by a reduction of glycosylation of Flo11p as a defect in this process was found to reduce invasive growth in agar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meem and Cullen, 2012</xref>). Alternatively, the removal of TR in B-domain (i.e. RR1 sequence) may prevent Flo11p from reaching the cell surface and therefore reduce the capacity of the cells to remain trapped in the agar. Finally, this study brought to light new data on the process of invasive growth. On the one hand, we found that invasion in agar of strain L69 was equally intense under any kind of growth media, whereas this phenotype in Σ1278b background strain was weak in a galactose agar medium and absent in a glucose agar synthetic medium. In addition, the potent agar invasion phenotype of strain L69 could not be solely attributed to <italic>FLO11</italic> gene because the overexpression of this gene in YSTW3a <italic>flo11Δ</italic> (derivative of Σ1278b) did not provide to this strain a higher capacity to invade agar than that of the isogenic YSTW3α expressing its endogenous gene. More puzzling was to find that the ectopic overexpression of <italic>FLO11</italic> in BY4741 did not rescue the inability of this haploid strain to elicit invasive growth phenotype. Altogether, these data indicated that the Flo11p-dependent invasive phenotype involves additional genetic factors that are absent in BY4741 and that are more expressed in L69 strain, accounting for the higher potency of this strain to invade agar.</p><p>Based on this work and on several previous works on Flo11p in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, one can raise the question why strains that naturally express Flo11p or in which this gene has been ectopically expressed do not exhibit collectively all these phenotypes of flocculation, flor, or growth invasion. Clearly, a large part of the answer lies in the sequence of this protein, and more precisely in differences found in the three domains of this protein, as already suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barua et al., 2016</xref> for the phenotypic comparison between Flo11p from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> var <italic>diastaticus</italic> and Σ1278b. As an example, the pH dependence and adherence to polystyrene is totally different between L69 and Σ1278b strain. This difference could be explained by the fact that Flo11p in the latter strain has a 15 amino acid insertion in the N-terminal at position 115–130 that was shown to strongly enhance the adhesive property of Flo11p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brückner and Mösch, 2012</xref>). Likewise, the ability of Flo11p to elicit a flor phenotype in yeast has been attributed to high copy number of TRs in the B-domain, which enhances surface hydrophobicity via higher glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fidalgo et al., 2006</xref>). However, the strain L69 does not exhibit flor phenotype although the expansion of the B-domain in Flo11p of this strain is very similar to that of strain 133d (46 TRs vs. 49 TRs). The lack of flor phenotype of L69 strain could be due either to a lower glycosylation of its Flo11p or to the type of TRs sequences, which in the case of Flo11p of this strain is represented by four different sequences, while only one single sequence of 81 nt is repeated 49 times in the Flo11p of strain 133d. In summary, the Flo11p sequence has been subjected to evolution to adapt yeast to its specific ecological niche and, therefore, the acquisition of additional amyloid-forming sequences in the Flo11p of the L69 strain could be due either to its original niche or to the particular conditions related to the industrial process for its propagation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used and constructed in this work are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

The cells were grown overnight at 30°C in YNGal (supplemented with auxotrophic requirements when necessary), washed once in PBS buffer, and resuspended in YNGal adjusted at either pH 5.0 or pH 8.0 with HCL or NaOH 1 M to obtain one unit OD<sub>600</sub>. Aliquots of 100 μl of the culture were transferred into 96-well polystyrene plates and the cell suspensions were incubated at 30°C for 1 hr at 200 rpm. An equal volume of 0.1% (w/v) crystal violet was then added to each well. After 15 min, the wells were washed four times with sterile water, and the adherence of the cells was quantified by solubilizing the retained crystal violet in 100 μl 95% ethanol. After 10 min, the absorbance of the samples against the blank was measured at 595 nm in microplate reader (Biotek).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Octane adhesion test</title><p>Hydrophobic features of yeast surface were determined by measuring their affinity for a nonpolar solvent as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Purevdorj-Gage et al., 2007</xref>.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your study confirms and expands our understanding of fungal adhesins in general, and the role of amyloid-forming regions in particular. Specifically, the data show that amyloid sequences are needed for cis-interactions leading to clusters of Flo11p at the cell surface.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Physiological function of Flo11p domains and the particular role of amyloid core sequences of this adhesin in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Lipke (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While all reviewers agree that your work is an interesting confirmation of previous findings, they also agreed that the study suffers from several loose ends that need to be resolved before the paper can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Firstly, there is no direct evidence that the different adhesin constructs are present in more or less equal amounts at the cell surface. Expression levels may not be a good proxy for the levels of active protein at the cell surface, especially for constructs lacking the GPI domain medium and decreased surface anchorage. Hence, further experiments to address this issue, for example using previously established methods to observe adhesins, such as atomic force microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy, seem essential.</p><p>Secondly, the formation of amyloid-like structures was not demonstrated directly. Demonstrating that the relevant peptides can form amyloids that can be broken by ThioS or the breaker peptide, would take care of that issue.</p><p>Third, it does not seem appropriate to only show data from one cell instead of reporting the aggregated data from all cells.</p><p>A last important issue is that the structure of the abstract and in fact the whole manuscript is perhaps not optimal. The authors convey and mix too many different messages, and the summary and main text would benefit from simplification and a better separation of the different questions that are addressed. In addition, the authors are also encouraged to better discuss their findings against the background of previous literature, explicitly pointing out where their findings confirm previous observations.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript would benefit from discussion of relevant data and models in 3 recent papers:</p><p>Ho et al., 2019.

FEMS Yeast Res. 2012 Feb;12(1):78-87.</p><p>p. 4: In the description of the protein architecture the function of the A-domain as an adhesin is now missing and should be described in detail, since it is the A-domain that contains the Flo11 domain (see Pfam database: PF10182 or the interpro database). The Flo11p domain is now generally accepted as the domain of the Flo11 protein that is responsible for the cell-cell interaction.</p><p>Nanodomains were observed using AFM and a bare tip. Some details on how the measurements were performed are missing from the Materials and Methods section, such as which cantilever(s) of the MLCT were used, in which buffer (or growth medium) (what was the pH?) were the experiments performed. Were the cantilevers plasma or O3 cleaned?</p><p>A question that arises when looking at the adhesion maps and adhesion force determination is which type of interaction is present here? Is it an electrostatic or hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction? Plasma/O3 cleaning can change the hydrophilicity of the cantilever and the adhesion strength. It would be interesting to better characterize the type of interaction since now there is no control. As an additional measurement, the cantilever could be coated with compounds that make the surface hydrophobic or positive or negative charged.</p><p>Additionally, since the type of interaction is not well characterized (as well as the conditions), it is not clear now with which part of the Flo11p (and/or the glycans (Meem 7 Cullen, 2012); since yeast glycans contain (charged) phosphates that can interact (Goossens KV, Ielasi FS, Nookaew I, Stals I, Alonso-Sarduy L, Daenen L, Van Mulders SE, Stassen C, van Eijsden RG, Siewers V, Delvaux FR, Kasas S, Nielsen J, Devreese B, Willaert RG. Molecular mechanism of flocculation self-recognition in yeast and its role in mating and survival. mBio. 2015 Apr 14;6(2):e00427-15). For example, Kraushaar et al., (Structure. 2015 Jun 2;23(6):1005-17) showed that the Flo11 domain trans-interact via a hydrophobic interaction due to the presence of 2 aromatic bands in the structure. They also discovered that this interaction only occurs at low pH (5.5) and not at higher pH (6.8)).</p><p>These aspects will influence the results on the measured adhesion forces. A bimodal distribution of the adhesion forces were observed. The weaker adhesion forces were attributed to surface proteins that unfold upon retraction of the AFM tip (p. 6, line 137; p. 7, line 160). Are these surface proteins the Flo11 proteins? There is no direct evidence from the results that these nanodomains are composed of Flo11p. This could be obtained by adhesion maps using an anti-Flo11p antibody or with the purified Flo11p, or Flo11p on other cells by performing single cell force-spectroscopy (Brückner et al., e<italic>Life</italic>. 2020 Apr 14;9:e55587). What was the effect of lowering the maximal applied force on the adhesion forces?</p><p>If the weaker adhesion forces were due to unfolding of proteins, this should be visible in the force-distance curves. If it was not visible, this hypothesis should be rejected. Please provide these graphs.</p><p>p. 11, line 254: &quot;On the other hand, the cell surface of L69flo11-∆Cter cell was characterized by needle-shaped nanostructures whose height was 3 times greater than nanodomains formed on the surface of the L69 strain. These nanodomains displayed adhesion forces that were scattered from a few pN to max 200 pN and stiffness that was roughly 30% higher than that of nanodomains from L69 strain (see Figure S9, in supplementary data).&quot;</p><p>– How could these results be explained? When the C-terminal part of the protein has been removed, is it still anchored in the cell wall? Is there proof of this? Suppose that the truncated Flo11p is present: Does the bare AFM tip interact specifically with the remainder of Flo11p and does cis-interaction results again in these nanodomains? Why are these nanodomains then larger?</p><p>The force-distance curves shown in Figure S.9 G, indicate 2 slopes indicating that first a softer layer is pushed through. Not clear what this could be?</p><p>p. 12, line 293: …&quot;This residual clumping is likely a specific feature from Σ1278b background strain, which does not hamper the notion that Flo11p is critical in cell-cell interaction. This is further supported by the lack of aggregates in BY4741 as this strain does not express FLO11 due to non-sense mutation in FLO8 encoding its major transcriptional activator.</p><p>– Not clear what is meant with a &quot;specific&quot; feature? How could this remaining interaction be explained? Remark that Brückner et al., (2020) demonstrated quantitatively using single-cell force spectroscopy that the Flo11p A-domain is needed to have a significant cell-cell interaction (although some variation is present in these single-cell experiments).</p><p>– Were these aggregation experiments also performed at a lower pH and could the results of Kraushaar et al., (2015) be confirmed?</p><p>– It has been shown recently that the BY4741 strain can flocculate depending on the condition and this flocculation was independent of Flo5p (see Degreif D, de Rond T, Bertl A, Keasling JD, Budin I. Lipid engineering reveals regulatory roles for membrane fluidity in yeast flocculation and oxygen-limited growth. Metab Eng. 2017 May;41:46-56). This has been shown for Flo1p. In many conditions, Flo1p and Flo11p are be coexpressed. Remark that the expression of FLO11 is very complex and control has been attributed to many transcription factors (Brückner S, Mösch HU. Choosing the right lifestyle: adhesion and development in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. FEMS Microbiol Rev. 2012 Jan;36(1):25-58.).</p><p>Has it been assessed that the flocs that were observed could be deflocculated by adding EDTA? Was the expression of other Flo proteins also measured?</p><p>– How many aggregates were counted to obtain the results? It is not clear if this method can detect significant small changes in interaction forces.</p><p>– An additional quantitative method of measuring the interaction between cells is needed to confirm the obtained results based on observing aggregates.</p><p>p. 14, line 330: … &quot;Adherence was assayed on polystyrene surfaces.&quot;</p><p>– Note that this was also investigated before: see Van Mulders et al., 2009, and should be included in the discussion (since here also the adhesion of cells that express other Flo proteins was investigated).</p><p>p. 14, line 335: &quot;Moreover, the moderate adherence of BY4741 cell to plastic at pH 5.0 must be due to cell wall proteins other than Flo11p, since this gene is not expressed in this strain due to a non-sense mutation in FLO8 encoding its transcriptional activator (Liu et al., 1996).</p><p>– Same comment as before: Under the selected conditions, was it confirmed that no other Flo proteins were expressed?</p><p>p. 16 and discussion: Invasive growth experiments =&gt; discuss the results also in relation to previous published results on this (such as Van Mulders et al., 2009).</p><p>p. 19, line 454: &quot;The finding that this phenotype was not abrogated when domain A was deleted could be at first glance in contradiction with the data of Kraushaar et al., (Kraushaar et al., 2015) who showed that this domain is essential for conferring cell-cell adhesion by facilitating homotypic interactions&quot;.</p><p>– Also in contrast to others: Bayly et al., (2005), Goossens and Willaert (2012).</p><p>However, the lack of A domain can be in part overcome by amyloid-forming sequences as these later could promote clustering of Flo11 molecules in cis, which enables cell-cell adhesion by trans-interaction as proposed by these same authors (Kraushaar et al., 2015, Bruckner et al., 2020).</p><p>– In the model hypothesis of Kraushaar et al., 2015; Bruckner et al., 2020 (based and their results as well on previous results from e.g. Ramsook et al.,), they propose that there is trans interaction between interacting cells, which is based on the interaction of the Flo11 domains, and that cis-interaction between various Flo11 proteins via the β-aggregation-prone amyloid-forming sequences could precede the trans-interaction. This model needs further experimental confirmation to be generally accepted.</p><p>It could be that the observed nanodomains correspond to trans-interacting Flo11 proteins. However, the cell-cell interaction would be significantly reduced if the Flo11p domains are not present in the truncated protein. This is however in contrast to what has been observed by the authors in this manuscript. Therefore, it is not clear how this can be explained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68592.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While all reviewers agree that your work is an interesting confirmation of previous findings, they also agreed that the study suffers from several loose ends that need to be resolved before the paper can be considered for publication in eLife.</p><p>Firstly, there is no direct evidence that the different adhesin constructs are present in more or less equal amounts at the cell surface. Expression levels may not be a good proxy for the levels of active protein at the cell surface, especially for constructs lacking the GPI domain medium and decreased surface anchorage. Hence, further experiments to address this issue, for example using previously established methods to observe adhesins, such as atomic force microscopy and immunofluorescence microscopy, seem essential.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed clear that there is no direct correlation between expression level of a given gene and level of the encoded protein and so we agreed that qRT-PCR, although showing similar expression levels of the genes encoding the wild type and the variants of Flo11 should be completed by a more direct quantification of the protein. We solve this issue in two ways:</p><p>A – As suggested by reviewer #1 and Editor, we carried out immunofluorescence assays. To do this, Flo11 and its variants were flanked at their C-ter of a 6-His tag which was inserted into the gene by CRISPR-cas9. Then, the immunofluorescence assay was carried out using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Anti-6x-His Tag Monoclonal Antibody. The result of this experiment clearly shows strong and distinct fluorescence spots at the cell periphery, regardless of the Flo11 variant used. This result, which we present as Figure 5 in the revised paper, leads to two relevant pieces of information which are (i) loss of amyloid β-aggregation sequence does not abrogate this localisation and (ii) more importantly, loss of C-ter and thus of the GPI anchor does not apparently prevent Flo11 protein to be retained at the cell surface. We then wanted to quantify the level of Flo11 protein produced in strains using flow cytometer, but the signal level was close to the autofluorescence, likely because our constructs are expressed at a single copy from the endogenous FLO11 promoter.</p><p>B – The second approach was to quantify Flo11p by a shot gun proteomic analysis on samples enriched with cell wall and cell membranes according to a protocol taken from Sarode et al., (EC, 10, 1516-1526, 2011). We did this experiment twice and identified around 700 proteins, from cell wall, cell membrane and mitochondria (likely because of the process of centrifugation that was suggested in the protocol). In cell wall, we identified about 20 cell wall among which Gas1, Fks1, Fks2, cwp1, several cell mannoproteins such as Pir1, Pir4, Pst1, Cwp1, but we failed to detect Flo11p as well as other flocculins. When looking carefully to the median abundance of the cell wall proteins that were identified in this shot-gun proteomic analysis, using SGD database , it turns out that the detection limit for statistical confidence in protein identification roughly corresponded to 3000 molecules per cell (ie the case for EXG2 encoding an endo1,3-glucanase). Thus, it may be possible that level of Flo11p was below this level, which could also explain that we were unable to detect Flo11p by Western blot using the same strain that was used for immunofluoresecence and thus using the anti-HIS antibody to cross react with the 6xHis tag that is at the C-ter of the Flo11p. It should be noticed that detection of Flo11p reported in previous work was done using strains that were transformed with a 2-µ plasmid that carries FLO11 under a strong promoter such as PGK1 (see work of Douglas et al., 2007) or under GAL1. Thus, the data we have reported here actually suggest that Flo11p is not a very abundant protein and that if this protein is highly overproduced, this may result in the expression of phenotypic behaviours that no longer reflect physiological reality. For the interest of reviewers and readers, we have provided the proteomic data for strain L69 in the supplementary data (data of one typical proteomic analysis is reported Supplementary File 3, as the second provided very similar results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the formation of amyloid-like structures was not demonstrated directly. Demonstrating that the relevant peptides can form amyloids that can be broken by ThioS or the breaker peptide, would take care of that issue.</p></disp-quote><p>It was already shown that Flo11p assembled into amyloid fibers in vitro (see reference Ramsook et al., Eukaryotic Cell, 9: 393-404, and this reference is given in our paper). This was not the purpose of this work to rediscover that, but to show that the nanodomains at the surface of the L69 strain was due to the presence of amyloid-core sequences in the Flo11p. Our data support the Lipke’ model that these β-aggregation prone sequences are required for the production of these nanostructures in response to an external force such as the retraction of AFM tip from the surface, and that these nanostructures are abolished when these sequences are removed in the protein (Flo11-ΔRR2) or upon incubation with an anti-amyloid peptide or amyloid perturbing agents such as thioflavin S.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, it does not seem appropriate to only show data from one cell instead of reporting the aggregated data from all cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in MandM, all AFM experiments were repeated 3 times on each strain expressing a Flo11 variant (ie 3 biological replicates), with 4 to 8 cells per replicate. For each cell, 1024 force-distance curves have been recorded given rise to histograms of the distribution of adhesion forces or spring constants. In figure 1E, we reported such a representation for one representative cell. By aggregating all data, we found obviously a similar bimodal distribution of adhesion values, characterized however by a high variability. Thus, we suggested to present the aggregated values in the manuscript as box plots (see figure 1 Gand H) to illustrate both this bimodality of the distribution and the variability of the adhesion force and stiffness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A last important issue is that the structure of the abstract and in fact the whole manuscript is perhaps not optimal. The authors convey and mix too many different messages, and the summary and main text would benefit from simplification and a better separation of the different questions that are addressed. In addition, the authors are also encouraged to better discuss their findings against the background of previous literature, explicitly pointing out where their findings confirm previous observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extensively revised our paper to focus on the importance and role of amyloid sequences in the function of Flo11 in yeast and in particular, our data show that amyloid sequences are needed for cis-interaction leading to clusters of Flo11p making nanodomain. Also they may contribute to trans-interaction since ablation of these sequences strongly reduce cell-cell interaction, or alternatively, insertion of the RR2 domain from Flo11 of L69 strain that is enriched in amyloid core sequences in the Flo11 of BY strain leads to strong cell-cell aggregation, what barely occurred in the BY strain expressing its normal Flo11p. We thus suggested this new title to &quot;The dual role of the amyloid core sequences in the physiological function of FLO11-encoded flocculin in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript would benefit from discussion of relevant data and models in 3 recent papers:</p><p>Ho et al., 2019.

They are in fact extremely relevant for our paper because they consolidate our experimental data suggesting that the amyloid core sequences are needed for nanoclustering of Flo11 molecules by cis-interaction, but also can contribute to cell-cell adhesion by trans-interaction or, alternatively, that this homophilic adhesion which is dependent on the A-domain of Flo11p according to the work of Kraushaar et al., (Structure, 2015) may require amyloid-β sheet interaction sequence to be the most effective. This suggestion is based on our data that cell-cell aggregation are strongly diminished in a strain expressing a Flo11 variant lacking amyloid core sequences, whereas this phenotype is remarkably exacerbated in BY cells either upon expression of the FLO11 of L69 strain or insertion of additional amyloid-core sequences in its endogenous FLO11.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments.</p><p>l.40: The wall integrity statement is not supported by the data: the data shows that expression of Flo11 contributes to resistance to wall-perturbing drugs.

We have revised the Introduction (see ie lines 78 to 90 in the revised version), taking into account some of the data related to Flo11 and data in these paper are more extensively considered in the Discussion section (and most of them have been mentioned in the initial submission) with regards to our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 4: In the description of the protein architecture the function of the A-domain as an adhesin is now missing and should be described in detail, since it is the A-domain that contains the Flo11 domain (see Pfam database: PF10182 or the interpro database). The Flo11p domain is now generally accepted as the domain of the Flo11 protein that is responsible for the cell-cell interaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided some additional description related to A-domain in the revised manuscript (see line 68 to 84), but as written above, discussed these important data in regards to our data (see line 484 -514).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nanodomains were observed using AFM and a bare tip. Some details on how the measurements were performed are missing from the Materials and Methods section, such as which cantilever(s) of the MLCT were used, in which buffer (or growth medium) (what was the pH?) were the experiments performed. Were the cantilevers plasma or O3 cleaned?</p></disp-quote><p>All these technical details are given in the Mand M, except that we did not specify that plasma with air was used to clean the cantilever before the experiment which has now been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A question that arises when looking at the adhesion maps and adhesion force determination is which type of interaction is present here? Is it an electrostatic or hydrophobic/hydrophilic interaction? Plasma/O3 cleaning can change the hydrophilicity of the cantilever and the adhesion strength. It would be interesting to better characterize the type of interaction since now there is no control. As an additional measurement, the cantilever could be coated with compounds that make the surface hydrophobic or positive or negative charged.</p><p>Additionally, since the type of interaction is not well characterized (as well as the conditions), it is not clear now with which part of the Flo11p (and/or the glycans (Meem 7 Cullen, 2012); since yeast glycans contain (charged) phosphates that can interact (Goossens KV, Ielasi FS, Nookaew I, Stals I, Alonso-Sarduy L, Daenen L, Van Mulders SE, Stassen C, van Eijsden RG, Siewers V, Delvaux FR, Kasas S, Nielsen J, Devreese B, Willaert RG. Molecular mechanism of flocculation self-recognition in yeast and its role in mating and survival. mBio. 2015 Apr 14;6(2):e00427-15). For example, Kraushaar et al., (Structure. 2015 Jun 2;23(6):1005-17) showed that the Flo11 domain trans-interact via a hydrophobic interaction due to the presence of 2 aromatic bands in the structure. They also discovered that this interaction only occurs at low pH (5.5) and not at higher pH (6.8)).</p><p>These aspects will influence the results on the measured adhesion forces. A bimodal distribution of the adhesion forces were observed. The weaker adhesion forces were attributed to surface proteins that unfold upon retraction of the AFM tip (p. 6, line 137; p. 7, line 160). Are these surface proteins the Flo11 proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not fully understand your comment and do not see if there is a question behind. What can be commented on our side are:</p><p>A – AFM techniques used is all what is the more common.</p><p>B – The adhesion forces (what you mention as interaction) have been analysed in detail for each strain expressing the different variant. Only nanodomains from L69 strain expressing the wild type Flo11 exhibits a bimodal distribution of adhesion forces.</p><p>C – The weaker adhesion force is likely due to protein being unfolded, which can be Flo11 but not exclusively indeed as we used a bare tip that interacts with cell surface component in general, not specifically. This can be seen in Figure 3 in which this low-adhesion forces was still observed but a lower frequency upon treatment of the cells with the anti-amyloid peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no direct evidence from the results that these nanodomains are composed of Flo11p. This could be obtained by adhesion maps using an anti-Flo11p antibody or with the purified Flo11p, or Flo11p on other cells by performing single cell force-spectroscopy (Brückner et al., eLife. 2020 Apr 14;9:e55587).</p></disp-quote><p>The evidence that the nanodomains are composed of Flo11p are:</p><p>A – deletion of FLO11 in strain L69 completely abrogates the formation of adhesive nanodomains upon AFM tip.</p><p>B – the laboratory BY strain that does not form nanodomains with its own FLO11 gene even after overexpression, but only upon ectopic expression of this peculiar Flo11p from strain L69.</p><p>C – nanodomains are not produced in cells that express a Flo11 lacking its amyloid-core –sequence.</p><p>D – the finding that purified Flo11p forms amyloids in vitro has been already reported by Lipke group (Ramsook, EC, 2010).

These nanodomains displayed adhesion forces that were scattered from a few pN to max 200 pN and stiffness that was roughly 30% higher than that of nanodomains from L69 strain (see Figure S9, in supplementary data).&quot;</p><p>– How could these results be explained? When the C-terminal part of the protein has been removed, is it still anchored in the cell wall? Is there proof of this? Suppose that the truncated Flo11p is present: Does the bare AFM tip interact specifically with the remainder of Flo11p and does cis-interaction results again in these nanodomains? Why are these nanodomains then larger?</p><p>The force-distance curves shown in Figure S.9 G, indicate 2 slopes indicating that first a softer layer is pushed through. Not clear what this could be?</p></disp-quote><p>As reported, we carried out immunofluorescence assay with all the Flo11 variants and reported in a new figure (Figure 4) that they have the same localization as the wild type (so clearly marked at the cell periphery), indicating that the loss of C-ter does not prevent anchorage of Flo11 at the cell wall. How this protein could be retained would need additional work that is out of the scope of this study.</p><p>We then performed AFM analysis on cells expressing these Flo11 variants and with the exception of Flo11-RR2, they all showed nanodomains formation with however a very different typology and a loss of bimodal behaviour. There is no reason that the tip does not interact with the reminder of the Flo11 protein, but we cannot exclude that the expression of this truncated form of Flo11p has somehow altered the cell surface, leading to this adhesion histogram. However, these data indicated that the high adhesion forces that result from amyloid-dependent clustering of Flo11p are no longer present. We have carefully revised our paper to take into account this remark (see now lines 266 -282 in the revised version).</p><p>Finally, the force-distance curves shown in Figure 9G is an example for the specific cell of this figure. It shows 2 slopes, but the stiffness has been calculated on the first one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 12, line 293: …&quot;This residual clumping is likely a specific feature from Σ1278b background strain, which does not hamper the notion that Flo11p is critical in cell-cell interaction. This is further supported by the lack of aggregates in BY4741 as this strain does not express FLO11 due to non-sense mutation in FLO8 encoding its major transcriptional activator.</p><p>– Not clear what is meant with a &quot;specific&quot; feature? How could this remaining interaction be explained? Remark that Brückner et al., (2020) demonstrated quantitatively using single-cell force spectroscopy that the Flo11p A-domain is needed to have a significant cell-cell interaction (although some variation is present in these single-cell experiments).</p><p>– Were these aggregation experiments also performed at a lower pH and could the results of Kraushaar et al., (2015) be confirmed?</p></disp-quote><p>The ∑1278 haploid strain exhibits a very different aggregation phenotype with respect to L29 strain, as deletion of FLO11 did not completely abolish this phenotype as reported in Figure 6 (now 7 in the revised version). Whether the remaining aggregation is due to the expression of another FLO gene is unlikely since Flo11p is the only flocculin expressed in this strain. As FLO gene is under silencing, it cannot be excluded that deletion of FLO11 has allowed desilencing of some FLO through epigenetic mechanism as (reported by Halme et al., Cell, 116, 405-415, 2004). This is only a speculation because we did not verify this suggestion. We revised this paragraph accordingly (see lines 302-312).</p><p>Our experiments of cell-cell interaction in YNGal agar was made at pH 5.0 which is a condition reported by Kraushaar et al., to favour hemophilic Flo11-Flo11 interaction. Our results are in part in support the finding of Kraushaar et al., although we did not show it directly. Although our data show that amyloid-core sequence contribute to cell-cell interaction (see figure 6), they are not absolutely essential for this phenotype as shown with the lack of effect of the anti-amyloid agents thioflavin S to be unable to disrupt aggregates formed with cells from ∑1278b strain. This data indirectly indicates that other components are implied in this phenotype, which is likely due to the A-domain (revised in lines 312 -315).</p><p>Finally, we tested the adherence at different pH and confirmed that this phenotype was sensitive to pH (hence higher at acidic than alkali pH, see figure 7). But surprisingly, we found that this pH effect was not similar between yeast strains. While strains ∑1278C showed better adherence at pH 8.0 than pH 5.0, this was the opposite for L69 strain and BY4741!. This difference would need additional experiments that is not in the scope of this work.</p><p>In our hands, the contribution of the N-terminal domain was more important at pH 8.0 than pH 5.0 for the Flo11p of L29 strain, whereas the amyloid core sequence has no role. However, what was striking was the finding that the adherence to plastic in quantitative term was dramatically increases upon overexpression of FLO11 gene whatsoever the origin of the gene (either FLO11 from BY or from L69). This result somehow alerted us because in the experiments carried out by Kraushaar et al., (Structure, 2016), FLO11 is expressed in CEN plasmid under the dependence of the strong PGK1 promoter. Thus, it may be possible that under these conditions, the effect of removal A-domain was quantitatively more effective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It has been shown recently that the BY4741 strain can flocculate depending on the condition and this flocculation was independent of Flo5p (see Degreif D, de Rond T, Bertl A, Keasling JD, Budin I.

In many conditions, Flo1p and Flo11p are be coexpressed. Remark that the expression of FLO11 is very complex and control has been attributed to many transcription factors (Brückner S, Mösch HU.

Although this regulation was examined in ∑1272b strain, it might be also valuable in BY strain.

This model needs further experimental confirmation to be generally accepted.</p></disp-quote><p>Recent data from Lipke et coll (see Ho et al., mBIO. mBio. 2019 Oct 8;10(5):e01766-19. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01766-19; Dehullu et al., 2019, Nano Lett. 2019 Jun 12;19(6):3846-3853. doi: 10.1021/acs.nanolett.9b01010) have now clearly demonstrated that amyloid-forming sequences are required for cis-interaction (interaction between adhesion molecule) leading to cluster of adhesion molecule and to trans-interaction, ie interaction cell to cell. Although this demonstration was done with ALS1 and ALS5 encoding Als adhesion of C. albicans, our data are in line with this statement. Indeed, we show that the nanodomains at the cell surface of L69 strain are due to the presence of several amyloid forming sequences present in this particular Flo11p, and this leads to cis-interaction which can be abolished using either the anti-amyloid peptide or an amyloid perturbant, and likely to trans-interaction because loss of RR2 domain that contains these amyloid sequences results in a strong reduction of cell-cell interaction (or cell-cell aggregation).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It could be that the observed nanodomains correspond to trans-interacting Flo11 proteins. However, the cell-cell interaction would be significantly reduced if the Flo11p domains are not present in the truncated protein. This is however in contrast to what has been observed by the authors in this manuscript. Therefore, it is not clear how this can be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>This is not what we show in Figure 6 and 7 since the loss of RR2 that contains the amyloid forming sequences results in &gt; 70% reduction of cell-cell interaction, whereas insertion of this fragment in the Flo11 from BY strain allows cells of this strain to form aggregate at a rate that higher than by ectopic overexpression of its endogenous FLO11 (see figure 6).</p></body></sub-article></article>
