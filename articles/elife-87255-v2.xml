kinase 2 (LRRK2) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. While it has been recently shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis including lysosomal damage can increase LRRK2 activity and localization to lysosomes, the molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined. We performed a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes, we demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. Together, these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate(s) at the lysosome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Lysosomes are cellular compartments tasked with breaking down large molecules such as lipids or proteins. They perform an essential role in helping cells dispose of obsolete or harmful components; in fact, defects in lysosome function are associated with a range of health conditions. For instance, many genes associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson’s disease code for proteins required for lysosomes to work properly, such as the kinase LRRK2.</p><p>Previous work has shown that this enzyme gets recruited to the surface of damaged lysosomes, where it can modulate the function of another set of molecular actors by modifying them through a chemical process known as phosphorylation. Such activity is increased in harmful versions of LRRK2 linked to Parkinson’s disease. However, the molecular mechanisms which control LRRK2 activity or its recruitment to lysosomes remain unclear.</p><p>To examine this question, Wang, Bondar et al. first performed a targeted screen to identify proteins that can regulate LRRK2 activity. This revealed that Rab12, one of molecular actors that LRRK2 phosphorylates, can in turn modulate the activity of the enzyme. Further imaging and biochemical experiments then showed that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes and that this step was in fact necessary for LRRK2 to also relocate to these compartments. The data suggest that this Rab12-driven recruitment process increases the local concentration of LRRK2 near its Rab targets on the membrane of damaged lysosomes, and therefore leads to enhanced LRRK2 activity. Crucially, Wang, Bondar et al. showed that Rab12 also plays a role in the increased LRRK2 activity observed with two Parkinson’s disease-linked mutations (one in LRRK2 itself and one in another lysosomal regulator, VPS35), suggesting that increased LRRK2 concentration on lysosomes may be a conserved mechanism that leads to increased LRRK2 activity in disease.</p><p>Overall, these results highlight a new, Rab12-dependent mechanism that results in enhanced activity at the lysosomal membrane with variants associated with Parkinson’s disease, and for LRRK2 in general when lysosomes are damaged. This knowledge will be helpful to develop therapeutic strategies that target LRRK2, and to better understand how increased LRRK2 activity and lysosomal injury may be linked to Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LRRK2</kwd><kwd>lysosomal damage</kwd><kwd>Rab12</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Rab12 was identified as a key modulator of LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation that mediates the recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes in response to damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coding variants in <italic>LRRK2</italic> can cause monogenic Parkinson’s disease (PD), and coding and non-coding variants in <italic>LRRK2</italic> are associated with increased risk for developing sporadic PD and Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blauwendraat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hui et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kluss et al., 2019</xref>). The majority of pathogenic LRRK2 variants cluster within its Roc-COR (Ras of complex proteins/C-terminal of Roc) GTPase tandem domain or kinase domain and contribute to disease risk by ultimately increasing LRRK2’s kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alessi and Sammler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kalogeropulou et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sheng et al., 2012</xref>). LRRK2 phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases, including Rab10 and Rab12. Excessive Rab phosphorylation can perturb interactions between Rabs and downstream effectors, which impairs various aspects of membrane trafficking including lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pfeffer, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Steger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Steger et al., 2016</xref>). LRRK2 localizes primarily to the cytosol in an inactive state, and higher-order oligomerization and membrane recruitment appear to be required for LRRK2 activation and Rab phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biskup et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greggio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schapansky et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work suggests that interactions between LRRK2 and its phosphorylated Rab substrates help maintain LRRK2 on membranes and result in a cooperative, feed-forward mechanism to promote additional Rab phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vides et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is not clear what mechanisms promote the initial recruitment of LRRK2 to membranes to trigger Rab phosphorylation or whether increased LRRK2 membrane association is a common driver of the elevated LRRK2 activity observed in PD.</p><p>Endolysosomal genes that modify PD risk and lysosomal damage can also increase LRRK2 activation and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbst et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>). Rab29 and the retromer subunit VPS35, proteins that are genetically associated with PD and play key roles in lysosomal function by regulating sorting between the endolysosomal system and the trans-Golgi network, can modulate LRRK2 activity, as overexpression of Rab29 or expression of the pathogenic VPS35 D620N variant lead to significantly elevated LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and other Rab substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>). LRRK2 kinase activity also appears to be increased in nonhereditary idiopathic PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Maio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fraser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), and emerging data suggest that lysosomal damage more broadly may be a common trigger for LRRK2 activation. Lysosomotropic agents that disrupt the endolysosomal pH gradient or puncture lysosomal membranes enhance LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes and result in increased Rab10 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbst et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Several hypotheses around the purpose of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes have been proposed, including promotion of lysosomal membrane repair or clearance of lysosomal content through exocytosis or sorting of vesicles away from damaged lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbst et al., 2020</xref>). There is a clear need to better define how LRRK2 is recruited to lysosomes upon damage, how these steps translate to LRRK2 activation, and how broadly conserved these mechanisms are in PD.</p><p>Here, we identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity. Rab12 regulates LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediates LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage. We demonstrate that Rab12 promotes Rab phosphorylation by recruiting LRRK2 to lysosomes following lysosomal membrane rupture. Pathogenic PD variants including VPS35 D620N and LRRK2 R1441G also result in increased levels of LRRK2 and pT73 Rab10 on lysosomes. Together, our data delineate a conserved mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal damage and genetic variants associated with disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>siRNA-based screen identifies Rab12 as a key regulator of LRRK2 kinase activity</title><p>Although a subset of 14 Rab GTPases has been clearly established as LRRK2 substrates, increasing data suggest a reciprocal relationship exists in which Rab proteins may also contribute to LRRK2 membrane association and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vides et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomez et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of one such LRRK2 substrate, Rab29, can increase LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 by promoting its membrane association at the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomez et al., 2019</xref>). However, additional work in RAB29 KO models demonstrated that LRRK2 activity was minimally impacted by loss of Rab29, suggesting Rab29 does not regulate LRRK2 activity under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalogeropulou et al., 2020</xref>). To determine whether any LRRK2-Rab substrates were required for LRRK2 kinase activity, we performed a targeted siRNA screen on 14 Rab genes in human A549 cells that endogenously express both LRRK2 and Rab10. Rab10 phosphorylation was chosen as the endpoint to assess LRRK2 activation as it is an established readout of LRRK2 kinase activity that has been routinely used in preclinical and clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jennings et al., 2022</xref>). The levels of Rab10 phosphorylation were measured using a previously described quantitative Meso Scale Discovery (MSD)-based assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Greater than 50% knockdown of gene expression of each target was demonstrated using RT-qPCR-based analysis, and we confirmed that knockdown of the positive controls LRRK2 and RAB10 attenuated the phospho-Rab10 signal as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). RAB12 was the only hit gene whose knockdown significantly reduced Rab10 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We confirmed that RAB12 knockdown reduced gene expression and led to a reduction in Rab12 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). RAB12 knockdown did not impact the levels of LRRK2 or Rab10, suggesting that Rab12 mediates Rab10 phosphorylation by regulating LRRK2’s activity rather than the stability of LRRK2 or Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, D, and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also confirmed previous observations that Rab29 does not regulate LRRK2 activity under endogenous expression conditions as RAB29 knockdown or genetic deletion did not impact Rab10 phosphorylation in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

LLOMe treatment significantly increased colocalization between pT73 Rab10 and LAMP1 in WT cells but had no effect in RAB12 KO cells, confirming that Rab12 is required for Rab10 phosphorylation on lysosomes in response to membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Rab12 increases Rab10 phosphorylation by facilitating LRRK2 recruitment to lysosomes</title><p>We hypothesized that lysosomal membrane permeabilization may increase Rab12 recruitment to damaged lysosomes and that increased Rab12 levels on lysosomes may facilitate the lysosomal association of LRRK2 upon damage. Consistent with this idea, treatment with LLOMe significantly increased the levels of Rab12 on lysosomes assessed by western blot analysis from isolated lysosomes and by confocal imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further imaging analysis revealed that LLOMe treatment significantly increased the colocalization of Rab12 with the lysosomal marker LAMP1, but not with the Golgi marker GM130, as quantified by Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC), and this colocalization was preserved upon nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Rab12 recruitment to damaged lysosomes was not impacted by LRRK2 deletion as Rab12 levels were similarly increased on lysosomes from WT and LRRK2 KO cells following lysosomal membrane permeabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data demonstrate that lysosomal membrane damage increases Rab12 localization to lysosomes and that this occurs in an LRRK2-independent manner, supporting the idea that Rab12 is an upstream regulator of LRRK2’s lysosomal localization and activity. Western blot analysis of isolated lysosomes showed that approximately 1% of total Rab12 was present on lysosomes at baseline and that this increased to approximately 1.5% following LLOMe treatment, while our imaging-based analysis revealed that approximately 12% of overexpressed Rab12 was present on lysosomes at baseline and increased to approximately 14% upon LLOMe treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that a small percentage of Rab12 and LRRK2 are present on lysosomes at baseline and that lysosomal damage leads to a significant increase in the localization of both proteins to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), but precise quantification of the amount of Rab12 and LRRK2 on lysosomes under these conditions is difficult and warrants further study.</p><p>To gain additional insight around the dynamics of Rab12 and LRRK2 recruitment following lysosomal membrane permeabilization, we performed live-cell imaging of HEK293T cells overexpressing mCherry-tagged Rab12 and eGFP-tagged LRRK2 and assessed Rab12 and LRRK2 localization over time. Rab12 and LRRK2 showed a diffuse localization under baseline conditions, while LLOMe treatment increased the recruitment of Rab12 and LRRK2 to vesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Rab12 colocalization with LRRK2 increased over time following LLOMe treatment, supporting potential coordinated recruitment of these proteins to lysosomes upon damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Lysosomes were isolated from WT and RAB12 KO cells, and the endogenous levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes were quantified by western blot analysis. Lysosomal levels of LRRK2 were increased by approximately 2.5-fold following treatment with LLOMe in WT cells, and loss of Rab12 abrogated this LLOMe-induced increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

We next examined whether two PD-linked genetic variants associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, also had increased levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes. Lysosomes were isolated from WT, LRRK2 R1441G KI, and VPS35 D620N KI A549 cells at baseline and following LLOMe treatment, and the levels of total and phospho-Rab10 and LRRK2 were subsequently assessed by western blot analysis. Expression of LRRK2 R1441G or VPS35 D620N led to an increase in Rab10 phosphorylation on isolated lysosomes at baseline, and the phosphorylation of Rab10 on lysosomes was further increased following LLOMe treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). The levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes were significantly increased in untreated LRRK2 R1441G KI cells and VPS35 D620N KI cells, suggesting that enhanced localization of LRRK2 to lysosomes and proximity to its Rab substrates may contribute to the elevated Rab10 phosphorylation observed on lysosomes at baseline in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Rab10 phosphorylation was increased on lysosomes in response to LLOMe treatment while the levels of LRRK2 were not significantly impacted on lysosomes isolated from LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N KI cells, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond LRRK2 localization may also contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage in these cells. Together, these results suggest that Rab12 regulates LRRK2 localization to lysosomes upon damage and that this may be a conserved mechanism also employed to contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to PD-linked variants.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Increased LRRK2 kinase activity is observed with pathogenic PD-linked variants and in sporadic PD patients, but many questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which LRRK2 activation is regulated basally and in response to endolysosomal stress associated with disease. We identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activation and demonstrate that Rab12 plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. A recent CRISPR-based genome-wide screen for modifiers of Rab10 phosphorylation also identified RAB12 as a top hit, providing additional validation that Rab12 is a key regulator of LRRK2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dhekne et al., 2023</xref>). Our data show that lysosomal membrane rupture promotes Rab12 localization to lysosomes. We propose a model in which Rab12 recruits LRRK2 to the lysosome and enhances its activity on lysosomal membranes by increasing LRRK2’s local concentration near Rab10 and potentially other Rab substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Previous studies suggested that another LRRK2 substrate, Rab29, can regulate LRRK2’s kinase activity and showed that exogenously expressed Rab29 is capable of activating LRRK2 at the trans-Golgi or at additional membranes when artificially anchored there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gomez et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies relied on overexpression of Rab29 to increase LRRK2 activity, and analyses of RAB29 KO cellular models or mice showed that RAB29 deletion minimally impacted LRRK2-dependent Rab10 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kalogeropulou et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we used endogenous expression conditions to demonstrate that Rab12, but not Rab29, regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and that Rab12 regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The PD-linked pathogenic LRRK2 variant R1441G, which lies outside of LRRK2’s kinase domain, and the VPS35 D620N variant have been shown in previous studies and confirmed here to increase LRRK2 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Purlyte et al., 2018</xref>). Our results suggest that these variants may also promote LRRK2 activation by increasing Rab12-mediated LRRK2 localization to lysosomes, implying this may represent a general mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is increased by various genetic variants and environmental stressors associated with PD. We cannot rule out the possibility that additional mechanisms beyond increased proximity between LRRK2 and its Rab substrates may contribute to Rab10 phosphorylation following lysosomal damage, as the magnitude of change in Rab10 phosphorylation induced by LLOMe treatment was greater than the extent of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes. Additional studies are warranted to determine how lysosomal membrane rupture triggers Rab12 recruitment, to identify other regulatory processes that may contribute to Rab phosphorylation upon lysosomal damage, and to better define how broadly such mechanisms are employed to drive LRRK2 activation in PD. As our work focused on the role of Rab12 in A549 cells, it will also be important to understand whether Rab12 similarly regulates LRRK2 activation and localization to damaged lysosomes in other cell types.</p><p>Our findings provide key insight into the mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is increased in response to lysosomal damage by demonstrating that Rab12 regulates LRRK2 localization to ruptured lysosomes. While the purpose of LRRK2 recruitment and activation on lysosomes is poorly defined, several hypotheses have been proposed suggesting that LRRK2 activity may be upregulated as a compensatory response to restore lysosomal homeostasis following damage. Previous work supports a model in which LRRK2 activity controls the decision to repair minor damage to lysosomal membranes through an ESCRT-mediated process or to target damaged lysosomes for degradation via lysophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbst et al., 2020</xref>). Additional studies suggested that LRRK2 hyperactivation triggers mechanisms aimed at clearing cargo from damaged lysosomes that have lost their proteolytic capacity, either through direct exocytosis of lysosomes or through a novel sorting process termed LYTL (lysosomal tubulation/sorting driven by LRRK2) in which tubules bud off from lysosomes following membrane rupture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonet-Ponce et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eguchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kluss et al., 2022</xref>). LRRK2 activation in the face of minor or acute lysosomal insults likely plays a beneficial role in maintaining lysosomal function, while chronic LRRK2 activation triggered by genetic variants with increased kinase activity or low-level lysosomal damage over time may ultimately impair the ability to effectively respond to membrane stress and maintain the balance between lysosomal repair and destruction. Macrophages from PD patients carrying pathogenic LRRK2 variants were shown to accumulate more damaged lysosomes compared to samples from healthy controls, suggesting that mechanisms that respond to and repair lysosomal membrane rupture may be perturbed in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herbst et al., 2020</xref>). A deeper understanding of the mechanisms by which LRRK2 responds to lysosomal damage and how these contribute to PD pathogenesis is critical in guiding new potential therapeutic strategies targeting LRRK2 for the treatment of PD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Cell pellets were resuspended in KPBS + buffer (KPBS supplemented with 3.6% [wt/vol] iodixanol [OptiPrep; Sigma-Aldrich], cOmplete protease inhibitor [Roche], and PhosStop phosphatase inhibitor [Roche]), and cells were fractionated by passing the suspension through a 21 G needle five times followed by centrifugation at 800 × <italic>g</italic> for 10 min. Post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) was harvested and incubated with anti-HA magnetic beads (pre-blocked with BSA and washed with KPBS buffer; Thermo Fisher) for 15 min with end-over-end rotation. Lysosome-bound beads were washed three times with KPBS + buffer, and samples used for immunoblotting were eluted from beads by heating to 95°C for 10 min in 1× NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer (Thermo Fisher).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of total and pRab10 and total and pRab12 levels on isolated lysosomes from WT, RAB12 KO, and PD-linked variant KI A549 cell models</title><p>For analysis of pRab10 levels on isolated lysosomes, one confluent 15 cm plate of cells was used per experimental condition. Cells were treated with 1 mM LLOMe (or vehicle) for 2 hr at 37°C prior to isolation of lysosomes via anti-HA immunoprecipitation as described above. Lyso-IP were performed with 60 µL of anti-HA magnetic bead slurry per condition. Immunoblotting for pRab10 and pRab12 levels was performed in parallel with analysis of total Rab10 and Rab12 levels, as detailed above, using 20% of total immunoprecipitated material per condition. pT73 Rab10, pS106 Rab12, total Rab10, total Rab12, and HA band intensities were quantified from immunoblots using ImageStudio Lite software (LI-COR), and the phospho- and total Rab band intensities were normalized to HA band intensity within each experimental condition. Data were normalized to the median value within each replicate and was then normalized to the mean value of vehicle-treated WT samples across replicates. Calculations for the total fraction of Rab12 present on immunoprecipitated lysosomes were performed by extrapolating the quantitated western blot signal of both the IP and PNS fractions out to 100%, and then calculating the percent of total estimated Rab12 signal captured in the IP divided by the total estimated Rab12 signal present in the PNS sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of LRRK2 levels on isolated lysosomes from A549 cell models</title><p>For analysis of LRRK2 levels on isolated lysosomes, three confluent 15 cm plates of cells (seeded 24 hr prior to the assay start) were used per experimental condition. Cells were treated with 1 mM LLOMe (or vehicle) for 4 hr at 37°C and then lysosomes were isolated via anti-HA immunoprecipitation as described above. Lyso-IP were performed with 150 µL of anti-HA magnetic bead slurry per condition. For immunoblot detection of endogenous LRRK2, 25% of the total immunoprecipitated material (per condition) was loaded onto a 3–8% Tris-Acetate gel (Thermo Fisher), fully resolved gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, probed overnight at 4°C with a 1/500 dilution of mouse anti-LRRK2 (clone N241A/34; UC Davis/NIH NeuroMab Facility, Davis, CA, USA), and imaged using standard immunoblotting protocol detailed above. LRRK2 and HA band intensity was quantified from immunoblots using ImageStudio Lite software (LI-COR), LRRK2 intensity was normalized to HA band intensity within each experimental condition, data was normalized to the median value within each replicate, and then was normalized to the mean value of vehicle-treated WT samples across replicates. Calculations for the total fraction of LRRK2 present on immunoprecipitated lysosomes were performed as for Rab12 (see above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Immunostaining of pT73 Rab10, Rab10, HA, and LAMP1 and image analysis</title><p>WT, RAB12 KO, and LRRK2 KO A549 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Revvity, Waltham, MA, USA, Phenoplate, #6055302), and then treated with vehicle or LLOMe (1 mM). After 2 hr, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min, permeabilized and blocked with blocking buffer (5% Normal Donkey Serum/0.05% Triton X-100/PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C. pT73 Rab10 antibody (Abcam, ab241060, 1:100), Rab10 antibody (CST, 8127, 1:100), LAMP1 antibody (Abcam, ab25630, 1:100), and HA antibody (CST, 3724, 1:100) were used in the study. After three washes with PBS/0.05% Triton X-100, secondary fluorescently labeled antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. DAPI (1:1000) and cell mask deep red (1:5000, Thermo Fisher, C10046) were diluted in PBS/0.05% Triton X-100 and incubated for 10 min. After three washes with PBS/0.05% Triton X-100, the cell plates were imaged on an automated confocal high-content imaging system (Revvity, Opera Phenix Plus High-Content Screening System) using a 63× water immersion objective lens with excitation lasers (405 nm, 488 nm, 561 nm, 640 nm) and preset emission filters. Channels were separated to avoid fluorescence crosstalk. A custom analysis was developed in the Harmony 4.9 image analysis software (Revvity) to enable image analysis. For analysis of puncta intensity, pT73 Rab10 or total Rab10 spots were defined using ‘Finding Spots’ building blocks, and the sum of corrected spot intensity per cell was used to measure puncta signals. The colocalization between pT73 Rab10 or TMEM192-HA puncta and LAMP1-positive lysosomes were measured with object-based analysis. Briefly, pT73 Rab10 or TMEM192-HA and LAMP1 spots were independently defined using separate ‘Find Spots’ building blocks. Colocalized pT73 Rab10 and LAMP1 spots or TMEM192-HA and LAMP1 spots were identified using the geometric center overlap method within the ‘Select Population’ tool. The average number of colocalized spots were calculated per cell from 16 fields per well (for pT73 Rab10 and LAMP1 analysis) or 20 fields per well (for HA and LAMP1 analysis) and averaged across the well.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Image analysis of the localization of Rab12 and LRRK2 to lysosomes and Golgi</title><p>For the colocalization analysis of Rab12 and organelle markers, HEK293T cells were transfected with mCherry-Rab12 plasmid (pcDNA3.1 vector) using Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent (Thermo Fisher #15338100), and cells were plated onto poly-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Revvity, Waltham, MA, USA, Phenoplate, #6055302). Two days after transfection, cells were treated with vehicle or LLOMe (1 mM), with or without nocodazole (25 μΜ). After 2 hr, cells were fixed and immunostained with a LAMP1 antibody (Abcam, ab25630, 1:100) or GM130 antibody (Abcam ab52649). Cell plates were imaged on an automated confocal high-content imaging system (Revvity, Opera Phenix Plus High-Content Screening System) using a 40× water immersion objective lens. For the colocalization analysis of LRRK2 and organelle markers, HEK293T cells stably expressing eGFP-LRRK2 were used. For the colocalization analysis of LRRK2 and Rab12, HEK293T cells stably expressing eGFP-LRRK2 were transfected with mCherry-Rab12 plasmid. After LLOMe and nocodazole treatment, cell plates were imaged using a 63× water immersion objective lens.</p><p>For image analysis, we used PCC to assess the colocalization between various pairs of fluorophores: (1) mCherry-Rab12 and 488 LAMP1-positive lysosomes, (2) mCherry-Rab12 and 647 GM130-positive Golgi, (3) eGFP-LRRK2 and 568 LAMP1-positive lysosomes, (4) eGFP-LRRK2 and 647 GM130-positive Golgi, and (5) mCherry-Rab12 and eGFP-LRRK2, as the PCC is a commonly used intensity-based measurement to quantify colocalization between two fluorophores. A custom analysis algorithm built in the Harmony image analysis software (versions 5.1 and 4.9, Revvity) was used to calculate PCC. For Rab12 or LRRK2 singly expressing cells, individual nuclei were identified with DAPI and cell boundaries were defined using either the mCherry or GFP fluorescent channel, respectively. Rab12-positive and LRRK2-positive cells were selected after thresholding for extremely low or high intensities. Lysosomes and Golgi were independently segmented using the ‘Find Spots’ building block in Harmony, and PCC for either Rab12 or LRRK2 was calculated on a per-cell basis within these two compartments. The average PCC score was calculated from ~30 fields per well across three independent biological replicates.</p><p>For Rab12-LRRK2 colocalization, the number of Rab12-LRRK2 co-expressing cells was much lower than their single-expressing counterparts. Therefore, additional steps were taken to manually identify cells that expressed both mCherry-Rab12 and eGFP-LRRK2 at correct levels. mCherry-Rab12 and eGFP-LRRK2 PCC were calculated on a per-cell basis from ~3 wells across three independent biological replicates.</p><p>Calculation of the percentage of Rab12 and LRRK2 in lysosomes was performed using the Harmony image analysis software (versions 5.1 and 4.9, Revvity) to determine the percentage of mCherry-Rab12 intensity in lysosomes compared to the whole cell. From Rab12-positive cells, lysosomes were segmented using the LAMP1 channel. mCherry-Rab12 sum intensity from lysosomes was calculated and divided by the total sum mCherry-Rab12 intensity within the entire cell. Values were calculated on a per-cell basis, averaged across ~30 fields per well, and across three independent biological replicates. A similar image analysis process was adapted for calculating the percentage of LRRK2 within lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Image analysis of Rab12 in WT and LRRK2 KO cells</title><p>WT and LRRK2 KO A549 cells were transfected with mCherry Rab12 plasmid (pcDNA3.1 vector) using Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent (Thermo Fisher #15338100), and cells were plated onto poly-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Revvity, Waltham, MA, USA, Phenoplate, #6055302).

The total mCherry-Rab12 levels present in lysosomes were determined by calculating the mean fluorescence intensity of the 568 nm channel within the LAMP1 area. Values were measured from mCherry-Rab12 expressing cells (n=20 cells per condition, with cellular intensity between 2000 and 5000 fl. units) and averaged across wells (~4–6 wells per condition).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Live-cell imaging of Rab12 and LRRK2 in HEK293T cells</title><p>HEK293T cells were transfected with eGFP-LRRK2 and mCherry-Rab12 plasmids (pcDNA3.1 vectors) using Lipofectamine LTX with Plus Reagent (Thermo Fisher #15338100), and cells were plated onto poly-lysine-coated 96-well plates (Corning Inc, Corning, NY, USA, BioCoat plates, #354640). Two days after transfection, cells were incubated with Hoechst 33342 (1 μg/mL, Thermo Fisher #62249) and CellMask Deep Red Plasma membrane Stain (1:2000, Thermo Fisher C10046) for 10 min. After replacing the cell culture media containing 1 mM LLOMe, the cell plates were immediately started for live-cell imaging on an automated spinning-disk confocal high-content imaging system (Revvity, Opera Phenix) using a 40× water immersion objective lens under 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 37°C condition. The confocal images were taken every 10 min for 90 min in total.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Time lapse cell segmentation analysis</title><p>Fields of view containing cells co-transfected for eGFP-LRRK2 and mCherry-Rab12 were manually selected from the time lapse dataset across three independent experiments. For each field, channel, and timepoint, the z-stack was converted to a 2D image by maximum intensity projection, then the background intensity was estimated by smoothing the image with a Gaussian filter with a kernel standard deviation of 50 pixels (~14.8 μm) using the ndimage module in scipy v1.9.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Virtanen et al., 2020</xref>). The background was subtracted from the original image and all pixels below the background intensity were set to zero. Background subtracted images were loaded into napari v0.4.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sofroniew et al., 2022</xref>) as 2D+time images for segmentation.</p><p>To better visualize cells co-expressing low levels of LRRK2 and Rab12, the contrast limits were set to between 0 and 125 AU for LRRK2 and between 0 and 600 AU for Rab12. Cells were included in the segmentation if they (1) appeared morphologically healthy, (2) were visible throughout the time series, and (3) co-expressed LRRK2 and Rab12 at levels above background, but below the maximum contrast limit. Cells were segmented using the brush tool in napari using a brush size of 10 pixels (~3.0 μm). Cells were painted to the edge of the cell border including the nucleus but excluding signal from cell debris and other extracellular sources. Tracking cells across frames was typically possible through a combination of proximity and morphology, but where the assignment was ambiguous, those cells were excluded from further analysis (n=2). The resulting dataset contained 55 segmented cells.</p><p>For each cell, the non-background subtracted LRRK2 and Rab12 signals were extracted and normalized to between 0.0 and 1.0 by subtracting 200 AU and then dividing by 800 AU. Values above 1.0 or below 0.0 were set to 1.0 or 0.0, respectively. For all pixels under the cell mask, the PCC I was calculated between the normalized LRRK2 and Rab12 signals using the pearsonr function in the scipy.stats module. Cell properties such as area, perimeter, and mean intensity in each channel were extracted for each timepoint using the regionprops function in scikit-image v0.19.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>). Cells were filtered for quality by fitting a least squares line to the mean intensity of both LRRK2 and Rab12 signal for each and excluding any cells where the slopes were negative (n=31 cells excluded), resulting in 24 validated cell traces. Normalized intensity and correlation coefficients were plotted as mean of all 24 traces ± standard error (SEM) using Prism Version 9.5.1 (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are shown as mean ± SEM, and all statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism 9.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Tone down conclusions throughout as indicated in the reviews.</p><p>2. Verify the LRRK2 dependence of activation of rab10 phosphorylation.</p><p>3. Demonstrate that Rab12 does in fact have a more important role than Rab29.</p><p>4. Clarify the discrepancy in Figure 4 (see comments).</p><p>5. The data do not show lysosomal accumulation of rab12 precedes LRRK2 (point #1 above) and clarify Fig. 3 as described by Reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Fig. 2G. The A549 R1441G cells show lower kinase activity than wild-type cells. Does this clone have less LRRK2? These cells should also be listed under Key Reagents.</p><p>2. Figure 3E would benefit from nocodazole addition to most clearly demonstrate the true co-localization of Rab12 and LRRK2 on lysosomes (rather than concentration in a very crowded perinuclear area).</p><p>3. Line 326. &quot;Rab12 and LRRK2 showed a primarily cytosolic localization [at baseline].&quot; Most Rabs are 50% on membranes or bound to GDI in cytosol. The images shown highlight massive concentration in one part of the cell upon LLOME addition and the faint, small-vesicle bound Rab12 would appear very diffuse without actually being non-membrane associated or &quot;cytosolic&quot;. Perhaps the word &quot;diffuse&quot; would be more precise for the Rab?</p><p>4. In the Lyso-IPs, there seems to be a lot of Rab10 on lysosomes yet by microscopy that is never seen. Perhaps the tag is pulling down some Golgi membranes for biosynthetic trafficking of the HA-tag? It might be worth mentioning that this represents a very small fraction of total Rab10 if that is the case. Also, the LAMP is lost in LLOME samples and this should also be mentioned.</p><p>5. Normally mechanism is required for an <italic>eLife</italic> paper but this is a short report in a competitive area where other complementary stories will bolster this work (Biorxiv doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.17.529028).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the overall role of Rab12 in activating LRRK2 is well supported by the data, there are several areas where the study could be improved.</p><p>1. Although it is likely that the reported relationship between Rab12 and LRRK2 is generalizable to other cell types, this remains to be shown outside of A549 cells. Unapanta et al, bioRxiv, 2022 showed that Rab38 can also play an important role in activating LRRK2 in melanocytes and other cell types might employ other LRRK2 activation mechanisms. Although it is beyond the scope of this study, it will eventually be important to see how Rab12 KO in a mouse model affects LRRK2 activity across a range of tissues (similar to what the Alessi lab did for Rab29).</p><p>2. It is puzzling that even though LLoMe-induced lysosome damage does not increase LRRK2-R1441G abundance at lysosomes (Fig 4D), it still promotes LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK2-R1441G (Fig 4B). This result suggests that something more than recruitment to lysosomes is required for Rab12-dependent LRRK2 activation. At a minimum, some discussion of these results and the potential impacts of LRRK2 activation mechanisms would be helpful. The claim in lines 395-397 that these pathogenic variants are unable to further respond to additional lysosomal stress is undermined by the discrepancy between 4B vs 4D.</p><p>3. Based on data in Figure 4A, it is claimed that lysosome damage causes LRRK2 to accumulate at lysosomes. However, in Figure 4D the same treatment fails to yield a similar increase in LRRK2 levels at lysosomes. These inconsistencies undermine confidence in these results and should be explained.</p><p>4. In multiple figures, treatment with LLoMe results in a decrease in the amount of LAMP1 that is recovered in the TMEM192-HA &quot;lysosome&quot; immunoisolations. This effect was not explained. However, it raises a concern about whether LLoMe is truly triggering LRRK2 recruitment to lysosomes versus the possibility that there is also an effect on TMEM192-HA localization. Is LRRK2 getting recruited to lysosomes? Or is TMEM192-HA moving to a different compartment in the endolysosomal pathway? Some simple experiments that test the colocalization between TMEM192-HA and lysosome proteins +/- LLoMe treatment would help to address this.</p><p>5.

The authors were asked to modify the title. As it stands, the title implies that Rab12 is on lysosomes which it is normally not, and that LRRK2 is only active on lysosomes which is also not true. The title is really important and either needs to indicate that Rab12 promotes localization to DAMAGED lysosomes or be otherwise modified.</p><p>2. LRRK2 still produces pRab10 in Rab12 knockout cells. The authors claim on Page 13 that Rab12 is necessary and sufficient for Rab10 phosphorylation but this is not correct. It is clear that LRRK2 still produces pRab10 in cells lacking Rab12 from blots in 2A and 1D. In Figure 2C, the authors show significant variability in Rab10 levels. This highlights the importance of normalizing phosphoRab10 levels to total Rab10 levels. Please normalize data to total Rab10 and not GAPDH or other protein. This is standard in this field.</p><p>3. The only data on Rab12 being on lysosomes comes from lyso-IPs. In order to understand the magnitude of the process being studied here the authors need to state the fraction of the total Rab12 and total LRRK2 in the LysoIPs of Fig. 3 and 4. This is essential. For example, it is possible that Rab12 increases LRRK2 on lysosomes from 2% of total to 4% of total. The reader needs this information.</p><p>4. The authors were asked to carry out nocodazole experiments to document true lysosome co-localization. 293T cells are poorly adherent and give poor microscopy images with or without LLOME or nocodazole. Why didn't the authors use their A549 cells as in Fig. 3E? Note that a Golgi marker in these cells would have shown complete co-localization with lysosomes in this scenario-this is why nocodazole is so important to separate membrane compartments. The authors need a clear and well controlled experiment showing that the structures they visualize are lysosomes and not Golgi derived vesicles. This circles back to the title of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have responded to all of the concerns raised. It is nice to see that LRRK2 is not required for the localization of rab12 to the lysosome. What is very clear is that LLOMe recruits rab12 to the lysosome, induces phosphorylation of rab10 and rab12 is required for phosphorylation of rab10. However, a discrepancy remains between the recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome by LLOMe, which is not as apparent for wt LRRK2 in Fig. 4D as in 4A, and the phosphorylation of rab10 induced by LLOMe (4B,C). So it seems likely, as the authors have now included in the results, that mechanisms other than lysosomal recruitment of LRRK2 contribute to the phosphorylation of rab10. Importantly, they have also shown that LRRK2 is responsible for the induction by LLOMe (Fig. 2), so I think this is fine, but they should probably include this important consideration in the discussion as well as the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript provides strong evidence that Rab12 can regulate the ability of LRRK2 to phosphorylate Rab10 and that this occurs at least in part by regulating the abundance of LRRK2 at lysosomes. Although key questions about the mechanism remain unanswered, these are still important findings. New data was added to the manuscript that helped to address concerns that were raised during the previous review. Below I have provided some suggestions for clarification to the text that should be addressable without the need for new experiments. However, I also remain concerned about some important results and their interpretation (points 1-).</p><p>1. There is a discrepancy between the strong decrease in LAMP1 levels in the lysosome IP samples in Figure 3A and that is not seen in the LAMP1 immunofluorescence signal in 3C. This should be acknowledged and/or explained in the text.</p><p>2. Lines 272-275 imply that previous studies (references 32 and 33) also saw reductions in LAMP1 levels on purified lysosomes following LLoMe treatment. However, I could not find evidence of this in the papers that were cited.</p><p>3. There is still a discrepancy between Figure 4A-C where LLoMe activates LRRK2 (as measured by phosphor-Rab10) even in the context of VPS35-D620N and LRRK2-R1441G and Figure 4D where LLoMe does not change LRRK2 lysosome abundance in the same cells. The authors touched on this in the response to reviewers but the answer was not definitive. The description and interpretation of these results in the manuscript text is confusing as it is unclear to what extent LRRK2 kinase activity is regulated in response to these stimuli versus LRRK2 localization and proximity to substrates. The data suggests that there might be independent changes to LRRK2 localization and activity. It is not necessary for the authors to solve these puzzles but they should be more clearly presented.</p><p>4. Line 168: The statement that Rab12 is necessary and sufficient is too strong. Some commentary is required to at minimum acknowledge that this study only examined A549 cells and that the extent that the findings are generalizable to other cell types remains unknown.</p><p>5. Figure 3A and D and Figure 4A-D should also show the total cell lysates rather than just the IP results.</p><p>6. Figure 4E and Line 505 over-reach in stating that Rab12 mediates LRRK2 recruitment to lysosomes. Proving this would require evidence that a direct interaction between LRRK2 and Rab12 is necessary for LRRK2 recruitment and activation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87255.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Figure 3E would benefit from nocodazole addition to most clearly demonstrate the true co-localization of Rab12 and LRRK2 on lysosomes (rather than concentration in a very crowded perinuclear area).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we employed nocodazole treatment to assess whether Rab12 and LRRK2 colocalization is maintained when the clustering of late endosomes/lysosomes in the perinuclear region is disrupted by blocking microtubule assembly. Briefly, HEK293 cells overexpressing mCherry-Rab12 and eGFP-LRRK2 were pre-treated with nocodazole (50 uM) for 2.5 hours and then treated with either vehicle or LLOMe (1mM) for 1.5 hours in the continued presence of nocodazole. The distribution of mCherry-Rab12 and eGFP-LRRK2 was then assessed using high-content confocal imaging. Unfortunately, treatment with both LLOMe and nocodazole caused significant cytotoxicity, rendering us unable to quantify the extent of colocalization of Rab12 and LRRK2 with and without nocodazole treatment following lysosomal membrane permeabilization. We were able to observe a few examples of surviving cells in our studies. In these cells, we found that the apparent colocalization of Rab12 and LRRK2 (overlay in white) following LLOMe treatment was maintained with nocodazole treatment (see example images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>; scale bar: 20μm). These data suggest that the significant colocalization between Rab12 and LRRK2 observed in our manuscript is not simply due to increased concentration of vesicular structures near the perinuclear region. Because of the severe toxicity observed in our experiments, we prefer not to include this data in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87255-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In the Lyso-IPs, there seems to be a lot of Rab10 on lysosomes yet by microscopy that is never seen. Perhaps the tag is pulling down some Golgi membranes for biosynthetic trafficking of the HA-tag? It might be worth mentioning that this represents a very small fraction of total Rab10 if that is the case. Also, the LAMP is lost in LLOME samples and this should also be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises valid points regarding the use of Lyso-IP method to isolate lysosomes following membrane damage. While we do observe significant enrichment of lysosomal proteins using the Lyso-IP method, we cannot rule out the possibility that some of the Rab10 detected arises from Golgi components that are also immunoprecipitated from biosynthetic trafficking of TMEM192-3xHA. To address this concern, we employed imaging-based methods to assess the colocalization of phospho-Rab10 with lysosomal markers at baseline and following LLOMe treatment in WT and RAB12 KO cells (Figure 3C). Using this orthogonal approach, we also observed significant colocalization of pT73 Rab10 with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 following LLOMe treatment that is abolished by RAB12 deletion or LRRK2 deletion. These results provide additional confirmation that LRRK2 promotes Rab10 phosphorylation on lysosomes in a Rab12-dependent manner. As suggested by the reviewer, we have added new text (lines 326-328 of the updated manuscript) to address this point: “While Rab10 has been reported to primarily localize to the Golgi and endosomes, our data show that a proportion of Rab10 is localized to lysosomes basally and in response to lysosomal damage(34, 35).</p><p>The reviewer also astutely noted the loss of LAMP1 detected in our isolated lysosomes following LLOMe treatment. This is an effect we have observed across our Lyso-IP experiments. Our data is consistent with previous studies that have also observed a loss of lysosomal transmembrane proteins following LLOMe treatment (Lee et al <italic>Dev Cell</italic> 2020 PMID: 32916093 and Eriksson et al <italic>Cell Death Dis</italic> 2020 PMID: 32409651). Our hypothesis is that the loss of LAMP1 following lysosomal membrane permeabilization may arise from the redistribution of LAMPs to the cytosol in small vesicles and/or targeted degradation via lysophagy, as suggested by the studies highlighted. Whereas LAMP1 levels are robustly reduced following LLOMe treatment, we observed a minimal impact on the levels of exogenously-expressed TMEM192-3xHA in isolated lysosomes (see Figure 3A and D and Figure 4A). As suggested by the reviewer, we have added new text to our updated manuscript that discusses the reduction in LAMP1 observed following LLOMe treatment and potential explanations for this effect (lines 299-304).</p><p>To increase confidence in the use of TMEM192-3xHA to isolate damaged lysosomes, we have also added new data to the updated manuscript assessing the localization of TMEM192-3xHA to lysosomes at baseline and following lysosomal membrane damage via LLOMe.

Although it is likely that the reported relationship between Rab12 and LRRK2 is generalizable to other cell types, this remains to be shown outside of A549 cells. Unapanta et al, bioRxiv, 2022 showed that Rab38 can also play an important role in activating LRRK2 in melanocytes and other cell types might employ other LRRK2 activation mechanisms. Although it is beyond the scope of this study, it will eventually be important to see how Rab12 KO in a mouse model affects LRRK2 activity across a range of tissues (similar to what the Alessi lab did for Rab29).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a great question regarding whether Rab12 regulates LRRK2 activity in additional cell types beyond the A549 cell model used in the present work. In a recent preprint that also identified Rab12 as a key regulator of LRRK2 activation, the authors characterize the impact of loss of Rab12 <italic>in vivo</italic> by analyzing LRRK2-dependent Rab10 phosphorylation across different tissues in <italic>Rab12</italic> KO mice (Dhekne et al bioRxiv 2023 doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.17.529028). The authors observed reductions in phospho-Rab10 levels in <italic>Rab12</italic> KO mouse lung with trends toward reduction in the large intestine and kidney. This study supports the relevance of Rab12 as a regulator of LRRK2 activity beyond the A549 cell model used in the present work. The authors could not assess the role for Rab12 in regulating LRRK2 activity in the brain given challenges in detecting pT73 Rab10 in brain tissue, and additional studies in human iPSC-derived CNS cells are warranted to better assess the consequences of Rab12 deletion in the brain. These additional studies will undoubtedly be a focus of future work by us (and others) but are beyond scope for the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is puzzling that even though LLoMe-induced lysosome damage does not increase LRRK2-R1441G abundance at lysosomes (Fig 4D), it still promotes LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 by LRRK2-R1441G (Fig 4B). This result suggests that something more than recruitment to lysosomes is required for Rab12-dependent LRRK2 activation. At a minimum, some discussion of these results and the potential impacts of LRRK2 activation mechanisms would be helpful. The claim in lines 395-397 that these pathogenic variants are unable to further respond to additional lysosomal stress is undermined by the discrepancy between 4B vs 4D.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point regarding the potential mechanisms by which the LRRK2 R1441G variant leads to increased Rab10 phosphorylation at the lysosome and whether additional factors beyond LRRK2 localization may contribute to this effect. We focused on detecting effects on the localization of endogenously-expressed LRRK2 to avoid any potential artifacts caused by LRRK2 overexpression. Because of this, the amount of LRRK2 detected on isolated lysosomes is low, and technical variability in lysosomal isolations across independent experiments can complicate our ability to quantify smaller effects on LRRK2 levels on lysosomes. To add confidence in the effect of lysosomal damage on LRRK2 levels in LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N cells, we performed two additional, independent replicates. The updated compiled data confirm that both variants have elevated levels of LRRK2 on isolated lysosomes at baseline compared to WT cells and show a non-significant trend of a further increase in LRRK2 levels following LLOMe treatment (updated Figure 4D).</p><p>These data suggest that increased LRRK2 recruitment to lysosomes upon damage may at least, in part, contribute to elevated Rab10 phosphorylation observed in LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N KI cells with LLOMe treatment.

Using our sensitive MSD-based assay to quantify pT73 Rab10 levels under basal conditions, we observed a similar reduction in Rab10 phosphorylation with Rab12 knockdown or deletion as we also observed with LRRK2 knockdown or deletion (Figure 1A, Figure 2A and B) which led us to make this comment. As the reviewer noted, we do observe some residual Rab10 phosphorylation upon Rab12 knockdown/deletion when assessed by western blot analysis (Figure 2A and Figure 1D). This signal is also observed in LRRK2 KO A549 cells, which may be a result of background signal from western blot analysis or may also suggest that a minor proportion of Rab10 phosphorylation may be LRRK2- and Rab12- independent in this cell model as proposed by the reviewer. We appreciate this reviewer’s point and have therefore modified the text to remove any reference to Rab12 being required or sufficient for LRRK2-dependent Rab10 phosphorylation. Specifically, we have changed the subsection heading of the results section on page 13 from “Rab12 is necessary and sufficient for LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10&quot; to “Rab12 deletion attenuates LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10.”</p><p>The reviewer also commented on variability in total Rab10 levels across clones examined in Figure 2C and suggested we normalize pRab10 levels to total Rab10 levels.

Issues with specificity and sensitivity precluded us from using an MSD-based assay against total Rab10, so western blot analysis was used to measure total Rab10 levels. To address the reviewer’s concern, we have now normalized pRab10 levels (quantified using an MSD-based assay) to total Rab10 levels measured using western blot analysis. These new data have been added as a new supplementary figure (Figure 2- figure supplement 1B and G).

To address the reviewer’s question regarding the percentage of total LRRK2 and Rab12 present on isolated lysosomes, we quantified LRRK2, Rab12, and HA band intensity in WT cells from both the IP and PNS (post-nuclear supernatant, the input fraction used for the IP) samples used for Figure 3D and 4A. We then calculated the total amount of each species present in both sample types by extrapolation based on the amount of sample loaded for western blot analysis and determined the total percentage of each species recovered in the IP. This analysis indicates that ~2% of LRRK2 is on lysosomes at baseline, and LLOMe treatment roughly doubles this to ~4% present on lysosomes. Similarly, ~1% of total Rab12 is present on lysosomes at baseline, and LLOMe treatment increased this to ~1.5% present on lysosomes. This analysis has been added as new data to our updated manuscript in Figure 3- figure supplement 2G and is presented on page 22 of the revised manuscript. Our analysis of total HA recovery in the IP samples confirms that less than 100% of the total HA-labeled lysosomes present in the input were captured in all cases – by experimental design to ensure equal capture across conditions– which ultimately suggests that the calculated total LRRK2 and Rab12 levels present on lysosomes are likely underestimates of the true values.</p><p>We had previously included imaging data that showed Rab12 localization to lysosomes basally that was significantly increased upon LLOMe treatment (Figure 3E). As an orthogonal approach to address the reviewer’s question, we quantified the percentage of LRRK2 and Rab12 on lysosomes at baseline and following LLOMe treatment using imaging-based analysis. Specifically, we overexpressed either fluorescently-tagged LRRK2 or Rab12 and quantified the % of LRRK2 or Rab12 on lysosomes by measuring the amount of LRRK2 or Rab12 signal that colocalized with LAMP1 normalized to the total LRRK2 or Rab12 signal per cell. Our imaging-based analysis suggested that ~5% of LRRK2 localized to lysosomes at baseline and that LLOMe significantly increased this to ~6%, and ~12% of Rab12 was observed at lysosomes basally and ~14% following LLOMe treatment. These data have been added as a new figure panel in Figure 3- figure supplement 2H and is presented on page 22 of the revised manuscript. This analysis required overexpression of both LRRK2 and Rab12 which also has its caveats with respect to recapitulating endogenous localization but nonetheless provides a useful complimentary approach.</p><p>We employed two distinct methods to estimate the percentage of LRRK2 and Rab12 on lysosomes basally and following LLOMe treatment. Both methods support our conclusions that a portion of total LRRK2 and Rab12 localize to lysosomes and that lysosomal damage further increases their lysosomal localization. The potential caveats associated with both approaches make it difficult in the end for us to be confident about the precise quantification of both proteins on lysosomes. Nevertheless, we do agree with the reviewer that this data addresses an essential question and have therefore decided to include it with the caveat as stated on lines 733-738:</p><p>“These results also show that a small percentage of Rab12 and LRRK2 are present on lysosomes at baseline and that lysosomal damage leads to a significant increase in the localization of both proteins to the lysosome (Figure 3- figure supplement 2), but precise quantification of the amount of Rab12 and LRRK2 on lysosomes under these conditions is difficult and warrants further study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors were asked to carry out nocodazole experiments to document true lysosome co-localization. 293T cells are poorly adherent and give poor microscopy images with or without LLOME or nocodazole. Why didn't the authors use their A549 cells as in Fig. 3E? Note that a Golgi marker in these cells would have shown complete co-localization with lysosomes in this scenario-this is why nocodazole is so important to separate membrane compartments. The authors need a clear and well controlled experiment showing that the structures they visualize are lysosomes and not Golgi derived vesicles. This circles back to the title of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion to use nocodazole to confirm the colocalization of LRRK2 and Rab12 and to more clearly understand if LRRK2 and Rab12 are recruited to lysosomes rather than the Golgi upon LLOMe treatment. In line with their suggestions, we have conducted new studies and added new figures to the manuscript that we feel have further strengthened the manuscript.</p><p>To examine this, we conducted new studies using overexpression of eGFP-tagged LRRK2 and mCherry-tagged Rab12 to follow the localization of each protein at baseline and following lysosomal damage. We had initially tried to use A549 cells, but it turned out to be very challenging to identify a sufficient number of cells expressing both eGFP-LRRK2 and mCherry-Rab12 due to poor transfection efficiency in A549 cells (especially for eGFP-LRRK2 due to its large size). We therefore used HEK293T cells to address the reviewer’s comment. We further optimized the concentration and duration of nocodazole treatment based on previously-published work (Fasimoye et al PNAS 2023 and Berndsen et al <italic>eLife</italic>, 2019) and found that reducing the nocodazole treatment to 25 uM for 2 hours reduced toxicity and enabled subsequent analysis. We saw that the Golgi marker GM130 showed fragmented and dispersed punctate structures, confirming the effects of nocodazole treatment in this paradigm.</p><p>By performing this new imaging analysis, our data showed that:</p><p>1) LLOMe treatment significantly increased the colocalization of Rab12 with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 but not with the Golgi marker GM130 (as quantified by Pearson’s correlation coefficient). This co-localization was retained upon nocodazole treatment (see new data included in figure 3D and Figure 3-figure supplement 1). These data support our hypothesis that lysosomal damage increases the localization of Rab12 to lysosomes and not Golgi-derived vesicles.</p><p>2) LLOMe treatment also significantly increased the colocalization of LRRK2 with LAMP1 but not with the Golgi marker GM130 (quantified by Pearson’s correlation coefficient). As was observed with Rab12, this co-localization was retained upon nocodazole treatment (see new data in Figure 3G and Figure 3-figure supplement 2). These data add confidence to our conclusions that lysosomal damage increases the localization of LRRK2 to lysosomes.</p><p>3) To add confidence that Rab12 and LRRK2 colocalize following LLOMe treatment, we quantified their colocalization using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. We observed colocalization between Rab12 and LRRK2 following lysosomal damage and saw that this co-localization was preserved upon nocodazole treatment (new figure 3F). These data further support our conclusion that Rab12 and LRRK2 colocalize with one another following LLOMe treatment.</p><p>Overall, these data add confidence that a portion of LRRK2 and Rab12 localize to lysosomes a baseline, LLOMe treatment induces increased localization of both LRRK2 and Rab12 to lysosomes but not to the Golgi, and LRRK2 and Rab12 colocalize following lysosomal damage. We thank the reviewer for their suggestion that has further strengthened our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have responded to all of the concerns raised. It is nice to see that LRRK2 is not required for the localization of rab12 to the lysosome. What is very clear is that LLOMe recruits rab12 to the lysosome, induces phosphorylation of rab10 and rab12 is required for phosphorylation of rab10. However, a discrepancy remains between the recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome by LLOMe, which is not as apparent for wt LRRK2 in Fig. 4D as in 4A, and the phosphorylation of rab10 induced by LLOMe (4B,C). So it seems likely, as the authors have now included in the results, that mechanisms other than lysosomal recruitment of LRRK2 contribute to the phosphorylation of rab10. Importantly, they have also shown that LRRK2 is responsible for the induction by LLOMe (Fig. 2), so I think this is fine, but they should probably include this important consideration in the discussion as well as the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that our previous submission addressed all of the concerns raised by this reviewer and thank them for their suggestions that have substantially improved our manuscript. We agree that additional mechanisms beyond lysosomal recruitment of LRRK2 may contribute to the phosphorylation of Rab10. In addition to the text that was added in the results section around this in our last submission, we have updated the discussion to also include this important consideration as suggested by the reviewer. Specifically, we have added the following text to the Discussion (lines 908-915):</p><p>“We cannot rule out that additional mechanisms beyond increased proximity between LRRK2 and its Rab substrates may contribute to Rab10 phosphorylation following lysosomal damage, as the magnitude of Rab10 phosphorylation induced by LLOMe treatment was greater than the extent of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes. Additional studies are warranted to determine how lysosomal membrane rupture triggers Rab12 recruitment, to identify other regulatory processes that may contribute to Rab phosphorylation upon lysosomal damage, and to better define how broadly such mechanisms are employed to drive LRRK2 activation in PD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revised manuscript provides strong evidence that Rab12 can regulate the ability of LRRK2 to phosphorylate Rab10 and that this occurs at least in part by regulating the abundance of LRRK2 at lysosomes. Although key questions about the mechanism remain unanswered, these are still important findings. New data was added to the manuscript that helped to address concerns that were raised during the previous review. Below I have provided some suggestions for clarification to the text that should be addressable without the need for new experiments. However, I also remain concerned about some important results and their interpretation (points 1-).</p><p>1. There is a discrepancy between the strong decrease in LAMP1 levels in the lysosome IP samples in Figure 3A and that is not seen in the LAMP1 immunofluorescence signal in 3C. This should be acknowledged and/or explained in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer correctly notes that we did not observe a significant decrease in LAMP1 signal assessed via imaging following LLOMe treatment, in contrast to the decrease observed in isolated lysosomes. LLOMe treatment leads to permeabilization of the lysosomal membrane, and these data may suggest that we are immunopurifying fragments of lysosomal membrane from which LAMP1 has been dissociated or perhaps degraded. We observed strong recruitment of Gal3 to isolated lysosomes following lysosomal damage, supporting some membrane integrity and glycocalyx remain after LLOMe treatment. Our imaging-based analysis did not show obvious differences in LAMP1 signal with LLOMe treatment, likely because our fixation and imaging conditions would capture lysosomal membrane fragments and dissociated LAMP1.</p><p>To acknowledge this point, we have added the following text to the results section (lines 287-295):</p><p>“While LLOMe treatment reduced the levels of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) in isolated lysosomes, the levels and localization of TMEM192-3xHA, the lysosomal membrane protein used to isolate lysosomes, were not significantly impacted by LLOMe treatment (Figure 3A and Figure 3- figure supplement 1). We did not observe a loss of LAMP1 signal by immunofluorescence analysis, suggesting that LAMP1 may dissociate or be degraded from ruptured lysosomal membranes upon immunopurification. These data suggest that while LLOMe treatment results in lysosomal membrane damage, sufficient lysosomal integrity remains to enable purification of this subcellular compartment using TMEM192.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Lines 272-275 imply that previous studies (references 32 and 33) also saw reductions in LAMP1 levels on purified lysosomes following LLoMe treatment. However, I could not find evidence of this in the papers that were cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the inclusion of references 32 and 33 in our previous draft following our comment around potential explanations for the reduction in LAMP1 levels observed on isolated damaged lysosomes was not clearly elaborated. References 32 and 33 had been previously included to support our hypothesis that LAMP1 levels may be reduced due to enhanced lysophagy or redistribution to small vesicles upon damage. These papers showed that LLOMe treatment led to the redistribution of LAMP2 to the cytoplasm or increased the turnover of LAMP1, respectively. However, based on the great point raised by this reviewer that LAMP1 signal loss was not observed in our imaging-based studies, our speculation is that we are immunopurifying lysosomal membrane fragments from which LAMP1 has dissociated or been degraded. We have revised the text as described above in Point 1 to better reflect our thinking on this and removed reference to these papers entirely in the updated manuscrpt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is still a discrepancy between Figure 4A-C where LLoMe activates LRRK2 (as measured by phosphor-Rab10) even in the context of VPS35-D620N and LRRK2-R1441G and Figure 4D where LLoMe does not change LRRK2 lysosome abundance in the same cells. The authors touched on this in the response to reviewers but the answer was not definitive. The description and interpretation of these results in the manuscript text is confusing as it is unclear to what extent LRRK2 kinase activity is regulated in response to these stimuli versus LRRK2 localization and proximity to substrates. The data suggests that there might be independent changes to LRRK2 localization and activity. It is not necessary for the authors to solve these puzzles but they should be more clearly presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s feedback that the description and interpretation of our results around the magnitude of increase in Rab10 phosphorylation being greater than the increase in LRRK2 localization to lysosomes observed following LLOMe treatment should be edited to more clearly represent our ideas on the balance between activity versus localization. To further clarify our results and interpretation of our data, we have modified our results section to the following (lines 849-857):</p><p>“The levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes were significantly increased in untreated LRRK2 R1441G KI cells and VPS35 D620N KI cells, suggesting that enhanced localization of LRRK2 to lysosomes and proximity to its Rab substrates may contribute to the elevated Rab10 phosphorylation observed on lysosomes at baseline in these cells (Figure 4D). Rab10 phosphorylation was increased on lysosomes in response to LLOMe treatment while the levels of LRRK2 were not significantly impacted on lysosomes isolated from LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N KI cells, suggesting additional mechanisms beyond LRRK2 localization may also contribute to LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage in these cells.”</p><p>Further, we have added the following text to the Discussion (lines 908-915):</p><p>“We cannot rule out that additional mechanisms beyond increased proximity between LRRK2 and its Rab substrates may contribute to Rab10 phosphorylation following lysosomal damage, as the magnitude of Rab10 phosphorylation induced by LLOMe treatment was greater than the extent of LRRK2 recruitment to damaged lysosomes.

Line 168: The statement that Rab12 is necessary and sufficient is too strong.
