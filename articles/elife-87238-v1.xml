Why should economic variables such as reward and effort alter the vigor of our movements? In theory, both the option that we choose and the vigor with which we move contribute to a measure of fitness in which the objective is to maximize rewards minus efforts, divided by time. To explore this idea, we engaged marmosets in a foraging task in which on each trial they decided whether to work by making saccades to visual targets, thus accumulating food, or to harvest by licking what they had earned. We varied the effort cost of harvest by moving the food tube with respect to the mouth. Theory predicted that the subjects should respond to the increased effort costs by choosing to work longer, stockpiling food before commencing harvest, but reduce their movement vigor to conserve energy. Indeed, in response to an increased effort cost of harvest, marmosets extended their work duration, but slowed their movements. These changes in decisions and movements coincided with changes in pupil size. As the effort cost of harvest declined, work duration decreased, the pupils dilated, and the vigor of licks and saccades increased. Thus, when acquisition of reward became effortful, the pupils constricted, the decisions exhibited delayed gratification, and the movements displayed reduced vigor.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>foraging theory</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>saccades</kwd><kwd>vigor</kwd><kwd>marmosets</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-EB028156</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>In Kyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Shadmehr</surname><given-names>Reza</given-names></name><name><surname>Hage</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Looi</surname><given-names>Vivian</given-names></name><name><surname>Pi</surname><given-names>Jay S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fakharian</surname><given-names>Mohammad Amin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS078311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shadmehr</surname><given-names>Reza</given-names></name><name><surname>Hage</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Fakharian</surname><given-names>Mohammad Amin</given-names></name><name><surname>Pi</surname><given-names>Jay S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-NS128416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hage</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>In Kyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Looi</surname><given-names>Vivian</given-names></name><name><surname>Fakharian</surname><given-names>Mohammad Amin</given-names></name><name><surname>Pi</surname><given-names>Jay S</given-names></name><name><surname>Shadmehr</surname><given-names>Reza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000006</institution-id><institution>Office of Naval Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>N00014-15-1-2312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orozco</surname><given-names>Simon P</given-names></name><name><surname>Sedaghat-Nejad</surname><given-names>Ehsan</given-names></name><name><surname>Shadmehr</surname><given-names>Reza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When the acquisition of reward becomes effortful, marmosets choose to work longer, delaying their harvest, but slow their movements, reducing energy consumption.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During foraging, animals work to locate a food cache and then spend effort harvesting what they have found. As they forage, their decisions appear to maximize a measure that is relevant to fitness: the sum of rewards acquired, minus efforts expended, divided by time, termed the capture rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Charnov, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowie, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shadmehr and Ahmed, 2020</xref>). For example, a crow will spend effort extracting a clam from a sandy beach, but if the clam is small, it will abandon it because the additional time and effort required to extract the small reward – dropping it repeatedly from a height onto rocks – can be better spent finding a bigger prize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson and Verbeek, 1986</xref>). In other words, if going to the bank entails waiting in a long line, one should go infrequently, but make each transaction a large amount.</p><p>Intriguingly, reward expectation not only affects decisions, it also affects movements: we not only prefer the less effortful option, we also move vigorously to obtain it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Korbisch et al., 2022</xref>). This modulation of movement vigor can be justified if we consider that movements require expenditure of time and energy, which discount the value of the promised reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shadmehr et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shadmehr et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, from a theoretical perspective, there should exist a mechanism to coordinate control of decisions with control of movements so that both contribute to maximizing fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoon et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To study this coordination, we designed a task in which marmosets decided how long to work before they harvested their food. On a given trial, they made a sequence of saccades to visual targets and received an increment of food as their reward. However, the increment was small, and its harvest was effortful, requiring them to insert their tongue inside a small tube. Theory predicted that in order to maximize the capture rate, harvest should commence only when there was sufficient reward accumulated to justify the effort required for its extraction. Indeed, the subjects chose to work and stockpile food, and only then initiated their harvest.</p><p>On some days the effort cost of harvest was low: the tube was placed close to the mouth. On other days the same amount of work, that is, saccade trials, produced food that had a higher effort cost: the tube was located farther away. The theory made two interesting predictions: as the effort cost increased, the subjects should choose to work more trials, thus delaying their harvest so to stow more food, but reduce their movement vigor, thus saving energy. Indeed, when marmosets encountered an increased effort cost, they extended their work period, stockpiling food, but reduced their vigor, slowing their saccades during the work period, and slowing their licks during the harvest period.</p><p>What might be a neural basis for this coordinated response of the decision-making and the motor-control circuits? During the work and the harvest periods, momentary changes in pupil size closely tracked the changes in vigor: pupil dilation accompanied increases in vigor, while pupil constriction accompanied decreases in vigor. Remarkably, this was true regardless of whether the movement that was being performed was a saccade or a lick. Moreover, in response to the increased effort cost, the pupils exhibited a global change, constricting during both the work and the harvest periods.</p><p>If we view the changes in pupil size as a proxy for activity in the brainstem noradrenergic circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joshi and Gold, 2020</xref>), our results suggest that as these circuits respond to effort costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornert and Bouret, 2021</xref>), they alter computations in the brain regions that control decisions, delaying gratification and encouraging work, and the brain regions that control movements, promoting sloth and conserving energy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We tracked the eyes and the tongue of head-fixed marmosets as they performed visually guided saccades in exchange for food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each successful trial consisted of three visually guided saccades, at the end of which we delivered an increment of food (a slurry mixture of apple sauce and monkey chow). Because the reward amount was small (0.015–0.02 mL), the subjects rarely harvested following a single successful trial. Rather, they worked for a few trials, allowing the food to accumulate, then initiated their harvest by licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The key variables were how many trials they chose to work before starting harvest, and how vigorously they moved their eyes and tongue during the work and the harvest periods.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Elements of a foraging task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During the work period, marmosets made a sequence of saccades to visual targets.

The work period ended when the subject decided to stop tracking the targets and instead initiated harvest, which lasted about 6 s, resulting in 16–18 licks. Subject M completed an average of 909.5 ± 61 successful trials per session (mean ± SEM), producing an average of 241 ± 13.9 work-harvest pairs, and subject R completed an average of 1431 ± 65 successful trials, producing an average of 263 ± 8.9 work-harvest pairs.</p><p>We delivered food via either the left or the right tube for 50–300 consecutive trials and then switched tubes.

During the work and the harvest periods, the brain implicitly controlled the vigor of movements. We imagined that these two forms of behavior were not independent, but rather coordinated via a control policy that maximized a single utility: the sum of rewards acquired, minus efforts expended, divided by time, termed the capture rate. We chose this formulation because it presents a normative approach that ecologists have used to understand the decisions that animals make regarding how far to travel for food, what mode of travel to use, and how long to stay before moving on to another patch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richardson and Verbeek, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stephens and Krebs, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bautista et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>During a work period, our subjects decided to complete a number of saccade trials <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , a fraction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> of which were successful, earning food increment <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, but expended effort <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> that consumed time <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> for each trial.

As a result, when the effort cost of reward increased, the pupils constricted, and the vigor of both saccades and licks decreased.</p><p>While the theory predicted that moving the tube farther would result in a longer work period and reduced movement vigor, it also predicted that the subjects would reduce their harvest duration (reduced licks, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). That is, it predicted that the subjects would work longer, stowing more food, but leave more of it behind. This last prediction did not agree with our data (see ‘Discussion’).

To check whether reward magnitude affected movement vigor, for each tube distance we computed the average lick vigor during the harvest as a function of the number of trials completed in the preceding work period. We found that when the work period had included many completed trials, then the movements in the ensuing harvest period were more vigorous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, two-way ANOVA, effect of trials, subject M: F(4, 164242) = 353, p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>, subject R: F(4,123411) = 152, p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>). Thus, the licks were invigorated by the amount of food that awaited harvest.</p><p>Because the tube was small, many of the licks missed their goal and failed to contact the food. The success or failure of a lick affected both the vigor of the subsequent lick and the change in the size of the pupil. Following a successful lick, there was a large increase in lick vigor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, subject M: t(85182) = 40, p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>, subject R: t(81378) = 104, p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>), and a large increase in pupil size (subject M: F(84969) = 57, p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>, subject R: t(80318) = 94, p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>). In contrast, following a failed lick the subjects either reduced or did not increase their lick vigor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, subject M: t(114159) = 0.88, p=0.37, subject R: t(97164) = -44, p&lt;10<sup>–50</sup>).

Thus, a single successful lick led to acquisition of reward, which then was followed by a relatively large increase in pupil size, and an invigorated subsequent lick.</p><p>For saccades, we had found that increased vigor was associated with greater accuracy. To quantify the relationship between lick vigor and accuracy, for each tube distance we labeled each reward-seeking lick as being high or low vigor. For subject M, high vigor licks tended to be more successful, but this was not the case for subject R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Moreover, tube distance did not produce a consistent effect on lick success.</p><p>In summary, the subject licked more vigorously following a long work period in which they had accumulated more reward.

From a theoretical perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoon et al., 2018</xref>), our brain should coordinate these two forms of behavior because both the act that we select and its vigor dictate expenditure of time and energy, contributing to a capture rate that affects longevity and fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemon, 1991</xref>). Does the brain coordinate decisions and movements to maximize a capture rate? If so, how might the brain accomplish this coordination?</p><p>Here, we designed a foraging task in which marmosets worked by making saccades, accumulating food for each successful trial, then stopped working and harvested their cache by licking. On every trial they decided whether to work or to harvest. Their decision was carried out by the motor system, producing either a visually guided saccade or a lick, each exhibiting a particular vigor. The theory predicted that to maximize the capture rate, the appropriate response to an increased effort cost of harvest was to do two things: work longer to cache more food but reduce vigor to conserve energy.</p><p>We varied the effort costs by moving the food tube with respect to the mouth. This changed the effort cost of harvest but not the effort cost of work. The subjects responded by altering how they worked as well as how they harvested. When the harvest was more effortful, they performed more saccade trials to stockpile food. They also slowed their movements, reducing saccade velocity during the work period, and reducing lick velocity during the harvest period. Notably, the most vigorous saccades were also the most accurate: as saccade vigor increased, so did endpoint accuracy.</p><p>The theory made a second prediction: as the value of reward increased, the subjects should again choose to work a longer period before initiating harvest, but unlike the effort costs, now respond by moving more vigorously. We did not directly manipulate the subjective value of reward, but rather relied on the natural fluctuations in body weight and assumed that when their weight was low, the subjects were hungrier for reward. Indeed, when their weight was low, the subjects again chose to work longer, but now elevated their vigor during the harvest period.</p><p>Finally, we quantified the effect of reward magnitude on vigor. Within a session, lick vigor increased robustly as a function of the number of trials completed in the preceding work period. Thus, the licks were invigorated by the amount of food that awaited harvest.</p><p>Notably, some of the predictions of the theory did not agree with the experimental data. An increased effort cost did not accompany a reduction in the duration of harvest, and hunger did not increase saccade vigor robustly. Indeed, earlier experiments have shown that if the effort cost of harvest increases, animals who expend the effort will then linger longer to harvest more of the reward that they have earned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cowie, 1977</xref>). This mismatch between observed behavior and theory highlights some of the limitations of our formulation. For example, our capture rate reflected a single work-harvest period rather than a long sequence. Moreover, the capture rate did not consider the fact that the food tube had finite capacity, beyond which the food would fall and be wasted. This constraint would discourage a policy of working more but harvesting less. Finally, if we assume that a reduced body weight is a proxy for increased subjective value of reward, it is notable that we observed a robust effect on vigor of licks, but not saccades. A more realistic capture rate formulation awaits simulations, possibly one that describes capture rate not as the ratio of two sums (sum of gains and losses with respect to sum of time), but rather the expected value of the ratio of each gain and loss with respect to time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateson and Kacelnik, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateson and Kacelnik, 1996</xref>).</p><p>A shortcoming of our model is that we did not include a link between lick vigor and its probability of success. As a result, when we moved the food tube away, the model did not consider the possibility that maintaining lick accuracy may involve reduced vigor. The reason for this is that we searched for but could not find a consistent relationship, across subjects or effort conditions, between protraction speed of the tongue and its success probability. Thus, we cannot exclude this alternate hypothesis. However, the most interesting aspect of our results was that when we increased tube distance, making harvest more effortful, there was not only a reduction in lick vigor, but also a reduction in saccade vigor. That is, the decisions and actions during the work period responded to the increased effort cost of reward during the harvest period.</p><p>What might be a neural basis for this coordination of decisions and movements? A clue was the fact that the pupils were more constricted in sessions in which the effort cost of harvest was greater. This global change in pupil size accompanied delayed harvest and reduced vigor across sessions, but surprisingly, even within a session, transient changes in pupil size accompanied changes in vigor. During the work period, the trial-to-trial reduction in saccade vigor accompanied trial-to-trial constriction of the pupil, and within a harvest period, the rapid rise and then the gradual fall in lick vigor paralleled rapid dilatation followed by gradual constriction of the pupil.</p><p>Pupil dilation is a proxy for activity in the brainstem neuromodulatory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>) and is a measure of arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mathôt, 2018</xref>). Control of pupil size is dependent on spiking of norepinephrine neurons in locus coeruleus (LC-NE): an increase in the activity of these neurons produces pupil dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joshi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019</xref>). Some of these neurons show a transient change in their activity when acquisition of reward requires expenditure of either physical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bornert and Bouret, 2021</xref>) or mental effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Contadini-Wright et al., 2023</xref>), even when there is no concomitant movement to be made. It is possible that in the present task, as the effort cost of harvest increased, LC-NE neurons decreased their activity, producing pupil constriction. If so, the reduced NE release may have had two simultaneous effects: encourage work and promote delayed gratification in brain regions that control decisions, discourage energy expenditure and promote sloth in brain regions that control movements. Thus, the idea that emerges is that the response of NE to economic variables, as inferred via changes in pupil size, might act as a bridge to coordinate the computations in the decision-making circuits with the computations in the motor-control circuits, aiming to implement a consistent control policy that improves the capture rate.</p><p>In addition to NE, the basal ganglia and, in particular, the neurotransmitter dopamine are likely the key contributors to the coordination of decisions with actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thura and Cisek, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herz et al., 2022</xref>). When the effort price of a preferred food increases, animals choose to work longer, pressing a lever a greater number of times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Salamone et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberman and Salamone, 1999</xref>). This desire to expend effort to acquire a valuable reward is reduced if dopamine is blocked in the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farrar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yohn et al., 2015</xref>). Hunger activates circuits in the hypothalamic nuclei, disinhibiting dopamine release in response to food cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassidy and Tong, 2017</xref>). Dopamine concentrations in the striatum drop when the effort price of a food reward increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schelp et al., 2017</xref>), and dopamine release before onset of a movement tends to invigorate that movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the presence of dopamine may not only alter decisions by encouraging expenditure of effort, but also modify movements by promoting vigor.</p><p>Experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayden et al., 2011</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barack et al., 2017</xref> suggest that the decision of when to stop work and commence harvest may rely on computations that are carried out in the cingulate cortex. They found that as monkeys deliberated between the choice of staying and acquiring diminishing rewards, or leaving and incurring a travel cost, these neurons encoded a decision variable that reflected the value of leaving the patch. The prediction that emerges from our work is that the rate of rise of these decision variables may be modulated by the presence of NE.</p><p>From a motor-control perspective, a surprising aspect of our results was that an increase in saccade vigor accompanied an improvement in endpoint accuracy. In our earlier work, we found that during reaching, reward increased vigor without reducing accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Summerside et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the brain has the means to increase movement vigor and improve its accuracy. How is this achieved?</p><p>We found that the high vigor saccades were produced when the pupils were dilated, implying an increased release of NE. In songbirds, increased NE release acts on the basal ganglia to suppress activity of spiny neurons, and this reduced activity in the basal ganglia accompanies reduced variance in the songs that the animal sings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Singh Alvarado et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, NE may play a critical role in control of movement variability. For saccades, control of endpoint accuracy depends on the coordinated activity of Purkinje cells in the oculomotor region of the cerebellar vermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barash et al., 1999</xref>).

As the animal made a saccade to the primary target, that target was erased and a secondary target was presented at a distance of 2–2.5°, also at one of eight randomly selected directions. The subject was rewarded if following the primary saccade it made a corrective saccade to the secondary target, landed within 1.5° radius of the target center, and maintained fixation for at least 200 ms. Onset of reward coincided with the presentation of another distinct tone. Following an additional 150–250 ms period (uniform random distribution), the secondary target was erased and the center target was displayed, indicating the onset of the next trial.

We modeled harvesting of the food as a hyperbolic function of the number of licks to represent the fact that as the licking bout began, each successful lick depleted the food, and thus the first few licks produced a greater amount of food consumption than the last few licks. We modeled the effort cost of licking as a linear function of the number of licks.</p><p>A critical assumption that we made is that energy expended performing the saccade trials (which grew faster than linearly as a function of the number of trials attempted) grew faster than the time spent attempting those same trials (which grew linearly with the number of trials). This assumption is based on the heuristic that the average rate of energy lost following a large number of attempted trials is greater than the average rate of energy lost following a small number of attempted trials.</p><p>The model’s simplicity provided closed-form solutions across all parameter values, allowing us to make predictions without having to fit the model to the measured data. For example, for all parameter values that produce a real solution (as opposed to imaginary), the optimal number of saccade trials increases with the square root of the cost of licking. Thus, the basic prediction of the model is that to maximize the capture rate, regardless of parameter values, an increase in the effort required for harvest should be met with a greater willingness to work. The closed-form solutions are presented in the supplementary document (simulations.nb).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Other models of utility</title><p>In composing our utility (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>), we chose to combine reward and effort additively. This is in contrast to other approaches in which effort discounts reward multiplicatively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugiwaka and Okouchi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Prévost et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein-Flügge et al., 2015</xref>). Our reasoning is that multiplicative interactions have the limitation that they are incompatible with the observation that reward invigorates movements.</p><p>To compare additive and multiplicative approaches, let us consider an arbitrary function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf48"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that specifies how effort varies with movement duration <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf49"><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Typically, this is a U-shaped function that describes energy expenditure as a function of movement duration, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shadmehr et al., 2016</xref>. In the case of multiplicative interaction between reward and effort, we can consider the following representation of utility:<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In the above formulation, reward <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf50"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is discounted hyperbolically with time and an increase in reward increases the utility of the action.

Notably, because increasing reward merely scales this utility, it has no effect on vigor. Thus, a utility in which reward is multiplied by a function of effort generally fails to predict dependence of movement vigor on reward.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Simulations</title><p>The optimal policy specifies the decisions and movements that for the effort cost defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref> maximizes the capture rate defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>.

In all three cases, we were able to solve for the relevant control variable analytically (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for the derivations).

In an interesting comprehensive framework, the authors study how experimental and natural variation of these factors affect both the decisions and actions necessary to gather and accumulate food, as well as the actions necessary to consume the food.</p><p>The manuscript proposes a computational model of how the monkeys may guide all these aspects of behavior, by maximizing a food capture rate that trades off the food that can be gathered with the effort and duration of the underlying actions. They use this model to derive qualitative predictions for how monkeys should react to an increase in the effort associated with food consumption: Monkeys should work longer before deciding to consume the accumulated food, but should move more slowly. The model also predicts that monkeys should show a different reaction to an increase in reward value of the food, also working longer but moving faster. The authors test these predictions in an interesting experimental setup that requires monkeys to collect small increments of food rewards for successful eye movements to targets. The monkeys can decide freely when to interrupt work and consume the accumulated food, and the authors measure the speed of the eye movements involved in the food acquisition as well as the tongue movements involved in the food consumption.</p><p>By and large, the behavioral findings fall in line with the qualitative model predictions: When the effort involved in food consumption increases, monkeys collect more food before deciding to consume it, and they move slower both during food acquisition and food consumption. In a second test, the authors approximate the effects of reward value of the food at stake, by comparing monkey behavior during different days with natural variations in body weight. These quasi-experimental increases in the reward value of food also lead to longer work times before consumption, but to faster movements during food consumption. Finally, the authors show that these effects correlate with pupil size, with pupils dilating more for low-effort foraging actions with increased saccade speed and decreased work duration. The authors conclude that the effort associated with anticipated actions can lead to changes in global brain state that simultaneously affect decisions and action vigor.</p><p>The paper proposes an interesting model for how one unified action policy may simultaneously affect multiple types of decisions and movements involved in foraging. The methods employed to measure behavior and test these predictions are generally sound, and the paper is well written.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87238.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hage</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jang</surname><given-names>In Kyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BALTIMORE</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Looi</surname><given-names>Vivian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fakharian</surname><given-names>Mohammad Amin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BALTIMORE</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Orozco</surname><given-names>Simon P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pi</surname><given-names>Jay S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BALTIMORE</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sedaghat-Nejad</surname><given-names>Ehsan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">BALTIMORE</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shadmehr</surname><given-names>Reza</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Hage et al. presents interesting results from a foraging behavior in Marmosets that explores the interactions of saccade and lick vigor with pupil dilation and performance as well as a marginal value theory and foraging theory-inspired value-based decision-making model thereof. The results are generally robust and carefully presented and analyses, particularly of vigor, are carefully executed.</p><p>The authors constructed a model that makes two predictions: &quot;In summary, this simple theory made two sets of predictions: in response to an increased cost of harvest, one should work longer, but move with reduced vigor. In response to an increased reward value, as in hunger, one should also work longer, but now move with increased vigor.&quot; Their behavioral data meets these predictions. It is not clear if the model was designed and tweaked in order to make those predictions and match the data, or derived from principles. Furthermore, it is not clear what other models would make similar predictions. It would help to assess what is predicted by other simple models, as well as different functional forms for the effort costs in their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose this formulation of utility (Eq. 1) because it is a normative approach that ecologists have used to understand the decisions that animals make regarding how far to travel for food, what mode of travel to use, and how long to stay before moving on to another reward opportunity (Richardson and Verbeek 1986; Stephens and Krebs 1986; Bautista et al. 2001). In a typical formulation of the theory, the numerator represents the reward gained (in units of energy), minus the effort expended (also in units of energy). The denominator represents the amount of time spent during that behavior. We represented this idea in Eq. (1) with saccades that produced reward accumulation, and licks that produced reward consumption. Thus, the utility that we are trying to maximize is the rate of energy gained.</p><p>The specific functions that we used to represent the energy acquired through reward acquisition, and the energy expended through effort expenditure, came a priori either from experiment design, or from the measurements we have made in other experiments. We modeled reward accumulation as a linear rise in energy stored because successful saccades produced a linear increase in the food cache. We modeled consumption of the food as a hyperbolic function of the number of licks to represent the fact that as the licking bout began, each successful lick depleted the food, and thus the first few licks produced a greater amount of food consumption than the last few licks. We modeled the effort cost of licking to grow linearly with the number of licks.</p><p>A critical assumption that we made is that energy spent performing the saccade trials (which grew faster than linearly as a function of the number of trials attempted), grew faster than the time spent attempting those same trials (which grew linearly with the number of trials). This assumption is based on the heuristic that the average rate of energy lost following a large number of attempted trials is greater than the average rate of energy lost following a small number of attempted trials.</p><p>Sensitivity to parameter values: The model’s simplicity provides closed-form solutions across all parameter values, allowing one to make predictions without having to fit the model to the measured data. For example, for all parameter values that produce a real solution (as opposed to imaginary), the optimal number of saccade trials increases with the square root of the cost of licking. Thus, the basic prediction of the model is that in order to maximize the capture rate, an increase in the effort that it takes to harvest the reward should produce a greater willingness to work longer, caching more food. The closed-form solutions are presented in the Mathematica supplementary document.</p><p>Other models of utility: In composing our utility (Eq. 1), we chose to combine reward and effort additively. This is in contrast to other approaches in which effort discounts reward multiplicatively (47–49). Here, let us show that multiplicative interactions may have the limitation that they are incompatible with the observation that reward invigorates movements.To compare additive and multiplicative approaches, let us consider an arbitrary function <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa3m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that specifies how effort varies with movement duration. Typically, this is a U-shaped function that describes energy expenditure as a function of movement duration, as in Shadmehr et al. (2016). In the case of multiplicative interaction between reward and effort, we can consider the following representation of utility:<disp-formula id="sa3equ1"><mml:math id="sa3m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>J</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In the above formulation, reward <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa3m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is discounted hyperbolically with time, and an increase in reward increases the utility of the action. The optimum movement vigor has the duration <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa3m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> that maximizes this utility. Notably, because increasing reward merely scales this utility, it has no effect on vigor. Thus, a utility in which reward is multiplied by a function of effort generally fails to predict dependence of movement vigor on reward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 37 page 6; the link of pupil to NE/LC is tenuous. Other modulators systems and circuits may be equally important and should be mentioned (e.g. Reimer, Jacob, Matthew J. McGinley, Yang Liu, Charles Rodenkirch, Qi Wang, David A. McCormick, and Andreas S. Tolias. &quot;Pupil fluctuations track rapid changes in adrenergic and cholinergic activity in cortex.&quot; Nature communications 7, no. 1 (2016): 13289.)</p></disp-quote><p>Reimer et al. (2016) used two-photon microscopy to measure activity of ACh and NE projections in layer 1 of mouse visual cortex while tracking pupil diameter fluctuations. During stillness, elevated pupil diameter was followed by cholinergic and noradrenergic axonal activity. Notably, NE activity levels were larger and with shorter latency than ACh. In primates, Joshi et al., (2016) recorded from LC during a fixation task. Using spike-triggered averaging, they found that following a spike in an LC neuron, there was pupil dilation at 200-300 ms latency. Moreover, microstimulation in LC produced pupil dilation at 500ms latency. More recently, Breton-Provencher and Sur (2019) provided causal evidence that LC activity drives pupil size. They optogenetically activated (1s) or silenced (5 sec) locus coeruleus noradrenergic neurons and found strong increase in pupil size or modest decrease: increase had a slow time scale of 1 second or more, similar slow timescale for decrease. The LC-NA neurons are surrounded by GABA-ergic neurons. Stimulation of the GABA-ergic neurons produced mild, slow constriction. They identified GABA-ergic and NA neurons by photo-tagging and then tried to identify them via spike shape and found that “spike shape of some GABA neurons were not well separated from NA neurons, demonstrating the difficulty of cell-type identification based on spike shape alone.” They noted that a subset of GABAergic neurons received coincident inputs with the NA neurons. When the GABA neurons were excited, the gain of the pupil response to an auditory tone was diminished, producing an increase as a function of tone intensity that had a lower gain. Thus, LC-NA neurons causally drive pupil size, and the GABA neurons that surround them control the gain of the response of LC-NA neurons to arousal stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 35 page 6-page 7 line 10 emphasizes a cognitive interpretation of the pupil dilations that is emphasized, in relation to effort costs. But there are also more concomitant vigorous movements. Could all of their pupil results be explained by motor correlates? This should be tested and ruled out before making cognitive interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>Pupil dilation is a proxy for activity in the brainstem neuromodulatory system (Vazey et al., 2018) and is a measure of arousal (Mathot, 2018). Control of pupil size is dependent on spiking of norepinephrine neurons in locus coeruleus (LC-NE): an increase in the activity of these neurons produces pupil dilation (Joshi et al., 2016; Breton-Provencher and Sur, 2019). Some of these neurons show a transient change in their activity when acquisition of reward requires expenditure of physical effort (Bornert and Bouret, 2021). However, the link between effort costs and pupil size appears to go beyond motor control, as a recent paper found that pupil size increases during effortful speech perception (Contadini-Wright et al., 2023). Thus, although in our work increases in pupil size were always associated with increased movement vigor, the results from other studies suggest that economic variables such as cognitive effort in tasks in which there is no concomitant movement also drive an increase in pupil size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7, line 37-42: How would the model need to be modified in order to account for this discrepancy with the data? Ideally, this would be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We comment on potential modifications that can be made to the model that may account for the discrepancy referred to by the reviewer in the discussion section: “Notably, some of the predictions of the theory did not agree with the experimental data. An increased effort cost did not accompany a reduction in the duration of harvest, and hunger did not increase saccade vigor robustly. Indeed, earlier experiments have shown that if the effort cost of harvest increases, animals who expend the effort will then linger longer to harvest more of the reward that they have earned (2). This mismatch between observed behavior and theory highlights some of the limitations of our formulation. For example, our capture rate reflected a single work-harvest period, rather than a long sequence. Moreover, the capture rate did not consider the fact that the food tube had finite capacity, beyond which the food would fall and be wasted. This constraint would discourage a policy of working more but harvesting less. Finally, if we assume that a reduced body weight is a proxy for increased subjective value of reward, it is notable that we observed a robust effect on vigor of licks, but not saccades. A more realistic capture rate formulation awaits simulations, possibly one that describes capture rate not as the ratio of two sums (sum of gains and losses with respect to sum of time), but rather the expected value of the ratio of each gain and loss with respect to time (Bateson et al., 1995 &amp; 1996).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 9, line 2-11: In this section, it would help to also consider 'baseline' pupil size (inbetween trials). This would give a signal that is not 'contaminated' by movements, and may reflect control state. Relatedly, changes in control state may impact and confound the movement-related dilation magnitudes due to e.g. floor and ceiling effects on pupil size, which has a strong tendency for reversion to the mean.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiment design included little or no between-trial periods because during the trials the subjects worked (performed saccades to accumulate reward), while after completing a few trials they stopped working and started harvesting through licking. Because primates make saccades during their entire wake state, it is probably not possible to find a significant period in which the subjects do not make any movements. We selected a window of 500 ms around each lick in the harvest period, and each saccade during the work period, and computed the average pupil size per movement, which includes data from both before and after movements. We then computed a within-session z-score by normalizing these measures by the average pupil size acquired for that day.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The hunger-related and reward-size related analyses are both heavily confounded since they were not manipulated directly and could co-vary with many latent factors. For example, why might a given Marmoset be lower weight on a given day? Could it affect sleep, stress, activity, or other factors during the preceding 24 hours? If so, could these other variables be driving the results that are interpreted as 'hunger?' Relatedly, since the reward size is determined by the animals behavior on each trial (how much they worked), factors (internal brain state, external noises, etc.) that alter how much they worked will influence the subsequent reward size. Therefore interpretations about reward expectancy are confounded. Both of these issues should be discussed and manipulations of them (different feeding schedules and reward size-work functions proposed, respectively).</p></disp-quote><p>Weight of the subjects was measured prior to the start of the experiment on each day. The natural fluctuations are typically the result of factors such as time of the experiment and corresponding weight measurement (AM vs PM) relative to the time of feeding on the previous day, day of the week of the experiment (following a weekend vs. during the week), and volume of food given during the previous day. Animals were maintained at 90% of their baseline weight during food restriction, and fluctuations typically occurred within that range (Sedaghat-Nejad et al., 2019). We used weight as a proxy for hunger, and thus value of reward, and the resulting analyses yielded results consistent with predictions made by our model, as seen in Fig. 5. Critically, other factors that may co-vary with lower weights, like those mentioned by the reviewer (sleep conditions, stress levels, and activity levels) often lead to very poor task performance by the subjects. In sharp contrast, the model predicted increased work period, and increased movement vigor for high reward value, both of which we observed when the subject’s weight was low. Thus, a low relative weight did not seem to impair performance, but rather act as a motivating factor. Subjects were closely monitored for well characterized stress-related behaviors and impaired attentive states by experimenters, veterinarian staff, and caretaker staff, and, in the event of abnormalities, were removed from food restriction and experimentation until behavior stabilized.</p><p>Effect of reward size: As you noted, we did not manipulate reward size directly. Rather, because our emphasis was on quantifying the effect of effort, the subjects received the same increment of reward per each completed trial, but on some sessions this reward was easy to harvest, while in other sessions the reward required greater effort to harvest. Because the reward amount accumulated during the work period, some harvests encountered a small amount of reward, while other harvests encountered a large amount of reward. Indeed, the amount of reward available for harvest depended linearly on the number of successful saccade trials completed during the work period. We found that the vigor of licks grew with the reward magnitude.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major issue is a lack of alternative models. The authors seem to have constructed a particular model designed to capture the behavioral patterns they observed in the data. The model fails in some instances, as they point out. Even more importantly, there are no results or discussion about how other plausible models could or couldn't fit the data. The lack of model comparisons makes it difficult to interpret the conclusions or put the results in a broader context.</p></disp-quote><p>To model behavior, we chose a formulation of utility that represented a normative approach that ecologists have used to understand the decisions that animals make regarding how far to travel for food, what mode of travel to use, and how long to stay before moving on to another patch. In the model, the objective of decisions and actions is to maximize the sum of reward acquired, minus the efforts expended, divided by time. This is termed the capture rate. However, there are other models to consider, and thus we added a new section titled Model formulation and Other models of utility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The model proposed in the paper takes a very specific functional form that is neither motivated by the previous literature nor particularly useful for indexing the behavioral tendencies of individual monkeys (or of the same monkey in different contexts). For example, while it is clear that the saccade effort cost will need to outgrow the increase in the utility of the accumulated food for the monkey to start feeding, it is unclear why this needs to be modeled with a fixed quadratic exponent on the number of saccades? Similarly, why do licks deplete the food stash with the specific rate hard-coded in the model?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a section titled Model formulation and Other models of utility to better explain the rationale behind the model.</p><p>We chose this formulation of utility (Eq. 1) because it is a normative approach that ecologists have used to understand the decisions that animals make regarding how far to travel for food, what mode of travel to use, and how long to stay before moving on to another reward opportunity (Richardson and Verbeek, 1986; Stephens and Krebs, 1986; Bautista et al., 2001). In a typical formulation of the theory, the numerator represents the reward gained (in units of energy), minus the effort expended (also in units of energy), while the denominator represents the amount of time spent during that behavior. We represented this idea in Eq. (1) with saccades that produced reward accumulation, and licks that produced reward consumption. Thus, the utility that we aim to maximize is the rate of energy gained.</p><p>The specific functions that we used to represent the energy gained through reward acquisition, and the energy expended through effort expenditure, came either from experiment design, or from the measurements we have made in other experiments. We modeled reward accumulation as a linear rise in energy stored because successful saccades produced a linear increase in the food cache. We modeled consumption of the food as a hyperbolic function of the number of licks to represent the fact that as the licking bout began, each successful lick depleted the food, and thus the first few licks produced a greater amount of food consumption than the last few licks. We modeled the effort cost of licking to grow linearly with the number of licks.</p><p>A critical assumption that we made is that energy expended performing the saccade trials (which grew faster than linearly as a function of the number of trials attempted), grew faster than the time spent attempting those same trials (which grew linearly with the number of trials). This assumption is based on the heuristic that the average rate of energy lost following a large number of attempted trials is greater than the average rate of energy lost following a small number of attempted trials. A quadratic function is one example of such a function, which has the advantage of providing closed form solutions for the optimal policy.</p><p>The model’s simplicity provided closed-form solutions across all parameter values, allowing us to make predictions without having to fit the model to the measured data. Critically, for all parameter values that produce a real solution (as opposed to imaginary), the optimal number of saccade trials increases with the square root of the cost of licking. Thus, the basic prediction of the model is that to maximize the capture rate, regardless of parameter values, an increase in the effort required for harvest should be met with a greater willingness to work. The closed-form solutions are presented in the supplementary document (simulations.nb).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the proportion of successful saccades and lick events is assumed to be fixed, even though it very likely to be directly influenced by movement speed (speed- accuracy trade-off), which is also contained in the model. It would strongly increase the plausibility and potential impact of the model if the authors could clearly state where these hard-coded model terms come from. Ideally, they would formulate the model in more general terms and also consider other functional forms, as briefly suggested in the discussion. This latter point would be particularly important since not all model predictions were actually borne out in the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. Regarding saccades, contrary to the speed accuracy trade-off hypothesis, we found that faster saccades were also more accurate (Fig. 3C). Thus, increased pupil size was not only associated with more vigorous saccades, but also more accurate saccades. Importantly, these vigor-related changes in accuracy were too small to affect the probability of reward: the reward area for the saccades was much larger (1.5 deg) than the endpoint accuracy changes that was produced due to changes in the food tube distance. For example, on average saccade vigor changed from 0.95 to 1.05 when the food tube distance changed from 12 mm to 8 mm. These changes in vigor would produce a fraction of degree reduction in endpoint error (Fig. 3C).</p><p>Regarding licks, we added new data to the manuscript to assess the relationship between vigor of the licks and endpoint accuracy. We saw no consistent relationship, across subjects or effort conditions, between protraction speed and the outcome of a lick, that is, if the lick was successful in making it inside the tube. On average, in subject R we observed an improvement in lick accuracy with increased vigor, and in subject M we saw no change (Fig. 4F). Thus, we used the average success rate of licks, which was roughly 30% for both subjects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors derive qualitative predictions, by simulating their model with apparently arbitrary parameters. They then test these qualitative predictions with conventional statistics (e.g., t-tests of whether monkeys lick more for high vs low effort trials). The reader wonders why the authors chose this route, instead of formulating their model with flexible parameters and then fitting these to data. This would allow them (and future researchers) to test their model not just qualitatively but also quantitatively, and to compare the plausibility of different functional forms. The authors certainly have enough data and power to do this, given the vast number of sessions the monkey completed.</p></disp-quote><p>The model’s simplicity provides closed-form solutions across all parameter values, allowing one to make predictions without having to fit the model to the measured data. For example, for all parameter values that produce a real solution (as opposed to imaginary), the optimal number of saccade trials increases with the square root of the cost of licking. Thus, the basic prediction of the model is that to maximize the capture rate, an increase in the effort that it takes to harvest the reward should produce a greater willingness to work longer, caching more food. The closed-form solutions are presented in the Mathematica supplementary document.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effort manipulation chosen by the authors (distance of food tube) goes hand in hand with a greater need for precision since the monkey's tongue needs to hit an opening of similar size, but now located at a greater distance. This raises the question of whether the monkeys moved slower to enhance its chance of collecting the food (in line with a speed-accuracy trade off). The manuscript would benefit from an explicit test of this possibility, for example by reporting whether for each of the two conditions, the speed of tongue movements on a trial-by-trial basis predicts the probability of food collection? At the very least, the manuscript should explicitly discuss this issue and how it affects the certainty with which effects of tube distance can be linked to anticipated effort cost alone.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the excellent point. We looked for but found no consistent relationship, across subjects or effort conditions, between protraction speed of the tongue and the success probability of a lick (probability of insertion into the tube). Regardless, we agree with you that it is an excellent alternate hypothesis that reductions in lick vigor that accompanied increased distance of the tube may be due to a desire to maintain accuracy, and not a reflection of increased effort cost of reward. To incorporate this idea into the model, we would need a measure of speed-accuracy for the licks, something that we do not have but hope to develop in the future.</p><p>However, perhaps the most interesting aspect of our results is that when we increased tube distance, making reward more effortful, there was not only a reduction in lick vigor, but also a reduction in saccade vigor. That is, the decisions and actions during the work period responded to the increased effort cost of reward during the harvest period. These changes accompanied dilation of the pupil, both in the work period and in the harvest period. We now include a paragraph regarding this in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript measures pupil dilation in a time period ranging from -250ms before to 250 ms after saccade onset. However, the pupil changes strongly during saccade execution relative to the preceding baseline, leaving doubts as to whether the aggregated measure blurs several interesting and potentially different effects. It would be more conclusive if the manuscript could report the analyses of pupil size separately for a period prior to saccade onset and during/after the saccade.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal was to test for general correlations between the state of the pupil and both movement vigor and decisions. We chose a window of 500 ms around saccade onset, as referred to by the reviewer, as it allowed us a large enough time window to measure pupil size outside of the movement itself (~30 ms duration), to accurately capture the state of the animal around initiation and end of a saccade. Critically, pupil tracking during a saccade itself, when using infrared eye tracking techniques, can be prone to slight measurement error in certain cases due to tracking jitter. Thus, averaging across this window, following processing of the signal, results in a more accurate measure of pupil size.</p></body></sub-article></article>
