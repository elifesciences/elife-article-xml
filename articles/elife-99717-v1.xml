However, little is known about the underlying developmental processes. The central complex of the brain is an excellent model to understand neural development and divergence. It is produced in large parts by type II neuroblasts, which produce intermediate progenitors, another type of cycling precursor, to increase their neural progeny. Type II neuroblasts lineages are believed to be conserved among insects, but little is known on their molecular characteristics in insects other than flies. <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> has emerged as a model for brain development and evolution. However, type II neuroblasts have so far not been studied in this beetle. We created a fluorescent enhancer trap marking expression of <italic>Tc-fez/earmuff</italic>, a key marker for intermediate progenitors. Using combinatorial labeling of further markers, including <italic>Tc-pointed,</italic> we characterized embryonic type II neuroblast lineages. Intriguingly, we found nine lineages per hemisphere in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo while <italic>Drosophila</italic> produces only eight per brain hemisphere. These embryonic lineages are significantly larger in <italic>Tribolium</italic> than they are in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and contain more intermediate progenitors. Finally, we mapped these lineages to the domains of head patterning genes. Notably, <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is absent from all type II neuroblasts and intermediate progenitors, whereas <italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks an anterior subset of the type II lineages. <italic>Tc-six4</italic> specifically marks the territory where anterior-medial type II neuroblasts differentiate. In conclusion, we identified a conserved pattern of gene expression in holometabolan central complex forming type II neuroblast lineages, and conserved head patterning genes emerged as new candidates for conferring spatial identity to individual lineages. The higher number and greater lineage size of the embryonic type II neuroblasts in the beetle correlate with a previously described embryonic phase of central complex formation. These findings stipulate further research on the link between stem cell activity and temporal and structural differences in central complex development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic></kwd><kwd>insect brain development</kwd><kwd>neuroblasts</kwd><kwd>central complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Göttingen Promotionskolleg für Medizinstudierende</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jacob-Henle-Programm</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rethemeier</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic labeling and molecular analyses characterize the dynamics of embryonic central complex-forming type II neuroblast lineages in <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neural development of insects allows to study molecular and cellular principles in easy to manipulate invertebrate models. The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<italic>Drosophila</italic> hereafter) has mostly been used for this purpose, making it one of the best understood models for neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2014</xref>). However, it has remained a puzzle how the huge ecological diversity of insects and the divergent neural anatomies that are adapted to different niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farnworth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Couto et al., 2020</xref>) evolved. Furthermore, <italic>Drosophila</italic> may in many instances not be a good representation of insect development and some processes are derived in the fly lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hakeemi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klingler and Bucher, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tautz et al., 1994</xref>). For these reasons, the beetle <italic>Tribolium castaneum</italic> (<italic>Tribolium</italic> hereafter) has been introduced as an additional model for insect neural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posnien et al., 2023</xref>). <italic>Tribolium</italic> is a grain storage pest and all stages live in flour; hence, there is no major transition of habitat or lifestyle between the larval and adult stage as in flies. However, compared to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the larvae are more mobile through the use of walking legs, which allows them to navigate within or between food sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farnworth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klingler and Bucher, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>). In this beetle, many molecular genetic manipulation and labeling methods have been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilles et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Posnien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farnworth et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hunnekuhl et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, labeling of neural cell types in <italic>Tribolium</italic> has been facilitated by the advent of CRISPR-Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farnworth et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2019</xref>). Another factor that makes <italic>Tribolium</italic> an informative model for the understanding of insect brain development is the more conserved development of the head neuroectoderm facilitating the identification of specific neurogenic domains and allowing cross-species comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posnien et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Posnien et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>).</p><p>The insect central complex is an anterior, midline spanning neuropile and constitutes an important brain center for the processing of sensory input, coordination of movement, and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pfeiffer and Homberg, 2014</xref>). The highly conserved basic structure of the central complex, along with diverse specifications in response to ecological requirements among different insect species, makes this brain structure a very interesting model for evolutionary developmental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farnworth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Honkanen et al., 2019</xref>). Between the two insect models <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Tribolium,</italic> a temporal shift in the emergence of central complex neuropile was observed, with <italic>Tribolium</italic> developing a functional larval central complex during embryogenesis, whereas it develops only at the onset of adult life in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farnworth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Koniszewski et al., 2016</xref>). It is, however, not known how these temporal differences are established during development on a cellular and molecular level.</p><p>The entire insect central nervous system including the brain is produced by neural stem cells, the neuroblasts (NBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartenstein and Stollewerk, 2015</xref>). While there are evolutionary modifications in the relative position of trunk NBs and their gene expression profiles between fly and beetle, the core determinants specifying their role as neural progenitors are conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biffar and Stollewerk, 2014</xref>). NBs undergo repeated divisions producing rows of ganglion mother cells (GMCs), which divide one more time to produce neurons and/or glia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, top panel). This leads to neural cell lineages that include the NB itself and its progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doe and Skeath, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stollewerk, 2016</xref>). Several NBs of the anterior-most part of the neuroectoderm contribute to the central complex, which has been characterized as the most complex brain structure (apart from the optic lobe) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strausfeld, 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in the grasshopper <italic>Schistocerca gregaria,</italic> an NB subtype, the type II NBs, were found to prominently contribute to the formation of the central complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boyan et al., 2017</xref>). These specific NBs generate more offspring by producing another class of neural precursors, the intermediate progenitors (INPs), which also divide in a stem cell-like fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, lower panel). Type II NBs and INPs have attracted a lot of attention because intermediate, cycling progenitors have also been described in vertebrates, the radial glia cells, which produce a variety of cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malatesta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barry et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> brain tumors have been induced from type II NB lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Caussinus and Gonzalez, 2005</xref>), opening up the possibility of modeling tumorigenesis in an invertebrate brain, thus making these lineages one of the most intriguing stem cell models in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Homem and Knoblich, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Neuroblasts (NBs) of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system.</title><p>Type I NBs (top panel) and type II NBs (lower panel). Type I NBs undergo stem cell-like divisions, with each round producing a ganglion mother cell (GMC) that divides one more time to produce two neurons or glia cells. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, all type I NBs express <italic>dpn</italic> and <italic>ase,</italic> whereas GMCs express only <italic>ase</italic>. Type II NBs express <italic>dpn</italic> and <italic>pnt</italic> but not <italic>ase</italic>. They also undergo repeated divisions, with each round producing an intermediate progenitor cell (INP), which is also a proliferating progenitor and expresses <italic>ase</italic>. INPs undergo a maturation process during which <italic>pnt</italic> is still expressed initially, but not <italic>dpn</italic>. Mature INPs express <italic>dpn</italic>, <italic>ase,</italic> and <italic>fez/erm,</italic> whereas GMCs express <italic>ase</italic> and <italic>fez/erm</italic>. Type II NB lineages are only found in the anterior brain; they produce central complex neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Southall and Brand, 2009</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99717-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the developing insect brain, the number of neurons that is produced by each type II NB is significantly larger than the offspring of a type I NB. Medial <italic>Drosophila</italic> type II NBs produce an average of 450 neurons, whereas type I NBs of the brain only generate 100–200 neurons each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bello et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyan and Williams, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Izergina et al., 2009</xref>). This increased number of neural cells that are produced by individual type II lineages, along with the fact that NB lineages can produce different types of neurons, leads to the generation of extensive neural complexity within the anterior insect brain (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Southall and Brand, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Based on descriptions of large proliferative lineages in the grasshopper <italic>S. gregaria,</italic> a hemimetabolous insect distantly related to flies, it is widely believed that type II NBs and INPs are conserved within insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyan et al., 2010</xref>). However, a molecular characterization of such lineages that, on the one hand, will allow to test whether the cell type markers characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are more widely conserved, and, on the other hand, will facilitate an identification of subcell types, has not been performed in an insect other than <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Whereas it is widely believed that <italic>Tribolium</italic> does use type II NB in central complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farnworth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia-Perez et al., 2021</xref>), their presence has so far not been unequivocally shown and a thorough comparison of type II NB lineages and their subcell types between the fly and the beetle model has been lacking.</p><p>The characterization of type II NBs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has in large parts been based on a specific reporter line in which eGFP expression is driven by an <italic>earmuff (fez/erm</italic>) enhancer element and marks INP lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeiffer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weng et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Tribolium earmuff</italic> has been first described as <italic>Tc-fez</italic>, referring to the vertebrate <italic>earmuff</italic> ortholog <italic>fez</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>). We will use <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> in the following. A defined sequence of gene expression has been described in <italic>Drosophila</italic> type II NBs, INPs and GMCs. The ETS-transcription factor <italic>pointed</italic> (<italic>pnt</italic>) marks type II NBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>), which do not express the type I NB marker <italic>asense</italic> (<italic>ase</italic>) but the neural gene deadpan (<italic>dpn</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). INPs express <italic>fez/erm</italic> and <italic>ase</italic> and at a more mature stage also <italic>dpn</italic>, whereas <italic>prospero</italic> (<italic>pros</italic>) marks mature INPs and GMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bayraktar et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>Six4</italic> is another marker for <italic>Drosophila</italic> type II NBs and INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we characterize type II NBs in <italic>Tribolium</italic> with respect to their number, their location, and the conservation of the molecular markers known from <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We also wanted to test in how far the earlier emergence of the central complex in beetles would be reflected by a change of division activity of type II NBs or INPs. To that end, we used CRISPR-Cas9-induced genome editing for creating a <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> enhancer trap line to characterize embryonic <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells, including INPs and GMCs of type II NB lineages, and combined this line with other labeling methods, including multicolor <italic>hybridization chain reaction</italic> (HCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Choi et al., 2010</xref>). We found that the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo produces nine <italic>Tc-pnt</italic>-expressing type II NBs compared to only eight type II NB lineages in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez and Díaz-Benjumea, 2018</xref>). We show that these lineages produce central complex cells and confirm a largely conserved molecular code that differentiates INPs of distinct maturation stages and GMCs. Intriguingly, we found that lineage sizes in <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryos are considerably larger and include more mature INPs than in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez and Díaz-Benjumea, 2018</xref>). We also show that the placodal marker gene <italic>Tc-six4</italic> characterizes the embryonic tissue that gives rise to the larger anterior group of type II NBs, whereas <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is marking only an anterior subset of these lineages. Interestingly, there is a part of the central complex precursors expressing neither <italic>Tc-six3</italic> nor <italic>Tc-otd,</italic> which is absent from all type II NB lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A CRISPR-Cas9-NHEJ-generated enhancer trap lines marks <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic>-expressing cells at the embryonic and larval stages</title><p>We created an enhancer trap line driving eGFP that reflects <italic>Tc-fez/erm</italic> gene expression in the embryo.

Our finding of an additional type II NB lineage at the embryonic stage shows that the number of type II NBs is not fixed across insects and suggests that evolutionary divergence in brain development between species may be driven by differences in the number of progenitor lineages. To test this, further research is required to determine where the additional lineage in <italic>Tribolium</italic> is located and if it is associated with morphological differences of the brain.</p><p>Although in the frame of this work we did not perform lineage tracing, we can speculate about which NB might be lacking in fly embryos based on our data. In the hemimetabolan <italic>Schistocerca,</italic> there is no obvious clustering of type II NBs, and they are all arranged in one row at the medial rim of the head lobes. In <italic>Tribolium,</italic> we have observed an arrangement of the type II NBs into two groups per side, one large anterior-medial group containing seven type II NB clusters and one posterior group of two type II NBs. The anterior six of the anterior-medial group are arranged in one row like in the grasshopper. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> there are three described groups referred to as the anterior, the middle, and the posterior clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>). The posterior cluster consists of two type II NBs and therefore most likely corresponds to the posterior two type II NBs in <italic>Tribolium</italic>. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> middle and anterior clusters are most likely equivalent to the anterior-medial group of <italic>Tribolium</italic>. However, the type II NB 7, which we assigned to the anterior-medial group, but which is a bit separated and produces offspring into the opposite direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-II</xref>, white arrow) might be the one that does not have a homologue in the fly embryo. The identification of more specific spatial markers for type II NBs (in addition to <italic>Tc-six3</italic> and <italic>Tc-six4</italic>) or lineage-tracing tools are required to identify the NB, which is not present in fly embryos. Subsequently, it would be especially interesting to see what the role of the additional type II NBs in the beetle is and which neuropile it contributes to.</p><p>In summary, there is a tendency toward grouping of type II NBs into subsets in the holometabolan models that was not observed in the only hemimetabolan studied so far.

In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> both these factors have key functions in defining the developmental potential of type II NBs and INPs: Pnt suppresses Ase in type II NBs and promotes the formation of INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>).

Hence, there must be signals that make them different despite the conserved and well-studied sequence of neural gene expression and functional interactions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayraktar and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xie et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In the ventral nerve cord, the different identities of the NBs are specified by the combination of spatial patterning genes expressed in the neuroectoderm at the time of delamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stollewerk, 2016</xref>). However, little is known about these signals for type II NBs. In <italic>Tribolium,</italic> the domains of head patterning genes in the brain neuroectoderm are well characterized and some highly conserved territories like the anterior-medial <italic>six3</italic>-positive domain were described and suggested to give respective NBs different spatial identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posnien et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>). The <italic>Tc-six4</italic> expression domain is also largely coincident with an embryonic structure termed insect head placode, a neurogenic, invaginating tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Posnien et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Velasco et al., 2007</xref>) potentially homologous to the vertebrate adenohypophyseal placode, which is also marked by <italic>six4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posnien et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Posnien et al., 2011a</xref>). A placodal origin of <italic>Drosophila</italic> type II NBs has been shown for one type II NB, and it is assumed that the other type II NBs also stem from placodal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Walsh and Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez and Díaz-Benjumea, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hwang and Rulifson, 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>Tc-six4</italic> is also a very interesting factor with regards to the specification of type II NBs because it is expressed only in the anterior group of type II NBs. Hence, it could contribute to distinguishing their developmental fate from the posterior group. This is however different in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. Here, Six4 is expressed in all eight lineages where it prevents the formation of supernumerary type II NBs and a premature differentiation of INPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). In the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo Six4 may have a similar rate-limiting role within the anterior group of type II NBs. However, its early expression in a small part of the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Posnien et al., 2011a</xref>) and the delamination of the anterior-medial type II NB group within this domain also hints at an instructive role of <italic>Tc-six4</italic> in the formation of the anterior-medial group.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title><italic>Tc-six3</italic> marks a subset of type II NBs, whereas <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is absent from all lineages</title><p>Importantly, we found that in <italic>Tribolium</italic> late embryogenesis, <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is expressed specifically within the lineages of type II NBs 1–4 of the anterior-medial group, but not in the other lineages. In grasshopper and fly, these anterior 4 lineages (DM1-4) give rise to the z, y, x, and w tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boyan and Williams, 2011</xref>) and contribute crucially to the development of protocerebral bridge and central body. These tracts form a major midline crossing neuropile of the central body, which serves as a scaffold in the development of this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farnworth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyan and Reichert, 2011</xref>). We conclude that in <italic>Tribolium</italic> the evolutionary ancient <italic>six3</italic> territory gives rise to the neuropile of the z, y, x, and w tracts. This might well be the same in other insects such as flies and grasshoppers but has to our knowledge not been looked at in detail in these models. In the beetle, the central body is also missing in weak <italic>Tribolium Tc-six3</italic>-RNAi phenotypes, suggesting that <italic>Tribolium six3</italic> is required for the formation of this structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Posnien et al., 2011b</xref>). Given that central complex neuropile is marked by additional factors such as <italic>Tc-</italic>foxQ2 (<italic>Drosophila</italic> fd102c; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lee and Frasch, 2004</xref>) and <italic>Tc-rx</italic>- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Farnworth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">He et al., 2019</xref>), it would be interesting to see the relationship of additional spatial patterning genes with regards to the type II NB lineages in future studies.</p><p>The gene <italic>otd</italic> is a marker of the posterior protocerebrum, and <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>otd</italic> are believed to subdivide the embryonic anterior brain into two major domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>). This subdivision is also part of the recently revisited concept of an ancestral division of the insect protocerebrum into archicerebrum (<italic>six3</italic>-positive) and prosocerebrum (<italic>otd</italic>-positive) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posnien et al., 2023</xref>). As discussed above, <italic>Tc-six3</italic> is expressed in the anterior-most four type II NB lineages, but unexpectedly, we found that <italic>Tc-otd</italic> is specifically absent from all type II NB lineages, suggesting that its inhibition is required for the development of all these lineages. Interestingly, the lineages of type II NB 5 and 6 (and presumably of type II NB 7) of the anterior cluster and the posterior type II NB lineages do neither express <italic>Tc-otd</italic> nor <italic>Tc-six3,</italic> showing that there are protocerebral structures expressing none of these conserved markers in development, questioning the assigned generalized role of these two factors in subdividing the protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posnien et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Steinmetz et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings are just the beginning of the quest for the genes required for the identity specification of type II NB lineages. The genes known to be involved in head patterning are an excellent starting point for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Posnien et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

Although the molecular mechanism of insect neural development has been mainly studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the beetle, Tribolium castaneum has been introduced as another model to understand the differences and similarities in the process of insect neural development. In this manuscript, the authors focused on the origin of the central complex. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, type II neuroblasts have been known as the origin of the central complex. Then, the authors tried to identify those cells in the beetle brain. They established a Tribolium fez enhancer trap line to visualize putative type II neuroblasts and successfully identified 9 of those cells. In addition, they also examined expression patterns of several genes that are known to be expressed in the type II neuroblasts or their lineage in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They concluded that the putative type II neuroblasts they identified were type II neuroblasts because those cells showed characteristics of type II neuroblasts in terms of genetic codes, cell diameter, and cell lineage.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors established a useful enhancer trap line to visualize type II neuroblasts in Tribolium embryos. Using this tool, they have identified that there are 9 type II neuroblasts in the brain hemisphere during embryonic development. Since the enhancer trap line also visualized the lineage of those cells, the authors found that the lineage size of the type II neuroblasts in the beetle is larger than that in the fly. They also showed that several genetic markers are also expressed in the type II neuroblasts and their lineages as observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The revisions have improved the manuscript greatly. However, I still have some concerns about the lack of examination of the expression of NB markers.

The lineages are called type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages and assumed to be conserved in insects. While Tribolium castaneum produces a functional larval Cx that only consists of one part of the adult Cx structure, the fan-shaped body, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> a non-functional neuropile primordium is formed by neurons produced by the embryonic type-II NBs which then enter a dormant state and continue development in late larval and pupal stages.</p><p>The authors present a meticulous study demonstrating that type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages are indeed present in the developing brain of Tribolium castaneum. In contrast to type-I NB lineages, type-II NBs produce additional intermediate progenitors. The authors generate a fluorescent enhancer trap line called fez/earmuff which prominently labels the mushroom bodies but also the intermediate progenitors (INPs) of the type-II NB lineages. This is convincingly demonstrated by high resolution images that show cellular staining next to large pointed labelled cells, a marker for type-II NBs in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Using these and other markers (e.g. deadpan, asense), the authors show that the cell type composition and embryonic development of the type-II NB lineages are similar to their counterparts in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Furthermore, the expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NB lineage markers six3 and six4 in subsets of the Tribolium type-II NB lineages (anterior 1-4 and 1-6 type-II NB lineages) and the expression of the Cx marker skh in the distal part of most of the lineages provide further evidence that the identified NB lineages are equivalent to the Drosophila lineages that establish the central complex. However, in contrast to Drosophila, there are 9 instead of 8 embryonic type-II NB lineages per brain hemisphere and the lineages contain more progenitor cells compared to the Drosophila lineages. The authors argue that the higher number of dividing progenitor cells supports the earlier development of a functional Cx in Tribolium.</p><p>While the manuscript clearly shows that type-II NB lineages similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> exist in Tribolium, it does not establish a direct link between the characteristics of these lineages and a functional larval Cx in Tribolium, i.e., it does not identify the cause of the heterochronic development of the Cx in these insects. However, the detailed study lays the foundation for lineage tracing and gene function experiments that will elucidate if the higher number of Tribolium type-II NB lineage progenitors, the additional lineage and the timing of developmental progression of the progenitors can indeed be linked with the earlier function of the Cx and/or if other components are required for establishing the functional larval neural circuits in Tribolium such as e.g. larval born neurons as is the case in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99717.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Rethemeier et al capitalize on their previous observation that the beetle central complex develops heterochronically compared to the fly and try to identify the developmental origin of this difference. For this reason, they use a fez enhancer trap line that they generated to study the neuronal stem cells (INPs) that give rise to the central complex. Using this line and staining against <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II neuroblast markers, they elegantly dissect the number of developmental progression of the beetle type II neuroblasts.

The reviewers expressed hesitations on our interpretation that the observed quantitative differences of embryonic lineages can directly be linked to the embryonic development of the central complex in Tribolium. While we still believe that a connection of both observations is a valid and likely hypothesis, we acknowledge that due the lack of functional experiments and lineage tracing a causal link has not directly been shown. We have therefore changed the manuscript to an even more careful wording that on one hand describes the correlation between increased embryonic proliferation with the earlier development of the Cx but on the other hand also stresses the need for additional functional and lineage tracing experiments to test this hypothesis. We have also strengthened the discussion on alternative explanations of the increased lineage size and emphasize the less disputed elements like presence and conservation of type-II NB lineages.</p><p>While our manuscript could in conclusion not directly show that the reason of the heterochronic shift lies in the progenitor behaviour, we still provide a first approach to answering the question of the developmental basis of this shift and testable hypotheses directly emerge from our work. We agree with reviewer#1 that functional work is best suited to test our hypothesis and we are planning to do so. However, we believe that the presented work is already rich in novel data and significantly advances our understanding on the conservation and divergence of type-II NBs in insects. We would also like to stress that most transgenic tools for which genome-wide collections exist for <italic>Drosophila</italic> have to be created for <italic>Tribolium</italic> and doing so can be quite time consuming. Conducting RNAi experiments is certainly possible in Tribolium but observing phenotypes in this defined cellular context will need laborious optimization. We have for example tried knocking down Tc-fez/erm but could not see any embryonic phenotype which might be due to an escaper effect in which only mildly affected or wild type-like embryos survive while the others die in early embryogenesis. Due to pleiotropic functions of the involved genes a cell-specific knockdown might be necessary and we are working towards establishing a system to do that in the red flour beetle. For the stated reasons, we see our work as an important basis to inspire future functional studies that build up on the framework that we introduced.</p><p>In response to these common points, we have made the following changes to the manuscript</p><p>- The title has been changed from ‘being associated’ to ‘correlate’</p><p>- The conclusions part of the abstract has been changed</p><p>- We deleted the statement ‘…thus providing the material for the early central complex formation…’</p><p>- Rephrased to saying that the two observations just correlate</p><p>- The part of the discussion ‘Divergent timing of type-II NB activity and heterochronic development of the central complex’ has been extensively rewritten and now discusses several alternative explanations that were suggested by the reviewers. It also stresses the need for further functional work and lineage tracing (line 859-862 (608-611)).</p><p>In addition, we have made numerous changes to the manuscript to account for more specific comments of the reviewers and to the recommendations for the authors.</p><p>Our responses to the individual comments can be found in the following.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Insects inhabit diverse environments and have neuroanatomical structures appropriate to each habitat. Although the molecular mechanism of insect neural development has been mainly studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the beetle, Tribolium castaneum has been introduced as another model to understand the differences and similarities in the process of insect neural development. In this manuscript, the authors focused on the origin of the central complex. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, type II neuroblasts have been known as the origin of the central complex. Then, the authors tried to identify those cells in the beetle brain. They established a Tribolium fez enhancer trap line to visualize putative type II neuroblasts and successfully identified 9 of those cells. In addition, they also examined expression patterns of several genes that are known to be expressed in the type II neuroblasts or their lineage in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They concluded that the putative type II neuroblasts they identified were type II neuroblasts because those cells showed characteristics of type II neuroblasts in terms of genetic codes, cell diameter, and cell lineage.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors established a useful enhancer trap line to visualize type II neuroblasts in Tribolium embryos. Using this tool, they have identified that there are 9 type II neuroblasts in the brain hemisphere during embryonic development. Since the enhancer trap line also visualized the lineage of those cells, the authors found that the lineage size of the type II neuroblasts in the beetle is larger than that in the fly. They also showed that several genetic markers are also expressed in the type II neuroblasts and their lineages as observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I recommend the authors reconstruct the manuscript because several parts of the present version are not logical. For example, the author should first examine the expression of dpn, a well-known marker of neuroblast. Without examining the expression of at least one neuroblast marker, no one can say confidently that it is a neuroblast. The purpose of this study is to understand what makes neuroanatomical differences between insects which is appropriate to their habitats. To obtain clues to the question, I think, functional analyses are necessary as well as descriptive analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The expression of an exclusive type-II neuroblast marker would indeed have been the most convincing evidence. However, <italic>asense</italic> is absent from type-II NBs and <italic>deadpan</italic> is not specific enough as it is expressed in many other cells of the developing protocerebrum. The gene <italic>pointed</italic>, although also expressed elsewhere, emerged as the the most specific marker. Therefore, we start with <italic>pointed</italic> and fez/erm to describe the first appearance and developmental progression of the cells and then add further evidence that these cells are indeed type-II neuroblasts. Further evidence is provided in the following chapters. We have discussed the need for functional work in the general response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors address the question of differences in the development of the central complex (Cx), a brain structure mainly controlling spatial orientation and locomotion in insects, which can be traced back to the neuroblast lineages that produce the Cx structure. The lineages are called type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages and are assumed to be conserved in insects. While Tribolium castaneum produces a functional larval Cx that only consists of one part of the adult Cx structure, the fan-shaped body, in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> a non-functional neuropile primordium is formed by neurons produced by the embryonic type-II NBs which then enter a dormant state and continue development in late larval and pupal stages.</p><p>The authors present a meticulous study demonstrating that type-II neuroblast (NB) lineages are indeed present in the developing brain of Tribolium castaneum. In contrast to type-I NB lineages, type-II NBs produce additional intermediate progenitors. The authors generate a fluorescent enhancer trap line called fez/earmuff which prominently labels the mushroom bodies but also the intermediate progenitors (INPs) of the type-II NB lineages. This is convincingly demonstrated by high-resolution images that show cellular staining next to large pointed labelled cells, a marker for type-II NBs in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Using these and other markers (e.g. deadpan, asense), the authors show that the cell type composition and embryonic development of the type-II NB lineages are similar to their counterparts in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Furthermore, the expression of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NB lineage markers six3 and six4 in subsets of the Tribolium type-II NB lineages (anterior 1-4 and 1-6 type-II NB lineages) and the expression of the Cx marker skh in the distal part of most of the lineages provide further evidence that the identified NB lineages are equivalent to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineages that establish the central complex. However, in contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are 9 instead of 8 embryonic type-II NB lineages per brain hemisphere and the lineages contain more progenitor cells compared to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineages. The authors argue that the higher number of dividing progenitor cells supports the earlier development of a functional Cx in Tribolium.</p><p>While the manuscript clearly shows that type-II NB lineages similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> exist in Tribolium, it does not considerably advance our understanding of the heterochronic development of the Cx in these insects. First of all, the contribution of these lineages to a functional larval Cx is not clear. For example, how do the described type-II NB lineages relate to the DM1-4 lineages that produce the columnar neurons of the Cx? What is the evidence that the embryonically produced type-II NB lineage neurons contribute to a functional larval Cx? The formation of functional circuits could rely on larval neurons (like in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) which would make a comparison of embryonic lineages less informative with respect to understanding the underlying variations of the developmental processes. Furthermore, the higher number of progenitors (and consequently neurons) in Tribolium could simply reflect the demand for a higher number of cells required to build the fan-shaped body compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In addition, the larger lineages in Tribolium, including the higher number of INPs could be due to a greater number of NBs within the individual clusters, rather than a higher rate of proliferation of individual neuroblasts, as suggested. What is the evidence that there is only one NB per cluster? The presented schemes (Fig. 7/12) and description of the marker gene expression and classification of progenitor cells are inconsistent but indicate that NBs and immature INPs cannot be consistently distinguished.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for pointing out the inconsistency in our classification of cells within the lineages as one central part of our manuscript. These were due to a confusion in the used terms (young vs. immature). We have corrected this mistake and have changed the naming of the INP subtypes to immature-I and immature-II. We are confident that based on the analysed markers, type-II NBs and immature INPs can actually be distinguished with confidence.</p><p>We agree that a functional link of increased proliferation to heterochronic CX development is not shown although we consider it to be likely. As stated in the general response we have changed the manuscript to saying that the two observations (higher number of progenitors and larger lineages/more INPs) correlate but that a causal link can only be hypothesized for the time being. At the same time, we have strengthened the discussion on alternative explanations.</p><p>We would like to remain with our statement of an increased number of embryonic progeny of <italic>Tribolium</italic> type-II NBs. We counted the total number of progenitor cells emerging from the anterior median cluster and divided this by the number of type II NBs in that cluster. Hence, the shown increased number of cells represents an average per NB but is not influenced by the increased number of NBs. On the same line, we have never seen indication for the presence of additional NBs within any cluster while one type-II NB is what we regularly found. Hence, we are confident that we know the number of respective NBs. The fact that the fly data included also neurons and was counted at a later stage indicates that the observed differences are actually minimum estimates.</p><p>We have discussed that based on the position and comparison to the grasshopper we believe that Tribolium type-II NB 1-4 contribute to the x, y, z and w tracts. To confirm this, lineage tracing experiments would be necessary, for which tools remain to be developed.</p><p>We agree that the role of larvally born neurons and the fate of Tribolium neuroblasts through the transition from embryo to larva and pupa need to be further studied.</p><p>Available data suggests that the adult fan shaped body in Tribolium does not hugely differ in size from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart, although no data in terms of cell number is available. In the larva, however, no fan shaped body or protocerebral bridge can be distinguished in flies while in beetle larvae, these structures are clearly developed. Hence, we think that it is more likely that differences observed in the embryo reflect differences in the larval central complex. We discuss the need for further investigation of larval stages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main difference between Tribolium and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cx development with regards to the larval functionality might be that <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NB lineage-derived neurons undergo quiescence at the end of embryogenesis so that the development of the Cx is halted, while a developmental arrest does not occur in Tribolium. However, this needs to be confirmed (as the authors rightly observe).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, there is evidence that cells contributing to the CX go into quiescence in flies – hence, this certainly is one of the mechanisms. However, based on our data we would suggest that in addition, the balance of embryonic versus larval proliferation of type-II lineages is different between the two insects: The increased embryonic proliferation and development leads to a functional larval CX in beetles while in flies, postembryonic proliferation may be increased in order to catch up.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Rethemeier et al capitalize on their previous observation that the beetle central complex develops heterochronically compared to the fly and try to identify the developmental origin of this difference. For this reason, they use a fez enhancer trap line that they generated to study the neuronal stem cells (INPs) that give rise to the central complex. Using this line and staining against <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II neuroblast markers, they elegantly dissect the number of developmental progression of the beetle type II neuroblasts. They show that the NBs, INPs, and GMCs have a conserved marker progression by comparing to <italic>Drosophila</italic> marker genes, although the expression of some of the lineage markers (otd, six3, and six4) is slightly different. Finally, they show that the beetle type II neuroblast lineages are likely longer than the equivalent ones in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and argue that this might be the underlying reason for the observed heterochrony.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- A very interesting study system that compares a conserved structure that, however, develops in a heterochronic manner.</p><p>- Identification of a conserved molecular signature of type-II neuroblasts between beetles and flies.

How do the authors know when to compare the sizes of the lineages between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Tribolium? Moreover, the fact that the authors recover more INPs and GMCs could also mean that the progenitors divide more slowly and, therefore, there is an accumulation of progenitors who have not undergone their programmed number of divisions.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the difficulty of comparing stages between species, but we feel that our analysis is on the save side. At stages comparable with respect to overall embryonic development (retracting or retracted germband), the fly numbers are clearly smaller. To account for potential heterochronic shifts in NB activity, we have selected the stages to compare based on the criteria given: In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the number of INPs goes down after stage 16, meaning that they reach a peak at the selected stages. In Tribolium the chosen stages also reflect the phase when lineage size is larger than in all previous stages. Therefore, we believe that the conclusion that Tribolium has larger lineages and more INPs is well founded. Lineage size in Tribolium might further increase just before hatching (stage 15) but we were for technical reasons not able to look at this. As lineage size goes down in the last stage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis the number of INPs goes down and type-II NB enter quiescence, we think it is highly unlikely that the ratio between Tribolium and <italic>Drosophila</italic> INPs reverses at this stage, but a study of the behaviour of type-II NB in Tribolium and whether there is a stage of quiescence is still needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The main conclusion that the earlier central complex development in beetles is due to the enhanced activity of the neuroblasts is very handwavy and is not the only possible conclusion from their data.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the general response we have made several changes to the manuscript to account for this criticism and discuss alternative explanations for the observations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The argument for conserved patterns of gene expression between Tribolium and <italic>Drosophila</italic> type-II NBs, INPs, and GMCs is a bit circular, as the authors use <italic>Drosophila</italic> markers to identify the Tribolium cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested the hypothesis that in <italic>Tribolium</italic> there are type-II NBs with a molecular signature similar to flies. Our results are in line with that hypothesis. If <italic>pointed</italic> had not clearly marked cells with NB-morphology or <italic>fez/erm</italic> had not marked dividing cells adjacent to these NBs, we would have concluded that no such cells/lineages exist in the <italic>Tribolium</italic> embryo, or that central complex producing lineages exist but express different markers. Therefore, we regard this a valid scientific approach and hence find this argument not problematic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An appraisal of whether the authors achieved their aims, and whether the results support their conclusions: Based on the above, I believe that the authors, despite advancing significantly, fall short of identifying the reasons for the divergent timing of central complex development between beetle and fly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that based on the available data, we cannot firmly make that link and we have changed the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In addition to these descriptive analyses, functional analyses can be included. RNAi is highly effective in this beetle.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that functional analyses of some of the studied genes and possible effects of gene knockdowns on the studied cell lineages and on central complex development could be highly informative. However, when studying specific cell types or organs these experiments are less straight forward than it may seem as knockdowns often lead to pleiotropic effects, sterility or lethality. All the genes involved are expressed in additional cells and may have essential functions there. Given the systemic RNAi of <italic>Tribolium</italic>, it is challenging to unequivocally assign phenotypes to one of the cell groups. Overcoming these challenges is often possible but needs extensive optimization. Our study, though descriptive is already rich in data and is the first description of NB-II lineages in Tribolium central complex development. We see it as a basis for future studies on central complex development that will include functional experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Introduction</p><p>For these reasons the beetle...</p><p>Could you explain the differences in the habitats between Tribolium and <italic>Drosophila</italic>? or What is the biggest difference between these two species at the ecological aspect?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a short characterisation of the main differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The insect central complex is an anterior...</p><p>The author should explain why they focus on the structure.</p></disp-quote><p>Added</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is however not known how these temporal...</p><p>If the authors want to get the answer to the question, they need to conduct functional analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the importance of functional work (see above) we believe that detailed descriptions under the inclusion of molecular markers as presented here is very informative by itself for understanding developmental processes and sets the foundation for the analysis of mutant/RNAi- phenotypes in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CX - Central complex?</p></disp-quote><p>We have opted to not use this abbreviation anymore for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“because intermediate cycling progenitors have also been...”</p><p>Is the sentence correct?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included ‘INPs’ in the sentence to make clear what the comparison refers to and added a comma</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“However, molecular characterization of such lineage in another...”</p><p>The authors should explain why molecular characterization is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done so</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Results</p><p>a) Figure 8.

To corroborate our argument that the cells are neuroblasts we have used several criteria:</p><p>- We have used the same markers that are used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to label type-II NBs (pnt, dpn, six4). We are not aware of any other marker that would be more specific.</p><p>- We have shown that these cells are larger and have larger nuclei than neighbouring cells and they are dividing</p><p>- We have shown that these cells through their INP lineages give rise to central complex neuropile</p><p>We believe that these features taken together leave little doubt that the described cells are indeed neuroblasts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“We found that the cells they had assigned as...”</p><p>How did the authors distinguish that they are really neuroblasts?</p></disp-quote><p>We see the difficulty that we first describe the position and development of these cells (e.g. fig 3) and then add further evidence (cell size, additional marker dpn) that these are neuroblasts (also see above). However, without previous knowledge on position (and on pnt expression as the most specific marker) the type-II NB could not have been distinguished from other NBs based on cell size or expression of other markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Conserved patterns of gene expression...”</p><p>This must be the first (especially dpn).</p></disp-quote><p>Dpn is not specific to type-II NB because it is also expressed in type-1 NBs, mature INPs and possibly other neural cells. It is therefore impossible to identify type-II NBs based on this gene alone. We therefore first used the most specific marker, pnt, in addition to adjacent fez expression to identify candidates for type-II lineages. Then we mapped expression of further genes on these lineages to support the interpretation (and show homology to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineages). Although of course the structure of a paper does not necessarily have to reflect the sequence in which experiments were done we would find putting dpn expression first misleading as it would not be clear why exactly a certain part of the expression should belong to type-II NB. Also, our pnt-fez expression data shows the position of the NB-II in the context of the whole head lobe whereas the other gene expressions are higher magnifications focussing on details. We therefore believe that the structure we chose best fits our data and the other reviewers seemed to find it acceptable as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“As type-II NBs contribute to central...”</p><p>Before the sentence, the author could explain differences in the central complex structure between Tribolium and <italic>Drosophila</italic> in terms of cell number and tissue size.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added references on the comparisons of tissue sizes, but unfortunately there is no Tribolium data that can be directly compared to available <italic>Drosophila</italic> resources in terms of cell number.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“We conclude that the embryonic development of...”</p><p>How did the authors conclude?

Position? This needs to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that ‘youngest pnt-positive cells’ refers to the position of these cells close to the type-II NB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Therefore these neural markers can be used for a classification of type II NBs (Tc-pnt+, Tcase-), young INPs (Tc-pnt+, Tc-fez/erm-, Tc-ase-), immature INPs (Tc-pnt+, Tcfez/erm+, Tcase+), mature INPs (Tc-dpn+, Tc-ase+, Tc-fez/erm+, Tc-pros+), and GMCs (Tc-ase+, Tcfez/ erm+, Tc-pros+, Tc-dpn). This classification is summarized in Fig. 7 A-B.&quot;</p><p>This is not the best classification and not in line with the schemes in Figure 7 - the young INPs are also immature. What is the difference? It needs to be explained what &quot;mature&quot; means (dividing?).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have corrected the error in this part that confused the two original groups (young and immature). To take the immaturity of both types of INPs into account we have then also changed our naming of INP subtypes into immature-I and immature-II and throughout the manuscript. Figure 7 and figure 12 were also changed accordingly. While our classification if primarily based on gene expression the available data indicates that both types of immature INPs are not dividing, whereas mature INPs are. We have added a statement on that to this part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;In beetles a single-unit functional central complex develops during embryogenesis while in flies the structure is postembryonic.&quot;</p><p>This statement is vague - the authors need to explain what is meant by &quot;single-unit&quot;.

Owing to the highly conserved nature of an anterior median six3 domain in arthropods and bilaterian animals in general, we would expect it to be expressed anterior-medially in grasshoppers as well. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> the gene is expressed in the anterior-medial embryonic region where the type-II NBs are expected to develop, but to our knowledge it has not been specifically studied which type-II NB lineages are located within this domain. We have clarified in our text that we do not claim that the origin of anterior-medial type-II NB 1-4 and the X,Y, Z and W lineages from the six3 territory is highly conserved but only the territory itself. As far as we know our work is the first to analyse the relationship of type-II lineages and the conserved head patterning genes <italic>six3</italic> and <italic>otd</italic>.

The authors compare the largest cell of a cluster of cells with a number of random cells from the same brain. It is obvious that the largest cell of a cluster will be larger than the average cell of the same brain. A better control would be to compare the largest cell of the pnt+ cluster with the largest cell of a random sample of cells, although this also comes with biases. Personally, I have no doubt that the authors are looking at neuroblasts, based on the markers they are using, so I would recommend completely eliminating Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we produced a somewhat biased and expected result when we select the largest cell of a cluster for size comparison. However, we found it important to show based on a larger sample that these cells are also statistically larger than the average cell of a brain, which we think our assessment shows. We do not claim that type-II NBs are the largest cells of a brain, or that they are larger than type-I NBs, therefore in a random sample there might be cells that are equally big (see also distribution of the control sample shown in figure 4, and we have added a note on this to the text). We are happy to hear that this reviewer has no doubts we are looking at neural stem cells. However, reviewer#1 did express some hesitations and therefore we think it is important to keep the information on cell size as part of our argument that we are indeed looking at type-II NBs (gene expression, cell size, dividing, part of a neural lineage).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The comparison of NB, INP, and GMC numbers between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Trbolium (section &quot;The Tribolium embryonic lineages of type-II NBs are larger and contain more mature INPs than those of <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot;) compares an experiment that the authors did with published data. I would suggest that the authors repeat the <italic>Drosophila</italic> stainings and compare themselves to avoid cases of batch effects, inconsistent counting, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>None of the authors is a <italic>Drosophila</italic> expert or has any experience at working with this model and reassessing the lineage size would require a number of combinatorial staining. Therefore, we feel that using the published data produced by experts and which also includes repeat experiments is for us the more reliable approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) In Figure 10, there are some otd+ GFP+ cells laterally.
