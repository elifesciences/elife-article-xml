fetal development may lead to epigenomic modifications in fetal germ cells, altering gene expression and promoting diseases in successive generations. In mouse, maternal exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is known to induce defects in spermatogenesis in successive generations, but the mechanism(s) of impaired spermatogenesis are unclear. Here, we showed that maternal DEHP exposure results in DNA hypermethylation of promoters of spermatogenesis-related genes in fetal testicular germ cells in F1 mice, and hypermethylation of <italic>Hist1h2ba</italic>, <italic>Sycp1,</italic> and <italic>Taf7l</italic>, which are crucial for spermatogenesis, persisted from fetal testicular cells to adult spermatogonia, resulting in the downregulation of expression of these genes. Forced methylation of these gene promoters silenced expression of these loci in a reporter assay. These results suggested that maternal DEHP exposure-induced hypermethylation of <italic>Hist1h2ba</italic>, <italic>Sycp1,</italic> and <italic>Taf7l</italic> results in downregulation of these genes in spermatogonia and subsequent defects in spermatogenesis, at least in the F1 generation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18J40019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tando</surname><given-names>Yukiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H03231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsui</surname><given-names>Yasuhisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#JP17gm0510017h</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matsui</surname><given-names>Yasuhisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gene analyses reveal the abnormal DNA methylation and expression of the genes essential for spermatogenesis as a cause of spermatogenic defects in offspring induced by maternal exposure of a chemical.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A wide variety of environmental influences have been shown to greatly impact human health, with the effects persisting through multiple generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Daxinger and Whitelaw, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taouk and Schulkin, 2016</xref>). Historically, studies on the Dutch famine of 1944 indicated that poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy was associated with low birth weight as well as a greater risk of metabolic and cardiovascular diseases in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Painter et al., 2005</xref>). Those studies also showed that maternal nutritional conditions resulted in changes in offspring in DNA methylation patterns in the promoters of genes related to metabolic diseases and cardiac diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tobi et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting the involvement of epigenetic modifications in germ cells in inter-/trans-generational influences of the maternal environment. In a rodent model, a maternal nutritional change induced increased DNA methylation of CpG sites in the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele and inhibition of expression of the corresponding gene, which in turn may result in changes in the hair color of offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Waterland and Jirtle, 2003</xref>).</p><p>With regard to paternal influences, various environmental factors also affect traits of offspring in human as well as rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pembrey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ng et al., 2010</xref>). For instance, studies of paternal inflammatory, nutritional and aging modifications suggested that the environmentally induced epigenetic alterations in sperm can be inherited by the next generation in rodents. Specifically, chemically induced liver damage has been shown to influence paternally inherited suppressive adaptation for liver fibrosis in F1 and F2 generations; these effects are mediated by epigenetic changes in sperm, and up- and downregulation of anti- and pro-fibrogenic genes, respectively, in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zeybel et al., 2012</xref>). Concerning nutritional influences, paternal prediabetes has been shown to alter DNA methylation of sperm genes encoding components of the insulin signaling pathway, leading to glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in the offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2014</xref>). Another example is that offspring of males fed a low-protein diet (LPD) exhibit upregulation of genes involved in lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis and decreased levels of cholesterol esters in the liver; these offspring also exhibit changes in the DNA methylation of genes involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carone et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, LPD-induced epigenetic changes (such as histone H3 lysine [K] 9 methylation levels and small RNA expression) in testicular germ cells have been shown to be mediated by cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 7 (ATF7), with resulting effects on gene expression in offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshida et al., 2020</xref>). Aging also results in DNA methylation changes of specific genes including neuronal development-related genes in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoshizaki et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As in mammals, transgenerational inheritance of the effects of environmental factors via epigenetic modifications has been demonstrated in model organisms such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Heat shock or osmotic stress in adult or embryonic <italic>Drosophila</italic> induces phosphorylation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> activating transcriptional factor-2 (dATF-2) and results in the release of this protein from heterochromatin; this heterochromatic disruption is an epigenetic event that is transmitted to the next generation in a non-Mendelian fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seong et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, starvation-induced developmental arrest leads to production of small RNAs that are inherited through at least three consecutive generations; these small RNAs target genes with roles in nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rechavi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Transgenerational defects in spermatogenesis have been demonstrated in rodents after maternal exposure to several chemicals, including vinclozolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anway et al., 2005</xref>), arsenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yin et al., 2021</xref>), and p,p′-dichlorodiphenoxydichloroethylene (p,p′-DDE), one of the primary metabolic products of the classical organochlorine pesticide, dichlorodiphenoxytrichloroethane (DDT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2014</xref>). Recent work has demonstrated changes of DNA methylation in fetal germ cells and spermatogenetic cells in postnatal testis after prenatal exposure to vinclozolin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skinner et al., 2019</xref>) and DDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben Maamar et al., 2019</xref>), but a causal relationship between the altered DNA methylation/gene expression and the spermatogenetic defects has not been determined.</p><p>Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a plasticizer that is used in a wide range of consumer products, such as food packing, medical devices, and wallpapers. Maternal exposure to DEHP has been shown to affect spermatogenesis in male offspring of mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>) as well as several other body systems over multiple generations, including the female reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brehm et al., 2018</xref>), liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2020</xref>), and anxiety-like behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quinnies et al., 2015</xref>). Concerning influences on spermatogenic cells, offspring that are exposed prenatally to DEHP show defects in spermatogenesis, decreases in sperm number, and reduction of sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doyle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prados et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stenz et al., 2017</xref>), and F1 sperm demonstrate altered DNA methylation and expression of the genes encoding seminal vesicle secretory protein 2 (Svs2; also known as semenogelin-1); Svs3b; Svs4; and seminal vesicle antigen (Sva), all of which are involved in sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stenz et al., 2017</xref>). However, possible causes of inter- or trans-generational spermatogenic defects, including epi-mutations of spermatogenesis-related genes, have not been identified; such causes are expected to be essential to understanding the mechanism(s) of the transgenerational effects of DEHP on spermatogenesis. In the present study, we examined changes in DNA methylation and gene expression in fetal male germ cells shortly after maternal DEHP exposure and in spermatogenic cells in adult offspring. We identified candidate epi-mutated genes that are involved in abnormal spermatogenesis in mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defects in spermatogenesis following maternal DEHP exposure</title><p>Using C57BL/6 mice, we confirmed the previously reported effects of maternal DEHP exposure on testicular germ cells in embryos and in testes in subsequent generations.

Taken together, these observations indicate that the <italic>Hist1h2ba</italic>, <italic>Sycp1</italic>, and <italic>Taf7l</italic> genes are epi-mutated following maternal DEHP exposure; the resulting downregulation of these gene may be a cause of abnormal spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism of hypermethylation of spermatogenesis-related genes in fetal germ cells following maternal DEHP exposure</title><p>Our study revealed that the spermatogenesis-related genes were hypermethylated in fetal germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>), suggesting a possible preference of DEHP-induced DNA methylation for germ cells and/or spermatogenesis-related genes. Previous studies have shown that maternal DEHP exposure induces DNA methylation not only in testis but also in other tissues such as adrenal gland and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Quinnies et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wen et al., 2020</xref>); notably, DEHP exposure resulted in a significant increase in the expression, in the liver of the offspring, of <italic>Dnmt1</italic>, a gene encoding a DNA methyltransferase. These results suggested that upregulation of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> by DEHP plays a role in DNA hypermethylation. Change of expression levels of <italic>Dnmts</italic> after maternal DEHP exposure awaits a further study.</p><p>Another possible mechanism is involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS may be involved in DEHP-induced DNA methylation, given that mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), a hydrolyzed metabolite of DEHP, induces ROS production in adult testicular germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasahara et al., 2002</xref>), and that ROS directly enhances DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afanas'ev, 2014</xref>). In fetal germ cells, the chromatin structure around spermatogenesis-related genes is highly accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2018</xref>) and may facilitate preferential DNA methylation of spermatogenesis-related genes in fetal germ cells in response to the accumulation of ROS following DEHP exposure. Alternatively, DEHP- or MEHP-binding molecules may be involved in the observed DNA methylation. DEHP and MEHP are ligands of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR); these receptors regulate downstream pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corton and Lapinskas, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eveillard et al., 2009</xref>) and may thereby promote DNA methylation via unknown mechanisms, including recruitment of DNA methylation-related molecules to target genes. Those possibilities await further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Possible mechanisms of intergenerational inheritance of abnormal spermatogenesis following maternal DEHP exposure</title><p>Changes of the expression and methylation of <italic>Hist1h2ba</italic>, <italic>Sycp1</italic>, and <italic>Taf7l</italic> in F2 spermatogonia were not statistically significant after maternal DEHP exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s2sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). In our results, methylation levels in these genes in F2 spermatogonia generally were lower than those in F1 spermatogonia, even in the oil-treated group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s2sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>); these differences may be due, at least in part, to differences in the purity of the spermatogonia. We found that enrichment of <italic>Gfra1</italic> expression in sorted spermatogonia fractions was higher in those of F1 than those of F2, though its enrichment between oil- and DEHP-treated groups of F1 and of F2 was comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s2sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). Because the F2 alleles are inherited from DEHP-exposed males and untreated females, the influence of DEHP-induced epigenetic changes reasonably may become weaker or disappear in the F2 alleles compared with those in the F1 alleles. Additionally, those genes became hypomethylated during spermatogenesis in F1 testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>), suggesting that the hypermethylation of the genes by DEHP is not directly transmitted to the F2. A recent study suggested that binding of transcription factors (TFs) at CpG sites affects the methylation status of these sites during demethylation in primordial germ cells and affects subsequent re-methylation of these sites; notably, CpG sites not bound by TFs could be re-methylated after demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kremsky and Corces, 2020</xref>). These results imply that <italic>Hist1h2ba</italic>, <italic>Sycp1</italic>, and <italic>Taf7l</italic> are demethylated during spermatogenesis, and subsequently are re-methylated at some developmental time point(s) after fertilization.</p><p>In the case of embryonic undernutrition, abnormal DNA hypomethylation in F1 sperm is not inherited in F2 sperm and somatic tissues; however, the transcription levels of several genes near the regions with altered DNA methylation in F1 sperm are dysregulated in F2 somatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Radford et al., 2014</xref>). These results suggest that changes in DNA methylation perturb (indirectly) gene expression patterns in subsequent generations. Modified histones that are bound to specific genomic regions, such as H3K4 trimethylation (me3) bound at CpG-rich promoters and H3K9me3 bound at satellite repeats in the sperm genome, are not replaced by protamine during sperm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamaguchi et al., 2018</xref>). Maternal undernutrition, as well as maternal DEHP exposure, may affect such histone modifications in F1 sperm in a DNA methylation status-dependent manner, which in turn may influence phenotypes in the F2. Further work will be required to explore this possibility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, males)</td><td>Oct4-delta PE-GFP</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10646797/">10646797</ext-link></td><td/><td>C57BL/6J background</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Human</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T</td><td>ATCC <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td>CRL-3216</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Cleaved Caspase-3 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>CST <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2341188">AB_2341188</ext-link></td><td>Cat# 9661</td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCpGL (plasmid)</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17965610/">17965610</ext-link></td><td/><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ag-rehli.de/materials.html">http://www.ag-rehli.de/materials.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit</td><td>Zymo Research</td><td>Cat# D5005</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina</td><td>BioLabs</td><td>Cat#E7770S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System</td><td>Promega</td><td>Cat#E1910</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>DEHP</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat#80030</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Corn oil</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat#C8267</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Bismark</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21493656/">21493656</ext-link></td><td>v0.10.1</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>TopHat2</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23618408/">23618408</ext-link></td><td>V2.1.0</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml">https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/tophat/index.shtml</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Bowtie2</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22388286/">22388286</ext-link></td><td>V2.2.6.0</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml">http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>featureCounts</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24227677">24227677</ext-link></td><td>Packaged in Subread v1.5.0-p2</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://subread.sourceforge.net/">http://subread.sourceforge.net/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>edgeR</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19910308/">19910308</ext-link></td><td>V3.13</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and DEHP treatment</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Japan SLC. Oct4-deltaPE-GFP transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yoshimizu et al., 1999</xref>) were maintained in a C57BL/6J genetic background. The mice were maintained and bred in an environmentally controlled and specific pathogen-free facility, the Animal Unit of the Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (Tohoku University), according to the guidelines for experimental animals defined by the facility. Animal protocols were reviewed and approved by the Tohoku University Animal Studies Committee (approval number: 2019AcA-027-01). Maternal DEHP exposure was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stenz et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, female C57BL/6J mice (8–12 weeks old) were mated with male C57BL/6J or Oct4 (Pou51f)-deltaPE-GFP transgenic mice; noon on the day of mucus plug observation was defined as E0.5. Prenatal exposure to DEHP was performed by oral (gavage) administration of pregnant female mice, performed once per day from E8 to E18. At each administration, 200 μL of either corn oil (Sigma C8267) (for controls) or 200 μL of DEHP (Sigma 80030) diluted in corn oil to provide a dose of 100 mg/kg/day or 150 mg/kg/day for C57BL/6J or Oct4-deltaPE-GFP males, respectively, was delivered by oral gavage. The treated gestating dams were considered the F0 generation (F0), and the pups born from the F0 dams were considered the F1 generation (F1) offspring. The F2 generation was obtained by breeding males of the F1 of DEHP-treated animals or vehicle control animals with nontreated C57BL/6J females. We analyzed 3–8 mice of each condition as biological replicates to statistically evaluate the effect of DEHP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell line</title><p>HEK293T (ATCC #CRL-3216, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link>) was confirmed by STR profiling and was negative for mycoplasma.

Testes then were incubated for 15 min at 37°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5 mg/mL trypsin and 0.2 mg/mL EDTA (Sigma T4174). The cells were dissociated by pipetting, and then were filtered through a 40-µm-pore Cell strainer (BD Falcon 352340). A Bio-Rad S3e cell sorter was used to purify viable germ cells with intense Oct4-deltaPE-GFP expression and testicular somatic cells (Somas) without Oct4-deltaPE-GFP expression. For DNA isolation, one-quarter-volume of sorted cell suspension was centrifuged and stored at −80°C after removal of the supernatant. For RNA isolation, the remainder of the cell suspension was centrifuged, resuspended in buffer RLT (QIAGEN 79216) containing 1% beta-mercaptoethanol, and stored at −80°C. For each cell sorting, we obtained 1–16 embryos. The cells obtained from four independent sorting were combined before DNA or RNA extraction, which yielded suspensions containing approximately 12,000 cells for DNA isolation and 40,000 cells for RNA isolation. We repeated four more sorting and combined the sorted cells to obtain a biological replicate. To obtain totally 101,703 cells for oil- or 108,891 cells for DEHP group of germ cells used for the methylome and transcriptome, 43 and 82 embryos were dissected. Dissociation of testicular cells from adult mice and subsequent staining were carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ota et al., 2019</xref>). Testes were dissected from F1 or F2 mice at approximately postnatal day (P) 200. After the albuginea was removed, testes were incubated at 32°C for 25 min in 6 mL of Gey’s Balanced Salt Solution (GBSS; Sigma-Aldrich G9779) containing 1.2 mg/mL of Collagenase Type I (Sigma-Aldrich C0130), and the seminiferous tubules were dissociated. Interstitial cells were removed by filtration with the Cell strainer. Seminiferous tubules retained on the filter were collected and incubated at 32°C for 25 min in GBSS containing 1.2 mg/mL of Collagenase Type I and 5 μg/mL DNase (Roche 11284932). Cell aggregates were sheared gently by 10 rounds of pipetting with a wide orifice plastic transfer pipet and filtered through the Cell strainer to remove cell clumps. Cells were washed with GBSS and then resuspended in GBSS containing 1% FBS. Twenty million cells were diluted in 2 mL of GBSS containing 1% FBS and stained with 5 μg/mL of Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen H3570) for 1 hr at 32°C. Cells were kept on ice and protected from light until sorting. Before sorting, 0.25 μg/mL of propidium iodide (PI, BD 51-66211E) was added to the stained cells, and the mixture was filtered through the Cell strainer. The cells were sorted using a Becton-Dickinson FACSAria II cell sorter. PI-positive cells reflect dead cells, which were first eliminated by gating, and PI-negative living cells were then further fractionated to spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids according to their Hoechst staining patterns. Fluorescence of Hoechst 33342 has two emissions wavelength (450 nm, blue, and 675 nm, red), and the stained cells can be separated by signal intensity for the two wavelengths, which partly reflects DNA content of the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goodell et al., 1996</xref>). To avoid interference of GFP with red and blue emissions of Hoechst, compensation of fluorescence signals between GFP and Hoechst dye on the flow cytometer was performed using unstained or GFP-negative testicular cells. Confirmation of the purity of the sorted germ cells was evaluated by assessing the expression of stage-specific germ cell marker genes as follows: <italic>Gfra1</italic> for spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hofmann et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Scp3</italic> for spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lammers et al., 1994</xref>), and <italic>Acrv1</italic> for round spermatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reddi et al., 1995</xref>). We obtained two biological replicates for each cell type in F1 testes for transcriptome and methylome; one was composed of the cells from one individual, and the other was composed of pooled cells from two individuals to secure enough number of cells. Each sample was further divided for transcriptome (approximately 50,000 cells) and methylome (approximately 15,000 cells) analyses.

Genomic DNA then was isolated using phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. RRBS libraries were generated as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gu et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, 20 ng of genomic DNA was subjected to MspI digestion (NEB, Beverly, MA), with subsequent end repair/dA-tailing reaction using Klenow Fragment (3'−5' exo-) (NEB M0212S) and ligation with Illumina sequencing adapters using T4 DNA ligase (NEB M0202T). The resulting mixture was electrophoresed in NuSieve 3:1 agarose (Lonza 50091), and fragments sized 150–350 bp were excised and then purified using a MinElute Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN 28604). The purified fragments were treated with sodium bisulfite using an EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research D5005). Library amplification and indexing were performed with KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ ReadyMix (2×) (Kapa Biosystems KK2801). The PCR amplification was carried out as follows: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min; 13 cycles at 98°C for 20 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and a final 1 min extension at 72°C.

Refseq genes encoding microRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs as well as mitochondrial DNA were excluded from our analyses. Promoters were defined as regions 500 bp upstream and downstream from TSSs of Refseq transcripts. Gene bodies were defined as transcribed regions of Refseq transcripts except for promoters. We defined percentages of methylated CpG in all CpG sites in the regions of interest as methylation levels, which was estimated by analyzing promoters containing ≧10 CpG cytosines with sufficient coverage for calculation of the methylation levels.

RNAs were reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen 18080093) and random primers (Promega C1181). Real-time PCR was performed using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems 4367659). Thermal conditions were 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C, and 45 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 60 s at 60°C. Sequences of the primers used for the PCR reaction are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>. The <italic>Arbp</italic> transcript was used as an internal control. The relative expression was analyzed using comparative CT method.

Each sequence was cloned into the CpG-free pCpGL-basic Luciferase vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klug and Rehli, 2006</xref>). Luciferase reporter constructs were either mock-treated or methylated in vitro with SssI CpG methyltransferase for 4 hr at 37°C and purified with the QIAquick Purification Kit (QIAGEN 28704). Reporter plasmid (500 ng) and <italic>Renilla</italic> phRL-TK control vector (50 ng; Promega E2241) were co-transfected into HEK293T cells cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS using Lipofectamine LTX Reagent with PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen 15338100). After 48 hr, cells were lysed, and the relative luciferase activities were analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega E1910) on a Lumat LB 9507 (Berthold). Firefly luciferase (Luc) activity of individual transfections was normalized against <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase activity. We analyzed data from three independent experiments to evaluate statistically significant differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The significance of difference was assessed by the unpaired two-sided Student’s t-test after confirmation of normal distribution of the data by Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, except for bisulfite sequence. The data of Kolmogorov–Smirnov test is indicated in the source data files. Statistical analysis of DNA methylation levels was performed by using the Mann–Whitney U test. The level of significance was set at p-value &lt; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. H Motohashi for providing HEK293T, Dr. D Okamura and K Mochizuki for helpful advices and discussions, all the members of Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research for helpful discussions, the Biomedical Research Core of Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine and the Center of Research Instruments of Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer (IDAC), Tohoku University for use of instruments and technical support.

In this manuscript, Tando et al. have investigated the molecular consequences of this maternal exposure on fetal and adult male germ cells by studying DNA methylation and gene expression by large-scale approaches. They found three genes previously known to be involved in spermatogenesis that are deregulated following maternal exposure to DEHP and which could contribute to the observed spermatogenesis defects.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Epi-mutations for spermatogenic defects by maternal exposure to Di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ludwig Stenz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. The reviewers had concerns about the robustness and clarity of the statistical analyses that need to be addressed in a revised manuscript. This includes (i) much more detailed description and clarifications on the statistical methods (i.e. inclusion of software version numbers, FDR cutoffs, etc.), (ii) need to revise any analysis relying on the deprecated use of the FPKM framework, (iii) use of Student t-test in the absence of proof of normal distribution.</p><p>2. There were some concerns about the small number of replicates used (n = 2), reduced to n=1 for one type (E19.5 DEHP RNAseq analysis). This small number of replicates provide extremely limited statistical power and thus will make it difficult to capture the extent of biological variation (potentially missing many true targets). The ideal solution, which the reviewers recognize may be too time-consuming and difficult to achieve right now, would be to add 2 additional replicates to these analyses (so as to be able to account for batch effects). However, if this is too difficult to achieve, the reviewers recommend that all general conclusions be strongly toned down in the abstract, text and discussion to reflect that there is strong statistical support only for 3 targets that are further validated (Hist1h2ba, Sycp1, and Taf7l). The limitation due to the small sample number should also be explicitly discussed.</p><p>3.

In this case, functional annotation by DAVID did not show spermatogenesis- and spermiogenesis-related GO terms, while sperm motility-related GO terms were enriched in the up-regulated genes in spermatogonia and spermatocytes. We edited corresponding discussion concerning possible influence of DEHP on abnormal up-regulation of genes (page 7). In the case of RRBS, we extracted differentially methylated regions (DMRs) based on 5% changes of methylation levels in DEHP-treated samples compared to oil-treated samples, which is not fully reliable, but FDR&lt;0.05 did not result in extraction of spermatogenesis-related genes including Hist1h2ba, Sycp1, and Taf7l. We consider the extraction of DMRs as a step for selecting candidate spermatogenesis-related genes with DMRs. We therefore left the RRBS results in new Figure 3 as it was in the original manuscript except functional annotation of differentially methylated genes, in which FDR&lt;0.05 cutoff was applied (page 20), and toned down conclusions and discussions concerning genome-wide consequences of the DHEP exposure (Abstract, page 6, 7, 8, 10, 12), and focused on the three target genes that were extracted from the genome-wide data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Propidium iodide used for eliminating dead cells, also has 675 nm emission, but the stained cells were eliminated by pre-gating.
