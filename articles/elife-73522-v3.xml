syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the Golden Syrian hamster causes lung pathology that resembles human coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, extrapulmonary pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and post-COVID sequelae remain to be understood. Here, we show, using a hamster model, that the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to an acute inflammatory response and lung pathologies, while the late phase of infection causes cardiovascular complications (CVCs) characterized by ventricular wall thickening associated with increased ventricular mass/body mass ratio and interstitial coronary fibrosis. Molecular profiling further substantiated our findings of CVC as SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters showed elevated levels of serum cardiac troponin I, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and long-chain fatty acid triglycerides. Serum metabolomics profiling of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters identified N-acetylneuraminate, a functional metabolite found to be associated with CVC, as a metabolic marker was found to be common between SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and COVID-19 patients. Together, we propose hamsters as a suitable animal model to study post-COVID sequelae associated with CVC, which could be extended to therapeutic interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hamster</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV2</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>THSTI core</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Awasthi</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Translational Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Awasthi</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DST-SERB</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Awasthi</surname><given-names>Amit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters causes cardiovascular pathologies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>First reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected nearly 0.9% of the total world population with a mortality rate of around 1.96% as of December 2021 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://COVID-19.who.int/">https://COVID-19.who.int/</ext-link>). Symptomatic COVID-19 is typically characterized by symptoms ranging from mild to acute respiratory distress associated with cytokine release syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Li, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Verity et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, extrapulmonary signs, ranging from cardiovascular complication (CVC), coagulopathies, multiple-organ damage, and neurological disorders, were found to be recognized as post-COVID sequelae described in patients with mild to severe COVID-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Li, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortinovis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lamers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neurath, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishiga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xydakis et al., 2020</xref>). The severity of COVID-19 is governed by several factors such as titer of virus, route of viral entry, gender, age, and comorbid conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Li, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sungnak et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 engages with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a cellular receptor expressed primarily on host lung epithelial cells, which facilitates viral entry into the host cell. In addition, other factors such as cellular transmembrane protease ‘serine 2’ (TMPRSS2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) assist in the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daly et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Various nonhuman primates and small animal models have been described to study the pathogenesis and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Callaway, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johansen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lakdawala and Menachery, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2020</xref>). The Golden Syrian hamster, which was previously described as a model for SARS-CoV infection, has gained much attention as a suitable model for studying SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaptein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Osterrieder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenke et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tostanoski et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, hamsters have been shown to be infected through intranasal, oral, and ophthalmic routes by SARS-CoV-2 with respectively descending lung viral load and pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). While several reports have described the usefulness of the hamster model in preclinical evaluations of vaccines and therapeutics for COVID-19 as well as studying SARS-CoV-2-associated lungs pathology, only limited studies have focused on extrapulmonary pathologies that are associated with post-COVID sequelae in hamsters.</p><p>Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2-associated pulmonary and extra pathologies in the Golden Syrian hamster. Following intranasal infection, hamsters showed a high lung viral load with significantly increased lungs injuries on days 2 and 4 post infection (dpi). Our data show an acute immune reaction characterized by heightened expression of inflammatory cytokines in the early phase of infection. Strikingly, at the later phase of the infection, the cardiomyocytes of the infected hamsters showed a high viral load with interstitial coronary fibrosis. SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the thickening of ventricular walls and the interventricular septum of the heart, with an increased serum troponin I level. Cardiovascular changes, upon 4 dpi, were found to be associated with an increase in serum triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) while long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) were found to be increased on 7 dpi. Furthermore, our metabolomics data identified changes in serum metabolites of the infected, as compared to uninfected, hamsters. In the line with data on CVC, we found an increased serum N-acetylneuraminate, a functional metabolite found to be associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maciel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), in the samples of the SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters and COVID-19 patients. These data further substantiated our claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases serum lipids and metabolites that are associated with CVC. Taken together, here we provide shreds of evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters results in post-COVID sequelae marked by CVC with elevated levels of molecular markers of CVC. We thus propose the Golden Syrian hamster as an appropriate and valuable model to study both early SARS-CoV-2 infection and postinfection sequelae.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters results in acute inflammatory response and lung pathology</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and a fragment of S1 protein with host ACE2 receptor and NRP-1 were critical for virus entry into epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>). Since SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters mimics human infection, therefore it was essential to understand the similarities between human (hu) and hamster (ha) receptors, especially ACE2 and NRP-1, and study their interactions with SARS-CoV-2 at the molecular level. To compare amino acid residues of hu and ha ACE2 that interact with the RBD, structure-guided sequence alignment was performed with their respective sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The overlay of the crystal structure of huACE2 with modeled haACE2 was 1.2 Å, indicating the high structural resemblance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). At the interface, 20 residues of hu ACE2 interact with 17 residues of RBD while 20 residues of ha ACE2 interact with 16 residues of RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). The NRP-1 receptor, which binds to S1 fragment of the spike protein and facilitates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daly et al., 2020</xref>), also showed identical interaction with S1 fragment residues between hu and ha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F–I</xref>).</p><p>The in silico data provided a comparative molecular insight into SARS-CoV-2 interaction and cellular entry in hamsters, which showed molecular and structural similarities of SARS-CoV-2 interaction and cellular entry with humans. Previous reports on SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters have shown a decrease in body mass, upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, as one of the clinical signs for a successful establishment of infection. In line with this, our data showed that hamsters challenged with either 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming unit (PFU) SARS-CoV-2 showed a gradual decrease in body weight up to 4 dpi, and subsequently recovered. The body weight loss peaked (~10% as compared to uninfected) at 4 dpi when compared to the unchallenged control hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sia et al., 2020</xref>). This data was accompanied by gross lung morphological changes characterized by pneumonitis regions with a high lung viral copy number and TCID<sub>50</sub> at 2 dpi that gradually decreased with disease progression, marking the recovery of the animals from SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). COVID-19 is marked by severe pneumonia, lung injury, and an influx of activated immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afrin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudewijns et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Li, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moore and June, 2020</xref>). In line with this, the histological analysis indicated an elevated disease index score marked by high scores of inflammation, epithelial injury, lung injury, and pneumonitis with elevated infiltration of granulocytes and mast cells on 2, 4, and 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The experimental control for toluidine blue showed negligible stain for mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Consistently, mRNA expression of mast cell signature enzymes, chymase and tryptase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caughey, 2007</xref>), was increased on 2 and 4 dpi corroborating with mast cell enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of eotaxin, a CC chemokine and a potent chemoattractant for airway eosinophils and mast cells found to be increased in asthma and allergy conditions, was upregulated at 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2001</xref>). The expression of other lung injury markers like mucin (muc-1: marker of respiratory infections), surfactant protein-D (sftp-D: acute lung injury marker), advanced glycation end product (AGER: pro-inflammatory pattern recognition receptor), and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1: a key factor for lung fibrosis) was upregulated at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chatterjee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crouch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oczypok et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prabhakaran et al., 2003</xref>). Collectively, our data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters resembles human COVID-19 pathologies with a high viral load at the onset of infection marked by lung injury and inflammation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pulmonary pathologies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected hamsters.</title><p>Hamsters infected with 10<sup>4</sup> or 10<sup>5</sup> plaque-forming unit (PFU) SARS-CoV-2 and the course of infection were followed for 14 days with the evaluation of clinical and pathological features of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Most of the SARS-CoV-2 infection studies in hamsters have demonstrated the pathological changes associated with the dissemination of virus in various organs without characterization of an acute inflammatory response. We observed a profound splenomegaly in hamsters challenged with SARS-CoV-2 with an increase in spleen mass to body mass ratio at 2 and 4 dpi as compared to the uninfected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). As hamsters recover from SARS- CoV-2 infection indicated by gain of body weight, splenomegaly also subsided at the late phase of infection (7 and 14 dpi), which is corroborated with recovery in lung pathologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These observations, together, indicated that splenomegaly could be used as an indicator of disease severity and cytokine release syndrome, and thus can be used as one of the key parameters to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. To characterize the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters, serum IgG titer against viral proteins, RBD, spike, and N protein, was determined. As compared to a low dose, a high dose of infection generates a higher IgG titer against RBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The RBD, spike (prefusion S2P), and N protein ELISA detected the corresponding antibodies in challenged animals as early as 7 dpi. The serum endpoint antibody titers against RBD, spike, and N protein were 1:3610, 1:405, and 1:330, respectively, and the titer of these antibodies was further enhanced to 1:8900, 1:550, and 1:660 at 14 dpi for PFU SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The cellular response was corroborated with the antibody response as the frequency of RBD-specific CD4<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup> cells was also found to be elevated (~2.5-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells remained the same at 2 dpi between uninfected and SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To define the cellular response, particularly the T helper (Th) cell response, against SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters, we performed mRNA expression of crucial cytokines, chemokines, transcription factors, and checkpoint inhibitors. Our data demonstrated an increased mRNA expression of signature cytokines of Th1 (IFNγ, tumor necrosis factor [TNF)-α], Th2(interleukin [IL]-13), Th9 (IL-9), and Th17 (IL-17A) cells and IL-6 cytokine at the peak of infection (i.e., 2 dpi) along with their respective transcription factors, T-bet, GATA3, and RAR-related orphan receptor (ROR)-c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Candia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grifoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mathew et al., 2020</xref>). However, the transcription factor forkhead box protein (Foxp)-3 was found to be elevated at 14 dpi, suggesting a suppressive immunological response induced by regulatory T (Tregs) cells was increased with the declining of the infection. Interestingly, anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, set in much early at 2 dpi, which could serve to counterbalance an aggressive inflammatory reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We also found elevated expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) at 2 dpi compared to uninfected hamsters, indicating a possible role of an oxidative environment in SARS-CoV-2-induced pathologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Immune activation and infiltration at the target site is primarily dependent on chemokines and chemokine receptors. Therefore, we tested the expression of both chemokines and their receptors in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. We found elevated expression of C-C chemokine receptor (CCR5) and C-C motif chemokine ligand (CCL)-5 at 2 dpi, which are known to regulate T cell function and chemotaxis. CCL-22, which is essential for Treg-dendritic cell (DC) cross-talk, was found to be elevated at 7 dpi as compared to uninfected hamsters. The expression of CXCL9 and CXCL-10, which are crucial for effector T cell trafficking and activation, and have been described as one of the biomarkers for CVC, was upregulated at 2 dpi as compared to uninfected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hueso et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, mRNA expression of PD-1 and its ligand, PDL-1, was found to be upregulated at the onset of infection, suggesting the induction of checkpoints to suppress the acute immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). These data demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters induces an acute immune activation, chemotaxis, and expansion of immune cell populations at the peak of infection that resembles the cytokine storm patterns reported in symptomatic COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afrin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moore and June, 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Immunological response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in hamsters.</title><p>Immunological responses of SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters were evaluated from serum or spleen samples.

The interplay between host-virus interaction via ACE2-RBD and its impact on the host renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and immunological response is central to the development of CVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giustino et al., 2020</xref>). However, the lack of a suitable SARS-CoV-2 animal model has remained a limitation for studying cardiovascular-related complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acute inflammatory responses like upregulation of CXCL9/10 and oxidative stress allowed us to rationalize that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters may lead to CVC. Indeed, 7 and 14 dpi hearts showed clear ventricular hypertrophy, marked by a significant increase in ventricular mass to body mass ratio in challenged hamsters as compared to unchallenged hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). It was further observed that the ventricular space was reduced as characterized by thickening of the ventricular wall and interventricular septum at 7 and 14 dpi in SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamsters as compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>). The ventricular wall thickening at 7 and 14 dpi with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hamster was marked by increased inflammation surrounding the coronary artery and elevated interstitial coronary fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). The experimental control Masson’s trichrome (MT) staining of the heart showed staining pattern comparable to the uninfected heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, increased fibrosis is an established pathophysiological stage in the majority of CVC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Travers et al., 2016</xref>). To further validate the CVC pathology observed during the late phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters, we evaluated the CVC biomarkers in serum and viral load in the heart. There was a gradual increase in serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels from the early to late phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Remarkably, remdesivir, which has been shown to have significant antiviral efficacy in hamsters, was able to inhibit serum cTnI levels at 4 dpi when compared to the infection control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortinovis et al., 2021</xref>). We also found elevated serum IL-6 levels at 2 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In addition to inflammation indicator, IL-6 is used as a prognosis marker for CVC. Our data indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases serum levels of IL-6 ,which decreases during later time points of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The elevated levels of CVC markers were accompanied by a high viral load in the heart of infected hamsters at 2 dpi as compared to uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The viral load in the heart was significantly reduced with remdesivir administration and was in line with reduced cTnI levels during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Interestingly, we did not find any significant viral load in the heart at 7 and 14 dpi.

Indeed, the serum lipid profile showed elevated cholesterol, TGs, HDLs, LDLs, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels at 4 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Since our preliminary data revealed CVC and perturbations in the lipid profile of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, we set out to do a detailed characterization of modulation in the abundance of lipid moieties at different time points of infection through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to identify potential lipid biomarkers associated with cardiovascular pathologies. Our LC-MS/MS data identified 831 lipid molecules from the hamster serum samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These 831 lipid molecules were from the following categories: 11 acylcarnitine (AcCar), 15 cholesterol ester (CE), 50 ceramide (CE), 2 co-enzyme Q (CoQ), 31 diglycerides (DG), 13 ditetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE), 10 hexocylceramide (Hex-Cer), 31 lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), 19 lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE), 7 lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI), 105 oxidized (Ox), 107 phosphatidylcholine (PC), 41 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 7 phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 38 phosphatidylinositol (PI), 141 ether bond containing lipid (Plasmenyl), 4 phosphatidylserine (PS), 56 sphingomyelin (SM), 5 saturated lipids (SO), and 135 TGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In addition, the uniquely and significantly modulated serum lipid molecules in hamsters, at 2, 4, 7, and 14 dpi with SARS-CoV-2, were identified by carrying out <italic>t</italic>-test analysis followed by multiple testing correction as compared to uninfected (0 dpi) control. Volcano plots for 2, 4, 7, and 14 dpi (top to bottom) show significantly modulated lipid molecules in red dots. Interestingly, majority of the significantly modulated lipid molecules were identified at the late phase of infection, that is, 7 or 14 dpi serum samples corroborating with the appearance of CVC in 7 dpi hamster hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In total, 275 lipids were differentially regulated as identified by <italic>t</italic>-test analysis (described in the ‘Materials and methods’ section), of which 65 lipids molecules were upregulated while 208 were downregulated as identified by log<sub>2</sub> fold change (FC) in volcano plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition, the heatmap for log<sub>2</sub> fold normalized relative abundance values for differentially regulated lipids showed that different classes of lipid molecules were distinctly downregulated or upregulated with the progression of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>, respectively). Our lipidomics data show that unsaturated TGs (4–11 double bonds [db]), plasmanyl-PE (1–6 db), and plasmanyl-TGs (1–3 db) were uniquely upregulated during infection while saturated TGs (1–3 db), DGs, oxidized lipids, PC, PE, and PI were found to be downregulated during infection. However, both saturated TGs and oxidized lipids, which were implicated in CVC, were downregulated upon infection. Quite remarkably, we found LCFA TGs to be more abundant in the serum of infected hamsters as compared to uninfected hamsters. On the contrary, medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) TGs were more abundant in uninfected hamsters as compared to infected hamsters. This corroborated with a previously published report that showed that increased LCFAs and decreased MCFAs are associated with increased risks of heart diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labarthe et al., 2008</xref>).

Here, we attempted to identify signature metabolites that could help in predicting the severity and progression of COVID-19. To find a correlation of metabolic signatures of COVID-19 in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, we carried out serum metabolomics analysis of 2, 4, 7, and 14 dpi hamster serum samples and compared them with uninfected (0 dpi) controls.

When compared to COVID-19 serum metabolomics profile data published by Bo Shen et al., we found six metabolites, viz, arginine, N-acetylglutamate, N-acetyl-tryptophan, ornithine, proline, and sphingomyelin, to be distinctly common between severe vs. healthy, nonsevere vs. healthy (Shen et al. study), and the hamster serum profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, two metabolites were uniquely common between severe vs. healthy and hamster, that is, isovalerylglycine and uracil. Five metabolites were unique between the nonsevere and hamster profiles but were absent in the severe COVID-19 profile: 5-hydroxyindoleacetate, adenosine, carnitine, fumurate, and propionylcarnitine. Only one metabolite, N-acetylneuraminate, overlapped between severe vs. nonsevere COVID-19 profile and was also present in infected hamsters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). These common metabolites between hamsters and severe and nonsevere COVID-19 human serum samples prompted us to ask if these identified metabolites are also present in COVID-19 individuals in the early and late phases of infection.

Moreover, hamsters as a preclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection model were recently shown to mimic viral entry and replication in a manner naturally similar to humans, and therefore hamsters are regarded as a suitable and natural model for SARS-CoV-2-challenged studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sia et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters causes lung pathologies, which resemble that of human lung pneumonitis, inflammation, and alveolar epithelial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boudewijns et al., 2020</xref>, p. 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sia et al., 2020</xref>). This is not surprising as huACE2 and haACE2 receptors have been shown to share major sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2020</xref>). Such similarities between hACE2 and haACE2 strongly point to interaction with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein with a similar trend of binding affinity. Our in silico data on haACE2 extends previous knowledge, providing greater insight into the interaction established between haACE2 and RBD protein. Moreover, the interacting residues and changes in interaction energy are strikingly similar between hamsters and humans, and as a result, the furin-cleaved S subunit could enter the interacting groove of haNRP-1 and prime it for interaction with ACE2 in a manner similar to that seen in humans. Our in silico data was suggestive of similarity in SARS-CoV-2 interaction in hamsters and humans, and it corroborated well with intranasal infection and subsequent lung viral load in hamsters as reported by previous studies. As increased viral load in the lungs is reflective of lung pathologies and has been shown to induce inflammation and injuries in clinical cohorts, we reasoned that consistent pathophysiological changes may be occurring in the hamster as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leng et al., 2020</xref>). In line with this, we observed profound pneumonitis, inflammation, and alveolar epithelial injury upon histological assessments of the lung. Our data show that lung pathologies long persist even after a decrease in lung viral load since we observed significantly higher pathological scores on 7 dpi. This corroborates well with clinical cases of COVID-19 where it has been found that lung pathologies such as pneumonitis and lung injury persist longer even after no viral load was detected in the oral and nasal swabs.</p><p>Viremia is an important pathological characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, and further, SARS-CoV-2 is known to shed viral proteins that remain in circulation in the serum long after the virus is cleared, which provide humoral immunity against subsequent strain-specific infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson and Petersen, 2020</xref>). The host responds to these pathogenic factors by producing IgG antibodies for effective neutralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the IgG response to SARS-CoV-2 was most profound on 7 and 14 dpi, which corroborates well with recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection in the hamster model. In addition to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response, a robust host response against SARS-CoV-2 depends on T cell proliferation and activation. Consistently, our data demonstrates profound splenomegaly in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals on 2 and 4 dpi with an increased spleen mass to body mass ratio, pointing to active immune cell stimulation and proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis indicated a significantly elevated IFN-γ response at 2 dpi hamsters, which could be one of the mechanisms of the antiviral response mounted during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, the Th17 signature cytokine IL-17A and its master transcription factor, RORc, were also found to be elevated in early phase of infection. Numerous clinical studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a cytokine storm syndrome, which is responsible for lung pathologies and respiratory distress in severe COVID-19 cases. IFNγ, IL-6, and IL-17A were found to be important mediators and the hallmark of acute inflammatory response induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moore and June, 2020</xref>). These cytokines were found to be significantly elevated in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. Furthermore, the qPCR analysis revealed a similar activation pattern for several chemokines and inflammatory cytokines together with their respective transcription factors, indicating that immune activation sets in quite early during infection, and thus plays a role in pathological damage associated with the lungs and other organs during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francis et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Emerging reports suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection affects the cardiovascular system, which results in inflammation, endothelial activation, and microvascular thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giustino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishiga et al., 2020</xref>). CVC is one of the comorbidities found to be associated with COVID-19 patients. Since there is a lack of knowledge about CVC arising from SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters, we carried out a detailed histological analysis to monitor the changes occurring in and around cardiomyocytes of the heart muscle. Interestingly, we found a profound thickening of the ventricular and interventricular septum with a marked depression in ventricular space capacity on 7 and 14 dpi heart samples. These changes were accompanied by the deposition of fibrous mass around the coronary artery and inflammation, which is believed to be one of the major causes of CVC and arrhythmia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Travers et al., 2016</xref>). Observation of cardiovascular complications on 7 and 14 dpi was a remarkable finding as it hinted strongly at extrapulmonary damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. It may be possible that the virus invades the heart and causes direct infection and injury to cardiomyocytes or it may release soluble mediators in the blood that may cause CVC. Serum cTnI is an established prognosis marker for CVC and is associated with an increased risk of heart failure. We found that cTnI levels, in SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters, were increased significantly especially in the late phase of infection, that is, 7 and 14 dpi. In addition, the qPCR analysis suggested an approximately 15-fold increase in heart viral load at 2 dpi. It seems, therefore, that CVC pathologies in SARS-CoV-2 infection are a consequence of both SARS-CoV-2 infection of heart cells and release of soluble factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Francis et al., 2021</xref>), causing CVC. Consistently, remdesivir treatment reduced heat viral and profoundly decreased the serum cTnI levels.</p><p>In addition to cTnI, we also characterized the serum lipid profile of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters. We found a dramatic increase in serum cholesterol, TGs, LDL, and VLDL levels in infected serum samples, which peaked at 4 dpi. Serum lipid molecules are other important soluble mediators that are associated with cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labarthe et al., 2008</xref>). We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters leads to global changes in the lipid profile occurring at 7 and 14 dpi. In addition, LCFAs were found to be uniquely accumulated in serum samples of infected hamsters as compared to MCFAs during the late phase of infection, corroborating well with previously published reports showing that increase and decrease in LCFAs and MCFAs levels could be one of the biomarkers of CVC and heart failure.</p><p>In addition to lipid profiling, we attempted to evaluate the metabolomic changes occurring in hamsters infected with SARS-CoV-2 as there is no such data available on metabolic profiling in the hamsters. We identified 62 serum metabolites that were significantly modulated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. In order to identify signature metabolic biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters that is also common for COVID-19 patients irrespective of the stage of infection, disease severity, or demography of infection, we followed a rigorous metabolomics comparative analysis between an already published Bo Shen et al. human database, our hamster study data, and our in-house-generated early and late phase human COVID-19 database. N-acetlyneuraminate was found to be a uniquely upregulated serum metabolic marker that was common across all these datasets. It is noteworthy that increased N-acetylneuraminate has been linked to increased heart disease risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maciel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Together, our data provide the first insight into the key metabolites that could be used as biomarkers for the efficient and rapid evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 disease severity and could potentially be useful for testing the efficacies of antiviral drugs.</p><p>As of now, the hamster model for SARS-CoV-2 has been described as a suitable model to study lung pathologies and their associated clinical parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Imai et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaptein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Osterrieder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tostanoski et al., 2020</xref>). However, a robust animal model that mimics extrapulmonary COVID pathologies, especially cardiovascular pathologies arising due to COVID-19, has not been evaluated. The current study provides a detailed insight into the cardiovascular and immunopathological changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 progression in hamsters. Our data further provides a detailed and comprehensive analysis of lipidometabolomic changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters can be classified into early and late phases of infection with distinct pulmonary and extrapulmonary pathophysiologies. While the early phase of infection is characterized by a high lung viral load, lung injury, and an acute inflammatory response, the late phase of the infection was characterized by the appearance of cardiovascular pathologies and heart-related complications. Together, our study provides the first proof of concept that hamsters could serve as a robust preclinical model for understanding pathologies associated with early and late phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and provide a basis to test therapeutics at different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated early and late pathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal ethics and biosafety statement</title><p>6–8-week-old female Golden Syrian hamsters were acclimatized in biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) for 1 week and then infected in Animal BSL3 (ABSL-3) institutional facility.

The paraffin blocks were cut into 3-µm-thick sections and then mounted on silane-coated glass slides. One section from each organ sample was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Lung, heart, and colon samples were stained with toluidine blue, MT, and mucicarmine stains, respectively. Each stained section was analyzed and captured at ×10 and ×60 magnification. Heart images were also captured at ×1 magnification. Blinded assessment and scoring (on the scale of 0 [no observable pathological feature] to 5 [highest pathological feature]) of each sample section was performed by a trained pathologist.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunophenotyping of splenocytes</title><p>0.5 million RBC lysed splenocytes were used for intracellular cytokine staining by restimulation with PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; 50 ng/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), ionomycin (1.0 µg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich), and monensin (#554724; GolgiStop, BD Biosciences) for 6 hr or with RBD protein (50 µg) for 72 hr. Cell surface staining with anti-mouse CD4 (GK1.5) PerCp (BioLegend) was carried out for 20 min in the dark at RT. Intracellular anti-mouse IFN-γ (XMG1.2) (BioLegend) staining was then carried out after fixing the cells in Cytofix solution and permeabilizing with 1X Perm/Wash Buffer using kit (BD Biosciences; #554714) for 20 min in dark at RT. Cells were then washed and acquired on FACS Canto II and were analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Malik et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Lipid extraction and lipidomics</title><p>Lipid extraction from serum samples was performed as previously described with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schwaiger et al., 2018</xref>). 0.3 ml methanol was added to 100 µl of serum samples and mixed for 30 s followed by the addition of 1.25 ml methyl-tert-butyl ether. The mixture was incubated at RT for 1 hr on a shaker followed by the addition of 0.3 ml of MS grade water for the phase separation. 10 min after incubation at RT, samples were spun down at 400 rpm at 10°C for 5 min. The organic upper phase was collected and dried in a speed vac and stored at –80°C till further use. Moreover, the lipids extracted were dissolved in 100 µl of 65:30:5 (acetonitrile:2-propanol:water v/v/v). An acquity HSS T3 (2.1 mm × 100 mm × 1.8 Um, Waters) was then utilized for carrying out lipid separation by exploiting UPLC. Solvents A and B were water/acetonitrile (2:3 v/v) and 2-propanol/acetonitrile (9:1, v/v) respectively, at 0.3 ml/min flow rate and 40°C column temperature. 18 min total run time was utilized with the following gradient setup: 0–12 min solvent B ramped from 30% to 97% and hold for another 3 min. From 15.2 to 18 min, B was at 30%. Acquisition of data was carried out on a high-resolution mass spectrometer, Orbitrap Fusion (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source. Auxiliary gas and ESI sheath gas were 20 and 60, respectively. The negative and positive spray voltage was 3000 V. For a full MS run, 120k resolution was used with automatic gain control (AGC) targeted of 200,000 and mass ranges between 250 and 1200. The resolution was kept at 30K with AGC target 50,000 for Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Collision energy for fragmentation used was 27 ± 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Lipid data analysis</title><p>LipidMatch Flow was utilized with default settings for peak picking (using mzmine), lipid annotation, blank filtration, and combining positive and negative data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koelmel et al., 2017</xref>).

Thereafter, the mixture was vortexed for 1 min and kept on ice for protein precipitation. After centrifugation (10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C), the supernatant was collected and distributed in two tubes for polar and nonpolar metabolite analysis. The collected supernatants were then dried using a speed vacuum for 20–25 min at RT and stored at –80°C till further analysis. For the reverse phase, metabolites were dissolved in 15% methanol in water (v/v), and for polar metabolite analysis, samples were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile in water (v/v).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Measurement of metabolites</title><p>Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with heated electrospray ion source was used for data acquisition.

Briefly for MS1 mode, mass resolution was kept at 120,000, and for MS2 acquisition, mass resolution was 30,000. Mass range of data acquisition was 60–900 Da. Extracted metabolites were separated on UHPLC UltiMate 3000. Data were acquired on both reverse phase and HILIC column and positive and negative ionization mode. The reverse phase column was HSS T3, and the HILIC column was XBridge BEH Amide (Waters Corporation). For polar compound separation, solvent A was 20 mM ammonium acetate in the water of pH 9.0 and mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile. The elution gradient started from 85% B to 10% B over 14 min with a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. For the reverse phase, solvent A was water and solvent B was methanol with 0.1% formic acid added in both. The elution gradient started with 1% B to 95% B over 10 min with a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The sample injection volume was 5 µl. A pool quality control (QC) sample was run after every five samples to monitor signal variation and drift in mass error.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Data processing</title><p>All LC/MS acquired data has been processed using the Progenesis QI for metabolomics (Waters Corporation) software using default settings. The untargeted workflow of Progenesis QI was used to perform retention time alignment, feature detection, deconvolution, and elemental composition prediction. Metascore plug of Progenesis QI has been used for the in-house library with accurate mass, fragmentation pattern, and retention time for database search. We have also used an online available spectral library for further confirmation of identification. The cutoff for retention time match was 0.5 min, and spectral similarity was more than 30% fragmentation match in Progenesis QI. Peaks that had a coefficient of variation (CV) less than 30% in pool QC samples were kept for the further analysis of data. Additionally, manual verification of each detected feature has been done for the selection of the right peaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Lipidomics and metabolomics data analysis</title><p>For both metabolomics and lipidomics data, the data was cleaned up to remove zero intensity values.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, &quot;Immunological and cardio-vascular pathologies associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden syrian hamster&quot;, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>There are many outstanding aspects of this work that the authors are commended for. The model clearly reproduces lung pathology attributed to this diseases and to this animal model, the immunological aspects are outstanding and the lipidomics and metabolomics-based studies are an outstanding and novel aspect, but on their own they do not yet tell a cohesive story or explain the histological findings that the authors need to stress..</p><p>The main area of weakness, which would have represented the potentially most significant and novel aspect of this work, relates to the cardiac histology findings. The quality of the images does not lend itself to the interpretations currently made and many helpful suggestions have been made by the reviewers that could help the authors pursue this issue and this generate a very high quality contribution to the field that will be of very wide interest. So overall the reviewers feel this work has tremendous potential</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors aim to show that hamsters may be a useful model of SARS CoV-2 long-term sequelae or &quot;long COVID.&quot; The authors present useful data on many aspects of acute SARS CoV-2 in hamsters that are not well demonstrated in the literature such as gene expression of major regulators of inflammation, lipidomics, metabolomics, and antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell responses which are important features of SARS CoV-2 in this model with translational potential if hamsters are used to test therapeutics aimed at preventing long COVID sequelae. However, the pathologic data that is presented to link both the lipidomics and metabolomics to extrapulmonary pathology suggestive of long COVID is weak. This study would greatly benefit from the addition of a treatment group or extended study timeline to support the claim that hamsters model key aspects of long COVID as seen in people. The lack of convincing pathology undermines the authors' model that lipidomic and metabolic changes are supportive of hamsters as a translational model of long COVID.</p><p>Overall-there is lack of description on scoring systems for histology. The methods state that pathology assessment was performed by a histologist (?)--pathology should be reviewed by a blinded veterinary pathologist. The data presented to show cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation is not convincing. The pathology images are very low resolution and the fibrosis and inflammation cannot be observed clearly (if present). Control (sham infected, procedure-matched) and age matched tissue specimens are not shown. Organ weights for spleen and heart are not shown (preferably need to see organ/body weight measurements). Heart weight is the gold standard for cardiac hypertrophy-without this measure cardiac hypertrophy cannot be diagnosed; at a minimum measurement of the interventricular septum should be shown-the images do not convincingly show differences over time.</p><p>Ln 155: The images of mast cells are not clear-how was this scored (counts/high power field?). Please show control animals (not just time 0).</p><p>Likewise increased mucin staining in the GI tract is also not convincing. Please show controls over time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>There are many published studies in which golden Syrian hamsters (GSH) are used as a small animal model for human SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathology. In this study, Rizvi, Zaigham Abbas et al. investigated several aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection of GSHs, with an emphasis on the usefulness of the model to study cardiovascular complications in human COVID-19. From in silico analyses, they confirm with more detail than previous reports that hamster angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) interactions with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are predicted to be very similar to human ACE-2 interactions, and they show novel data that predict hamster neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) interaction with spike protein are similar to human NRP-1 interactions. A shortcoming of this analysis is lack of biochemical or blocking studies, either in vivo or in vitro to establish of NP is an important receptor for viral infection of hamster cells. The authors histological and gene expression analysis of pulmonary pathology convincingly recapitulates the severe but resolving inflammatory lung disease in the hamsters that has been described in other publications, validating to relevance of the model in their hands before exploring extrapulmonary manifestations. The lung studies here also added some limited new findings that type 2 inflammation with mast cell activation and eotaxin are prominent in the hamster, which has also been implicated in some human studies.</p><p>Analyses of serum antibodies specific for viral RBD, spike and N proteins, spleen size, splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> IFN-γ+ T cell numbers, and splenocyte mRNA expression all demonstrated a vigorous systemic immune/inflammatory responses, with most parameters peaking by day 2 after intranasal infection, and returning to baseline by day 14, while the serum anti-viral IgG titers showed continuous elevation from d2 to d14. Although the interrogation of immunological responses was limited in scope, especially with respect to local tissue responses, and lack of single cell omic analyses, the results are sufficient to establish the similarity of the post infection disease in the authors hands with previous hamster reports and to compare with comparable human parameters, again validating the relevance of looking at metabolic and cardiovascular parameters not previously explored.</p><p>A major strength of this study is the intent to study cardiovascular complications in the hamster model, and to this end the authors focused on heart histopathology and serum lipids that are known to associate with human cardiovascular disease. The analysis of heart tissue was limited to H&amp;E and Mason Trichome stained sections, to assess morphologic changes in myocardium and intramyocardial blood vessels, myocardial inflammation, and fibrosis. The interpretation that there is myocardial hypertrophy, increased coronary fibrosis, and increased inflammation in infected mice at days 7 and 14 is questionable based on the images shown in Figure 4, which appear to represent one section of one heart for each time point. Quantitative image analyses of the histopathogical parameters, including the hearts from the 9 animals sacrificed at each time point would help is assessing the significance of the findings. The images shown suggest some perivascular fibrosis, even at day 0, and mild perivascular inflammation, although the resolution of the images limits interpretation. Additional data showing cardiac inflammation and myocardial dysfunction by other methods would be helpful, such as transcriptional analysis, immunohistochemistry, or flow-cytometry of cardiac cell suspensions. Each or all could help substantiate the authors conclusions. A relevant but unanswered question is if there is viral infection of cardiac cells in their experimental animals, as myocyte SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in a few recent papers. The acute changes in blood cholesterol, lipoproteins, and triglycerides only seen at day 4, shown in Figure 4, are unlikely to have any consequences on long term vascular pathology or any myocardial pathology that may be present at day 7 or 14. Extremely elevated cholesterol levels over many weeks can lead to arterial atherosclerosis in some experimental rodent models, rarely resulting in myocardial ischemic injury, but there is no evidence of atherosclerosis or ischemic myocardial injury in this study.</p><p>The extensive blood lipidomic and metabolic analyses on the hamsters at different time points after infection, and comparison of with lipid and metabolite changes associated with human COVD-19 patients, is a major strength and novel aspect of this study. The value of these types of data in developing biomarkers of disease severity and risk for long term sequalae to infection remains to be determined, but the findings here help establish the value of the hamster model for such purposes. Nonetheless, these data are descriptive, and the causal connection of changes in any of the lipids or metabolites with putative cardiovascular pathologies is tenuous.</p><p>Overall, the authors succeeded in showing how the hamster model can be useful to study systemic extra -pulmonic pathologies and systemic metabolic changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The data shown do not make a compelling case for the hamster model to study long term effects of infection outside the lung, given that the longest time point examined was d14, and the cardiac/vascular data were not robust. Furthermore, most of the cardiovascular complications that have been reported in COVD patients concern thrombosis, yet this report does not show any evidence of thrombotic complications in the hamsters.</p><p>The possibility that cardiac cells in experimental animals are infected by SARS-CoV-2 should be tested. Recent reports that cardiac myocytes can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, including hamster myocytes (Chen, S et al. SARS-CoV-2 Infected Cardiomyocytes Recruit Monocytes by Secreting CCL2. Res Sq. 2020 doi: 10.21203/rs.3.rs-94634/v1; Marchiano, S et al. SARS-CoV-2 Infects Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes, Impairing Electrical and Mechanical Function. Stem Cell Reports. 2021 Mar 9;16(3):478-492. doi: 10.1016/j.stemcr.2021.02.008.)</p><p>Cardiac hypertrophy is best assessed by heart weight, and a second best way is to do careful quantitative analysis of left ventricular wall thickness on cross sections from all animals in each group.

This is a well-established model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection. The authors also examine changes in splenic inflammatory related molecules, serum lipid molecules and serum metabolites.</p><p>The major strength of the work is the attempt to perform detailed analyses of the extrapulmonary organs combined with splenic inflammatory changes, metabolomics and lipidomics in the setting of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection in an animal model.</p><p>The major weakness of this work is that often the histologic changes being reported, particularly in the heart, are not well supported by the data provided. In addition, more rigorous statistical approaches could be employed, and there is no clear mechanism proposed to link the changes in the splenic inflammation, serum lipidomics, and serum metabolomics with the proposed cardiac changes.</p><p>1. There are numerous studies now on SARS-CoV-2 in the hamster. There should be much better effort relating this work to the published literature, particularly stressing what is novel and what is not. It is not clear if any of the pulmonary studies being reported here are actually novel.</p><p>2. The authors claim: &quot;Strikingly, SARS-CoV2 infection in the hamster leads to significant interstitial coronary fibrosis on 7 and 14 dpi characterized by thickening of ventricular walls interventricular septum.&quot; and later: &quot;The ventricular walls thickening at 7 and 14 dpi with SARS-CoV2 infection in GSH was marked by increased inflammation surrounding the coronary artery and elevated interstitial coronary fibrosis (Figures 4B, 4C).&quot; However, the cardiac changes being reported are simply not supported by the images provided. Heart weights and wall thicknesses need to be measured and compared across the groups using statistics. Also, cardiac fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration should be quantified and comparted across the groups using statistics. Better images showing clear changes correlating with the quantitative analyses would be required.</p><p>3. The authors state &quot;…we reasoned that cardio-vascular pathologies of SARS-CoV2 in GSH may be related to changes in circulating lipid molecules (Bruzzone et 240 al., 2020; D. Wu et al., 2020). Indeed, serum lipid profile showed elevated cholesterol, TGs,HDL, LDL and VLDL levels at 4 dpi (Figure 4D).&quot; However, the changes in serum lipids were very transient and unlikely to rapidly cause cardiac fibrosis. There is no clear logical mechanism being present linking the serum lipid levels with the proposed cardiac changes.</p><p>4. For all of the studies performed including the lipidomics and metabolomic studies the authors simply us a P-value of less than 0.05 as being statistically significant with no adjustment for multiple assessments or consideration of FDR. A more sophisticated statical approach is needed.</p><p>5. The spleens need to be weighed and the weights compared across the groups using statistics.</p><p>6. There are frequent statements in the discussion that simply do not match the data shown. For example, the authors state: &quot;Our data show that lung pathologies long persists after the virus clearance from the lung since we observed a high pathological score on 7 dpi.&quot; However, the authors own data show that the virus is still present at 7 dpi.</p><p>7. All figure panels need proper labels, particularly both axes of any plots.</p><p>8. In Figure S4, the degree of mucin staining in the images does not appear to match that shown in the bar graphs. The scale for the scale bars is not legible. For Panel B the images marked &quot;liver&quot; are not liver, and the images marked &quot;kidney&quot; are not kidney.</p><p>9. There should be some rational mechanism linking the splenic inflammatory cell changes, lipidomics and metabolomics with the proposed cardiac changes.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Golden Syrian hamster as a model to study cardiovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV2 infection&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The data clearly highlights metabolic changes that support the exploration of using the hamster model for cardiovascular complications of COVID. The data for histopathologic evidence for cardiovascular changes remain unconvincing at the timepoints shown. I believe a longer-term study following hamsters for greater than 14 days would be more biologically relevant for histopathologic changes. Regardless, the biochemical and immunologic data support the use of this model for studying cardiovascular changes.</p><p>The authors have addressed all the concerns raised. Unfortunately, the histopathologic data, although shown as significant via scoring, is still not biologically convincing. The heart weight to body weight index tracks for infected animals only. The ventricular width should have been done quantitatively and not semi quantitatively (scoring) to be convincing. The appropriate statistical comparison would be heart mass/body mass of infected to uninfected animals at each time point assayed.

However, the pathologic data that is presented to link both the lipidomics and metabolomics to extrapulmonary pathology suggestive of long COVID is weak. This study would greatly benefit from the addition of a treatment group or extended study timeline to support the claim that hamsters model key aspects of long COVID as seen in people. The lack of convincing pathology undermines the authors' model that lipidomic and metabolic changes are supportive of hamsters as a translational model of long COVID.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the in-depth review of our manuscript and critical comments to improve the manuscript. In line with the reviewers suggested, we have now included new experimental data from remdesivir therapeutic group (Figure S3D and S3E). Remdesivir is a previously known anti-viral drug that shows good efficacy in hamster. In line, we observed significant decrease in heart viral load in remdesivir treated challenged hamsters as compared to no remdesivir group. The serum cardiac troponin I level, which is a biomarker for CVC also was downregulated in remdesivir group. In addition, we have also included the ventricular mass/ body mass ratio as per the suggestion of the reviewers (Figure S3B). The assessment score for the histopathologies have been included in Figure 3. Wherever possible, we have now included blinded scores by trained pathologist for quantitation of the histological images.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall-there is lack of description on scoring systems for histology. The methods state that pathology assessment was performed by a histologist (?)--pathology should be reviewed by a blinded veterinary pathologist. The data presented to show cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation is not convincing. The pathology images are very low resolution and the fibrosis and inflammation cannot be observed clearly (if present). Control (sham infected, procedure-matched) and age matched tissue specimens are not shown. Organ weights for spleen and heart are not shown (preferably need to see organ/body weight measurements). Heart weight is the gold standard for cardiac hypertrophy-without this measure cardiac hypertrophy cannot be diagnosed; at a minimum measurement of the interventricular septum should be shown-the images do not convincingly show differences over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We are thankful for the critical comments.

The data shown do not make a compelling case for the hamster model to study long term effects of infection outside the lung, given that the longest time point examined was d14, and the cardiac/vascular data were not robust. Furthermore, most of the cardiovascular complications that have been reported in COVD patients concern thrombosis, yet this report does not show any evidence of thrombotic complications in the hamsters.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the in-depth review of the manuscript and critical comments for improving the quality of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The possibility that cardiac cells in experimental animals are infected by SARS-CoV-2 should be tested.

In addition, more rigorous statistical approaches could be employed, and there is no clear mechanism proposed to link the changes in the splenic inflammation, serum lipidomics, and serum metabolomics with the proposed cardiac changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for the critically reviewing our manuscript and helping us improve the quality of the manuscript. We have now incorporated histological assessment data in the manuscript to support histology readout. We have also performed new experiments and evaluated cardiovascular markers and heart viral load to strengthen our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There are numerous studies now on SARS-CoV-2 in the hamster. There should be much better effort relating this work to the published literature, particularly stressing what is novel and what is not. It is not clear if any of the pulmonary studies being reported here are actually novel.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking this question. It is true that SARS-CoV2 associated lung pathologies have been earlier reported in human and hamsters. However, in the present study we have tried to evaluate the other factors which are associated with lung injury such as Eotaxin, AGAR which have been previously shown to contribute to lung pathologies (Figure 1G). We have also evaluated the expression of mast cell functionality and it was found to be upregulated at the peak of infection. To our best of knowledge, these parameters have not been reported before for the hamsters SARS-CoV2 challenge study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors claim: “Strikingly, SARS-CoV2 infection in the hamster leads to significant interstitial coronary fibrosis on 7 and 14 dpi characterized by thickening of ventricular walls interventricular septum.” And later: “The ventricular walls thickening at 7 and 14 dpi with SARS-CoV2 infection in GSH was marked by increased inflammation surrounding the coronary artery and elevated interstitial coronary fibrosis (Figures 4B, 4C).” However, the cardiac changes being reported are simply not supported by the images provided. Heart weights and wall thicknesses need to be measured and compared across the groups using statistics. Also, cardiac fibrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration should be quantified and comparted across the groups using statistics. Better images showing clear changes correlating with the quantitative analyses would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for asking us to evaluate the heart weight/ body weight ratio which is a standard method for evaluating ventricular hypertrophy. We have now included new sets of data from recently completed experiment and have incorporated new data on heart viral load, heart weight/body weight ratio and serum cardiac troponin-I levels. Furthermore, we have included the histological assessment data in the form of blinded scoring by trained pathologist. The method of scoring has also been described in the methodology section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors state “…we reasoned that cardio-vascular pathologies of SARS-CoV2 in GSH may be related to changes in circulating lipid molecules (Bruzzone et 240 al., 2020; D. Wu et al., 2020). Indeed, serum lipid profile showed elevated cholesterol, TGs,HDL, LDL and VLDL levels at 4 dpi (Figure 4D).” However, the changes in serum lipids were very transient and unlikely to rapidly cause cardiac fibrosis. There is no clear logical mechanism being present linking the serum lipid levels with the proposed cardiac changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the valuable suggestion. We have now incorporated new data set from recent studies in which we have evaluated both viral load and serum cardiac troponin-I level in circulation that could be an valuable markers for validating cardiovascular pathologies in SARS-CoV2 infected hamsters. Furthermore, we have also added a histological assessment data based on blinded random scoring by trained pathologist to support the quantitative assessment of cardio-vascular histopathologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. For all of the studies performed including the lipidomics and metabolomic studies the authors simply us a P-value of less than 0.05 as being statistically significant with no adjustment for multiple assessments or consideration of FDR. A more sophisticated statical approach is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern raised by the reviewers. The FDR correction has been incorporated for the omnics data and a statement describing FDR correction has been incorporated in the methodology section (Page 34, line number 658).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The spleens need to be weighed and the weights compared across the groups using statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this critical suggestion. We have not included the spleen weight/ body weight data in the main figure panel to support the splenomegaly condition arising due to SARS-CoV2 infection (Figure 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. There are frequent statements in the discussion that simply do not match the data shown. For example, the authors state: “Our data show that lung pathologies long persists after the virus clearance from the lung since we observed a high pathological score on 7 dpi.” However, the authors own data show that the virus is still present at 7 dpi.</p></disp-quote><p>We regret for the ambiguity in the statement. We have now corrected the statement to make it simpler and unambiguous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. All figure panels need proper labels, particularly both axes of any plots.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this concern. We have rechecked the figures of the manuscript and have added the axis wherever it was missing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. In Figure S4, the degree of mucin staining in the images does not appear to match that shown in the bar graphs. The scale for the scale bars is not legible. For Panel B the images marked “liver” are not liver, and the images marked “kidney” are not kidney.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the limitations of the study. Since we have now revised the manuscript focusing on the cardiovascular and lipido-metabolomics changes we feel that other extra-pulmonary pathologies do not fit with the main theme of the study. Therefore, we have removed histology data for the other organs from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. There should be some rational mechanism linking the splenic inflammatory cell changes, lipidomics and metabolomics with the proposed cardiac changes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We have improved the manuscript in line with the suggestions made and have tried to connect the immunological and cardiovascular changes with other parameters studied. In line with this, we have improved the introduction and Discussion section focusing on the pathological changes associated with SARS-CoV2 infection and molecular factors that maybe involved in the pathologies. For example, inflammatory cytokines contribute to lung pathologies and further IL6 and some other cytokines and chemokines have also been described as contributors for CVC. CVC is usually associated with injuries to cardiomyocytes which may happen due to accumulation of cholesterol, LDLs and LCFAs in the circulation. Furthermore, N-acetylneuraminate metabolite levels have been previously linked with CVC condition in clinical settings.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Revise statistical analyses using non-parametric approaches as suggested.</p><p>2) Minimize or remove connections made to long COVID- the evidence is not strong enough that this is a model.</p><p>3) Include recent references as suggested.</p><p>4) Extensive editing of grammar and syntax is absolutely necessary.</p><p>5) Make MS readouts legible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments which will help in improving the quality of the manuscript.
