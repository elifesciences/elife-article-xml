viability and functionality of neurons. HAT (histone acetyltransferase) and HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors have been applied to treat neurological deficits in humans; yet, the epigenetic regulation in neurodegeneration remains elusive. Mutations of HAT cofactor TRRAP (ransformation/translation domain-associated protein) cause human neuropathies, including psychosis, intellectual disability, autism, and epilepsy, with unknown mechanism. Here we show that Trrap deletion in Purkinje neurons results in neurodegeneration of old mice. Integrated transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics reveal that TRRAP via SP1 conducts a conserved transcriptomic program. TRRAP is required for SP1 binding at the promoter proximity of target genes, especially microtubule dynamics. The ectopic expression of Stathmin3/4 ameliorates defects of TRRAP-deficient neurons, indicating that the microtubule dynamics is particularly vulnerable to the action of SP1 activity. This study unravels a network linking three well-known, but up-to-date unconnected, signaling pathways, namely TRRAP, HAT, and SP1 with microtubule dynamics, in neuroprotection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell lines</kwd><kwd>TRRAP</kwd><kwd>SP1</kwd><kwd>Brain</kwd><kwd>stathmins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoc Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tapias</surname><given-names>Alicia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lázaro</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Trrap-HAT-Sp1 axis operates a conserved transcriptional program to control proper microtubule dynamics in brain homeostasis and prevents neurodegeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are a range of incurable and debilitating conditions strongly linked with age, which represent a social and economic burden given the burgeoning elderly population. The key features of the brain are its adaptability and plasticity, which facilitate rapid, coordinated responses to changes in the environment, all of which require delicate brain functionality and maintenance. Progressive neuronal loss, synaptic deficits, disintegration of neuronal networks due to axonal and dendritic retraction, and failure of neurological functions are hallmarks of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palop et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2018</xref>). Molecular causes of neurodegeneration are believed to include protein misfolding and degradation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Palop et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kurtishi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burté et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, non-coding or small RNAs, have been linked to brain development and neurological disorders, such as autism, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy, as well as neurodegenerative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meaney and Ferguson-Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christopher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tapias and Wang, 2017</xref>). Histone acetylation, which is modulated by a range of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) families, is a major epigenetic modification controlling a wide range of cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tapias and Wang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choudhary et al., 2014</xref>). HATs and histone deacetylases (HDACs) maintain a proper acetylation kinetics of histones, yet also other protein substrates, which can coordinate histone dynamics over large regions of chromatin to regulate the global gene expression as well as target gene-specific regions or promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vogelauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nagy and Tora, 2007</xref>). HAT-HDAC-mediated histone modifications have been suggested to play a role in brain functionality, including memory formation, mood, drug addiction, and neuroprotection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meaney and Ferguson-Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christopher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delgado-Morales et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Levenson and Sweatt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renthal and Nestler, 2008</xref>). For example, the pharmacological inhibition of HDACs has been used for their anti-epileptic, anti-convulsive, and mood-stabilizing effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, HDAC inhibitors or HAT activators have been employed in clinics to treat the neurological symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, as well as autism, memory loss, and cognitive function, although not always successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christopher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delgado-Morales et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Selvi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganai et al., 2016</xref>). Genome-wide approaches have revealed global and local changes in multiple histone marks; yet, the impact and meaning of these alterations in the pathophysiological processes are obscure. A major hurdle is the lack of specificity of these pharmacological interventions causing adverse side effects in clinical treatment. Interestingly, alterations of the acetylation profiles have been found in neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington’s disease (HD) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Valor, 2017</xref>), Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garbes et al., 2013</xref>), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kernochan et al., 2005</xref>), Parkinson’s disease (PD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harrison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2016</xref>), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marzi et al., 2018</xref>). These findings highlight the involvement of HATs in the etiology of neurodegenerative processes, yet through various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobos et al., 2019</xref>). Although widely discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saha and Pahan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Konsoula and Barile, 2012</xref>), the role of histone acetylation and deacetylation in the adult central nervous system (CNS) and brain homeostasis remains largely unknown.</p><p>To gain insight into how the alteration of histone acetylation maintains neuronal homeostasis and prevents neurodegeneration, we used mouse and cellular models, in which the HAT essential cofactor TRRAP is deleted, so that the general HAT activity is disturbed. TRRAP (transformation/transcription domain-associated protein) interacts with E2F1 and c-Myc at gene promoters and is a critical component shared by several HAT complexes, including those from the GNAT and MYST families, which facilitates the recruitment of HAT complexes to target proteins for acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tapias and Wang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knutson and Hahn, 2011</xref>). The complete deletion of Trrap in mice and cells is incompatible with the life of proliferating cells and mouse development, because of severe defects in the spindle checkpoint and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herceg et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhanalakshmi et al., 2004</xref>). A tissue specific deletion of Trrap in embryonic neural stem cells leads to a dysregulation of the cell cycle length which drives the premature differentiation of neuroprogenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tapias et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, missense variants of TRRAP have been recently reported to associate with neuropathological symptoms, including psychosis, ID, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cogné et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mavros et al., 2018</xref>). These basic and clinical studies point to a potential involvement of TRRAP in the manifestation of these neuropathies in humans. Because the known function of TRRAP in the mitotic checkpoint and cell cycle control does not apply to postmitotic cells, i.e., neurons, how TRRAP and its mediated HAT regulate adult neuronal fitness and affect neurodegeneration remains elusive.</p><p>In this study, we attempt to elucidate the molecular pathways that are governed by Trrap-HAT in postmitotic neural tissues. We find that Trrap deletion in the mouse model (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) causes an age-dependent loss of existing neurons leading to neurodegeneration. We show that Trrap-HAT specifically regulates the Sp1 pathway that controls various neural processes, among which microtubule dynamics is particularly affected. Our study discloses the Trrap-HAT-Sp1 axis as a novel regulator of neuronal arborization and neuroprotection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Trrap</italic> deletion in Purkinje cells results in cerebellar degeneration</title><p>To study the role of histone acetylation and Trrap in postmitotic neurons, we generated two mouse models.

To understand through which transcription factors Trrap was mediating its function, we performed a transcription factor binding site (TFBS) enrichment analysis on the common DEGs in Trrap-deleted cortices and striata. We found that most of these transcriptional changes after Trrap deletion were mediated mainly by limited transcription factors, among which transcription factors Sp1 and TCFs appeared to be the most relevant upstream factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Transcription factors TCF1, TCF3, and NFAT are known effectors of the Wnt signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cadigan and Waterman, 2012</xref>) and were indeed downstream of the Sp1-mediated transcription regulation upon Trrap deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We attempted to analyze the transcriptional activity of Sp1 in the absence of Trrap. To achieve this, we had to adopt an in vitro culture approach and used replicating adult neural stem cells (aNSCs) from <italic>Trrap</italic><sup>f/f</sup> mice expressing the CreER<sup>T2</sup> transgene (<italic>Rosa26</italic>-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(cre/ERT2)Tyj</sup>) (designated as Trrap-iΔ). Addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) in cultured Trrap-iΔ NSCs induced an efficient deletion of Trrap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). We first validated the transcriptome of aNSCs in comparison with that of Trrap-FBΔ cortex and striatum and found 1261 common DEGs among these three samples.

Thus, Trrap-HAT regulates a very conserved transcriptomic network in different brain regions as well as in NSCs. Using these cells, we then performed a luciferase reporter assay to investigate whether Sp1 is directly regulated by Trrap and detected a dramatic decrease in Sp1 activity in Trrap-deleted NSCs, compared to control cells. Strikingly, ectopic overexpression of Sp1 in Trrap-deleted cells failed to activate the Sp1-reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Depletion of Trrap led to a downregulation of 2274 AcH3 and 1355 AcH4 peaks that were associated with coding genes (equivalent to 10% of the most depleted regions in TrrapΔ versus controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Only 12.6% and 10.2% respectively of these depleted peaks correlated with changes in the RNA level of the corresponding genes in Trrap-FBΔ brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). ChIP-seq analyses revealed no significant difference of AcH3 on Sp1-site between control and Trrap-deleted aNSCs, whereas H4Ac on Sp1-site in control (mean = 12.37) is slightly lower than in Trrap mutants (mean = 12.54) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Interestingly, the downregulated genes had a significantly lower acetylation level of H3 and H4 in the Sp1 promoter area in Trrap deleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Twenty-two genes exhibited downregulated histone H3 and H4 acetylation and were also downregulated in the RNA-seq from brains.

The microtubule dynamics proteins STMN3 (SCLIP) and STMN4 (RB3) are of special interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>), because microtubule dynamics have been proposed to be involved in brain homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chauvin and Sobel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>) and defects in microtubule dynamics often cause axonal swellings and dendrite retraction in postmitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voelzmann et al., 2016</xref>).

Western blot analysis also confirmed a great reduction of both STMN3 and STMN4 proteins in Trrap-deleted forebrains at P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We next turned our analysis to our neurodegeneration model Trrap-PCΔ mice. Co-staining of STMN3 or STMN4 with calbindin in the brain sections detected a significant decrease of both proteins in Trrap-deleted Purkinje cells compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). To explore the mechanism, ChIP-seq was performed and showed that the level of AcH3 and AcH4 at the promoters of these genes was greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1g</xref>). To validate the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, we performed ChIP experiments in brain samples and found both Sp1 binding and histone H4 acetylation were enriched at the STMN3 and STMN4 promoters in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Upon Trrap deletion there was a dramatic decrease in Sp1 binding, as well as in the acetylation of histone H4 in the STMN3 and STMN4 promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). We also noted that Trrap deletion did not change the H3K4<sup>m2</sup> level in the STMN3 promoter, yet decreased mildly in the STMN4 promoter. Moreover, Trrap deficiency did not compromise binding of Sp1-unrelated transcription factor Oct4 at the promoter proximities of these STMNs genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). These data together indicate an essentiality of Trrap for loading Sp1 and HATs to the promoters of these Sp1 target genes. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated Sp1 knockdown indeed decreased expression of STMN3 and STMN4 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

To investigate if Trrap deficiency especially affecting neuronal homeostasis was indeed mediated by STMNs, first we knocked down Trrap by siRNAs in primary neurons isolated from wild-type E16.5 cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), co-transfected with GFP or STMNs 3- or 4-expressing vectors at day 6 in vitro culture (DIV6), designated day 0 post transfection (DPT0), and analyzed the neuronal phenotype at DPT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the Trrap knockdown evidently reduced the neurite length and the branching numbers of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). This was also confirmed by the IncuCyte assay at DPT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c,d</xref>), which allows scoring a large number of cells. These findings indicate that Trrap deficiency also compromises neuronal arborization in vitro. To examine whether the downregulation of STMNs is indeed responsible for the neuropathies of Trrap deleted neurons, we ectopically expressed STMN3 in Trrap knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Intriguingly, ectopic expression of STMN3 is sufficient to rescue these neuronal defects caused by Trrap knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Similarly, ectopic expression of STMN4 also corrected the neurite length and branching defects in Trrap knockdown primary neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Interestingly, we note a co-upregulation of both STMNs when either STMN3 or STMN4 was overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>), which suggests a co-stabilization or cooperative action of both STMNs in microtubule dynamics in the brain; yet the underlying mechanism requires further investigation.

A loss of control of these processes prompts age-related neurological deficits, including neurodegeneration. Various mechanisms, including protein folding/stability, neuroinflammations, or DNA damage accumulation, have been implicated in the maintenance of brain homoeostasis and functionality. The acetylation modulations of proteins have been proposed to be important for the maintenance and function of neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tapias and Wang, 2017</xref>) as well as in neurodegenerative disorders, including HD, AD, PD, and ALS, yet through different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cobos et al., 2019</xref>). These studies highlight the involvement of HATs in the etiology of neurodegenerative processes. Despite the assumption that HAT/HDAC conducts a general regulatory function in transcription, how acetylation and deacetylation modulate the functionality, fitness, and even the survival of adult neurons is largely unknown. The current study shows that the HAT cofactor TRRAP is vital for preventing neurodegeneration of the Trrap-PCΔ mouse model. Trrap is an essential gene in proliferating cells because a Trrap null mutation causes lethality in cells and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herceg et al., 2001</xref>). Unexpectedly, the deletion of Trrap in postmitotic neural cells (i.e., Purkinje neurons) is compatible with life, but elicits a full range of age-dependent neurodegenerative symptoms – axonal demyelination, dendrite retraction, progressive neuronal death, reactive astrogliosis, and the activation of microglial cells. Trrap deletion in non-dividing neurons, avoiding lethality, allows the identification of Sp1 as a specific master regulator, which is under the control of Trrap-HAT, to ensure proper neuronal arborization and to prevent neuron loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Although our omics studies detect a range of genes that have been altered, microtubule dynamics seems to be particularly vulnerable to Trrap deletion, because the major changes in the Trrap deleted brains are the processes involving microtubule dynamics and that ectopic expression of microtubule destabilizing proteins STMNs can largely ameliorate the arborization defects of Trrap-deficient neurons.</p><p>The TFBS enrichment analysis of these commonly dysregulated genes in Trrap-deleted brains points to selective transcription programs of the Trrap-HAT downstream. Our integrated omics analyses revealed a remarkable commonality of Trrap-HAT-regulated genes via Sp1 in the neurons of the cortex and striatum, and even with neural stem cells. Intriguingly, the Sp1 pathway is on the top of the changes by Trrap deletion and Trrap is required for the Sp1 transcriptional activity. The action of Trrap-HAT in postmitotic neurons is to regulate, via Sp1, the expression of neuroprotection and brain homeostasis genes, among which microtubule dynamics is most affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Noelanders and Vleminckx, 2017</xref>). Although we have not completely confirmed that all these molecular pathways governed by Trrap-HAT-Sp1 in pyramidal neurons (Trrap-FBΔ mice) would be identical in Purkinje neurons (due to the technical limitation), STMN3/4 were indeed downregulated in Trrap-PCΔ models. In agreement with the ChIP data, knockdown of Sp1 repressed STMN3/4 expression. Thus, it is likely that the Sp1-mediated specific transcriptome could also function in the prevention of neurodegeneration.</p><p>Sp1 is a master transcription factor binding to the GC box of promoters and can also regulate by itself. It has many downstream target genes, among which the regulation of cancer and cell proliferation have been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Davie, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vizcaíno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suske, 2017</xref>). However, the upstream regulatory mechanism of Sp1 has not been defined previously. Here we show that Trrap-HAT is upstream of Sp1 and has a specific regulatory role in the Sp1-mediated transcription. Although Sp1 has been reported to bind to the promoter of some genes in neural cells, such as Slit2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saunders et al., 2016</xref>), P2 × 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">García-Huerta et al., 2012</xref>), and Reelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), it has not been linked directly with neural development and degeneration. Our transcriptome analyses reveal that many neurological processes are indeed regulated by Sp1 downstream targets, many of which are connected with microtubule dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1A</xref>). For example, Trrap facilitates Sp1 binding to the gene loci of the microtubule destabilizing proteins STMN3 and STMN4. These findings are particularly interesting, because Sp1 has been implicated in neurodegeneration disorders; yet previously published data are often controversial. A GWAS analysis detected Sp1 among candidates mediating transcriptional activity changes in AD and PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ramanan and Saykin, 2013</xref>). Sp1 seems to prevent neurotoxicity in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunah et al., 2002</xref>), whereas others showed that a downregulation is protective in HD development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qiu et al., 2006</xref>). Sp1 is found upregulated in AD patients and also in an AD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Citron et al., 2008</xref>); however, when it was chemically inhibited, memory deficits were even enhanced in AD transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Citron et al., 2015</xref>), ruling out an instrumental role of Sp1 in AD. These controversial findings are perhaps not surprising, because the expression changes of the Sp1 gene and protein can be regulated by multiple mechanisms, such as transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, and posttranscriptional modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li and Davie, 2010</xref>), or can be secondary to the manifestation of disease processes in a very heterogenous genetic background in human studies.</p><p>Our analyses identify the Trrap-HAT-Sp1 axis as a specific regulator of the microtubule dynamics process. Microtubules dynamics, coordinated, but mainly, by a destabilizing processing of microtubules, is a crucial regulator of neurite outgrowth, the maintenance of neuronal morphology and cargo transport along axons, and thereby of brain homeostasis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chauvin and Sobel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voelzmann et al., 2016</xref>). The destabilizing factors STMNs play an important yet distinct function in neuronal homeostasis. Defects in microtubule dynamics can cause axonal swellings and dendrite retraction; both processes of neurodegeneration and the misregulation of STMNs have been associated with neuron abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dubey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voelzmann et al., 2016</xref>). Trrap deletion greatly downregulates STMN3 and STMN4 in Purkinje cells and also in the forebrains. This finding is particularly interesting because that STMN3 and STMN4 express preferentially high during adult life than STMN1 and STMN2 (SCG10), suggesting their important functions in neuronal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chauvin and Sobel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Voelzmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ozon et al., 1998</xref>). The repression of STMN3 suppresses the Purkinje cell neurite growth and arborization; when overexpressed, it promotes dendritic elongation and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Poulain et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast to STMN3, the role of STMN4 in neuronal morphogenesis and arborization has not been extensively studied. Moreover, STMN1 knockout mice showed an age-dependent axonopathy, characterized by a progressive degeneration of axons and demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liedtke et al., 2002</xref>). Also, an overexpression of STMN2 has been shown to enhance neurite outgrowth by favoring microtubules disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morii et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that downregulation of STMN3 and STMN4 is responsible for axonal swellings and the dendrite retraction of <italic>Trrap</italic>-deleted Purkinje cells. This conclusion is further supported by our genetic knockdown and rescue experiments showing that an ectopic expression of either STMN3 or STMN4 can effectively rescue the defects of neurite length and branching of primary cortical neurons, which are caused by Trrap knockdown. However, an in vivo rescue of neuron loss in Trrap-PCΔ mice has been impossible due to a technique limitation. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate an instrumental role of the Trrap-Sp1-mediated transcriptional control of microtubule dynamics, likely via STMNs, in neuronal morphogenesis and preventing neurite retraction.</p><p>Very recently, human patients carrying de novo mutations of TRRAP are reported to be associated with neuropathological symptoms, such as ID, ASD, and epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cogné et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mavros et al., 2018</xref>). Although molecular pathways have not been investigated in these genetic studies, our findings hint at the Sp1 transcription regulation network by HAT being a plausible mechanism. This current study is the first report demonstrating that the general transcriptional regulator Sp1 is specifically under the control of Trrap-HAT. Our findings propose that the Trrap-HAT-Sp1 axis orchestrates the program of neuronal microtubule dynamics and neuron morphogenesis and, possibly, neuron survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

For library preparation 3 µg of tissue total RNA or 800 ng of aNSC total RNA were introduced to the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kit (Illumina, San Diego, USA), per manufacturer’s description. The quantification and quality check of the libraries were conducted using the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 in combination with the DNA 7500 kit. For sequencing of tissues, pools of four libraries were compiled and each pool was loaded on one lane of a HiSeq2500 machine running in 51cycle/single-end/high-output mode. For the sequencing of aNSCs, all libraries were pooled and loaded on three lanes of a HiSeq2500 machine running in 51 cycle/single-end/high-output mode.

Frozen tissue was transferred on ice to bead-beating tubes (Precellys CKMix, 0.5 ml) containing ice-cold PBS with Protease and a Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and beaten for 2 cycles of 20 s at 6000 rpm, with a 30 s break at 4°C. Homogenates were prepared at an estimated protein concentration of 10 µg/µl; based on 5% protein content of fresh brain tissues by weight. A volume of homogenate corresponding to approximately 500 µg protein was transferred to 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and taken for lysis. Lysis was carried out by resuspension of the homogenate in lysis buffer (final concentration 4% SDS, 0.1 M HEPES [pH 8], 50 mM DTT) to a final protein concentration of 1 µg/µl, followed by a sonication in a Bioruptor (Diagenode, Seraing, Belgium) (10 cycles, 1 min ON/30 s OFF, 20°C). The samples were heated (95°C, 10 min), and sonication steps repeated. The lysates were clarified by brief centrifugation, incubated with iodacetamide, (15 mM) at RT, in the dark. Each sample was treated with four volumes ice-cold acetone to precipitate the proteins (overnight, −20°C). The samples were centrifuged at 20,800 g (30 min, 4°C). The supernatant was removed and the pellets washed twice with 400 µl of ice-cold 80% acetone/20% water. The pellets were air-dried before dissolving in a digestion buffer (3 M urea in 0.1 M HEPES, pH 8) at 1 µg/µl. A 1:100 w/w amount of LysC (Wako, Richmond, USA; sequencing grade) was added to each sample before incubation (4 hr, 37°C, 1000 rpm). The samples were diluted 1:1 with milliQ water and incubated with a 1:100 w/w amount of trypsin (Promega, Madison, USA; sequencing grade) (overnight, 37°C, 650 rpm). The digests were acidified with 10% trifluoroacetic acid and desalted with Waters Oasis HLB µElution Plate 30 µm (Waters, Milford, USA) in the presence of a slow vacuum, to manufacturer’s instructions. The eluates were dried down with the speed vacuum centrifuge. Peptide labeling with TMT and subsequent high pH fractionation and LC-MS were conducted as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buczak et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, the peptide samples obtained from the digestion were labeled with TMT-10plex isobaric mass tags (Thermo Fischer Scientific) per manufacturer’s instructions. Equal amounts of the labeled peptides from the 10 samples (five replicates each condition) were mixed, desalted, and pre-fractionated into 16 fractions using high pH reverse phase fractionation on an Agilent Infinity 1260 HPLC, then each fraction was measured individually by nano-LC-MS on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos employing SPS-MS3 data acquisition (Thermo Fischer Scientific). Subsequently, the fraction data were searched together in Mascot 2.5.1 (Matrix Science, Boston, USA) using Proteome Discoverer 2.0 (Thermo Fischer Scientific) against the Swissprot <italic>Mus musculus</italic> database (2016; 16,756 entries) and a list of common contaminants. Reporter ion intensity values for the PSMs were exported and processed using in-house written R scripts to remove common contaminants and decoy hits. Only PSMs having reporter ion intensities above 1 × 10<sup>3</sup> in all the relevant TMT channels were retained for a quantitative analysis, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buczak et al., 2018</xref>. Briefly, the reporter ion (TMT) intensities were log<sub>2</sub>-transformed and normalized. Peptide-level data were summarized into their respective protein groups by taking the median value. For differential protein expression, the five replicates of the two conditions respectively within the TMT10-plex were taken together. Protein ratios were calculated for all protein groups quantified with at least two peptides. To compare DEP in the cortex obtained by RNA-seq to protein DEP (differentially expressed proteins) obtained by mass spectrometry, Ensembl gene IDs were mapped to Uniprot IDs with the R packages AnnotationDbi (1.42.1) and org.Mm.eg.db (3.6.0), while only genes/proteins present in both analyses were considered. When for a single Uniprot ID multiple Ensembl IDs are known, the proteomics measurement is duplicated and all different transcriptomics results assigned to this entry.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>aNSC cell culture</title><p>The SVZ of 2–4 months old mice were isolated, minced, and digested with DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 20 U/ml papain, 240 µg/ml cysteine, and 400 µg/ml DNAse I type IV.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from Tapias, Larazo, et al., examines effects of neuronal deletion of the transformation/transcription domain associated protein (Trrap) gene. The authors show that Trrap deletion in Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum causes neurite retraction, progressive cell loss, and age-related motor control deficits. Similarly, deletion of Trrap in the cortex and striatum (using the forebrain-selective Camk2a promoter) results in widespread transcriptional dysregulation, specifically at genes containing SP1 transcription factor motifs. Consistent with SP1-mediated deficits in gene expression, Trrap deletion decreased SP1 activity at a luciferase reporter, and decreased SP1 binding and histone acetylation at Trrap target genes Stmn3 and Stmn4. Similar gene expression changes were observed after conditional Trrap deletion in neural stem cells. Finally, the authors report that overexpression of Trrap target genes Stmn3 and Stmn4 rescues effects of Trrap knockdown on neurite branching and length in primary cultured neurons.</p><p>Overall, the results identify a novel mechanism by which Trrap regulates neuronal function, and might contribute to neuronal development and potentially also neurodegeneration. Additionally, these results may have relevance to Trrap mutations in human patients.</p><p>While the results identify a potentially novel link between Trrap, SP1, and microtubule dynamics that support neruonal growth and function, the reviewers had several concerns with the current manuscript. First, the evidence that SP1 and histone acetylation mediates the effects of Trrap deletion is not sufficient to fully support the claims of the manuscript. Second, while the examination of different cell types is helpful and increases the ability to generalize effects of Trrap deletion, there are significant concerns about the timing of Trrap deletion in these models, and several of the results are not consistent with a neurodegenerative phenotype. We have suggested the following revisions to improve the manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The data presented in Figure 3G are intriguing, and are the main data in the paper to support a direct mechanistic link between Trrap and SP1 function. However, these results are based on a relatively underpowered experiment (n=3), with large error. The manuscript would be improved if this could be strengthened or bolstered by additional evidence. For example, the manuscript already contains H3ac and H4ac ChIP-seq data, which is used to infer effects mediated by SP1 at Trrap target genes. The authors might confirm this relationship by looking at the distribution of histone acetylation across SP1 sites in the genome (as well as specifically at Trrap DEGs). Similarly, it would be useful to show that Trrap is normally found at SP1 motifs for these genes in neurons (e.g. with ChIP). Likewise, although the ChIP data suggest that SP1 regulates STMN3 and 4 expression, this is not directly demonstrated. Does SP1 depletion alone influence their expression?</p><p>2) The authors argue that neurodegeneration linked with Trrap deletion is the result of altered transcription of SP1 targets through impaired SP1 activity caused by reduced acetylation. However, the overlap between hypoacetylated loci and SP1-regulated genes on a genome-wide scale was pretty low (subsection “Trrap-HAT mediates Sp1 transcriptional control of microtubule dynamic genes”, 11 genes), indicating that other factors may be at play. The authors validate their assertion by showing that Sp1 and AcH4 are reduced by Trrap deletion on target promoters (Figure 4E and F), but this study is lacking proper controls to show that these changes are selective for acetylation. Given that the authors argue that the effect is mediated by HAT activity (which is not measured but inferred based on known Trrap functions), it is important to exclude alternative explanations, such as non-specific effects of Trrap deletion on nucleosome density or other post-translational modifications. As such, studies in Figure 4D should be repeated for total H4 and also for another PTM that isn't directly regulated by Trrap. In addition, to validate the relevance of SP1 as a regulator of genes affected by Trrap function, an additional control would be beneficial – specifically, the authors could conduct ChIP for a TF that was not associated with genes affected by Trrap deletion in Figure 3F to show that changes in Figure 4F are specific for SP1 and acetylation.</p><p>3) The authors link SP1 with impaired microtubule function. They show microtubule-related terms in ontology analysis of differentially regulated genes that overlap in the striatum and the cortex, but not specifically for DEGs that contain SP1 binding sites. Although they do identify STMN3 and 4 as targets, it would be useful to see if these categories come out for SP1 regulated genes as a group. As authors point out, SP1 tends to have wide spread functions that influence many pathways, so it is important to exclude the possibility that microtubule-related functions affected by Trrap may be small compared to other pathways that are influenced more dramatically. Even if they are small, this finding is still of interest, but the conclusions need to be dampened.</p><p>4) While the manuscript claims that TRRAP-HAT modulates microtubule dynamics via SP1 signaling in brain homeostasis and neurodegeneration, the evidence for these assertions is relatively weak. The signaling pathway the authors found is based on the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq in the forebrain at P10 when postnatal brain development and maturation is still going on. Also, the role of TRRAP-HAT-SP1-STMN3/4 signaling in the neurodegeneration context is not validated since the cortical primary culture at DIV6-12 is also at developmental stage rather than fully matured stage. Therefore, while the manuscript begins with Purkinje neuronal degeneration by Trrap deletion, data in Figure 3 shows that the signaling pathway is more likely to be involved in the neural development. Similarly, the authors did not carefully confirm the effect of Trrap deletion on Purkinje neuronal development. In the PCP2-Cre line the authors used in this study, Cre expression starts at P6 (Zhang et al., 2004). Considering the cerebellum and Purkinje neuronal development is completed around at ~P20, it is difficult to exclude the possibility TRRAP-HAT-SP1-STMN3/4 signaling affect the Purkinje neuronal development rather than neuronal survival. Indeed, previous study showed that STMN3 is crucial for the formation and development of the Purkinje cell dendritic arbor (Poulain et al., 2008). These issues should be addressed in the manuscript, and if the authors cannot rule out neurodvelopmental effects, the specific claims regarding neurodegeneration should be removed.</p><p>5) The primary interest appears to be in investigating the role of Trrap in cerebellar neurodegeneration, and as such, they quantify phenotypes that are relevant to cerebellar function. However, mechanistic studies are conducted in the striatum and cortex. The argument for switching mouse models and brain regions was the scarcity of Purkinje cells in the Trrap-PC model, so they switch to CamKIIa Cre and striatum and cortex for mechanism. A search of the literature and Allen Brain atlas shows CamK2a expression in cerebellar cells, including Purkinje cells. Since there was no cell sorting performed to select for CamK2a cells in any of the brain regions examined, the experiments would presumably be able to be conducted in the cerebellum? Similarly, the authors use multiple cell types in cell culture studies, including cultured cortical neurons – why not use cultured cerebellar neurons?</p><p>6) Please clarify how the ChIP datasets in Figure 4E-F are compared between groups. Why is there no variability in the control group? For ChIP-qPCR data, it would be preferable to show the results as % of input, rather than binding enrichment. Additionally, while the sequences for ChIP-qPCR primers are provided, the authors should clarify where these primers target within the genome, and whether site contains a known SP1 motif.</p><p>7) The data showing siRNA-mediated Trrap knockdown (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) is not convincing – summary data and statistical comparisons should be shown for manipulations as performed in the in vitro experiments. Similarly, it is not clear how transfection experiments would lead to robust knockdown. Typically, neuronal transfection experiments suffer from a very low efficiency, meaning that manipulations would only occur in a very small fraction of cells. If this is not the case here, data for transfection efficiency should be provided.</p><p>8) The Title of the manuscript should be revised to meet <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines. Specifically, the Title should avoid use of dashes, acronyms, or unfamiliar abbreviations (unless needed for scientific reasons). Please revise your Title with this advice in mind. Additionally, the Title and/or Abstract should provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation (i.e., species name or broader taxonomic group, if appropriate). Please revise your Title and/or Abstract with this advice in mind.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;HAT cofactor TRRAP modulates microtubule dynamics via SP1 signaling in neurodegeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Specifically, they show that loss of TRRAP results in neurite retraction, neurodegeneration, and motor deficits. They link these changes with activity of the transcription factor SP1 and with two downstream targets, Stmn3 and Stmn4, which are implicated in microtubule dynamics. Overall, these data present a novel regulatory pathway in regulating microtubule dynamics and provide a basis for uncovering the role of specific epigenetic factors in this process. Given the ties between TRRAP and several human conditions affecting neural conditions, these findings have implications for uncovering novel disease mechanisms.</p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors made significant efforts to address all the concerns raised by previous reviews with new experiment, data re-analyses, and clarification in the text. The manuscript is significantly improved, and the new results support the author's interpretation that Trrap deletion alters SP1 binding and expression of STMN3 and STMN4. Notably, overexpression of STNM3 can rescue certain neurite growth deficits caused by Trrap deletion, in agreement with their model. Likewise, many conclusions have been appropriately toned down to match the experimental results or in light of noted caveats. However, some specific revisions are still critical prior to publication of the manuscript (outlined below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Replace all figures with higher resolution images – the current versions appear pixelated upon zooming in to see details.

To address the comments, we performed all these experiments and presented them as Figure 4F-G. We used H3 and H4 for histone controls and H3K4me2 as a non-relevant PTM control. Oct4 is a transcription factor that is not under the control of SP1 (PMID:10592386) and is used as a control, as requested by the reviewers. Please note there was a large error bar in the Oct4 ChIP data because one pair of the sample gave a very high value (we noted in the figure legend). However, when we compared pairwise (paired t-test), the error bar in both control and mutant is low (data not shown). Nonetheless, both showed no statistical difference. In revised manuscript, we present these new data in the text and described them in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors link SP1 with impaired microtubule function.

Following this comment, we have now provided the Top50 of the SP1-containing DEGs in Figure 3—figure supplement 2G. As one can see, again, the microtubule dynamics is prominent in the list.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) While the manuscript claims that TRRAP-HAT modulates microtubule dynamics via SP1 signaling in brain homeostasis and neurodegeneration, the evidence for these assertions is relatively weak. The signaling pathway the authors found is based on the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq in the forebrain at P10 when postnatal brain development and maturation is still going on.

These issues should be addressed in the manuscript, and if the authors cannot rule out neurodvelopmental effects, the specific claims regarding neurodegeneration should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are aware of the limitation of the model that was used. As stated in the text, the problem for Purkinje cell specific knockout is the scarcity of Purkinje cells (PC) in our PCdel models. Therefore, we switched to forebrain deleted model to analyze the pathway controlled by Trrap for the feasibility. To gain insight we performed integrated omics (RNA-seq, proteomics and ChIP-seq) and found a striking commonality of molecular pathways governed by TRRAP-HAT in different neural cell types. We provided detailed analyses on these omic datasets. Then, we confirmed STMNs using primary neurons and PC models (Figure 4C-D). However, given the normal PC development in the PCD model, i.e., a normal PC density and behavior at young age (Figure 1A-B), Trrap-Sp1-STMNs does not likely play a prominent role in early PC development at least not in the Pcp2-Cre model. Moreover, in our animal models the deletion occurs after the neuron differentiation, despite not fully matured, pointing out that at the early stages the Trrap deleted brain looks normal (Figure 1C, Figure 2C (Purkinje-Cre related) and Figure 3A (CamkII-Cre related)). Having said this, we have no direct evidence, which would allow us to rule out the possibility that Trrap-Sp1-STMNs affects the general neuronal development or survival. Indeed, as the reviewers pointed out, STMN3/4 are also important in the maintenance of neuron dendrites, which had been discussed in the original text. Thus, we have carefully rephrased our statement, in the revised manuscript.</p><p>It is noteworthy that we have many PCdel models running in the lab, in which many life essential genes were deleted, such as ATR, MRE11 and NBS1 (null mutation of these genes causes cell and embryonic lethality). None of these PCD models show the neurodegeneration phenotype (even after 20 months) in contrast to the Trrap-PCD model. These observations thus highlight the specificity of the HAT-TRRAP-Sp1-STMN axis in preventing PC degeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The primary interest appears to be in investigating the role of Trrap in cerebellar neurodegeneration, and as such, they quantify phenotypes that are relevant to cerebellar function.

Since there was no cell sorting performed to select for CamK2a cells in any of the brain regions examined, the experiments would presumably be able to be conducted in the cerebellum?</p></disp-quote><p>Our lab works on CamKII-Cre mice extensively and observed using Confetti reporter that CamKII-Cre can deleted only minor subpopulations of cells in cerebella. Thus, an extensive cerebellar analysis of Trrap in the CamkII-Cre model would be very complicated due to two reasons: we would have to first map exactly the cells deleted and second exclude the possible influence of the forebrain excitatory neurons (extensively expressing CamKII). In our Trrap-FBD model it is not even possible since these mutant mice die around weaning. Thus, CamKII-Cre is not a suitable model to study cerebella. Nevertheless, this model was very useful to gain insight into the mechanistic understanding on how Trrap regulates neurological processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the authors use multiple cell types in cell culture studies, including cultured cortical neurons – why not use cultured cerebellar neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we tried to establish cerebellar PC culture; but it turned out to be very challenging. Meanwhile we have good experience in culturing cortical neurons. Although our in vitro data alone could not differentiate whether Sp1-STMNs is operational in PC development or degeneration, together with in vivo data (e.g., Figure 4C-D) and the discussion of literatures, we can comfortably conclude that proper Sp1-STMNs very likely contribute to neuroprotection. Nevertheless, we have carefully rephrased some sentences to reflect certain limitations (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please clarify how the ChIP datasets in Figure 4E-F are compared between groups.
