Although sensory pathways reorganize following spinal cord injury (SCI), the extent to which sensory input from Ia afferents is regulated during voluntary contraction after the injury remains largely unknown. To address this question, the soleus H-reflex and conditioning of the H-reflex by stimulating homonymous [depression of the soleus H-reflex evoked by common peroneal nerve (CPN) stimulation, D1 inhibition] and heteronymous (d), [monosynaptic Ia facilitation of the soleus H-reflex evoked by femoral nerve stimulation (FN facilitation)] nerves were tested at rest, and during tonic voluntary contraction in humans with and without chronic incomplete SCI. The soleus H-reflex size increased in both groups during voluntary contraction compared with rest, but to a lesser extent in SCI participants. Compared with rest, the D1 inhibition decreased during voluntary contraction in controls but it was still present in SCI participants. Further, the FN facilitation increased in controls but remained unchanged in SCI participants during voluntary contraction compared with rest. Changes in the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation were correlated with changes in the H-reflex during voluntary contraction, suggesting an association between outcomes. These findings provide the first demonstration that the regulation of Ia afferent input from homonymous and heteronymous nerves is altered during voluntary contraction in humans with SCI, resulting in lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>H-reflex</kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd><kwd>presynaptic inihibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS122336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Monica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veterans Administration Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01RX002474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Monica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veterans Administration Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01RX003715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Monica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veterans Administration Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I01RX002848</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Monica A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Physiological analysis reveals that during voluntary contraction Ia afferent input have a lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons in humans with chronic incomplete spinal cord injury compared with control subjects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anatomical and physiological studies have shown that sensory input to motor neurons is altered following spinal cord injury (SCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DAmico et al., 2014</xref>). For example, lesions of descending motor tracts in animals result in aberrant sprouting of primary afferents, leading to symptoms of hyperreflexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murray and Goldberger, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wong et al., 2000</xref>), and prolonged excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) are observed in motor neurons in response to brief sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker and Chandler, 1987</xref>). In agreement, humans with SCI show prolonged depolarization of motor neurons in response to stimulation of sensory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Norton et al., 2008</xref>), exaggerated stretch reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2020</xref>), and decreased transmission in spinal inhibitory pathways compared with uninjured controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones and Yang, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crone et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeForest et al., 2020</xref>). The functional consequences of this altered sensory input conveying to motor neurons following SCI remain largely unknown.</p><p>Primary afferent fibers (Ia) are rapidly conducting sensory fibers that originate from muscle spindle primary endings, which constantly monitors the rate at which a muscle stretch changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matthews, 1972</xref>). Ia afferent fibers bifurcate on entering the spinal cord and run several segments in both rostral and caudal directions in the dorsal columns and make contact with motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pierrot-Deseilligny and Burke, 2012</xref>). Different mechanisms can contribute to regulate Ia afferent input conveying to motor neurons. For decades, it was thought that sensory regulation was accomplished in part through axoaxonic contacts at the terminal of Ia sensory axons from GABAergic neurons that receive innervation from the brain and spinal cord through presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Fuortes, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eccles et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eccles et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</xref>). However, recent evidence in animal and humans suggested that facilitation of Ia-mediated EPSPs in motor neurons likely occurs when axon nodes of Ranvier are depolarized from activation of nodal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which contributes to reduce branch point failure in Ia afferent fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Metz et al., 2021</xref>). GABAergic neurons known to innervate terminals of Ia afferent fibers in the spinal cord also innervate nodes of Ranvier contributing to prevent failure of sodium spike transmission at branch points, which can facilitate sensory transmission and reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hari et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, in humans, cutaneous, proprioceptive, and corticospinal pathways can facilitate rather than inhibit Ia afferents facilitating the propagation of action potentials to motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Metz et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, GABAergic networks can have both facilitatory and inhibitory actions on afferent transmission within the spinal cord at different sites within Ia afferent fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metz et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>A critical question is how Ia afferent transmission is regulated during voluntary contraction after SCI. In uninjured humans, evidence showed that Ia afferent transmission decreases at the onset of a voluntary contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hultborn et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>) and during tonic contractions that last for 1â2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meunier and Pierrot-Deseilligny, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>) compared to rest and it changes according to the task requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Capaday and Stein, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crone and Nielsen, 1989</xref>). Following SCI, descending motor pathways converging onto GABAergic interneurons thought to contribute to regulate Ia afferent transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jankowska and Edgley, 2006</xref>) are likely altered. Indeed, humans with SCI show lesser corticospinal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunday et al., 2014</xref>) and H-reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phadke et al., 2010</xref>) modulation during voluntary behaviors compared with control participants. We hypothesized that during voluntary contraction, Ia afferent input exerts a lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons in SCI compared with control participants.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, the soleus H-reflex and conditioning of the H-reflex by stimulating homonymous and heteronymous nerves by measuring the depression of the soleus H-reflex evoked by common peroneal nerve (CPN) stimulation [D1 inhibition] and the monosynaptic Ia facilitation of the soleus H-reflex evoked by femoral nerve (FN) stimulation [FN facilitation] were tested at rest and during 30% of tonic maximal voluntary contraction (MVC).

The size of the H-reflex in the soleus muscle increases in controls and SCI participants during voluntary contraction but to a lesser extent in people with SCI. Two observations suggest that altered regulation of Ia afferent input from homonymous and heteronymous nerves during voluntary contraction might contribute to these results. First, the D1 inhibition was decreased in controls but it was still present in SCI participants during voluntary contraction compared with rest. Second, the FN facilitation was increased in controls but not in SCI participants during contraction compared with rest. Changes in the D1 inhibition and the FN facilitation correlated with changes in the H-reflex size during voluntary contraction. Together, these findings indicate that during voluntary contraction Ia afferent input from homonymous and heteronymous nerves exert a lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons in humans with SCI compared with control subjects.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Regulation of Ia afferent input after SCI</title><p>Although there have been multiple studies in animals and humans showing that sensory input conveying to motor neurons is altered following SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DAmico et al., 2014</xref>), the functional consequences of these changes remain largely unknown. Here, for the first time, we examined the regulation of Ia afferent input during voluntary contraction in humans with chronic incomplete SCI. Studies have used H-reflex conditioning paradigms in control humans to make inferences about the regulation of Ia afferent input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hultborn et al., 1987a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hultborn et al., 1987b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meunier and Pierrot-Deseilligny, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>). For example, the depression of the soleus H-reflex evoked by CPN stimulation (referred here as D1 inhibition) is thought to be caused by presynaptic inhibition at the terminal of Ia afferents on soleus motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mizuno et al., 1971</xref>) and the FN facilitation is thought to reflect the size of the monosynaptic EPSP in the soleus motor neurons evoked by activation of Ia afferents from the quadriceps muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hultborn et al., 1987a</xref>). Both outcomes likely provide independent information about Ia afferent transmission that help to rule out changes in the recruitment gain of soleus motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>). In the current study, the D1 inhibition was decreased during voluntary contraction in controls subjects but still present in SCI participants compared with rest. In addition, the FN facilitation was increased in control subjects during voluntary contraction but not in SCI participants when compared with rest. This is consistent with studies showing that, during a ramp-up and hold tonic contraction, in control subjects the FN facilitation decreased at the onset of a voluntary contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hultborn et al., 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meunier and Pierrot-Deseilligny, 1989</xref>) and during a tonic contraction lasting for 1â2 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>) as performed in the present study. This is also consistent with findings in control subjects showing that vibratory inhibition of the soleus H-reflex decreases during tonic voluntary contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iles and Roberts, 1987</xref>). These results were previously interpreted as a decrease in presynaptic inhibition during a voluntary contraction. For decades, it was thought that sensory regulation was accomplished in part through axoaxonic contacts at the terminal of Ia sensory axons through presynaptic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Fuortes, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eccles et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eccles et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">RudomÃ­n et al., 1998</xref>). However, recent evidence in rats and control humans suggested that facilitation of Ia-mediated EPSPs in motor neurons likely occurs when axon nodes are depolarized from the activation of nodal GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hari et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Metz et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the regulation of Ia afferent input tested in our study occurs not at the terminal of the Ia sensory fiber but at different sites within the Ia afferent fiber. It is also possible that the suppression of the H-reflex evoked by conditioning of a homonymous nerve is related, at least in part, to post-activation depression or any direct effect on the soleus motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Metz et al., 2022</xref>). Regardless of the site of Ia afferent regulation, together, these findings suggest that during voluntary contraction proprioceptive input from homonymous and heteronymous nerves exert a lesser facilitatory effect on motor neurons after SCI.</p><p>Both peripheral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eccles et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jankowska et al., 2021</xref>) and central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carpenter et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fetz, 1968</xref>) mechanisms have been shown to contribute to regulate Ia sensory transmission. GABAergic neurons contributing to regulate Ia sensory transmission receive innervation from the brain and spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rudomin and Schmidt, 1999</xref>). At rest, decreases in the D1 inhibition and increases in the FN facilitation in people with SCI compared with control participants could be related to decreased input from descending motor pathways. This is supported by multiple studies showing that activation of descending motor pathways, including the corticospinal pathway, is altered after the injury having a higher threshold resulting in the use of higher stimulus intensities in SCI compared with control participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bunday and Perez, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunday et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cirillo et al., 2016</xref>). Then, how do we explain the facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons in control participants during voluntary contraction? A possibility is that this is, in part, related to descending inhibition of GABAergic interneurons, which overrides the suppression originated from peripheral sources during a voluntary contraction. Hence, in SCI participants, a lesser facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons might be present during voluntary contraction because of the abnormal and/or decreased contribution from descending pathways, which might not be strong enough to override peripheral sources. Participants in the present study had incomplete injuries and were able to perform voluntary contraction. Evidence showed that corticospinal excitability increases in controls and SCI participants during voluntary contraction but to a lesser extent in SCI participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunday et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tazoe and Perez, 2021</xref>). Thus, a possibility is that the lesser facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons after SCI during voluntary contraction reflects altered contribution from descending motor pathways. Note that when the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation were tested at matching levels between groups, we observed a small but significant decrease in the D1 inhibition and increase in the FN facilitation during voluntary contraction, suggesting that to some extent similar mechanisms might contribute to the modulatinon of Ia afferent input in controls and SCI participants. This is also consistent with our results showing that H-reflex size increased during voluntary contraction in controls and SCI participants but to a lesser extent in people with SCI. Similarly, evidence showed that during voluntary contraction, motor neuron excitability (as measured by F waves) increases in people with SCI but to a lesser extent than in control participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vastano and Perez, 2020</xref>). Stretch reflexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Woolacott and Burne, 2006</xref>) and H-reflexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Faist et al., 1996</xref> have been reported to increase to a lesser extent or not at all during voluntary contraction in people with SCI compared with control subjects. Another important question is if changes in H-reflex size were related to changes in the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation. We did not find a correlation between these variables in each group. However, when we looked at the groups together, we found a strong positive correlation showing that increases in H-reflex size were associated with lesser D1 inhibition and larger FN facilitation, suggesting a relation between these variable in the overall population.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional consequences</title><p>During a voluntary contraction, the âexcitabilityâ of motor neurons increases. Thus, regulation of Ia afferent input to motor neurons can have implications for the generation of motor output. Indeed, evidence from animal studies and modelling analysis suggested that presynaptic regulation of spinal sensory feedback contributes to ensure smooth execution of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fink et al., 2014</xref>) and motor stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stein and OÄuztÃ¶reli, 1976</xref>). In intact humans, lesser facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons have been related to the optimization needed to improve motor performance during motor skill learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perez et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, it is possibly that the lesser facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons during voluntary contraction in SCI compared with controls contributes to regulate the ongoing voluntary contraction. Because after SCI prolonged EPSPs are observed in motor neurons in response to even brief sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Norton et al., 2008</xref>), a lesser facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons at the spinal level in SCI participants might be beneficial to control small levels of ongoing voluntary contraction as the one performed in our study. It is unclear if this adaptation contributes to the lack of task-dependent modulation of the H-reflex observed in humans with SCI during the gait cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phadke et al., 2010</xref>). H-reflex modulation differs during sitting, standing, and walking in humans with and without SCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayashi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Phadke et al., 2010</xref>) requiring that future studies assess the impact of our results on gait-based and other conditions. In controls, the greater facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input onto motor neurons might be functionally appropriate during the tonic voluntary contraction that we tested, but this might also change to a different extent during performance of more skilled motor behaviors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty individuals with SCI (50.9Â±17.2 years, 2 women) and 20 control subjects (41.5Â±13.6 years, 6 women; F<sub>1,38</sub>=2.8, p=0.1) participated in the study.

Participants with SCI had a chronic injury (â¥1 year) and were classified using the International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) as having a C2-T10 SCI. Five out of the 20 subjects were categorized by the American Spinal Cord Injury Impairment Scale (AIS) as AIS C and the remaining 15 subjects were classified as AIS D. Nine individuals with SCI were currently taking anti-spastic medication (baclofen and/or tizanidine and/or gabapentin; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) at the time of enrollment. These participants were asked to stop anti-spastic medication on the day of testing (at least 12 hr since last dosage). Spasticity was assessed using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).

The MT was defined as the minimal intensity needed to elicit 5 of 10 motor responses in the tibialis anterior muscle of 50 ÂµV above the background. The stimulus evoking the H-reflex was adjusted to obtain the same size of the control H-reflex (50% of the H-max) both at rest and during voluntary contraction. We found that the magnitude of the D1 inhibition was decreased in SCI (81.2% Â± 7.8%) compared with control (69.6% Â± 15.4%, p=0.01) subjects at rest. Thus, in an additional control experiment, we tested the D1 inhibition in SCI participants (n=10) using a higher CPN stimulation at 1.5â2ÃMT while the control H-reflex was kept at 50% of the H-max to elicit a magnitude of D1 inhibition similar to controls (referred to as D1 inhibition adjusted, D1 inhibition<sub>adj</sub>). This subgroup of subjects were participants that were able to return to complete this testing. Fifteen control H-reflexes and 15 conditioned H-reflexes were tested at rest and during 30% of MVC in a randomized order.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>FN facilitation</title><p>The soleus H-reflex was tested with (conditioned H-reflex) and without (control H-reflex) stimulation of the FN. The FN elicits a facilitation of the soleus H-reflex (FN facilitation), which is thought to reflect the size of the monosynaptic EPSP in soleus motor neurons evoked by activation of Ia afferents from the quadriceps muscle, and changes in its size are considered to indicate changes in Ia afferent transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hultborn et al., 1987b</xref>). Thus, both measurements, D1 inhibition and FN facilitation, provide independent information about Ia afferent transmission and help to rule out changes in the recruitment gain of soleus motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>). The FN was stimulated through bipolar electrodes with the cathode positioned over the femoral triangle and the anode electrode positioned just below the gluteus maximus muscle. The intensity for stimulating the FN was 5ÃMT in the quadriceps muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faist et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gracies et al., 1994</xref>). The onset of facilitation was taken to be the earliest conditioning-test interval at which the conditioned reflex was at least 5% larger than the control reflex to ensure that the conditioning-test interval reflects the size of the monosynaptic EPSP in the soleus motor neurons without contamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morita et al., 2001</xref>). Measurements were taken at 0.5â1 ms longer than this interval. The stimulus evoking the H-reflex was adjusted to obtain the same size of the control H-reflex (50% of the H-max) both at rest and during 30% of MVC. The facilitation induced by stimulating the FN has an onset at a conditioning-test interval between â7 and â8.5 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faist et al., 1994</xref>) (a negative value indicates that the control stimulus preceded the conditioning stimulus). In a control experiment, we tested conditioning-test intervals between â6.5 and â9.0 ms (a negative value indicates that the control stimulus preceded the conditioning stimulus) in controls (n=5) and SCI (n=5) and determined that in both groups the earliest onset of the FN was found at â7.5 ms (p=0.01). Thus, consistent with ours and previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faist et al., 1994</xref>), we used a conditioning-test interval of â8 ms to evaluate the FN facilitation at rest and during 30% of MVC in both controls (n=14) and SCI participants (n=20). The magnitude of the FN facilitation at rest is decreased in SCI compared with control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faist et al., 1994</xref>), therefore, in a control experiment we tested the FN facilitation in SCI participants (n=10) using lower FN stimulation at 2â4ÃMT (referred to as FN facilitation adjusted, FN facilitation<sub>adj</sub>) while the control H-reflex was kept at 50% of the H-max. The subgroup of subjects tested with adjusted stimulus intensities was the group of individuals that was able to return for this additional testing. Fifteen control H-reflexes and 15 conditioned H-reflexes were tested at rest and during 30% of MVC in a randomized order.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Normal distribution was tested by the Shapiro-Wilkâs test and homogeneity of variances by the Leveneâs test. Sphericity was tested using Mauchlyâs test. When sphericity was not met, the Greenhouse-Geisser correction was used. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to examine the effect of GROUP (controls and SCI) and CONTRACTION (rest and 30% of MVC) on background EMG activity and the H-reflex size. Repeated measures ANOVA was also used to examine the effect of GROUP and CONTRACTION on the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation. Similar analysis was also used to examine the effect of CONTRACTION on the D1 inhibition<sub>adj</sub> and the FN facilitation<sub>adj</sub>. One-way ANOVA was used to examine the effect of GROUP on MVCs, H-max, M-max, and the H-max/M-max ratio. Holm-Sidak post hoc analysis was used to test for mean pair wise comparisons. Spearmanâs correlation coefficient was used to assess association between the size of H-reflex, D1 inhibition, FN facilitation during 30% of MVC compared with rest. Statistical analysis was conducted using SigmaPlot (Systat Software, Inc, San Jose, CA) and the significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Group data is presented as means Â± SDs. Effect sizes were reported as Î·<sup>2</sup>p.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group

We want to clarify that for the main experiment (H-reflex) we tested 20 control and 20 SCI participants. For measurements of D1 inhibition and FN facilitation, we tested 14 control and 20 SCI participants. Six control participants were not able to return for additional testing. Therefore, we recalculated the power for the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation. Note that our results indicate that we had sufficient power with the number of participants that were tested. The following information was added to the manuscript:</p><p>(page 15),</p><p>âAdditionally, sample size for the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation was estimated using an effect size (Î·<sup>2</sup>p=0.7 and Î·<sup>2</sup>p=0.6, respectively) calculated from the significant GROUP Ã CONTRACTION interaction, with a power of 0.95 and Î± of 0.05, 14 and 18 participants (respectively) were considered sufficient in a repeated measures ANOVA (G*Power 3.1.9.7).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Ia afferent fibers bifurcate on entering the spinal cord and run several segments in both rostral and caudal directions in the dorsal columns and make contact with motor neurons (Pierrot-Deseilligny and Burke, 2012).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It would help the reader if the discussion were more clearly delineated when results of literature reporting neurophysiology for the able-bodied are discussed versus findings for persons with SCI.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we now clearly defined in the discussion when results were related to control versus individuals with SCI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Is there a teleological or gait-based way of thinking about the data that provides a model for understanding how gains or loss of effects of Ia inputs on H-reflexes are good or bad after SCI when muscles are already under load? Does this reasoning fit the new data presented?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. We propose that a lesser facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons at the spinal level in SCI participants might help to control small levels of ongoing voluntary activity as the one performed in our study. Because after SCI prolonged excitatory post-synaptic potentials are observed in motor neurons in response to even brief sensory stimulation (Norton et al., 2008), a lesser facilitatory effect of Ia afferent input on motor neurons at the spinal level in SCI participants might be beneficial to control small levels of ongoing voluntary activity as the one performed in our study. It is unclear if this adaptation contributes to the lack of task-dependent modulation of the H-reflex observed in humans with SCI during the gait cycle (Yang et al., 1991; Phadke et al., 2010). H-reflex modulation differs during sitting, standing, and walking in humans with and without SCI (Hayashi et al., 1992; Phadke et al., 2010) requiring that future studies assess the impact of our results on gait-based and other conditions. This information was added to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Some interpretations of the correlations presented in Figure 6 should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the following information to discussion:</p><p>(page 13),</p><p>âAnother important question is if changes in H-reflex size were related to changes in the D1 inhibition and FN facilitation. We did not find a correlation between these variables in each group. However, when we looked at the groups together, we found a strong positive correlation showing that increases in H-reflex size were associated with lesser D1 inhibition and larger FN facilitation, suggesting a relation between these variable in the overall population.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The discussion could come back to this point more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested the following information was added to the introduction:</p><p>(page 5),</p><p>âThe H-reflex, D1 inhibition, and FN facilitation were studied because these electrophysiological outcomes are modulated in a task-dependent manner during different motor behaviors providing a unique tool to assess the effect of sensory input onto motor neurons during voluntary activity (Pierrot-Deseilligny and Burke, 2012). The position of the ankle joint was maintained constant across conditions to standardize the possible effect of other inputs into the testing procedures.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
