A systemic state of stress characterized by low-grade inflammation and pathological formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) usually manifests in obesity. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) is the master regulator of the redox homeostasis and plays a critical role in the resolution of inflammation. Here, we show that the natural isothiocyanate and potent NRF2 activator sulforaphane reverses diet-induced obesity through a predominantly, but not exclusively, NRF2-dependent mechanism that requires a functional leptin receptor signaling and hyperleptinemia. Sulforaphane does not reduce the body weight or food intake of lean mice but induces an anorectic response when coadministered with exogenous leptin. Leptin-deficient <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice and leptin receptor mutant <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice display resistance to the weight-reducing effect of sulforaphane, supporting the conclusion that the antiobesity effect of sulforaphane requires functional leptin receptor signaling. Furthermore, our results suggest the skeletal muscle as the most notable site of action of sulforaphane whose peripheral NRF2 action signals to alleviate leptin resistance. Transcriptional profiling of six major metabolically relevant tissues highlights that sulforaphane suppresses fatty acid synthesis while promoting ribosome biogenesis, reducing ROS accumulation, and resolving inflammation, therefore representing a unique transcriptional program that leads to protection from obesity. Our findings argue for clinical evaluation of sulforaphane for weight loss and obesity-associated metabolic disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>leptin sensitizers</kwd><kwd>sulforaphane</kwd><kwd>body weight</kwd><kwd>NRF2 activators</kwd><kwd>isothiocyanate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008982</institution-id><institution>Qatar National Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NPRP9-351-3-075</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghamari-Langroudi</surname><given-names>Masoud</given-names></name><name><surname>Rizk</surname><given-names>Nasser M</given-names></name><name><surname>Çakır</surname><given-names>Işın</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pilot &amp; Feasibility grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghamari-Langroudi</surname><given-names>Masoud</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Michigan Diabetes Research Center Pilot and Feasibility Grant P30-DK020572</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Çakır</surname><given-names>Işın</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sulforaphane through NRF2-dependent and -independent cellular and molecular pathways alleviates leptin resistance to reverse the diet-induced obesity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There has been a sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity in the past decades. About 2 billion people in the world are either obese or overweight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Finucane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">National-Heart-Lung-Blood-Institute, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Flegal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">OECD, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">WHO, 2020</xref>). Obesity commonly causes comorbidities, including diabetes, stroke, hypertension, cancer, liver failure, and arthritis. In fact, diabetes is becoming a pandemic disorder, and the most common underlying cause of diabetes is obesity. These comorbidities are associated with a measurable diminished quality of life and pose an enormous burden on health-care costs. Efforts to address the obesity epidemic pharmaceutically have been largely unsuccessful. To date, the most effective treatment available for obesity is the invasive bariatric surgery, which is associated with short- and long-term complications. Therefore, development of pharmaceutical tools to tackle this pandemic is overdue.</p><p>The balance between food intake and energy expenditure (EE), that is, energy homeostasis, is regulated by central circuitries that integrate, among others, nutritional, hormonal, and visual cues to generate homeostatic or hedonic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andermann and Lowell, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rossi and Stuber, 2018</xref>). Leptin-melanocortin circuitry is the major regulator of homeostatic feeding in mammals and represents a well-characterized system of peripheral-to-central communication of energy homeostasis. While lean or leptin-deficient animals are responsive to the anorectic and weight-reducing effect of leptin, diet-induced obesity manifests itself as a leptin-resistant state where hyperleptinemia is accompanied by lack of response to exogenous leptin administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frederich et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Myers et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, reversing leptin resistance or increasing leptin sensitivity has been a consideration to combat obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreoli et al., 2019</xref>). There are several mechanisms proposed in regard to the etiology of leptin resistance; however, whether the pharmacological approaches to potentiate leptin action can be effectively utilized therapeutically is not clear. For instance, earlier studies proposed that peripheral CB1R inverse agonism results in central leptin sensitization through cell-nonautonomous mechanisms, leading to a leptin-dependent weight loss in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tam et al., 2012</xref>). Reported more recently, the central blockade of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor signaling reverses obesity in DIO mice but not in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice, proposing a central and potentially cell-autonomous mechanism of leptin sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaneko et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the origin and mechanism of action of signals that can alleviate leptin resistance seem diverse and largely unclear.</p><p>Obesity is usually accompanied by elevated markers of oxidative stress and low-grade systemic inflammation resulting, at least in part, from excess saturated free fatty acids (FAAs) and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wellen and Hotamisligil, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Manna and Jain, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ellulu et al., 2017</xref>). FFAs act on TLR4 to initiate the expression of chemotactic pro-inflammatory signaling, including necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yeop Han et al., 2010</xref>). TNF-α results in further lipolysis and activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)/IKKβ pathway and increased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). Signaling through the JAK-STAT3 pathway, IL-6 suppresses the expression of GLUT4 and IRS1 in skeletal muscle, resulting in further insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaul and Forman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kahn and Flier, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Qatanani and Lazar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). The insulin resistance decreases glucose uptake and increases FFA consumption in adipocytes, leading to increased β-oxidation in mitochondria. Overloading the electron flow to the mitochondrial electron transport chain results in excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, leading to further activation of pro-inflammatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaul and Forman, 1996</xref>). The ROS accumulation and inflammatory response are further exacerbated by eventual suppression of β-oxidation, and the resulting reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase 4 (NOX4) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lugrin et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, interventions that increase mitochondrial biogenesis and beta-oxidation enzymes can potentially diminish ROS production and alleviate the inflammation and insulin resistance accompanying obesity.</p><p>The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NRF2) is the master transcriptional regulator of cytoprotective pathways involving detoxification, antioxidation, metabolism, and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vomund et al., 2017</xref>). Accumulation of ROS and depletion of antioxidant capacity activate NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Diotallevi et al., 2017</xref>). Under normal conditions, NRF2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), which recruits NRF2 for the proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McMahon et al., 2003</xref>). Molecules that interact with the reactive cysteine residues on KEAP1, such as ROS, set NRF2 free to translocate into the nucleus. NRF2 activation induces expression of antioxidative genes, including NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1, glutathione S-transferases, and glutamate cysteine ligase, which subsequently reduce ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McWalter et al., 2004</xref>). ROS formation also triggers inflammatory responses, which lead to activation of IκB kinase (IKK) β and phosphorylation of IκBα, resulting in nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB, the master regulator of the inflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Napetschnig and Wu, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wenzel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Similar to NRF2, IKKβ contains a motif allowing KEAP1 binding. Under basal conditions, KEAP1-dependent degradation of IKKβ results in IκBα inhibition of NF-κB activation. In response to pathological ROS formation, KEAP1 is inhibited, resulting in IKKβ stabilization, and subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. The absence of IκBα inhibition on NF-κB permits its activation and nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, the antioxidant role of NRF2 also helps in the resolution of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wenzel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cuadrado et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The role of NRF2 in obesity and diabetes has been controversial. Global deletion of NRF2 in mice on high-fat diet (HFD) results in lower body weight compared to the wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pi et al., 2010</xref>) and ameliorates HFD-induced insulin resistance by elevating systemic FGF21 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chartoumpekis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). However, activation of NRF2 is also protective against pathological ROS formation in insulin-sensitive tissues and prevents exacerbated diabetic complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yoh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">da Costa et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, several studies using pharmacological NRF2 activators suggested a protective role of NRF2 activation against obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahadoran et al., 2013</xref>). Indirect genetic activation of NRF2 achieved by KEAP1 deletion confers protection from short-term HFD-induced metabolic dysfunctions, while chronic long-term NRF2 activation results in increased weight gain and elevated markers of the metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">More et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, activation of NRF2 restricted only to muscle can lead to resistance to obesity and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uruno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matzinger et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that metabolic consequences of NRF2 activation by genetics versus pharmacological tools differ across the tissues.</p><p>Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate produced by cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cabbage. SFN interacts with the active cysteine residues of KEAP1, leading to the dissociation and activation of NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fahey and Talalay, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morimitsu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Figueiredo et al., 2015</xref>). SFN has a cytoprotective role by triggering oxidative stress response (OSR) and alleviating inflammation in multiple models of cellular stress. By suppression of the NF-κB pathway, SFN protects against damages in diabetic neuropathy and high glucose-induced changes in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Song et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Negi et al., 2011</xref>). SFN induces protection against diabetic cardiomyopathy by upregulation of NRF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bai et al., 2013</xref>) and reversing the oxidative stress-induced inhibition of LKB1/AMPK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). SFN alleviates alcohol-induced oxidative stress and endoplasm reticulum stress in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lei et al., 2018</xref>) and mitochondrial dysfunction in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). By suppressing the expression of adipogenic factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), SFN blocks adipocyte differentiation and therefore decreases lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). Treatment of mice with SFN was further reported to result in AMPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choi et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that SFN can have antiobesity and antidiabetic actions. Accordingly, SFN supplementation to obese patients with dysregulated type 2 diabetes reduces fasting blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), with its antidiabetic properties comparable to the most widely prescribed antidiabetic medication metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hawley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelsson et al., 2017</xref>). SFN also ameliorates glucose intolerance in obese mice by upregulation of the insulin signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2018b</xref>). As a pleiotropic molecule, SFN targets other homeostatic pathways besides NRF2. For example, SFN acts as an HSP90 inhibitor, and HSP90 inhibition was proposed to protect mice from HFD-induced weight gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chartoumpekis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2012</xref>) and regulate gene expression by increasing histone acetylation through HDAC inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have separately addressed the distinct roles of NRF2 and leptin signaling on energy homeostasis and metabolic syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shawky and Segar, 2018</xref>). However, whether the two pathways interact, especially in a cell-nonautonomous manner, is unknown. Using a combination of methods of pharmacology and various mouse models of obesity, here we explore the role of SFN as a molecule at the intersection of the NRF2 pathway and central leptin signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SFN induces weight loss in diet-induced obese mice</title><p>In order to assess the potential role of SFN on energy metabolism, we first tested its effect in obese mice. We fed lean wild-type, C57BL/6J mice a HFD (60% of the calories from fat) for 16–20 weeks to induce obesity. In order to test the potential antiobesity effect of SFN, we treated these DIO mice by daily intraperitoneal SFN (i.p., 5 mg/kg) injections. During the 2-week treatment period, SFN treatment led to a significant weight loss in mice (4.8% ± 1.4% vs. 18.2% ± 1.2% of initial weight, vehicle vs. SFN, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The reduced body weight was accompanied by a significant decrease in the food intake compared to the vehicle-treated counterparts (week 1: 1.74 ± 0.06 g vs. 0.95 ± 0.08 g, p&lt;0.0001; week 2: 1.85 ± 0.11 g vs. 1.31 ± 0.09 g, p&lt;0.001; vehicle vs. SFN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We next tested if the weight loss-inducing effect of SFN required obesity. To this end, we treated lean wild-type mice with the same dose of SFN (i.p., 5 mg/kg) daily and monitored their body weight and food intake. In contrast to its effect on DIO mice, SFN did not alter the weight or food intake of the lean mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). In order to ensure that the effect of SFN was not restricted to the specific C57BL/6J strain of mice, we repeated these experiments on the CD1 strain. During the 30-day treatment, SFN reduced the body weight and cumulative food intake (CFI) of DIO CD1 mice as effectively (body weight change was +2.05 ± 0.99 g vs. –8.25 ± 1.19 g for vehicle vs. SFN, respectively, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

We next tested whether SFN would protect the lean mice against diet-induced weight gain when exposed to HFD. To this end, we placed lean wild-type mice on HFD and treated them with daily injections of vehicle or SFN (10 mg/kg). Another group of mice were kept on standard chow diet and treated with vehicle in a similar manner as control. We assessed the effect of SFN treatment on development of diet-induced obesity in mice for eight consecutive weeks. At the end of this period, vehicle-treated animals on HFD gained significant adiposity with their final weight reaching 60.56% ± 2.50% of their initial body weights compared to the vehicle-treated mice on standard chow diet that gained 14.0% ± 1.35% weight. SFN protected the mice against diet-induced obesity, as the SFN-treated mice presented with an intermediate body weight gain of 42.64% ± 3.47% after the 8-week treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The lean mass of the animals was not significantly different at the end of the experiment; however, their final fat mass was significantly different, indicating that SFN significantly blocked the HFD-induced adipose tissue accumulation (13.19 ± 0.95 g in HFD-vehicle vs. 8.34 ± 0.84 g in HFD-SFN, p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

NRF2 knockout (KO) mice were fed HFD for 15 weeks to induce obesity, weighing at least 45 g. Next, we treated the mice with daily i.p. injections of either vehicle or SFN (5 mg/kg) for three consecutive weeks.</p><p>SFN did not induce any significant changes in body weight of DIO nrf KO mice during the first 2 weeks of SFN administration.

Doubling the administered SFN dose to 10 mg/kg after 3 weeks did not result in further body weight change. At the end of the treatment period, the SFN group had lower absolute body weight (47.6 ± 3.5 g in vehicle ss. 45.7 ± 2.1 g in SFN, p=0.58) and lower percentage of initial body weight (2.5% ± 2.8% vs. –2.5 ± 2.5% of initial weight, vehicle vs. SFN, p=0.0032) than the control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>).

Since the metabolic action of SFN requires high levels of leptin, we hypothesized that SFN induces weight loss in leptin-resistant DIO wild-type mice by increasing leptin sensitivity. In support of this hypothesis, lean wild-type mice with low circulating leptin concentrations fail to respond to weight-reducing effects of SFN treatment. We thus examined whether SFN can potentiate leptin action in lean wild-type mice when serum leptin levels are exogenously elevated. We treated fasted lean wild-type mice with either vehicle or SFN in combination with saline or leptin and monitored the food intake and weight changes in the animals during the refeeding period. As expected, leptin + vehicle attenuated the weight gain and food intake of the lean mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>), while the effects of saline + SFN and saline + vehicle on food intake and weight changes were not different. Notably, leptin + SFN-treated mice ate significantly less food and gained less weight than leptin + vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J and K</xref>), suggesting that SFN increases the anorectic action of leptin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Skeletal muscle serves as the primary site of SFN action</title><p>Our results indicate that SFN confers protection against diet-induced obesity in an NRF2 and leptin-dependent manner. Leptin receptors are expressed throughout the body; however, the functional isoform, called LepRb, is predominantly expressed in central feeding centers, most notably in the hypothalamus. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) harbors GABAergic LepRb-positive neuronal populations that appear to be the key regulators of homeostatic feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baskin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). The leptin resistance has also been predominantly mapped to the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Xu et al., 2018a</xref>). Therefore, we next tested if SFN reduces obesity through its direct central action. Central administration of 5–10 µg of SFN for 5 days failed to reduce body weight or food intake of DIO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Furthermore, SFN failed to enhance leptin receptor signaling in LepRb-expressing hypothalamic N1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), suggesting that the leptin-sensitizing effect of SFN was not LepRb<sup>+</sup>-cell autonomous. Thus, we next probed the NRF2 activity in several metabolic tissues including the hypothalamus, liver, eWAT, iWAT, and skeletal muscle following peripheral SFN administration. Because <italic>Hmox1</italic> was the most upregulated OSR gene among others tested in the SFN-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>), we used the HMOX1 expression as a surrogate for NRF2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wagner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, SFN treatment resulted in upregulation of HMOX1 expression only in the skeletal muscle but not in the other tissues that we analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This effect was NRF2 dependent as SFN failed to upregulate <italic>Hmox1</italic> expression in NRF2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results suggested that the skeletal muscle is potentially a direct target tissue of SFN action. To understand the global transcriptional changes following SFN treatment, we conducted RNAseq on tissues from DIO wild-type mice following 1-week treatment with vehicle or SFN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also analyzed tissues from DIO NRF2 KO mouse tissues following vehicle or SFN treatments for comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). As tissues of interest, we focused our analysis on the adipose tissue depots (iWAT, eWAT, and BAT), liver, skeletal muscle, and the hypothalamus. In the wild-type mice, the highest transcriptional changes were detected in the liver, and the least number of transcriptional changes were observed in the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), which might be explained by the highly heterogenous nature of the hypothalamus. This is also in agreement with LepRb-positive cells representing only a small population of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 2018</xref>). In NRF2 KO mice, the number of SFN-induced transcriptional changes were significantly reduced compared to the wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>). While SFN treatment altered the expression of 2555 genes in the liver of wild-type mice, only 77 genes were significantly regulated in the NRF2 KO mouse liver, with similar trends of lower number of differentially expressed genes detected in tissues from KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The molecular signature of sulforaphane (SFN) action in the obese mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The expression of NRF2-target gene <italic>Hmox1</italic> in the gastrocnemius skeletal muscle (left panel), and eWAT, inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT), liver, the hypothalamus (right panel) measured by qPCR of diet-induced obese (DIO) wild-type mice (n = 7 per group) following 1 week of vehicle or 5 mg/kg SFN treatments. *p&lt;0.05, calculated by Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test.

Therefore, we blasted the transcriptional profile of individual tissues in the Connectivity Map (CMap) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>). CMap contains gene expression profiles of cell lines subjected to genetic perturbation (gain and loss of function) or chemical perturbation (treatment with ~3000 small-molecule compounds), and therefore provides the cell-autonomous changes in the gene expression induced by the perturbagen. We analyzed the correlation between the transcriptional profile of the tissues in our study and the profile induced by SFN treatment or NRF2 overexpression in the CMap database. While liver and skeletal muscle had an RNAseq profile that highly correlated with the transcriptional signature of NRF2 overexpression, skeletal muscle was the only tissue that also correlated with the SFN-induced gene expression profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A similar analysis conducted on the RNAseq results obtained from the tissues of NRF2 KO mice following vehicle or SFN treatments yielded no significant correlation for any of the tissues analyzed with both SFN and NRF2 overexpression signatures in CMap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

We thus conducted a KEGG pathway analysis of skeletal muscle transcriptome and identified ribosome biogenesis, proteasome pathway, the RNA transport, and mitophagy as the significantly upregulated pathways in SFN-treated wild-type mice.

The antiobesity potential of SFN requires both a functional leptin receptor signaling as well as hyperleptinemia. SFN does not reduce the body weight or food intake of standard chow-fed wild-type lean, <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic>, or leptin-deficient <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> mice. However, when coadministered with exogenous leptin, SFN induces an anorectic response in standard chow-fed lean and <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic>, but not <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that the weight-reducing effect of the compound requires circulating leptin and functional leptin receptor signaling. Thus, SFN-induced weight loss and anorexia was observed only in DIO wild-type mice. We did not observe a decrease in the food intake of the lean animals when SFN administration started upon switching to HFD, at which point the mice did not have hyperleptinemia. Under such conditions of relatively lower leptin levels compared to hyperleptinemia observed in DIO mice, higher SFN concentrations were required to potentiate the anorexic effects of leptin. These findings are consistent with the requirement of leptin receptor signaling and relatively high serum leptin levels for the antiobesity action of SFN.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>SFN-treated mice lose fat mass, but not lean mass</title><p>We observed that SFN suppressed food intake in wild-type DIO mice. We postulate that the decreased energy intake contributes to the observed weight loss. We also investigated the effects of SFN on EE in DIO mice feeding ad lib on HFD. We did not observe increased EE in these mice; however, SFN prevented the calorie restriction-induced suppression of EE, suggesting that SFN may in fact activate mechanisms underlying promotion of EE. Additionally, SFN treatment significantly lowered RER, indicating increased fat utilization/fatty acid oxidation as an energy source, in agreement with the decreased fat mass of the SFN-treated animals observed in body composition analysis. SFN suppressed the expression of the fatty acid synthesis genes in the liver and white adipose tissues, consistent with the observation that SFN-treated mice lose significant fat mass. Locomotor activity in SFN-treated animals was not significantly different compared to the vehicle-treated counterparts, ruling out that increased physical activity contributed to decreased adiposity. This finding also suggests that SFN does not induce any apparent toxicity or aversive effects. In support of this notion, SFN treatment did not decrease the food intake of lean mice on either standard chow or HFD, further supporting a lack of SFN-induced taste aversion in mice, in agreement with reports from human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahadoran et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanisms underlying the metabolic effects of SFN</title><p>NRF2 activation by small-molecule compounds has been suggested to protect from diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shin et al., 2009</xref>).

While such discrepancy between pharmacology versus genetics is not uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Minikel et al., 2020</xref>), we hypothesized that SFN does not exert NRF2 activation across all tissues. While central NRF2 activation through genetic approaches confers partial protection against weight gain on HFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yagishita et al., 2017</xref>), central administration of SFN failed to reduce body weight or food intake in DIO mice in our study, nor did SFN directly activate leptin receptor signaling as measured by pSTAT3 in LepRb-expressing hypothalamic N1 cells, suggesting that the effect of SFN on leptin sensitivity may be mediated through two sites of action, where SFN primarily acting in peripheral tissue(s) communicates indirectly to the brain to activate leptin receptor signaling. In this regard, an important question remains as to how peripheral SFN action is coupled to central leptin sensitization that ultimately leads to weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Investigating the SFN’s mechanism of action by using RNAseq</title><p>The transcriptional profiling of several tissues following SFN treatment indicated a significant induction of NRF2 activity specifically in the skeletal muscle, supporting a role of the muscle tissue as a primary target site of SFN action. Most of the effects we detected in the skeletal muscle of wild-type mice were absent in NRF2 KO mice. In support of this model, NRF2 activation through skeletal muscle-specific ablation of KEAP1 protects from the development of diet-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome in wild-type mice with a significantly compromised effect in <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Uruno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matzinger et al., 2018</xref>), emphasizing the cell-nonautonomous connection between muscle NRF2 action and central leptin signaling. While we cannot rule out the potential contribution of other tissues not included in our analysis to SFN-induced phenotypes, it is tempting to speculate that direct SFN action on myocytes activates a transcriptional program that leads to central leptin sensitization, potentially through a systemic secreted factor.</p><p>We detected increased expression of BAT-marker genes, <italic>Ucp1</italic>, <italic>Elovl3</italic>, and <italic>Cidea,</italic> in the iWAT of NRF2 knockout mice, but not wild-type mice, in our RNAseq results obtained following SFN treatment. SFN exerts NRF2-independent actions such as inhibiting mTOR pathway through effects on HDAC6/AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, adipose-specific ablation of mTOR activity has been shown to induce the browning of WAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Polak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), and thus could potentially account for the NRF2-independent effect of SFN on this phenotype. However, when we directly treated the iWAT explants with SFN, we did not detect increased expression of either brown or beige adipose marker genes. A former study suggested that the SFN precursor glucoraphanin increased browning of the iWAT in an NRF2-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nagata et al., 2017</xref>). While the underlying causes of the discrepancy between our results and this former study remain unclear to us, differences in drug doses, treatment periods, or mouse strains could possibly be considered. While NRF2 activation is proposed to directly induce <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chang et al., 2021</xref>), fat-specific NRF2 KO mice had increased <italic>Ucp1</italic> expression in the iWAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chartoumpekis et al., 2018</xref>), Accordingly, it is possible that SFN-induced suppression of food intake and subsequent weight loss is normally compensated by NRF2-dependent mechanisms, leading to the downregulation of BAT-related genes in iWAT. Removal of these compensatory mechanisms in the NRF2 KO mice would result in the upregulated expression of BAT-related thermogenic genes in the iWAT. Although the role of NRF2 in beiging requires further investigation, taken together, our results suggest that SFN has an NRF2-independent effect on iWAT browning. Furthermore, this effect plays only a marginal role in SFN-induced weight loss in light of the fact that the antiobesity effect of SFN is significantly compromised in NRF2 KO mice.</p><p>One of the notable findings in our RNAseq analysis was the relatively low number of changes detected in the hypothalamic transcriptome. The hypothalamus is composed of more than 40 cell types with distinct transcriptional signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). For example, POMC and AgRP neurons, which form the melanocortin circuitry that mediates approximately half of leptin action, represent only a minor fraction of the diverse hypothalamic cell populations. This heterogeneity is further enriched within defined cell populations such that the leptin receptor-expressing hypothalamic cells represent at least 25 different neuronal and non-neuronal cell clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kakava-Georgiadou and Severens, 2020</xref>). It is likely that transcriptional changes in distinct, chemically defined neuronal populations cannot be detected by total hypothalamic transcriptional analysis. Future studies on the transcriptional profile of leptin receptor-positive cell populations in SFN-treated mice will help uncover both the nature of the peripheral signals potentiating leptin signaling and the molecular biology of leptin resistance.</p><p>The SFN-induced increase in antioxidant capacity has been reported as a result of NRF2 activation of its downstream genes. Increased OSR capacity improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kopprasch et al., 2016</xref>); however, the role of peripheral OSR on the central leptin receptor signaling and body weight regulation is unclear. Therefore, an important question remains as to how stimulation of NRF2 activity/OSR in skeletal muscle can improve leptin receptor signaling and trigger weight loss in SFN-treated mice. Future studies will assess the antiobesity and leptin-sensitizing effects of SFN on muscle-specific NRF2 KO mice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Reducing body weight in an anabolic state</title><p>KEAP1 is the main negative regulator of NRF2 stability and therefore activity. KEAP1 deficiency in mice was proposed to induce a metabolic state mimicking fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knatko et al., 2020</xref>), in large part because the resultant NRF2 activation leads to fatty acid oxidation. Our data also supports this state of fasting in the liver and adipose tissue in regard to fat metabolism. RNAseq results indicated downregulation of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA, and oxaloacetate formation including <italic>Fasn</italic>, <italic>Scd1</italic>, <italic>Acly,</italic> and <italic>Me1</italic> in liver, BAT, and eWAT, suggesting decreased lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis.

However, this catabolic phenotype in fat metabolism, which parallels the fasted state, is not accompanied by protein catabolism as we further discuss below.</p><p>SFN activates multiple cellular pathways, directly and indirectly, and generates a complex molecular profile. For example, SFN-induced reduction of food intake and fat mass could potentially result in an energy deficit and activation of metabolic pathways that conserve energy, leading to an overall catabolic output. On the other hand, SFN and its precursor glucoraphanin improve glucose homeostasis and increase insulin action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelsson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Xu et al., 2018c</xref>), which activates the major anabolic pathways that consume energy. Furthermore, SFN was proposed to inhibit the action of mTOR, an insulin signaling downstream molecule and major anabolic regulator, which might augment the energy-preserving pathways in key metabolic tissues. We thus decided to investigate further in-depth mechanisms of action of SFN using our large volume of RNAseq data by conducting pathway analyses to dissect the network-level changes induced by SFN in each tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s37">37</xref> ). Analysis of our RNAseq results indicates that the SFN treatment results in concurrent changes in multiple crucial molecular pathways. Surprisingly, despite weight loss and decreased food intake induced by the SFN treatment, the RNAseq results demonstrated that SFN caused a striking upregulation of the most anabolic pathways in the high-energy-demanding tissues including the BAT, skeletal muscle, and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s37">13; 32–37</xref>). We observed robust upregulation of protein synthesis and ribosome biogenesis pathways supported by upregulation of genes such as eIF2 downstream pathway, the housekeeping ATP-dependent peptidase CLPP, and numerous ribosomal proteins. Markers of cell proliferation such as myc downstream genes were upregulated, and tumor-suppressing genes such as <italic>Trim24</italic>, <italic>Trp53</italic>, and <italic>Rb1</italic> had decreased expression. Additionally, we observed upregulation in cytoskeletal assembly and cell-cell adhesion molecule genes supported by upregulation of alpha-catenin downstream genes, N−glycan biosynthesis genes, and <italic>Psmb11</italic> and <italic>Psmb7</italic>. Increased ribosome biogenesis and overall markers of proteostasis are in agreement with preservation of the lean mass and EE of the DIO mice despite decreased food intake during SFN treatment. In line with these findings, SFN-treated mice were reported to have enhanced running capacity with attenuated muscle fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Oh et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, overall metabolic profile induced by SFN is not a simple mimetic of fasting or associated with the catabolic state anticipated uniformly across the tissues due to caloric restriction.</p><p>One of the hallmarks of obesity is the chronic low-grade inflammation in several central and peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weisberg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wellen and Hotamisligil, 2003</xref>).

Furthermore, macrophage infiltration into the adipose tissue and their polarization towards a pro-inflammatory profile is causally linked to the etiology of obesity-induced insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee and Lam, 2019</xref>). In agreement with these, the expression of the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage marker genes <italic>Chil3</italic> and <italic>Arg1</italic> was upregulated (6.2- and 5.9-fold over vehicle for <italic>Agr1</italic> and <italic>Chil3</italic>, respectively, p&lt;0.001) in the white adipose tissue of SFN-treated mice. Furthermore, expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 is also increased in the eWAT by SFN (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, it is worth noting that the same dose of SFN that induces potent weight loss in DIO mice is not effective to reduce either the body weight or improve the glucose homeostasis in <italic>Lep<sup>ob/ob</sup></italic> or <italic>Lepr<sup>db/db</sup></italic> mice. Therefore, while these findings suggest that SFN could contribute to the improved metabolic profile of the animals by decreased inflammatory tone, we propose that the anti-inflammatory function of NRF2 activation is not the major driver of SFN-induced weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Therapeutic potential of SFN</title><p>Since SFN is acid labile and sensitive to heat, glucoraphanin, a more stable and inert precursor of SFN, is taken orally by humans as a food supplement.

With plant tissue degradation during chewing, myrosinase comes in contact with glucoraphanin that converts it to SFN. The mammalian cells do not produce myrosinases and the conversion of glucoraphanin to SFN occurs by the bacterial microflora of the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shapiro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yagishita et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouranis et al., 2021</xref>). Meta-analysis of published studies using mice indicates a close proximity of dose ranges for the efficacy of SFN on various pharmacological targets by i.p. and oral administrations, suggesting an excellent oral bioavailability. These studies have utilized a wide range of effective doses of SFN with the medians of 175 and 113 µmol/kg of body weight by oral and i.p. administration, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yagishita et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we used the dose 5–10 mg/kg (30–60 µmol/kg) SFN to treat DIO mice to induce weight loss, clearly in the lower range of previously published studies. Human studies, however, report the efficacy dose ranges of SFN to be significantly (around 10-fold) lower than in mice, even after correction for allometric scaling. The lower efficacy range was reported as &lt;0.5 µmol/kg and the median human dose around 300 µmol (4 µmol/kg) in human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shapiro et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yagishita et al., 2019</xref>). These discrepancies could be due to greater clearance in rodents compared to humans per body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yagishita et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, few rodent studies have included a dose-response data, with the majority of the animal study doses exceeding the highest doses of SFN used in humans, even after accounting for allometric scaling between rodents and humans. Thus, the greater than 4-log spread of doses used in mice appears not to be based on a dose-response analysis and optimization of translational science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yagishita et al., 2019</xref>). Following oral administration, SFN and its metabolites were detected in various tissues at 2 and 6 hr, and a dose-dependent increase in its concentration was also observed in most tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clarke et al., 2011</xref>). In humans, safety studies have shown that BSE at amounts corresponding to 50–400 μmol SFN daily is well tolerated without clinically significant adverse effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kensler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shapiro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). The toxicity dose (LD50) of SFN is estimated to be about 10-fold higher than the median dose reported for efficacy outcomes in mice (213 mg/kg i.p.; 1203 µmol/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yagishita et al., 2019</xref>). In clinical trials to investigate the effects of SFN on glucose control in T2D patients, BSE containing 150 μmol SFN per dose has been administered to humans. This dose (~3.3 mg/kg), corresponding to one-third of the dose per body surface area compared with the animal experiments (at 10 mg/kg), was well tolerated in clinical safety studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelsson et al., 2017</xref>) and significantly reduced the blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels in obese diabetic patients without affecting the body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bahadoran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cramer and Jeffery, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kikuchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Axelsson et al., 2017</xref>). While obese humans develop hyperleptinemia in a similar manner to diet-induced rodents, it is possible that the dose and bioavailability of SFN to various tissues are also important parameters to be considered as an antiobesity agent. Numerous clinical studies investigating SFN’s potential beneficial effects in a wide range of diseases including cancers (prostate, bladder, colorectal, breast, lung), psychiatric diseases (schizophrenia, autism, depression), inflammation (COVID-19, osteoarthritis), metabolic syndrome (DMII, obesity), and aging (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov">https://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>) will ultimately uncover whether the findings we report here are to be translated to human health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the University of Michigan (protocol number: PRO00007712), Vanderbilt University (protocol numbers: M1700112 and M/10/358), and Qatar University (protocol number: QU-IACUC 1-62019-1) approved the experimental protocols and euthanasia procedures used in this study.

Mice, after acclimation to individual housing for at least 7 days, were placed in metabolic cages located in the Mouse Metabolic Phenotyping Center at Vanderbilt University in a temperature- and humidity-controlled housing room. EE measures were obtained using a computer-controlled indirect calorimetry system (Promethion, Sable Systems, Las Vegas, NV). The calorimetry system consists of 16 metabolic cages (identical to home cages with bedding) each equipped with water bottles and food hoppers connected to load cells for food and water intake monitoring, and all animals had ad libitum access to food and water throughout the study unless otherwise specified. Respiratory quotient (RQ) is calculated as the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> production over O<sub>2</sub> consumption. EE is calculated using the Weir equation: kcal/hr = 60 * (0.003941 * VO<sub>2</sub> + 0.001106 * VCO<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weir, 1949</xref>). Ambulatory activity is determined simultaneously every second with the collection of the calorimetry data. Ambulatory activity and position are detected with XYZ beam arrays (BXYZ-R, Sable Systems) with a beam spacing of 1.0 cm interpolated to a centroid resolution of 0.25 cm. Consecutive adjacent infrared beam breaks are counted and converted to distance, with a minimum movement threshold set at 1 cm. Data acquisition and instrument control were coordinated by MetaScreen v2.2.18, and the obtained raw data were processed using ExpeData v1.7.30 (Sable Systems) using an analysis script detailing all aspects of data transformation. The script is available on request from Sable Systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Primer sequences</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Ms-<italic>Acaca</italic>-Fwd (<named-content

The authors demonstrate that NRF2-dependent lowering of body weight does not occur in lean animals and requires leptin receptor/hyperleptinemia. They also suggest a primary action in skeletal muscle and upregulation of a transcriptional program promoting a protection against obesity. There is some confusion/concerns about inclusion/exclusion of data within graphs, assumptions generated from the data, and interpretation of physiological drivers of the phenotype observed.</p><p>Cakir et al., examines whether pharmacological activation of NRF2 reverses DIO in mice. They showed that NRF2-dependent lowering of body weight does not occur in lean animals and requires leptin receptor/hyperleptinemia. They also suggest a primary action in skeletal muscle and upregulation of a transcriptional program promoting a protection against obesity.</p><p>Figures 1, 3, 4, 5. The body weight data in response to SFN and leptin is presented at times as total body weight and at other times percent change or change in grams. This makes it extremely difficult to compare across the different manipulations. Either this needs to be consistently presented throughout the manuscript or all 3 analyses should be presented for each manipulation. For instance, Figure 1A shows a 15% decrease in body weight of DIO mice however the total body weight as presented in Figure 1C is not shown for Figure 1A. However, in Figure 4A the total body weight is shown without the percent change. It appears from the graph in Figure 4A that there is 0% body weight change in Nrf2KO, vehicle; while the Nrf2KO, SFN may have reduced 5% maybe even up to 10%. If there was a change, was this significant? Similar comparisons should be shown in Figures 1C, 4D, 5A, 5C, 5F, Supp Figure 1, Supp Figure 5.</p><p>The authors make an assumption that the glucose effects are dependent upon body weight (page 10). Were the GTT measurements obtained from mice of a similar body weight? Could the authors plot the blood glucose in the GTT experiments against weight to determine if theres a connection?</p><p>Also, an overnight fast prior to GTT is not physiologically relevant since this completely depletes glycogen stores and increased gluconeogenesis, adipose tissue lipolysis – its not a physiological relevant way to assess glucose metabolism.</p><p>Also, if the authors were to normalize to percent change for the GTT, would they have the same conclusion?</p><p>Figure 2F, 2G, 2H unclear if vehicle does or does not affect activity. Is total ambulatory activity affected?</p><p>Figure 2C. Asterisks are confusing. What are the comparisons? In some, the asterisk is over the black bar, while in others they are over the red bars. In one, there is a double asterisk which is stacked vertically, while in others double and triple asterisks are horizontal.</p><p>Figure 3D. This presentation leads to the conclusion that there is no change in HFD and HFD SFN food intake. If so, then what accounts for the protection of the obese phenotype in the HFD SFN group? This would appear at odds with DIO mice (Figure 1 and 2). This should be discussed.</p><p>Figure 4. There appear to be issues with the controls in this figure. In figures 4A-4B, Nrf2KO mice receive vehicle and SFN. It seems the authors are missing vehicle and SFN groups for WT mice over this same period. In Figures 4D-4E, the authors present SFN treatment to WT and HDAC6KO mice. However, it appears they lack the vehicle control groups for these figures.</p><p>Figure 4F, presents WT vehicle/SFN; Nrf2KO Veh/SFN; and WT/HDAC6KO SFN – it appears they are missing the vehicle for HDAC6KO. Also, if these summary data are derived from Figure 4A-4E, are they comparable? In particular, Figure 4A-4C represents 27 days of treatment, while Figures 4D-4E represent 11 days of treatment. Overall it is very difficult to assess these data.</p><p>Figure 4f should be 2way anova</p><p>Figure 5E. it's surprising that leptin alone appears not to reduce cumulative food intake. However, this is not easily determined as the authors do not appear to have controlled for the effect of leptin. Previous studies have shown very rapid reductions (within 1d) in food intake in obob mice receiving as little as 1ug per day (PMID: 9421392). It would be useful to determine the effectiveness of leptin alone in these studies.</p><p>Figure 5g and 5h. Was the leptin level physiological in serum? Were these mice hyperleptinemic?</p><p>If SFN requires high leptin levels how does it work on lean mice which are fed HFD and administered SFN vs vehicle if they are starting with similar adiposity and presumably similar leptin levels?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Cakir et al., examined the underlying mechanisms for the herb extract Sulforaphane (SFN) in reducing obesity. This study appears to be based on a large body of existing literature demonstrating a beneficial effect of SFN in body weight and metabolism but with an unclear mechanism. They first showed that SFN is highly selective on reducing HFD-induced obesity but has no obvious impact on chow-fed weight. Using a variety of relevant animal models, this study elegantly showed that the SFN effect is dependent on leptin signaling as it has no effects in both ob/ob an db/db animal models with deficient leptin function. Given the potential involvements of multiple downstream signaling pathways, the authors provided data that SFN is not effective in reducing HFD-induced obesity in NRF2 KO mice but is effective in HDAC6 deficient mice, arguing NRF is the main downstream mediator in reducing obesity. Intriguingly, additional data suggested that the SNF action is not mediated by hypothalamic neurons, where leptin resistance is thought to reside. The authors then performed RNAseq studies in various relevant peripheral tissues , trying to identify key underlying signaling pathways, with some data pointing to a potential involvement of muscle tissues in mediating the SFN effect. Overall, the study is very well designed and the results are clearly presented, and the manuscript is also well-written.</p><p>Strength:</p><p>1) As SFN has been extensively studied with demonstrated effects on reducing obesity but no unified underlying mechanisms, this study points to a clear mechanism with leptin action and NRF2, significantly extending the biology of SFN, and will have a significant impact on the field of obesity as well as its prevention and treatment.</p><p>2) Beautiful use of animal models with clean effects of SFN in the impact of obesity, strongly supporting the concept that the SFN effect is mediated by the leptin pathway.</p><p>3) The synergistic effect of leptin+SFN on reducing lean mouse body weight provides additional support for leptin action in mediating the SFN function.</p><p>4) The data on Nrf2 KO mice with no obvious effects on body weight strongly support that Nrf2 is the major downstream mediator of SFN.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>1) One key concept is that the SFN effect on reducing obesity is mediated by its effect on activating the NRF2 signaling; however, NRF2 KO mice exhibit resistance to diet-induced obesity. As the authors have data from NRF2 KO mice, they didn't provide any data on these contradicting results.</p><p>2) This study will be benefited from providing more details on procedures including when or what ages the mice were subjected to GTTs and CLAMS measurements.</p><p>3) The RNAseq data in muscle/liver etc would be more informative in pointing to the underlying signaling pathways if the authors include the chow diet fed groups and/or Nrf2 KO groups.</p><p>This study is well executed and significant in the field of obesity research.

Discuss what accounts for the protection of the obese phenotype in the HFD SFN group Figure 3D</p></disp-quote><p>Results from metabolic chambers (Figure 2) show that SFN prevents the hypophagia-induced decrease in energy expenditure, suggesting that SFN induces energy expenditure. Therefore increased energy expenditure likely results in the attenuation of weight gain by SFN during the initial weeks of exposure to HFD of otherwise lean animals. The difference in the body weights of the HFD-Veh vs. HFD-SFN groups becomes significant (by 2-way ANOVA) after 2 weeks of HFD exposure.</p><p>SFN suppresses food intake in mice that are already obese and hyperleptinemic. Therefore in young, lean mice that have relatively low leptin levels, SFN did not suppress food intake during initial exposure of animals to HFD, suggesting that SFN does not induce a specific aversion against HFD. These results are consistent with the mechanism of action of SFN, which requires high leptin levels for SFN to suppress food intake.</p><p>Following 8 weeks of HFD exposure, the leptin levels in SFN-treated mice were significantly lower than vehicle-treated mice. We anticipate that as the leptin levels rise, SFN’s effect on food intake becomes more prominent. Accordingly, in the last week of the experiment (Figure 3D) the food intake of the SFN group started to show a tendency for a decrease, although the two-way ANOVA did not indicate statistical significance. Hence, we repeated this experiment with a slightly increased dose of SFN (15 mg/kg) where SFN significantly suppressed the cumulative food intake of the mice after two weeks of HFD exposure (Supplementary Figure 1L) suggesting that SFN action is dose dependent and slightly higher doses of SFN is required to suppress food intake when leptin levels are relatively low compared to DIO mice.</p><p>Our findings collectively suggest that SFN-induced leptin sensitization requires a potentially muscle-derived factor, which alone might be promoting energy expenditure, but in combination with hyperleptinemia elicits a potent anorectic weight-reducing effect. It is also possible that the mechanism of SFN-induced sensitization to leptin’s effect on food intake vs. energy expenditure might not be identical, however, this question requires identification of the precise mechanism of SFN-induced leptin sensitization. Neverthless, our results suggest that SFN attenuates weight gain on HFD in a dose-dependent manner through a mechanism that requires leptin signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Because SFN induces weight loss in DIO mice, it is not trivial to attribute the improved glucose tolerance to the drug’s direct effect on glucose homesotasis or reduced adiposity, or both. To address this concern, we conducted GTT in <italic>db/db</italic> and <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, which are resistant to the weight-reducing effects of SFN (Supplementary figure 4), where SFN did not improve the glucose tolerance.

Mice started receiving a daily injection of SFN once they were in the metabolic cages. We routinely conduct indirect calorimetry in our facilities at Vanderbilt Mouse Metabolic Phenotype Core. The cage size and environment in the Promethion SABLE systems are similar to the animals’ home cage. Furthermore, we discard results from the first 48 hours of each run.

The authors demonstrate that NRF2-dependent lowering of body weight does not occur in lean animals and requires leptin receptor/hyperleptinemia.

The body weight data in response to SFN and leptin is presented at times as total body weight and at other times percent change or change in grams. This makes it extremely difficult to compare across the different manipulations. Either this needs to be consistently presented throughout the manuscript or all 3 analyses should be presented for each manipulation. For instance, Figure 1A shows a 15% decrease in body weight of DIO mice however the total body weight as presented in Figure 1C is not shown for Figure 1A. However, in Figure 4A the total body weight is shown without the percent change. It appears from the graph in Figure 4A that there is 0% body weight change in Nrf2KO, vehicle; while the Nrf2KO, SFN may have reduced 5% maybe even up to 10%. If there was a change, was this significant? Similar comparisons should be shown in Figures 1C, 4D, 5A, 5C, 5F, Supp Figure 1, Supp Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised figures now show absolute body weights and percent changes in body weight for comparison for all cohorts.</p><p>– SFN-treatment does result in a small but significant change in the body weights of DIO nrf2KO mice. We observed that SFN leads to increased expression of brown adipose-related genes in inguinal WAT of nrf2KO mice.

Our results clearly indicate that SFN-induced beiging is NRF2-independent and contributes only marginally to the anti-obesity effect of SFN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make an assumption that the glucose effects are dependent upon body weight (page 10).

Increasing the SFN dose to 15 mg/kg led to a significant food intake suppression in lean mice placed on HFD after two weeks of treatment, pointing to a dose-response effect of the drug. However, the extent of inhibition of food intake by SFN in this experimental setting was still lower compared to its effect in the food intake of DIO mice. This is consistent with the mechanism of action of SFN, which requires high leptin levels to suppress food intake.
