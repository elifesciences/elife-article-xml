As a large intracellular multiprotein signaling platform, it activates downstream effectors that initiate a rapid necrotic programmed cell death (PCD) termed pyroptosis and activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines to warn and activate surrounding cells. However, inflammasome activation is difficult to control experimentally on a single-cell level using canonical triggers. We constructed Opto-ASC, a light-responsive form of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC (Apoptosis-Associated Speck-Like Protein Containing a CARD) which allows tight control of inflammasome formation in vivo. We introduced a cassette of this construct under the control of a heat shock element into zebrafish in which we can now induce ASC inflammasome (speck) formation in individual cells of the skin. We find that cell death resulting from ASC speck formation is morphologically distinct from apoptosis in periderm cells but not in basal cells. ASC-induced PCD can lead to apical or basal extrusion from the periderm. The apical extrusion in periderm cells depends on Caspb and triggers a strong Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling response in nearby cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>0ptogenetics</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>ASC speck</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leptin</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC2017-CoG-770988-InflamCellDeath</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Broz</surname><given-names>Petr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>175576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shkarina</surname><given-names>Kateryna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>198005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shkarina</surname><given-names>Kateryna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010776</institution-id><institution>OPO-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shkarina</surname><given-names>Kateryna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shkarina</surname><given-names>Kateryna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Manipulating cell death in situ with the temporal and spatial precision of optogenetic tools opens up new avenues for studying inflammation, death and related phenomena, revealing, for example, that epithelial cell death cannot be classified into strictly distinct categories.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune system plays a crucial role in the early recognition and eradication of potentially dangerous microorganisms. Inflammasomes are among the best characterized components of innate antimicrobial defense in vertebrates. Inflammasome activation is induced following recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by intracellular pattern-recognition receptors, such as NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and AIM2-like receptors (ALRs). This leads to the formation of large multiprotein platforms, which often contain the adaptor molecule ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD), that can recruit and activate proinflammatory caspases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Martinon et al., 2002</xref>). These caspases cleave and thereby activate downstream effector molecules, including the pore-forming Gasdermins (GSDMs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18), which are then released through the GSDM pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evavold et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heilig et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Inflammasome pathway components are expressed in immune and non-immune cells, but have been studied mostly in cultured cells or bone marrow derived macrophages (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tweedell et al., 2020</xref>). Recent studies also highlight their involvement in the antimicrobial defense in epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Santana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Churchill et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Epithelia are the first point of contact between the host organism and microbial invaders. Although the role of inflammasome components can be studied in vivo using epithelial infection models, little is known about the direct effects of inflammasome formation on cells and their neighbours in the context of the live tissue. Thus, analysis of this dynamic and rapid process would benefit from precise spatial control of inflammasome formation and live imaging of the ensuing physiological events.</p><p>Zebrafish are well suited to study innate and adaptive immunity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novoa and Figueras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renshaw and Trede, 2012</xref>). Their transparency in early stages and a multitude of fluorescent reporter lines offer ideal conditions for real-time visualization of cellular processes in tissues. Some of the genes encoding core components of innate immune signaling pathways are highly conserved in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stein et al., 2007</xref>), while others, like those encoding the fish-specific NLR proteins, are more divergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Howe et al., 2016</xref>). The adaptor protein ASC is among the most highly conserved inflammasome components in all vertebrates. ASC consists of a pyrin domain (PYD) and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) connected by a flexible linker. Once activated, ASC undergoes prion-like oligomerization, concentrating the entire pool of ASC in the cell in one spot to form a dense fibrous structure, the ASC speck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dick et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the zebrafish, ASC is expressed both in epithelial and immune cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>). The larval zebrafish skin consists of two cell layers. The outer cell layer, the periderm, consists of tightly connected keratinocytes with characteristic actin ridges; the underlying layer consists of basal cells which in adult zebrafish harbor a stem cell pool to replace dying cells in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). During larval development the periderm is gradually replaced and until then grows by divisions and asymmetric fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan et al., 2022</xref>). A functional inflammasome can be experimentally induced in both layers of the larval zebrafish skin by over-expressing ASC-mKate2, leading to immediate cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As in mammals, caspases in the zebrafish are recruited to the ASC speck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>). The zebrafish genome encodes three inflammatory caspases which contain a PYD domain rather than the CARD found in other vertebrates, Caspa, Caspb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masumoto et al., 2003</xref>) and Casp19b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spead et al., 2018</xref>) to the ASC speck. The functional homologues of mammalian Caspase-1 in zebrafish, Caspa and Caspb, are both able to induce cell death in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shkarina et al., 2022</xref>), and GSDMD cleavage and pyroptosis in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shkarina et al., 2022</xref>). Caspb has been shown to cleave the zebrafish Gasdermins, Gsdmea and Gsdmeb, in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), while Caspa has been shown to co-localize with ASC-specks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Masumoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Upon cleavage, GSDMs assemble into pores in the plasma membrane and lead to the release of the cell’s cytosol, including inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sborgi et al., 2016</xref>), a hallmark of pyroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rühl and Broz, 2022</xref>). In the absence of GSDMD, mammalian caspase-1 activates apoptosis as a default pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Heilig et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsuchiya et al., 2021</xref>), and the same was found for ASC-containing inflammasomes in the absence of caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sagulenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitazawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Apoptosis is morphologically distinct from pyroptosis and characterized by preservation of membrane integrity, characteristic membrane blebbing and progressive fragmentation of the cell, in contrast to pyroptosis, which most commonly leads to a characteristic cell swelling.</p><p>We have previously developed optogenetic variants for human and zebrafish caspases which can be activated by light-induced oligomerization of Cry2olig, a photosensitive protein that undergoes rapid homo-oligomerization in response to blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taslimi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shkarina et al., 2022</xref>). This enabled us to selectively induce multiple forms of programmed cell death (PCD) in different cell types in vitro, in organoids and in live zebrafish larvae. We observed that zebrafish periderm cells are apically extruded from their surrounding epithelium upon stimulation of the inflammatory caspases but are basally extruded after activation of the apoptotic caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shkarina et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To further study inflammasome formation and the resulting cell death in the zebrafish skin upstream of inflammatory caspases, we have now generated an optogenetic variant of zebrafish ASC (Opto-ASC), which efficiently induces speck formation in single cells in both layers of the larval skin. Opto-ASC specks cause inflammatory cell death followed by apical or basal extrusion in periderm cells, which is morphologically distinct from apoptosis. ASC-speck-induced cell death requires Caspa and Caspb but we could not confirm the role of GSDMs in this process; we therefore refrain from calling it pyroptosis. We show that Opto-ASC specks efficiently trigger cell death in the periderm via inflammatory apical or basal extrusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic activation of ASC-oligomerization</title><p>In the past, in vivo induction of inflammasome assembly has been achieved only via overexpression of ASC or NLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>), or by treatment with proinflammatory chemicals like CuSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>) or pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tyrkalska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forn-Cuní et al., 2019</xref>). However, such chemical and bacterial treatments affect the entire organism, which complicates targeted and controlled studies of cellular and tissue responses. In contrast, the over-expression of ASC efficiently triggers speck formation and cell death, but does not allow targeting these processes to pre-determined cells. To overcome these limitations and to enable specific induction of inflammasome assembly with spatial and temporal control, we tagged zebrafish ASC with Cry2olig to produce ‘Opto-ASC’. Cry2olig is a protein module that, upon exposure to blue light, reversibly oligomerizes within seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taslimi et al., 2014</xref>). We fused the mCherry-Cry2olig domain to the N-terminal PYD of ASC and placed this cassette under the control of a heat shock responsive element (HSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajoghli et al., 2004</xref>), to be able to selectively induce expression in experimental larvae. We generated stable zebrafish lines carrying the plasmid shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> using Tol2-based random genome integration. The plasmid contains a screening cassette in which tagRFP is expressed under the heart-specific myosin light chain 2 promoter (cmlc2).

If a more uniform expression of Opto-ASC were desired, this could be achieved by the expression of Opto-ASC under the control of tissue-specific promoters combined with Cre-Lox or trans-activator-induced expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Knopf et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mosimann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gerety et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Opto-ASC oligomerization is efficiently induced within minutes by constant exposure to 488 nm light. After a single light pulse, specks were often not observed immediately, but appeared with a delay of up to 40 min. This is unexpected, because it is unlikely that Cry2-olig would remain active for so long that dimerization could be delayed for more than a few minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taslimi et al., 2014</xref>), and one would expect that even a single initial dimerization of Opto-ASC would have led to the immediate recruitment of the endogenous ASC that is available throughout the cell. Our observations may suggest that the initial seeding event could have created a dimer that was not yet active, but that a second step of maturation could subsequently occur. This highlights the fact that we still know very little about the unusual dynamics of speck assembly, or the mystery why the cell normally always forms only one single speck.</p><p>In response to the formation of an Opto-ASC speck periderm cells died in two morphologically different ways. Cells were extruded either apically or basally, and some cells were simultaneously extruded in both ways. Apical extrusion of periderm cells has been described not only in response to infection, but also in response to treatment with the antibiotic geneticin (G418) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eisenhoffer and Rosenblatt, 2011</xref>) and during tissue homeostasis as a response to cell crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2012</xref>). Apoptotic stimuli like geneticin have been shown to induce extrusion via sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and its receptor, which is expressed in the surrounding cells. We have previously shown that S1P signaling does not seem to drive extrusion of pyroptotic cells in Caco-2 cell co-cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shkarina et al., 2022</xref>), but so far it is unclear if S1P signaling or another mechanism activated downstream of the inflammasome is responsible for apical extrusion. Although the factors determining the direction of extrusion remain to be discovered, the different ratios of apical and basal extrusion of periderm cells in different zebrafish strains suggest a genetic component.</p><p>These findings indicate that different types of cell death are not entirely separable, but that they represent different manifestations of parallel and interconnected signaling pathways, the overall balance of which defines the final outcomes. This is also evident from other studies in the past, where disrupting one pathway directs the cell towards a different pathway that may have a different phenotypic outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsuchiya et al., 2019</xref>). Perhaps it is only through experimental activation of the most downstream effector that a ‘pure’ phenotype can be induced.</p><p>In the case of zebrafish periderm, we identified Caspb as essential for apical extrusion. In the absence of Caspb, cells die with an apoptotic morphology in response to speck formation. The requirement for Caspb for apical extrusion and lysis might also explain the difference in the response to ASC-speck formation between the periderm and the underlying basal cells. According to cell-type-specific RNA sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cokus et al., 2019</xref>), basal cells express ten times lower levels of Caspb than periderm cells.</p><p>Although Caspa localizes to the ASC speck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>) and is necessary for rapid cell death if no Caspb is present, we did not find it to be necessary for speck induced extrusion. This contradicts our own previous work, in which we identified Caspa as responsible for fast extrusion after speck formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuri et al., 2017</xref>). We have now re-analyzed our previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) and found that the delay between speck formation and cell death can be partially explained by the type of cell that was imaged, namely basal cells, although we observed a much stronger delay between speck formation and cell death in Caspa deficient cells than in wildtype basal cells.</p><p>Zebrafish Caspa and Caspb are thus redundant in their role as rapid cell death inducers, but the downstream mechanisms that lead to either extrusion or apoptosis of periderm cells are yet to be identified. These mechanisms may be deployed differently in different situations. For example, in Caco-2 cell monolayers caspase-1 causes pyroptosis with rapid apical extrusion and a lamellipodial response in neighbouring cells which close the wound within approximately 70 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfim-Melo et al., 2022</xref>). Wound closure after ASC-induced apical extrusion of zebrafish periderm cells is much faster (around 10 min). Basal cells on the other hand trigger a lamellipodial response in neighbouring cells and take longer to close the gap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B</xref>), similar to Caco-2 cells.</p><p>Apoptosis and ASC-induced cell death are both initiated within a short time after speck formation and cause the recruitment of actin in surrounding periderm cells to the side facing the dying cells. The closure of the surrounding epithelium above or below the extruded cell is faster for ASC-induced extrusion than for apoptosis. This difference in rate of wound closure could be caused by different dynamics in the cell itself, or in the surrounding cells. The fact that we observe an immediate Ca<sup>2+</sup> response in the case of ASC-induced death, but not apoptosis, indicates signalling from the dying cell to the surrounding epithelium, and this signal differs between cells dying apoptotically or by ASC-induced death. Caspase-8-induced apical extrusion of MDCK cells is preceded by a strong calcium wave in surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takeuchi et al., 2020</xref>), further suggesting that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave correlates with the mode of extrusion rather than the trigger for cell death. The fast apical extrusion and the rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> response require Caspb, pointing to a Caspb-dependent signalling event. A similar reaction was observed in cultured intestinal epithelial cells in which a bacterial infection sensed by the NAIP/NLRC4 inflammasome induce a fast myosin-dependent contraction in surrounding cells. This reaction was dependent on the activation of sub-lytic GSDMD pores and the resulting ion flux and independent of the cell death or extrusion of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Samperio Ventayol et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish do not have a direct homolog of GsdmD but two homologues of GsdmE (Gsdmea/b). Human GsdmE is activated downstream of caspase-3 during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2017</xref>) and it plays a role in the caspase-3-mediated lytic death of primary human keratinocytes after viral inactivation of the Bcl-2 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Orzalli et al., 2021</xref>). Both zebrafish gasdermins can be cleaved by Caspb and other apoptotic caspases (but not Caspa) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). It was therefore surprising to find that we did not see a change in peridermal keratinocyte cell death after ASC-speck formation when we knocked out Gsdme a and b by CRISPR/Cas9. also treated larvae with inhibitors of Gasdermin D pore formation but did not see any effect on ASC-speck-induced apical extrusion. Although the CRISPR/Cas 9 strategy is highly efficient, and in our hands has worked well for other genes, we cannot rule out that Gsdme a and b are redundant in their function to mediate Caspb dependent extrusion and that a small amount is sufficient to induce this form of cell death. Additionally, we find that cells which are extruded do not lyse immediately upon swelling which is normally the case in pyroptotic cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shkarina et al., 2022</xref>). Since we find a Caspb-dependent difference in cell death phenotypes, the question arises which other components could cause the apical extrusion of cells and the wave-like Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling response in surrounding cells. Possible candidates could be pannexins, especially pannexin1a, which is expressed in skin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cokus et al., 2019</xref>) and is necessary downstream of caspase-11 to induce pyroptosis in response to LPS in mouse macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). The release of ATP caused by pannexin pores might explain the strong calcium wave in the Caspb-dependent extrusion of peridermal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mori et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish husbandry, transgenic lines, and genotyping</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were cared for using standard procedures as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Westerfield, 2000</xref>) and in accordance with EMBL guidelines.

We used the cell counter plugin to manually count total numbers of periderm cells and numbers of periderm cells expressing Opto-ASC. Example images are always presented as maximum intensity z-projections. The total mean fluorescence of larvae was measured in maximum z-projections in the region of interest (ROI) manually defined by the outline of the larva.

We detail below how we propose to respond to their suggestions and queries.</p><p>In view of the fact that my lab is no longer in existence, I will have to rely on the kind generosity of my colleagues at EMBL to host former team members (the two first authors) for a limited period to come back to Heidelberg to carry out any further experimental work that may be needed. This means we will have to limit the work we can do to those experiments with the highest priority.

Specific experimental issues that are easily addressable:</p><p>There's a significant concern with the use of LDC7559 (line 387) as a putative small molecule inhibitor of gasdermin D function to test roles (or lack thereof) of the zebrafish gasdermins in the ASC-triggered lytic cell death responses. A recent study (Amara et al. 2021. Cell. PMID34320407) has reported that LDC7559 does not inhibit gasdermin D (and possibly other gasdermins) but rather acts as an allosteric activator of PFKL (phosphofructosekinase-1 liver type) in neutrophils and thereby suppress generation of the NADPH required for the phagocytic oxidative burst and consequent NETosis. Thus, use of LDC7559 as a presumed gasdermin inhibitor in the current manuscript is problematic and should be deleted. As an alternative pharmacological approach to suppress gasdermin function, the authors might consider the use of either disulfiram (Hu et al. 2020. Nature Immunology. PMID32367036) and/or dimethylfumarate (Humphries et al. Science. 2020. PMID32820063). These would be straightforward additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have ordered the reagents to do these experiments. We are optimistic that we will obtain data that will strengthen this part of the ms and be a pointer for future studies by others.</p><p>We propose to keep the information on LDC7559 included, but to discuss the reservations the referee lists above – otherwise, others might ask why we did not even try this inhibitor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In Figure 3 and Figure 4, the majority of Opto-Asc localizes to the plasma membrane but not endogenous Asc. It seems that tagging affects its localization, which could potentially explain its slow kinetics in oligomerization.</p></disp-quote><p>That is an interesting suggestion. The membrane enrichment is indeed reproducible and we have no full explanation for it. However, ASC itself seems to have some affinity for the cell cortex as seen by its association with the apical actin ridges in keratinocytes in the resting state (see e.g. figure 3A). Affinity of ASC for actin is also documented in the literature:(F-actin dampens NLRP3 inflammasome activity via flightless<sup>-1</sup> and LRRFIP2 OPEN; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep29834).</p><p>Perhaps the fusion to the optogenetic module somehow enhances the affinity through the initial dimerization. But we can only speculate and have no further evidence that would allow reliable conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 7, the authors showed that deletion of Caspb, but not Caspa, affected the apical extrusion, without affecting cell death. This may indicate that other caspases, like Caspase-8 or/and caspase-3 were involved. This could be addressed through deletion of Caspase-8 or/and caspase-3.</p></disp-quote><p>These are experiments we had in fact done. Unfortunately, they did not allow us to address the question, because the deletions resulted in embryonic lethality. We have added this information to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is very surprising that Opto-Asc-mediated cell death is not dependent on Gasdermins, at least in Caspb-dependent apically extruded dead cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed – but see comment by and our response to reviewer 1. We hope to be able to provide additional data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Main points:</p><p>1. So far, it remains a bit unclear how the authors define precisely speck versus any aggregate and the light induced clusters of Cry2 olig. Is it related to the timescale of formation and/or the lifetime of the aggregates? Is it related to their size?</p></disp-quote><p>There Is no ‘formal’ definition of an inflammatory speck apart from it being the unusually large aggregates that ASC forms once it is activated. Light-induced clusters of Cry2Olig alone, or of Cry2olig fusions with proteins that do not normally oligomerize are much smaller (extensive documentation in the literature).</p><p>A speck is thus a stable aggregate of ASC which is usually around 1 µm in size and is able to activate downstream caspases. But neither of these aspects alone are unique to ASC: prion-like structures can also be large aggregates (indeed ASC-specks have been compared to prions), and much smaller molecular assemblies can activate caspases. Thus ‘speck’ is more an operational definition, and ‘natural’ specks do have both of these properties, but as our experiments show, the properties can actually be separated. I would rather not try to narrow or change the definition, but leave any further discussion to the experts in the field.</p><p>Figure 4E shows a number of variants of ‘speck’-like and other multimers: ASC-mKate and Opto-ASC form large single specks in the presence of endogenous ASC. Opto-ASC specks are only slightly smaller than those formed by endogenously tagged ASC-GFP (see also Supplementary Figure 2E). Opto-PYD recruits endogenous ASC and becomes incorporated into a speck of approximately the same size, while Opto-CARD does so less efficiently. All of these kill cells. In the absence of endogenous ASC, Opto-ASC forms much smaller specks, and very many in each cell, but these are still functional as seen by the fact that they still kill cells (not the large spot at t = 60 min in the right half of Figure 4E is not a speck, but the contracted dying cell). Both Opto-PYD and Opto-CARD also form only the small aggregates (quantification will be included), with Opto-PYD still killing the cell by virtue of its ability to recruit caspases via their PYD, whereas Opto-CARD does not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors use most of the time constant blue light illumination, could they also assess how long the speck remains after stopping blue light exposure and quantify their lifetime (relative to the CRY2olig cluster lifetime)?</p></disp-quote><p>Briefly, any speck that contains a functional ASC moiety remains stable and does not disassemble once the blue light is turned off. In skin cells it is not possible to make quantitative measurements because they are killed by the speck. Opto-ASC specks remain stable until they are taken up by macrophages, as originally reported for ASC-GFP specks in Kuri et al. 2017.</p><p>Stability can best be assessed in muscle cells, which do not die upon speck formation. The figure below shows that specks begin to form within minutes of a short pulse of illumination and remain stable (and indeed grow further) for at least 60 min.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> has an example:</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Stability of Opto-ASC specks in muscle cells after exposure to a single pulse of blue light specks in muscle cells expressing Opto-AscTg(mCherry-Cry2olig-asc) are induced by a single illumination with blue light (488nm) at t = 0 for 32 seconds.</title><p>Multiple oligomers begin to form within 6 minutes, continue to gradually increase in number and, and remain until the end of the movie (60 mins). Cell outlines in the overlying epithelium labeled by AKT-PH-GFP are faintly visible in the first frame. Scale bar is 20 mm.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86373-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly could they provide some comparison of the size and localisation of CRY2 olig clusters compared to the speck.</p></disp-quote><p>For size, see above. In addition, the size of the Cry2 oligomers as well as of Opto-ASC specks can vary with expression levels.</p><p>For location, Cry2olig clusters are usually distributed throughout the cell, as seen in most of the right panels in Figure 4E, and in earlier work in cultured cells (e.g. Taslimi et al. 2014). ASC specks can form anywhere in the cell, while Cry2olig-ASC has a preference for the cell cortex, but this is not absolute. In keratinocytes, but not in basal cells, the speck usually forms close to the lateral membrane. In the absence of endogenous ASC no real speck is formed but Opto-ASC in this case shows no clear localisation of Opto-ASC to the membrane.</p><p>In view of the variation we see, a strict quantification is difficult: what would be the ‘correct’ definition of classes to look at? To make statistically significant statements, we would need an enormous number of examples in which we could control for all of the variation of expression levels, cell size, day to day variation etc, and we currently don’t have these. We hope the qualitative evidence in the micrographs we show represents the differences well, and we will be happy to provide a larger number of images, if the referees feel this would be helpful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With the non functional CRY2olig Asc fusion (Cter fusion), do they still see transient olig2 clustering which then reverse when blue light illumination is gone? I think it might be useful to clarify these points in the main text since most of the quantifications are based on speck localisation/numbering, so their characteristics have to be very well defined.</p></disp-quote><p>That would be interesting to work out, but after our initial experiments with this construct, we did not pursue this further, since it was not a pressing issue at the time. If we can fit this into our planned experimental time table, we will re-assess it. However, while of interest, we feel these data would not add substantially to what we know at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In all the snapshots of speck formation, there seems to be a relative enrichment of the ASC signal at the cytoplasmic membrane (relative to the cytoplasm) prior to strong speck formation. This seems specific of optoASC as it does not seem to happen for the endogeneous ASC or upon overexpression of ASC-mKate (both in this study and in the previous study published by the same group). Is this apparent membrane enrichment something reproducible? (I see that on pretty much every example of this manuscript). If so what could be the explanation? Is there an actual recruitment at the membrane or is it because the membrane/cortical pool takes longer to be recruited in the speck (hence looking relatively more enriched at intermediate time points).</p></disp-quote><p>See our speculations in response to point 1 of the first referee.</p><p>We too would really like to understand this, but see no easy and efficient way of testing it at this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is also a very distinctive ring accumulation that seems to match with apical constriction and/or a putative actomyosin ring (since this is perfectly round, it could match with a structure with high line tension) (see Figure 1E, Figure 3B, Figure 4D…). Is it something already known? Could the authors comment a bit more on this? This could suggest that ASC accumulates in actomyosin cortex, which would be a very interesting property.</p></disp-quote><p>We see that we had failed to be clear about this.</p><p>There are two types of actin-labelled rings that appear around dying cells. One is formed by the epithelial cells that surround the dying cell. This structure becomes visible as soon as the cell begins to shrink. That it is formed by the surrounding cells is clear from mosaics where the dying cell does not express the actin marker (e.g. suppl. Figure 4A) and the parts of the ring are seen only in the subset of surrounding cells that do express the marker. This ring is also not circular, but follows the polygonal shape of the shrinking cell. We believe that this is the contractile structure that closes the wound, as observed in many other cases of wound healing.</p><p>The other is the one the referee describes here. It is formed within the dying cell, as shown by the fact that it is visible in labelled cells when all the surrounding cells are negative for the marker. The other difference is that it appears only once the dying cell has already contracted considerably and begins to round up and be extruded (most clearly seen in Figure 1E). The third referee had raised a similar point in relation to the same structure seen in Figure 6C, and we provide below the requested analysis. It relies on resolution in the y-axis, which is unsatisfactory, but nevertheless, it is clear that this ring is in a plane above the apical surface of the epithelium (marked by the red membrane marker, i.e is present in the detaching cell). It may well simply be actin appearing in the entire cortex of the cell as it rounds up and looking like a ring when seen from above. A completely different method for imaging would have to be set up to document this reliably, but we hope that these explanations help to clarify the confusion we may have created.</p><p>We do not see this accumulation in cells that leave the epithelium towards the interior (see figure in the response to ‘minor points’ below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In the end, since cell death can also occur without visible speck formation, I am wondering if they are eventually the most relevant structure to be quantified. Is it because speck can be dissolved upon caspase activation and could it relates to the speed at which caspase are activated (which may not leave enough time for strong aggregation and visible speck formation)? I believe it would help to get more explanation/discussion on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>As already mentioned above, it is indeed not obvious what the significance of the large speck is (and it is extremely puzzling why it is that normally one a single one forms in each cell). We agree that it is not necessarily functionally relevant for the signalling outcome to quantify this property – but nor was this the purpose of this work. Regardless of what kind of aggregate is formed, the optogenetic tool allows the induction of ASC-dependent cell death, and therefore the study of the ensuing cellular events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The compensatory mechanisms that lead to cell death/extrusion despite depletion of caspb is very interesting. Could the authors use some pan caspase inhibitor (like zvad FMK) to confirm that this block opto-ASC cell death also in this context? Alternatively could they check the status of effector caspase activation using live probe (nucview) or immunostaining in the context of caspb depletion?</p></disp-quote><p>Those would be interesting avenues to pursue. However, for the reason stated above (Leptin lab closing down, members of fish group no longer at EMBL), we are forced to restrict ourselves to the most important experiments, and think we should prioritize the ones mentioned above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. If I understand well, Figure 7C on the right side suggest that the double KO cells don't extrude (if indeed &quot;no change&quot; mean no extrusion, by the way this nomenclature may deserve some clarification in the legend). I don't think these results are mentioned at any point in the main text, but it would be important to include them (since this is an important control).</p></disp-quote><p>This interpretation is in fact correct, and we have changed the labelling in the figure to ‘no immediate death’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Waves of calcium following cell death and cell extrusion have been previously characterised (Takeushi et al. Curr Biol 2020, Y Fujita group). Interestingly, in this previous article they observed waves of calcium near Caspase8 induced death (in MDCK) as well as near laser induced death in zebrafish, while apparently the authors don't see such Calcium waves upon Caspase8 activation in the zebrafish here. I think it would be important to include a comparison of the authors results with this previous paper in the discussion</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. There is also a previous study which characterised the impact of caspase1 on cell extrusion (Bonfim Melo et al. Cell Report 2022, A. Yap lab) which promotes apical extrusion in Caco2 cells. I think it would also be important to include this work in the discussion and to compare with the results obtain here in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included this in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other minor points:</p><p>1. Line 439: are the numbers given in percentage? if these are absolute numbers, it is out of how many cells ? Same remark line 445: what are the number of cases representing? (percentage?)</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased this to make it unambiguous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 5: could the authors show periderm and basal cell extrusion with the same type of markers? (membrane or actin or ZO1)? This would help to really compare accurately the morphology and the remodellings associated.</p></disp-quote><p>We used Utr-mNeonGreen to lable actin both in periderm and basal cells. Actin labeling of extruded periderm cells is shown in figure 6C, actin labeling of a dying basal cells and the overlying periderm cells is shown in supplementary figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Is there any obvious differences in cell size or characteristic cell shape between the classic lab strains (golden, AB, AB2B2) and the WIK and experiment strain used here? I do acknowledge that this is clearly not the focus of this study, but given this striking difference (which is related to an important question in the field of extrusion), it would interesting to mention this if there is anything obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>We will make these measurements and include the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 6C: what is exactly the localisation in Z of this strong actin accumulation observed during apical extrusion? Is it apical or is it rather on the basal side of the cell? A lateral view of actin could be useful in this figure for all the different conditions described.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to ‘main point 3’ above.</p><p>The images that show this are below. However, even from these images it is hard to appreciate the locations. They are in fact much easier to see by following the movies over time, and through the z-sections at any given time point.

The apical surfaces forms a transient dome in which the actin ridges remain intact before the dying cell is internalized.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86373-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure S3B: could the authors show the utrophin-neonGreen channel separatly? Is there a ring of actin in the dying cell? Also are the membrane protrusion formed more basally?

The experiments mentioned by referee 3 under point 5 would take some testing of conditions and reagents, and while we will give it a try while the two first authors will have the opportunity to return to EMBL for additional experimental work, we can only do this if the experiments with higher priority will work as smoothly and efficiently as we are hoping they will. And we agree with the referee that this is an interesting avenue to pursue, but feel it is not essential to support the validation of the tools we describe or support the other results we present.</p><p>5. The compensatory mechanisms that lead to cell death/extrusion despite depletion of caspb is very interesting. Could the authors use some pan caspase inhibitor (like zvad FMK) to confirm that this block opto-ASC cell death also in this context? Alternatively could they check the status of effector caspase activation using live probe (nucview) or immunostaining in the context of caspb depletion?</p></disp-quote><p>Those would be interesting avenues to pursue. However, for the reason stated above (Leptin lab closing down, members of fish group no longer at EMBL), we are forced to restrict ourselves to the most important experiments, and think we should prioritize the ones mentioned above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
