Exosomes may participate in intercellular communication and have utility as disease biomarkers; however, little is known regarding the physiological stimuli that induce their secretion. Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx promotes exosome secretion, raising the possibility that exosomes are secreted during the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent plasma membrane repair of tissues damaged by mechanical stress in vivo. To determine whether exosomes are secreted upon plasma membrane damage, we developed sensitive assays to measure exosome secretion in intact and permeabilized cells. Our results suggest that exosome secretion is coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent plasma membrane repair. We find that annexin A6 (ANXA6), a well-known plasma membrane repair protein, is recruited to MVBs in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exosome secretion, both in intact and in permeabilized cells. ANXA6 depletion stalls MVBs at the cell periphery, and ANXA6 truncations localize to different membranes, suggesting that ANXA6 may serve to tether MVBs to the plasma membrane. We find that cells secrete exosomes and other EVs upon plasma membrane damage and propose that repair-induced secretion may contribute to the pool of EVs present within biological fluids.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exosome</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane repair</kwd><kwd>annexin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Sergey Brin Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Plasma membrane damage causes the release of exosomes from cultured human cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein secretion is an essential process that prokaryotes and eukaryotes utilize for intercellular communication. In eukaryotic cells, most secretory proteins are exported by the conventional secretory pathway which consists of co-translational signal peptide recognition by the signal recognition particle, polypeptide translocation through the Sec61 translocon, and anterograde transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus via COPII vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park and Rapoport, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shan and Walter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zanetti et al., 2011</xref>). However, eukaryotic cells have also developed alternative secretory processes that bypass the conventional pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malhotra, 2013</xref>). Some well-documented examples include the secretion of leaderless cargoes (proteins that lack a signal peptide), such as interleukin-1β, and the egress of cytoplasmic proteins and RNAs within extracellular vesicles (EVs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O’Brien et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>EVs are membrane-enclosed compartments that are exported to the extracellular milieu of cells in culture and in vivo. Eukaryotic cells secrete EV subpopulations that can be classified broadly into two major categories with distinct biogenesis pathways: microvesicles and exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). Microvesicles form by outward budding from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cocucci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tricarico et al., 2017</xref>). Exosomes are 30–150 nm vesicles formed by inward budding of the limiting membrane of late endosomes to produce multivesicular bodies (MVBs) that contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). Upon fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane, ILVs are released to the extracellular space as exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harding et al., 1983</xref>). Exosomes have potential utility as biomarkers for disease progression because they contain protein and small RNA molecules specific to their cell type of origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Driedonks and Nolte-’t Hoen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Upton et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the physiological circumstances that could elevate exosome secretion. Interestingly, elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> with ionophores has been demonstrated to induce rapid exosome secretion in a Rab27a, Munc13-4-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Messenger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Savina et al., 2003</xref>). These results raise the possibility that exosomes may be secreted as a byproduct of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent plasma membrane repair process that occurs after membrane disruption in vivo. Perforation of the plasma membrane results in an influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the cytoplasm and triggers a repair cascade that includes mobilization and fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews and Corrotte, 2018</xref>). Given the similarity of lysosomes and MVBs, it is plausible to suggest that exosomes are secreted as a byproduct of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent plasma membrane repair. However, some reports have suggested that, unlike lysosomes, MVBs do not undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaiswal et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaiswal et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>To determine if exosomes are secreted during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent plasma membrane repair, we developed an improved nanoluciferase (Nluc) reporter system to quantify exosome secretion that is sensitive, linear, and amenable to high throughput. Using this assay, we established that a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, a pore-forming cytolysin, and physiological mechanical stress all stimulated exosome secretion in an extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner. We showed that annexin A6 (ANXA6), a well-characterized plasma membrane repair protein, is recruited to MVBs in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and demonstrated that ANXA6 is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exosome secretion. We then observed that depletion of ANXA6 stalls MVBs at the periphery of cells treated with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore. Next, we developed a streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized cell reaction that recapitulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and ANXA6-dependent exosome secretion. Finally, we demonstrated that the two annexin domains of ANXA6 become enriched at different membranes upon elevation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Our results demonstrate that exosome secretion is coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent plasma membrane repair and that ANXA6 may serve as a potential tether for the recruitment of MVBs to the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design and validation of an endogenous CD63-Nluc exosome secretion assay</title><p>We sought to develop a cell-based exosome secretion assay that is quantitative, sensitive, amenable to high-throughput, and able to distinguish cell debris and <italic>bona fide</italic> exosomes. A previous study developed a luminescence-based assay to quantify exosome secretion by inserting Nluc into the endogenous locus of the tetraspanin protein CD63 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hikita et al., 2018</xref>). We obtained the HCT116 CD63Nluc-KI #17 cell line (referred to herein as CD63-Nluc cells) from this group and built upon their assay.</p><p>Sequestration of CD63 during ILV biogenesis results in the amino- and carboxyl-termini oriented to the exosome lumen. We leveraged this topology along with the relative membrane permeabilities of the substrate and an inhibitor of Nluc to develop a quantitative cellular assay to monitor the secretion of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Furimazine, the substrate of Nluc, permeates through cellular membranes and enables luminescence from both cellular debris and intact CD63-Nluc exosomes present within the conditioned medium of cultured CD63-Nluc cells. The addition of a membrane-impermeable Nluc inhibitor eliminates luminescence derived from cellular debris where Nluc is readily accessible, while not affecting the luminescence derived from intact CD63-Nluc exosomes incubated with furimazine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Walker et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, solubilization of cellular membranes by the addition of the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (TX-100) exposes all CD63-Nluc to the inhibitor. The addition of the membrane-impermeable Nluc inhibitor depleted a significant portion of luminescence derived from the conditioned medium of CD63-Nluc cells (~30%) and membrane solubilization by TX-100 reduced luminescence to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous CD63-nanoluciferase (Nluc) is a faithful reporter of exosome secretion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the topology of CD63-Nluc in different membranes and the cellular CD63-Nluc secretion assay.

Next, we obtained a partially clarified conditioned medium fraction by differential centrifugation and fractionated the material on a linear iodixanol gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). CD63-Nluc vesicles equilibrated at a density of 1.11 g/ml, a buoyancy similar to published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeppesen et al., 2019</xref>). In a time course over 24 hr, we measured secreted CD63-Nluc luminescence in the presence of Nluc inhibitor alone or with TX-100 and found the signal increased linearly, consistent with exosome secretion over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The luminescence signal in the presence of the Nluc inhibitor and TX-100 remained constant, consistent with cell rupture/detachment during medium change.

A similar process is elicited in cells treated with a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaiswal et al., 2002</xref>). We reasoned that MVBs, like lysosomes, might fuse with the plasma membrane to facilitate membrane repair. Upon treatment with the pore-forming toxin, SLO, exosomes were secreted in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Treatment with 400 ng/ml or 800 ng/ml of SLO significantly increased exosome production, dependent on the presence of extracellular CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1.8 mM). Similar to ionomycin, SLO induced exosome secretion 2 min after initial application and was complete after 10–20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In SLO time course experiments, pore formation was synchronized by pre-incubating cells with SLO on ice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corrotte et al., 2015</xref>). We noted that SLO permeabilized exosomes as well as cells. SLO treatment of conditioned medium decreased the CD63-Nluc signal when the membrane-impermeable Nluc inhibitor was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, our assay likely underestimates SLO-induced exosome secretion. To test whether plasma membrane damage also elicits exosome secretion in a different cell line, we generated a HEK293T reporter cell line that expresses FLAG-Nluc-CD63 under expression of the weak L30 promoter. We observed an increase in FLAG-Nluc-CD63 exosome secretion from this reporter cell line in a SLO dose- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Application of a physiological mechanical stress also induced exosome secretion in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). HCT116 CD63-Nluc cells were pumped slowly through a narrow-gauge needle to simulate a capillary. In the low mechanical stress regime, cells transiently experienced ~89 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> maximum fluid shear stress, whereas in the high-mechanical stress regime, cells transiently experienced ~178 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> maximum fluid shear stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2012</xref>). This form of mechanical stress increased exosome production but only when CaCl<sub>2</sub> was present in the conditioned medium. Endothelium and circulating lymphocytes routinely experience mechanical stress of ~95 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> and transiently experience up to ~3000 dyn/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Next, we used linear iodixanol density gradient fractionation to assess if the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent increase in extracellular CD63 was attributable to exosomes as opposed to the secretion of intact endosomes contained within plasma membrane-derived vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeppesen et al., 2019</xref>). EVs from cells treated with ionomycin for 30 min or vehicle for 24 hr were separated on a high-resolution linear iodixanol gradient. A 30 min ionomycin treatment induced the secretion of low-buoyant density, ANXA2- and FLOT2-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, Fraction #8) compared to the 24 hr vehicle control. ANXA2 is a marker for a subpopulation of plasma membrane-derived EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeppesen et al., 2019</xref>).

Such treatments may mimic conditions of physiologic stress in vivo and lead to wound-induced EV secretion. This may contribute to the diversity of EVs present in biological fluids, including in samples used for liquid biopsy. Plasma membrane repair is common, especially in certain tissues. In rats, 6.5% of cells in the vascular endothelium of the aorta undergo plasma membrane repair at a given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yu and McNeil, 1992</xref>); 20% of muscle cells repair their membrane after muscle contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McNeil and Khakee, 1992</xref>).

It is tempting to speculate that the increase in EV secretion is caused by increased plasma membrane repair. We postulate that exosome secretion during plasma membrane repair may allow for simple detection of tissue-specific damage during the routine clinical analysis of blood or urine samples.</p><p>The biological functions of exosomes released during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated secretion remain unclear. Much attention has focused on the role of exosomes in intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meldolesi, 2018</xref>). A recent study from our laboratory established quantitative assays to measure the functional delivery of exosome cargo to recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang and Schekman, 2023</xref>). Functional transfer of exosome cargo was inefficient, whereas functional intercellular transfer occurred quite effectively through the formation of open-ended membrane tubular connections. However, we do not exclude the possibility that exosomes and other EVs may functionally convey their cargo to recipient cells in specific physiological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ridder et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, a recent study showed that exosomes act as ‘decoys’ for pore-forming toxins such as α-toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Keller et al., 2020</xref>). During staphylococcus infection, cells upregulate exosome production. Instead of binding to the plasma membrane, α-toxin binds to exosomes. Correspondingly, we find that SLO binds exosomes at concentrations that may compete with plasma membrane binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exosome secretion allows for the rapid secretion of high levels of exosomes and may serve as a defense against bacterial toxins that perforate the plasma membrane.</p><p>Although our focus has been on exosome secretion, others have reported plasma membrane-derived vesicle secretion stimulated by plasma membrane disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Horn and Jaiswal, 2018</xref>).

Our data that CD63-positive compartments fuse at the plasma membrane upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is consistent with their findings. However, our results also suggest that endosomes/MVBs can undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis. We conclude this based on the secretion of MVB cargo vesicles (exosomes) upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx elicited by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, a pore-forming toxin, or physiological levels of mechanical stress. Our results also suggest that both free and pre-docked late endosomes/MVBs participate in plasma membrane repair as exosome secretion induced by Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore treatment is partially microtubule-dependent.

The combined data suggest that, in addition to lysosomes, late endosomes/MVBs can undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis.</p><p>Our results are consistent with published studies conducted in sea urchin eggs and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keefe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steinhardt et al., 1994</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent plasma membrane repair of sea urchin eggs after micropuncture with glass micropipettes has been demonstrated to be both fusion- and microtubule-dependent as suggested by sensitivity to either botulinum toxins or antibodies that block kinesin-mediated microtubule transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ingold et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poulain et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiavo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steinhardt et al., 1994</xref>). Endosomes pre-loaded with Alexa-488-conjugated transferrin traffic toward the plasma membrane upon treatment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes with perforin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Keefe et al., 2005</xref>). This result is consistent with our finding that MVBs undergo exocytosis in cells treated with SLO.</p><p>Given our findings, we propose that both MVBs and lysosomes undergo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis during plasma membrane repair, resulting in the concurrent secretion of exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of ANXA6 in exosome secretion</title><p>We find that ANXA6 is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion of MVBs with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Annexin proteins are known to be required for plasma membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blazek et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bouter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boye and Nylandsted, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Croissant et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerke and Moss, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koerdt et al., 2019</xref>). Depletion of ANXA6 compromises plasma membrane repair, and the N-terminal domain of ANXA6 is insufficient for membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croissant et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Potez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Swaggart et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to lysosome exocytosis, plasma membrane repair is accompanied by shedding of damaged membrane at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews and Corrotte, 2018</xref>). Annexins have been invoked in the capping and shedding of plasma membrane lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Demonbreun et al., 2016</xref>). Our results extend these conclusions to the fusion of MVBs at the cell surface.</p><p>Our data favors a model where ANXA6 is directly involved in tethering an MVB to the plasma membrane during exocytosis. ANXA6 is recruited to CD63-positive compartments in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, CD63-positive membrane compartments stall near the plasma membrane in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated, ANXA6-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This conclusion is strengthened by our observation that an anti-ANXA6 antibody blocks exosome secretion in permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Unlike other members of the annexin family, ANXA6 contains two distinct annexin domains, possibly one for each membrane partner of a fusion pair. Upon ionomycin stimulation, we observed that the N-terminal annexin domain, but not the C-terminal annexin domain, was recruited to the plasma membrane and that the C-terminal annexin domain became enriched at intracellular membrane structures, a portion of which were CD63-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). ANXA6 has also been demonstrated to tether liposomes in vitro in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzhynskyy et al., 2009</xref>). Alternative roles in docking, such as SNARE interactions or actin remodeling as seen for other annexins, remain possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerelsaikhan et al., 2012</xref>). Additionally, a recent study has demonstrated that the annexin isoform ANXA11 serves as a molecular tether that allows RNA granules to ‘hitchhike’ on moving lysosomes for their transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Although we focused on the role of ANXA6 in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exosome secretion, ANXA2 and CPNE3 were both recruited to MVBs and lysosomes in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and knockdown of CPNE3 inhibited MVB exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that these proteins could also be involved in the docking of MVBs and lysosomes at the plasma membrane during repair.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been favorably reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Senior Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. You will see from the comments that the reviewers are favorable and they would like to see the story presented in <italic>eLife</italic>. It is not necessary to address all the comments but some are essential, for example: please provide additional data on the kinetics of the process after ionomycin and please include additional compartment-specific markers in the immunofluorescence experiments. We leave it to you to decide which other points you wish to address.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Experimental request:</p><p>Lines 24, 78, 267, 381. The authors report that N- and C-terminal domains of Annexin A6 localize to &quot;different membranes&quot;. Please use organelle/compartment-specific markers to determine the identity of at least some of the structures. Is the different localization due to one domain preferring PS more than the other? Where is the CD63 construct in these cells in relation to the two constructs? What does it look like upon SLO addition?</p><p>Also, it would be useful to the field if the authors could report, from IF data, the fraction of total MVBs that bind annexin A6 before and after ionomycin – this could lead to the search for a molecular distinction explaining why all MVBs are not capable of plasma membrane exocytosis. (For the before ionomycin condition, it may be possible to briefly permeabilize cells with digitonin to leach out cytoplasm to enable detection of any membrane-bound annexin).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Exosome release triggered by ionomycin was characterized as &quot;rapid and robust&quot;, but this cannot be concluded with such long 30 min time points. For example, lysosome exocytosis triggered by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is only linearly sustained for up to 10 min. The very nice permeabilized-cell reconstitution assay indicates that the exosome detection assay is sensitive enough to detect exocytosis in 2 min. This is much more consistent with the time course of PM repair (completed in 1-2 min in most cells) and, importantly, would strengthen the data by reducing concerns with ionomycin cytotoxicity.</p><p>So my suggestion is that the first part of Figure 2 includes a time course of exosome release after ionomycin with several shorter time points. If 30 min is in the linear range the results would be strengthened. If not, the main assays should be repeated. An ionomycin dose-dependent curve would also help to find the lowest effective concentration and reduce concerns about cytotoxicity.</p><p>2) As mentioned in the public review, most studies implicating ANX6 in PM repair were performed using a non-physiological form of PM wounding, using lasers. Lasers, although convenient and thus extensively used in PM repair assays, can cause drastic localized temperature increases with associated membrane protein denaturation, potentially leading to misleading results. So it would be important (and easy) to perform simple PM repair essays (propidium iodide exclusion, for example) in the ANX6-depleted cells used in this study, to confirm that ANX6 is an essential player in PM repair in this system.</p><p>3) The imaging data in Figure 4E is not strong enough to support the conclusion that MVBs are stalled at the periphery, since CD63 is also present in lysosomes. TIRF-based live imaging of exocytosis showing sudden release and diffusion into the supernatant of CD63-containing material (a behavior that should not occur with ANX6), in control but not ANX6-depleted cells, would significantly strengthen the conclusions – and also allow quantification by counting exocytosis events.</p><p>4) The imaging data in Figure 5 is also not convincing, lacking side-by-side comparisons of the same imaging mode and a PM-specific marker. The tilting images shown do not add much information – maybe rotating movies of 3D reconstructions would be more informative. Part C of Figure 5 does show an apparently different localization for each truncated ANX6 construct, but the authors seem to use this as evidence for PM tethering, while none of the individual images suggest a PM localization. Again, a PM marker would be essential here, as some form of quantification.</p><p>5) The levels of exosome release after mechanical wounding seem to be lower than with SLO – although this is hard to assess since results are expressed as an exosome production index. This could be an interesting avenue to explore since it has been suggested that PM lesions caused by pore-forming toxins or by mechanical wounds are repaired by different mechanisms, perhaps involving different organelles. Also, it could be argued that mechanical injury is more important because it occurs more frequently in vivo. Simple assays for propidium iodide or Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (to compare the extent of cell permeabilization) and for lysosomal enzyme release after each form of wounding might add interesting information here.</p><p>6) The Methods section does not provide enough information on several procedures, such as how the knockdowns were performed or how the inhibitory capacity of the anti-ANX6 antibody used in the permeabilized cell assay was validated (the table seems to suggest this was the same as used in westerns, but there is no comment on the 'knockdown validation' mentioned in the text).</p><p>7) It is not clear why the Lamp1 IF (Figure 2 Figure supplement E) was done – the results are just mentioned but not discussed. This same condition (ionomycin) was shown decades ago to trigger massive exocytosis of lysosomes, detected as punctate PM-associated Lamp1. So the peripheral punctate signal seen is likely to include Lamp1 transferred to the PM, and not only a peripheral displacement as mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;Annexin A6 mediates calcium-dependent secretion of exosomes,&quot; Williams et al., report that secretion of endosome-derived exosomes is enhanced by a calcium-dependent response to damage to the plasma membrane of cells. The authors present convincing evidence that in response to the influx of calcium that follows damage to the plasma membrane annexin A6 is recruited to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and likely serves to tether the MVBs to the plasma membrane causing a concomitant release of exosomes.</p><p>1. In the first sentence of the Discussion, the authors specify that their results suggest that exosome secretion is coupled to calcium-dependent plasma membrane repair in HCT116 cells and indeed they present strong evidence that this is the case. Although the authors did use U2-OS cells to investigate the role of annexin A6 domains, it is not clear if this process is restricted to HCT116 cancer cells or a more general phenomenon for both normal and neoplastic cells. This reviewer is not suggesting that every experiment needs to be performed in multiple cell lines but rather that a few key experiments be repeated in at least one other cell line, perhaps normal epithelial cells or fibroblasts. This would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>2. The authors state (sentence 262, page 10) that &quot;…ANXA6(FL) was localized to the plasma membrane and to intracellular vesicles (Figure 6B)&quot; and also note (sentence 268, page 11) that &quot;…ANXA6(C) was observed on intracellular vesicles&quot;. What are these intracellular vesicles? Are they referring to intracellular compartments such as MVBs or are they referring to the intraluminal vesicles inside MVBs that are destined to be released as exosomes? From the model (Figure 7), it is suggested that annexin A6 binds to MVBs so presumably, the implication from Figure 6 is that annexin A6 localizes to MVBs following ionomycin treatment. But that is not demonstrated. It would improve the quality of the data in Figure 6 if cells labeled for both annexin A6 and CD63 (or other MVB marker) were imaged to see the extent of co-association with MVB structures.</p><p>3. Please clarify if annexin A6 itself is present in/on exosomes themselves or is absent from these.</p><p>4. Related to the question above, as annexin A6 can localize to the plasma membrane in ionomycin-treated cells, this would imply that microvesicles that bud off from the plasma membrane may also contain annexin A6. Thus, it is possible that annexin A6-positive microvesicles are released after plasma membrane damage or perturbation of the intracellular calcium level. The authors should comment on this possibility. The authors state that in response to ionomycin treatment, they observe the budding of plasma membrane-derived vesicles. If annexin A6 is present outside the cell, where does it partition after iodixanol density gradient fractionation – with CD63 or with annexin A2 and FLOT2?</p><p>5. Also related to the questions above, the authors use their endogenous CD63-Nluc system to convincingly demonstrate that specifically exosome secretion is enhanced as a consequence of plasma membrane repair but what about other types of extracellular vesicles such as plasma membrane-derived microvesicles? Is the release of microvesicles also enhanced by the plasma membrane repair process?</p><p>6. Although not directly addressed in the Discussion, this reviewer is left with the impression that the authors are hinting that exosome secretion is more a byproduct of plasma membrane repair rather than a means of intercellular communication. In other words, the cell needs the membrane material from the MVB to patch and repair holes in the plasma membrane and exosome ejection from the cell is a secondary (perhaps even irrelevant) consequence. Obviously, these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, the authors are encouraged to speculate about which possibility they favor and how their findings might change our understanding of the cell biology of exosome secretion.</p><p>7. The authors might consider placing their findings in the context of Annexin A11 acting as a tether for the transport of RNA granules (Y-C Liao et al., Cell 179:147-164, 2019).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86556.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Experimental request:</p><p>Lines 24, 78, 267, 381.

Unfortunately, we are unable to conclude the proportion of ANXA6 that is bound to membranes before and after ionomycin treatment due to likely artifacts. In particular, if we were to permeabilize cells with digitonin in medium supplemented with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we believe annexin proteins would most likely be relocalized to membranes. If permeabilization were conducted in medium without Ca<sup>2+</sup>, annexin proteins that were previously bound to membrane would likely be solubilized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Exosome release triggered by ionomycin was characterized as &quot;rapid and robust&quot;, but this cannot be concluded with such long 30 min time points.

We have conducted short time course experiments for both ionomycin and SLO treatment as described in our response to Reviewer #1 (with time points at 1, 2, 5, 10, and 20 or 30 min) and these experimental results are included as the new Figure 2B and 2D.</p><p>For most of our cell assays, we chose to measure exosome concentration at the completion of a reaction where the concentration is no longer time-dependent. Processing many samples makes it technically difficult to consistently measure exosome secretion in the linear range.</p><p>Regarding the reviewer’s concerns about ionomycin toxicity, we conducted all of our experiments in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Ionomycin and other ionophores bind to BSA in FBS, thus the concentration of available ionomycin is likely much lower than the amount was added to the incubation (DOI: 10.1016/B978-0-12-374841-6.00005-0). We hope that this information, in conjunction with both the short ionomycin and SLO time course experiments, allay the reviewer’s concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As mentioned in the public review, most studies implicating ANX6 in PM repair were performed using a non-physiological form of PM wounding, using lasers.

However, it has also been demonstrated that ANXA6 is required for the repair of SLO lesions in cultured cells (DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M110.187625). We added a reference to this publication in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The imaging data in Figure 4E is not strong enough to support the conclusion that MVBs are stalled at the periphery, since CD63 is also present in lysosomes.
