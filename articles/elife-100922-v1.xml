to augmented inflammatory responses and pathogen clearance upon secondary exposure. While the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and reprogramming of bone marrow (BM) progenitors are well-established mechanisms underpinning durable TI protection, remodeling of the cellular architecture within the tissue during TI remains underexplored. Here, we study the effects of peritoneal Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) administration to find TI-mediated protection in the spleen against a subsequent heterologous infection by the Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>.Tm). Utilizing single cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry, we discerned STAT1-regulated genes in TI-associated resident and recruited splenic myeloid populations. The temporal dynamics of TI were further elucidated, revealing both early and delayed myeloid subsets with time-dependent, cell-type-specific STAT1 signatures. Using lineage tracing, we find that tissue-resident red pulp macrophages (RPM), initially depleted by BCG exposure, are restored from both tissue-trained, self-renewing macrophages and from bone marrow-derived progenitors, fostering long lasting local defense. Early inhibition of STAT1 activation, using specific JAK-STAT inhibitors, reduces both RPM loss and recruitment of trained monocytes. Our study suggests a temporal window soon after BCG vaccination, in which STAT1-dependent activation of long-lived resident cells in the tissue mediates localized protection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BCG</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1289/22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Avraham</surname><given-names>Roi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001658</institution-id><institution>Minerva Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Avraham</surname><given-names>Roi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo perturbations and single-cell RNA-seq reveal cell-type-specific STAT1-IFNg signaling in regulation of trained immunity in tissue-resident immune cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Trained immunity (TI) is defined as the capacity of innate immune cells to recall and modulate their subsequent responsiveness following prior exposure to a diverse array of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arts et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike the adaptive immune system, these changes are antigen-agnostic and are more reflective of sustained alterations in cellular and systemic states. TI has been demonstrated to directly reprogram the metabolic, transcriptional, and epigenetic state of monocytes and macrophages, generating heightened inflammatory capabilities in-vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saeed et al., 2014</xref>). As the transient lifespans of these cells are weeks only, this alone is insufficient to explain the sustained protection generated by TI that can last from months to years. To address this limitation, current research has been focused on long-lived multipotent progenitor immune cells.</p><p>BCG vaccine (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin), an attenuated strain of <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic>, is a potent inducer of TI, which facilitate nonspecific protection against heterologous pathogens in mice, primates, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Darrah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moorlag et al., 2019</xref>). The effects of intravenous (i.v.) BCG vaccination, where bacilli persist within the bone marrow (BM), drive the expansion of LSK +hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moorlag et al., 2019</xref>). In conjunction, MPPs undergo biased differentiation towards myelopoiesis, increasing the proliferation of myeloid cells. These effects are driven primarily by interferon activation, particularly that of interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and its downstream transcription factors, STAT1 and IRF1, in MPPs and short-term HSCs, resulting in a transcriptional program of cell cycling (Cdk1, Cdk4, Ccnf) and histone modifications. Furthermore, these newly differentiated circulating cells have enhanced microbicidal properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hasso-Agopsowicz et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qadri et al., 2024</xref>). Upon infection, in order to elicit protection against invading agents, trained progenitor immune cells from the BM interact within local immune cell compartments in the tissue. Understanding these mechanisms is particularly relevant given emerging challenges in infectious disease control. The rise of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria demand the development of attenuated strains-specific vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hasso-Agopsowicz et al., 2024</xref>), such as the typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV) for the gram negative <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qadri et al., 2024</xref>). The premise of BCG and trained immunity is providing global heterologous protection against a range of pathogens. However, the broader potential of TI-mediated heterologous protection requires understanding of TI-mediated protection as it translates within the tissue and the local cellular architectures is not completely understood.</p><p>Most tissues harbor long-lived resident macrophages capable of self-renewal, independent of BM-derived precursors. These resident populations, including pulmonary alveolar macrophages, Kupffer cells in the liver and red pulp macrophages in the spleen, originate from embryonic erythro-myeloid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kurotaki et al., 2015</xref>). Antimicrobial activity of resident populations control early stages of invasion by pathogens but are than depleted, and the niche is repopulated either by self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoeffel et al., 2015</xref>) or by progenitors derived from the BM to maintain local functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lai et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, resident alveolar macrophages (AM) have been shown to undergo in-situ training, maintaining an altered phenotype over an extended period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barth et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keren-Shaul et al., 2019</xref>). One mechanism driving this training in-situ in AMs involves CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> T cells, which have been implicated in local reprogramming via IFNγ release. This process has been demonstrated to occur around three weeks after initial BCG vaccination, after which interferon-driven responses occur across the organism, including lung and BM, resulting in viral and mycobacterial protection. It remains unclear however, how during TI, a bridge is formed between peripheral, resident cells and BM-derived recruitment of trained myeloid cells.</p><p>In this study, we set out to investigate the interplay of circulating and tissue-level immune cells that mediate protection and remodeling during TI. To induce tissue specific TI, we used a model of intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of BCG, which rapidly delivers the bacteria to target lymphatic organs (<italic>e.g.,</italic> spleen), and measured protection against subsequent <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (<italic>S</italic>.Tm) challenge. Within the spleen’s unique structure and cellular composition, we characterized STAT1-mediated, cell type-specific TI signatures. We demonstrate that an initial depletion of resident red-pulp macrophages is followed by repopulation by recruited trained monocytes and a local self-renewing population, contributing to the maintenance of STAT1 signatures and long-lasting protection within the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Intraperitoneal BCG results in heterologous <italic>S</italic>.Tm protection and a distinct myeloid subsets with signatures driven by STAT1</title><p>To establish an in-vivo BCG training model targeted to the splenic tissue, and assess the extent of cross pathogen tissue protection conferred, we administered BCG-Pasteur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) (5×10<sup>6</sup> colony forming units (CFU)) or PBS as a control via i.p injection to 8-week-old female C57BL/6 J mice.

We observed an overall expansion of the myeloid compartment due to training, with an increase in the CD11b<sup>+</sup> subset, and a pronounced reduction of resident RPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This observed loss of RPM is common during infection and inflammation and has been previously described as the resident macrophage disappearance reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barth et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>We next determined transcriptional alterations caused by TI across the myeloid compartment. CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells from trained and naïve mice were isolated by sorting and processed for single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keren-Shaul et al., 2019</xref>). K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) clustering differentiated six distinct cell types, designated as CM, NCM, immature DC2 (cDC2), mature DC2 (mcDC2), neutrophils, and NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The identity of each cell type cluster was based on established transcriptional markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Additional analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) unique to training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). While most populations derived from control or trained mice clustered together by cell type, we identified a subset of trained CM (CM-T) particular to BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This subset represents an enhanced state of the STAT1-regulated IFNγ response that characterizes trained CM (e.g. <italic>Gbp2, Ly6a, Cxcl9</italic>, and <italic>Irg1</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Notably, these STAT1 activated genes are known to drive maturation and activation of monocytes and macrophages, enhancing their antimicrobial response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu and Ivashkiv, 2009</xref>).</p><p><italic>Stat1</italic> and its downstream targets (e.g. <italic>Gbp2</italic>, <italic>Irf1,</italic> and <italic>Ly6a</italic>), exhibited a pronounced elevation also in other myeloid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), aligning with an earlier report that BCG induces BM and HSC remodeling via interferon signaling, resulting in STAT1 upregulation in progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). However, not all populations were similarly activated in conjunction with STAT1-regulated genes, with gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrating differential pathway upregulation across cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). CM and mcDC2 primarily activated the IFNγ response, while complement associated genes were enriched in mcDC2. NK cells alone showed minimal activation due to training across all detected pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>We also observed increased SCA-1 (<italic>Ly6a/e</italic>) expression across the monocyte subsets and mcDC2, most notably in NCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). SCA-1 (stem cell antigen-1) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface protein commonly used as a marker for murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells within the BM. The STAT1 signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in the regulation of SCA-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting a role for STAT1 in the modulation of SCA-1 during development of TI. Recent studies have also demonstrated a link between SCA-1 and inflammation, with its expression found to be upregulated on a specific subset of Ly6C<sup>+</sup> monocytes during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biram et al., 2022</xref>). These SCA-1<sup>+</sup> monocytes exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and were implicated in the amplification of these responses. For Ly6C<sup>-</sup> NCM, the role of SCA-1 has not yet been studied.</p><p>In addition to the upregulation of inflammatory and antimicrobial genes, we also observed a significant downregulation of specific genes in CM-T as a result of training, including <italic>Ccr2</italic>, <italic>S100A8/9,</italic> and <italic>Ngp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). CCR2, a chemokine receptor crucial for monocyte recruitment, was found to be downregulated in response to IFNγ. This reduction in CCR2 expression is mediated by IFNγ-induced mRNA instability, potentially serving to retain monocytes at the site of recruitment and dampen a positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Penton-Rol et al., 1998</xref>). Similarly, BCG has been shown in other contexts to reduce the expression of S100A8 and S100A9, two calcium-binding proteins that can heterodimerize and stimulate IFNγ production in CD4 +T cells via an IL-10dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). By suppressing their activity, runaway signaling and exhaustion is avoided. Lastly, NGP (neutrophilic granule protein), has been implicated in the regulation of inflammation through its ability to block NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). The downregulation of these genes suggests that trained immunity not only enhances pro-inflammatory responses but also modulates the expression of key regulators to maintain a balanced immune response and prevent excessive inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dynamics of TI-associated subsets and signatures indicates early and delayed kinetics</title><p>To gain insight into dynamic processes underlying splenic cell type-specific TI, we conducted a two-month experiment, sacrificing mice at days 3, 14, 30, 45, and 60 post-vaccination with BCG, and challenging with S.Tm at 14 and 60 days post training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We assessed BCG growth in BM and spleen, resistance to <italic>S</italic>.Tm infection, flow cytometry analysis with cell-type-specific training markers (CXCL9 and SCA-1), and bulk RNA-seq.

Compared to mean control values, we observed rapid recruitment of CMs in the spleen, starting already at day three after BCG, peaking at day 14 before returning to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also stained cells for CXCL9 expression, as a marker gene of STAT1-mediated TI that defines the CM-T subset, and revealed that this population reaches peak levels at day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In a separate experiment to assess early kinetics of CM-Ts, we measured a significant increase of this subset already at five days post BCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), indicating an early recruitment of these cells due to the initial response to BCG. NCMs exhibit a different TI signature and kinetic pattern. While their ratio initially declines, they return to steady-state levels by day 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). NCMs express SCA-1 (<italic>Ly6a</italic>), another STAT1-regulated gene, which persists and remains highly elevated at all subsequent time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Challenge with S.Tm at day 14 triggered an expansion of CM-Ts, but this response was lost by day 60, coinciding with the diminished protection observed at this later timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, SCA-1 expression in NCMs remained upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the expression of STAT1-mediated TI markers is not solely restricted to BM-derived myeloid cells but also occurs in tissue-resident RPM. RPM loss is evident after 14 days of training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), together with increased expression of the STAT1-regulated CXCL9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). SCA-1<sup>+</sup> RPM levels fluctuate, elevating at day 14 and increasing again at day 60. Given their pivotal role in curbing the early replication of intracellular pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffman et al., 2021</xref>), such as <italic>S</italic>.Tm, and their long life span, as opposed to CM and NCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yona et al., 2013</xref>), trained RPM could be an additional determinant in generating long-lasting, localized tissue protection.</p><p>From the splenocytes collected during the kinetics experiment, we generated and analyzed bulk RNA-seq data. Principal component analysis (PCA) displayed a substantial shift along PC1 due to BCG training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Examination of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between BCG and PBS across these time points revealed the greatest transcriptional changes at day 14 and 30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the biological processes represented at these time points, GSEA was performed. At day 14, we detected enrichment for IFNγ response, IFNα response, and IL6-JAK-STAT signaling, with many genes shared across these pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This STAT1-dependent program includes several interferon-regulated genes upregulated at day 14, including the <italic>Gbp</italic> gene family, <italic>Ifitm3</italic>, and <italic>Socs3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). GBPs are guanylate-binding proteins involved in antimicrobial activity and inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tretina et al., 2019</xref>), while IFITM3 is an interferon-induced transmembrane protein that plays a role in the antiviral response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clement et al., 2022</xref>). SOCS3, a suppressor of cytokine signaling, particularly via IL-6/STAT3, is a necessary component for mycobacterial infection control. By blocking IL-6 signaling, SOCS3 allows for TNF and IL-12 signaling to occur, initiating CD4-dependent IFNγ release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carow et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Within the IFNγ response pathway, we noted that associated genes display distinct temporal expression patterns. For example, <italic>Irg1</italic> upregulation is limited to day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>) returning to control values for all subsequent time points. This may reflect that IRG1 induction requires bacterial phagocytosis and activation of the TLR-2/MYD88/NFKB axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bomfim et al., 2022</xref>). Conversely, an increase in <italic>Cxcl9</italic> expression is already observed by day 3, plateauing at day 14, and decreasing by day 30, mirroring its induction in CM-Ts in the flow cytometry analysis. Curiously, despite its loss in CM-Ts, the bulk transcriptional expression of <italic>Cxcl9</italic> is still sustained after 2 weeks, although at reduced levels. This may be attributed to its activity in other immune cells or regulatory mechanisms preventing further translation. Importantly, the IFNγ response mirrored STAT1 activity, showing initial reduction after 2 weeks followed by sustained upregulation for all subsequent time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), reinforcing their coupled role in mediating the effects of TI. Other downstream targets of STAT1, including <italic>Ly6a</italic> (SCA-1), maintain high expression 2 months post vaccination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Distinct from these immune signatures, day 30 was characterized by enrichment of E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, and heme metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Interestingly, RPM play a crucial role in iron homeostasis, recycling and storing iron from senescent erythrocytes, preventing accumulation of free iron that can lead to ROS production, oxidative damage, and pathogen utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vogt et al., 2021</xref>). Given the dynamics of RPM loss by day 14, it is tempting to speculate that their subsequent repopulation is reflected by these processes.</p><p>We then investigated whether TI signatures could be maintained through progenitor programming alone. BCG or PBS were injected i.p into mice with either a CD45.1 or CD45.2 background, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). After 2 weeks, BM was harvested from both, HSCs mixed 1:1, and injected into irradiated mice for BM transplant. Six weeks post transfer, mice were sacrificed and myeloid cells in the spleen were assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Within each mouse, we found in the spleen a greater fraction of NCMs expressed SCA-1 from trained donors relative to the naive control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1J</xref>). This persistence of the training signature in a naive host environment demonstrates that SCA-1 expression in NCMs can be maintained through progenitor programming alone, though it does not exclude potential contributions of local tissue signals during normal BCG training. CM-Ts however, were undetectable, consistent with the transient nature of this subset observed in our kinetics data.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RPM niche is replenished by recruited trained monocytes and by local training of tissue-resident populations</title><p>We observed a substantial reduction in RPM numbers upon BCG, followed by the expression of STAT1-mediated TI markers in RPMs. We hypothesized that upon BCG, two possible scenarios for training and replenishment of open niche are possible. The first is self-renewal by the remaining local tissue-resident macrophages who are trained within the tissue, while the other is that BM-derived trained monocytes differentiate and repopulate the open niche. While BM-derived macrophages may adopt signatures and function of their local counterparts, they may also retain aspects of their origin, particularly enhanced inflammatory capacities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To investigate this, we employed MS4A3<sup>Tdtm</sup>;CX3CR1<sup>GFP</sup> reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) with a knock-in flox-cre system to selectively label BM-derived monocytes with TdTomato fluorescence. As MS4A3 is distinctly expressed in granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMP), only this lineage will be TdTomato positive. These mice were administered BCG or PBS-i.p following the training protocol and sacrificed two weeks later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Effective labeling was determined by flow cytometry, measuring the fraction of MP expressing TdTomato and/or CX3CR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, the monocyte population were primarily double positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Intriguingly, training increased the percentage of labeled cells across monocytes, suggesting a potential lineage bias towards granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs). This observation is consistent with prior studies demonstrating that various microbial components can induce short-term differentiation biases in monocytes derived from GMPs or MDPs (monocyte-dendritic progenitors), endowing them with neutrophil- or dendritic cell-like properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yáñez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>RPM niche is replenished by recruited trained monocytes and by local training of tissue-resident populations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme representing known myeloid differentiation pathways and potential trans-differentiation of trained CM to RPM.

These sorted cell populations were then subjected to bulk RNA-seq and subsequent analysis. Crucially, training associated genes were differentially expressed across all sorted cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). When evaluating specific DEGs upregulated across trained RPM, we identified five gene clusters that varied between CM, NCM, and RPM, as well as genes primarily upregulated in Tdtm<sup>+</sup> or Tdtm<sup>-</sup> RPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Cluster I is composed of MHCII-associated genes (<italic>H2-Aa</italic>, <italic>H2-Eb1</italic>, CD72, etc.), and is enriched in NCM and RPM cells, indicating enhanced antigen presentation that may facilitate the activation of humoral immunity. Cluster II consists of the STAT-1 regulated TI hallmark genes, including <italic>Cxcl9</italic>, <italic>Gbp2</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic> and is upregulated in all trained subsets. Genes in Cluster III, such as <italic>Aif1</italic>, <italic>Fpr1</italic>, and <italic>Hk3</italic>, are primarily observed in trained RPM and are involved in response to tissue damage/disruption and immune infiltration. AIF1 is an established marker of macrophage activation and is functionally involved in phagocytosis and membrane ruffling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">De Leon-Oliva et al., 2023</xref>). Similarly, FPR1, a formyl peptide receptor, induces chemotaxis, phagocytic uptake, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prevete et al., 2015</xref>). Cluster IV is upregulated in BCG Tdtm<sup>-</sup> RPM, though the role of most genes detected in this cluster remains unknown in regard to their tissue-specific function and activation. Interestingly, <italic>CD8A</italic> expression, typically relegated to lymphocytes, was observed in this cluster. In monocytes, CD8A can co-engage with FcR, resulting in TNF release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibbings et al., 2007</xref>). Lastly, cluster V, which is primarily activated in CM regardless of training, was also upregulated in RPM due to BCG. Three of the genes within the cluster, <italic>Anxa1</italic>, <italic>Vim</italic>, and <italic>Wfdc17</italic>, have all been shown to dampen excess inflammatory responses through various mechanisms, including suppressing oxidative stress and promoting local resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugimoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Håversen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karlstetter et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>GSEA performed across all upregulated genes revealed that the IFNγ response was enriched, followed by IFNα response, allograft rejection, and JAK-STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Although the IFNγ signature was most prominent in CM, it was also observed in NCM and in the Tdtm<sup>+</sup> RPM. This finding suggests that engrafted monocytes differentiating within the niche may maintain a more inflammatory phenotype and a heightened sensitivity to IFNγ activation. However, the BM-derived RPM are not the sole population responsive to training, as the local fraction also upregulates the same genes in clusters I-III. Notably, RPM, as a whole, demonstrate a greater capacity to upregulate the expression of many interferon genes, including <italic>Cxcl9</italic> and <italic>Stat1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Taken together, our results indicate that BCG can reprogram populations and generate training via two separate routes. First, the recruitment of trained progenitors and monocytes within the spleen, which differentiate within a vacant niche, retaining their trained identity. Second, activation directly within the spleen in the context of native tissue-resident RPM, generating tissue-specific protection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transient IFNγ-STAT1 inhibition prevents TI signatures and splenic infection resistance</title><p>We observed that STAT1 signaling holds a critical role in training, with its regulated gene expression elevated across the myeloid population. However, BCG is an intact attenuated bacterium that can activate numerous PRRs. To evaluate whether STAT1 is necessary for TI signatures and protection, we vaccinated STAT1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kernbauer et al., 2012</xref>) with either PBS or BCG-i.p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We observed a complete absence of expression for both CXCL9 and SCA-1 across myeloid populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This aligns with previous findings that demonstrated compromised acquisition of trained immunity in IFNγR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, RPM, typically depleted following BCG inoculation, remain preserved in STAT1-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that STAT1-mediated pathways are involved in triggering the cellular death processes that occur during BCG interaction and/or engulfment.</p><p>There is however a significant limitation in this mouse model, as STAT1<sup>-/-</sup> leave mice highly susceptible to infection due to a severe compromise of immune homeostasis, limiting our ability to assess TI-mediated protection upon <italic>S</italic>.Tm challenge. In light of our findings that STAT1 signaling is activated shortly after BCG administration, we sought to transiently restrict STAT1 activity at these early time points, also enabling us to investigate the effect of inhibition of STAT1 signaling on training and protection, without affecting STAT1 activation during a secondary <italic>S</italic>.Tm challenge. To accomplish this, we used Fedratinib, a specific inhibitor of JAK2 activation of STAT1 through IFNγ signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Håversen et al., 2018</xref>), and Deucravacitinib, a specific inhibitor of TYK2 activation of STAT1/STAT2 through IFNα/β signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lé et al., 2022</xref>). First, we administered DMSO (control), Deucravacitinib, and Fedratinib i.p followed by BCG or PBS-i.p 4 hr after. These inhibitors were then injected daily via i.p for the following 4 days, followed by a subsequent 9-day rest period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). At the 2-week mark, splenocytes were extracted from all mice and analyzed by bulk RNA-seq.

At the 2-week mark, splenocytes were extracted from all mice for flow cytometry analysis, with CXCL9 utilized as a marker for STAT1-mediated TI signature in CM-Ts. As observed in the transcriptional response, only Fedratinib ablated the CXCL9<sup>+</sup> CM-Ts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We also sought to determine if these effects were localized solely to the tissue, or if they extended to progenitors in the BM, which expand upon BCG exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>). To ascertain this, we isolated BM from the femur, measuring the percent of LSK<sup>+</sup> HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Here too, only Fedratinib resulted in suppressing their expansion to levels comparable to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Conversely, perturbation of IFNα/β signaling with Deucravacitinib lead to no observable changes on trained subsets, suggesting that it is not involved in our BCG-i.p model. Type-I interferon has been established as a training signaling pathway in other contexts, as observed with β-glucan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalafati et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huijser et al., 2022</xref>) and LPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zahalka et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In order to prove that early STAT1 inhibition is sufficient to block the TI protective phenotype, and not just downstream markers, we repeated the inhibitor regime with control or trained mice receiving either Fedratinib or DMSO, with or without <italic>S</italic>.Tm infection after 2 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

PCA of the resulting data revealed two major axes of divergence among the populations: PC1, associated with training, and PC2, associated with the response to <italic>S</italic>.Tm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1J</xref>). While the PBS-i.p mice treated with either DMSO or Fedratinib were grouped together, the BCG-i.p samples treated with Fedratinib clustered distinctly, shifting closer to the PBS control group. Analysis of downregulated DEGs identified the IFNγ response as the most significantly affected pathway due to JAK2 inhibition by Fedratinib. This included its downstream effector <italic>Stat1</italic>, and other key STAT1-regulated trained immunity genes, such as <italic>Cxcl9/10</italic>, <italic>Irf1</italic>, <italic>Gbp2</italic>, and <italic>Irg1</italic>, across all treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). To further validate our findings and ensure that the loss of the trained immunity signature was not solely a result of blocking other JAK2-associated pathways, we repeated the inhibitor experiment using recombinant α-IFNγ. Mice were given either α-IFNγ or an isotype control after BCG or PBS vaccination, with injections on days 0, 2, and 4, and assayed 2 weeks post-vaccination. Upon sorting and sequencing CM and RPM from these treated mice, we found that the STAT1 regulated TI signatures were completely ablated with early inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K–L</xref>). Although we measured no changes in viable BCG in cultured spleen homogenates from control and treated mice at the 2-week interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1M</xref>), early α-IFNγ was sufficient in blocking training signatures. Interestingly, previous studies show that while removal of BCG by long-term antibiotic treatment decreases expansion of progenitor cells, protection against secondary ex vivo challenges remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the impact of Fedratinib and α-IFNy treatment on the TI phenotype further underscores the pivotal role of IFNγ and the JAK2-STAT1 axis in orchestrating the early programs and signatures required for long-term local and recruited myeloid populations within the tissue. When compromised, remodeling is suppressed and so too protection. Crucially, even though its administration was early and removed after only 5 days administration, inhibition occurred. This indicates that the acquisition of TI in the tissue occurs within a critically narrow temporal window.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>TI, or innate immune memory, embodies the capacity of innate immune cells to remember past encounters and modify their subsequent responses, triggered by diverse conditions and stimuli. In- vivo these processes are sustained in progenitor cells within the BM to provide long term TI, with differentiated cells inheriting this memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moorlag et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we set out to demonstrate how long-term protection events in the BM affords training within the tissue through local interactions with resident populations. We demonstrated how the immune effects of BCG vaccination are differentially imparted across recruited trained monocytes from the BM and diverse MP populations within the spleen, the temporal dynamics governing these processes, and the mechanisms necessary for them to be sustained long-term.</p><p>We verified that BCG-i.p inoculation stimulates an expansion of myeloid MP, notably a subset of classical monocytes marked by CXCL9 expression (CM-T) within the spleen. This CM-T population, which peaks at day 14 before declining, exemplifies the broader training response we observed, as our dissection of single-cell training signatures uncovered a fundamental program dominated by IFNγ response and STAT1 regulated genes across diverse populations. Among these, GBP2, CXCL9, and IRG1 represent some of the pathways involved in the protective response: GBP2, a member of the GTPase family, drives macrophages toward an inflammatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2023</xref>) while combating bacterial infection through vacuole disruption and pyroptosis induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meunier et al., 2014</xref>). CXCL9 orchestrates immune cell recruitment and activation at infection sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Groom and Luster, 2011</xref>), supporting trained immunity by establishing a pro-inflammatory environment conducive to pathogen clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joosten et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, IRG1 produces the metabolite itaconate, which serves dual functions in both directly inhibiting pathogen growth and modulating immune responses to prevent excessive inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampropoulou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michelucci et al., 2013</xref>). However, IRG1’s role in training appears context-specific, as exposure to training stimuli like β-glucan can actually block its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Domínguez-Andrés et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>By monitoring the kinetics of training over an extended duration, we observed that the initial surge in CM recruitment is confined to the first two weeks of training, potentially signaling inflammatory recruitment triggered by BCG exposure and RPM loss. Concurrently, the presence of CM-Ts starts to diminish at a similar rate and is eventually lost, suggesting that these cells may be differentiated to trained MPs in the tissue.</p><p>The depletion of RPMs at 14 days post-vaccination sets in motion a series of complex cellular responses. Notably, we observed an enrichment of heme metabolism at day 30, which may indicate an ongoing process of RPM replenishment. This process typically involves two key mechanisms: the local expansion and repopulation by native populations, and the recruitment of erythroid and myeloid progenitors, including classical and non-classical monocytes, to the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2018</xref>). These recruited cells, particularly monocytes, can differentiate within the niche, transitioning through a pre-RPM state via heme-mediated pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haldar et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, heme metabolism has also been implicated in the control and pathogenicity of mycobacterial species, particularly <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MtB). During systemic infection, MtB activates type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, which, along with its own virulence factors, disrupts iron transport and uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The presence of TI markers not only in BM-derived myeloid cells such as CM and NCM, but also in RPM, prompted us to uncover how these cells acquired this phenotype. Utilizing Ms4a3<sup>TdTm</sup> labeled mice, we investigated whether trained RPM were being derived from cells originating in the BM. Unlike CM and NCM, which are predominantly TdTm<sup>+</sup>, RPM express this lineage tracing marker at steady state around 16%, which was further increased with training. Probing the transcriptional profile of these cells also revealed differences due to origin, with Tdtm<sup>+</sup> RPM demonstrating a heightened response to IFNγ stimulation and elevated expression of STAT1. However, both populations exhibit significant upregulation of TI-associated genes post-vaccination. These findings indicate that TI in RPM is not solely due to BM-derived precursors filling a depleted niche but suggests a capacity for both resident and BM-derived RPM to undergo training within the tissue itself. Considering the importance of these cells in restricting early infection events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffman et al., 2021</xref>), their capacity for training reveals an additional factor contributing to the TI phenotype. While our examination was limited to a singular tissue-resident macrophage subset, other splenic macrophages like marginal zone macrophages (MZMs) and marginal metallophilic macrophages (MMMs), known to have immunological roles, may similarly exhibit a capacity for being trained. This research can be further broadened to include other resident myeloid populations, to explore how BCG can bestow localized protection independent of central HSC reprogramming.</p><p>When investigating the longevity of the trained transcriptional response within the spleen, we noted that Stat-1 and other interferon response genes remained upregulated even 2 months after vaccination. We found one such gene SCA-1 (<italic>Ly6a</italic>), was continuously expressed in NCM due to training, and was still identifiable after a BM transplant. Although SCA-1 is traditionally a marker for upstream progenitors, recent studies link its expression to inflammation, with upregulation noted in B/T cells during <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akter et al., 2022</xref>). Further exploration is warranted to investigate the mechanisms that enable such enduring expression, particularly in this cell type. Also, while <italic>Ly6a</italic> (SCA-1) is unique to mice, a recent study identified a human equivalent termed <italic>Ly6s</italic>, primarily expressed in splenic NCM and regulated by interferon signaling, that was linked to an inflammatory cell phenotype with resistance to viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shmerling et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Prior publications have demonstrated the importance of BCG localization in generating local vs. systemic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaufmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vierboom et al., 2021</xref>), and that BCG’s initial presence within the BM is associated with HSC reprogramming and long-term TI. Despite this, while we were able to isolate BCG from splenic tissue, not BM, from all sampled time points, we could still achieve training and protection, including LSK<sup>+</sup> subset expansion in the BM. This leads us to hypothesize that the signaling initiated due to BCG can act in trans, affecting system wide changes, and is not solely acquired due to local pathogen interactions in the BM. Supporting this, recent findings suggest that training in alveolar macrophages can also occur through subcutaneous BCG administration, potentially acting via the gut-lung axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jeyanathan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Finally, given STAT1’s ubiquity among all trained cells, we hypothesized that this transcription factor and its upstream activation via interferon signaling were instrumental in driving BCG-induced trained immunity. We observed that early transient inhibition, specifically targeting IFNγ-mediated STAT1 activation, effectively negated the hallmarks of trained immunity. These include myeloid recruitment, disappearance of RPM, the expression of training markers, LSK<sup>+</sup> expansion, transcriptional alterations, and, crucially, heterologous <italic>S</italic>. Tm protection - highlighting STAT1’s particular role in orchestrating a protective response against this pathogen. Furthermore, while it is generally known that BCG can reside within the tissue for weeks after inoculation, our findings suggest that even brief STAT1 and IFNγ inhibition is sufficient to disrupt the development of trained immunity, regardless of the pathogen’s presence. It is plausible that during the initial stages of BCG exposure and inflammation, IFNγ-secreting cells such as T/NKTs initiate the immunological remodeling needed for training. Should these processes be obstructed at this critical juncture, the opportunity for subsequent training is lost. While our inhibitor protocol was applied for a period of 5 days, the minimal duration required for effective inhibition and comparable outcomes may be even shorter.</p><p>In summary, our study emphasizes that examining the tissue, specifically the spleen, as a tissue for probing TI offers valuable insights into the temporal dynamics and signaling cascades that instigate and sustain TI locally, in parallel with established systemic effects. Central to these processes is the IFNγ-STAT1 pathway, which we identified as a key driver in establishing TI, by replenishment of resident naïve MPs with trained recruited and local immune populations. We further delineated that during intraperitoneal vaccination the resultant immune interactions limit BCG dissemination, while still effectively eliciting training. Our findings open new avenues to harness STAT1 pathway induction for optimized training and the importance of vaccines that can induce robust cross-domain protection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Mice and bacteria strains</title><p>C57BL/6 J mice, 7–9 weeks old, were purchased from ENVIGO, housed at the Weizmann Institute pathogen-free facility, and provided with standard food and water ad libitum.

Mice were given 6 weeks to allow for reconstitution and repopulation of the hematopoietic system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-12"><title>Flow cytometry, CFU, and spleen size analysis and quantification</title><p>Flow cytometry data was analyzed using the FlowJo software.</p><p>For size quantification, spleens were imaged against a contrasting background, and two-dimensional area was calculated using the ImageJ software.</p><p>All graphs quantifying the results from flow cytometry and CFU results were performed using R on RStudio with the Tidyverse package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>scRNA-seq data analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1-1"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>MARS-seq pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keren-Shaul et al., 2019</xref>) was used for demultiplexing, alignment to the genome (mm9), and gene counting by unique molecular identifier (UMI). Overall, we sequenced 1536 cells (768 from control mouse and 768 from trained mouse), with 1474 median UMI count per cell and 668 median genes per cell.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-2"><title>Data normalization and gene filtration</title><p>Only genes with at least one UMI count detected in at least one cell were used. Data was normalized to a library size factor. Factors were calculated by dividing total UMI counts in each cell to the median of the total UMI counts across all cells. Data was transformed to log10 scale (log10(UMI count +1)). Cells with less than 200 UMIs were excluded due to low coverage (24 cells, 9 from naive mouse and 15 from trained mouse). We filtered out cell cycle and ribosomal genes and selected the top 425 most variable genes for further analysis. Variable genes were selected based on fitting of the data to a simple noise model based on the genes mean expression and dispersion (coefficient of variance).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-3"><title>Data clustering and annotations</title><p>Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the variable genes, and the first 40 PCs were used for downstream analysis for k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-graph, based on Euclidian distance in PC space.

Cluster identity was inferred using cluster-specific and manually selected genes based on cell classification literature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-4"><title>Bulk RNA-seq data processing and normalization</title><p>MARS-seq pipeline was used for samples demultiplexing, alignment to the genome (mm9), and gene counting.

Replicate samples of each condition were averaged, except for 1 sample that was excluded due to low coverage (&lt;100 k reads; BCG 30d replicate 3). Preceding PCA analysis genes were centered and normalized to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. To identify genes that were up-regulated due to training, we calculated the differences between the integrals of each gene in BCG relative to PBS along time. The differences across all genes were approximately normally distributed, with a mean of 0.2 and a standard deviation of 10.11. Genes with more than 3 standard deviations above the mean were defined as up-regulated due to training.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-1-6"><title>Bulk inhibitor data</title><p>Data was transformed to log2 scale, and minimal expression threshold was set to 3.

They define the kinetics of shifts in myeloid populations within the spleen and the transcriptional response associated with IP BCG exposure. In lineage tracing experiments, they demonstrate that tissue-resident macrophages, red-pulp macrophages (RPM) that are rapidly depleted after BCG exposure, are replenished from recruited monocytes and expansion of tissue-resident cells; they use transcriptional profiling to characterize those cells. In contrast to previous descriptions of BCG-driven immune training, they do not find BCG in the bone marrow in their model, suggesting that there is not direct training of myeloid precursor populations in the bone marrow. They then link the observed trained immunity phenotype (restriction of heterologous infection with ST) with early activation of STAT1 through IFN-γ.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The work includes careful detaining of shifts and origins of myeloid populations within tissue associated with trained immunity and is a meaningful advance for the field.</p><p>Caveats:</p><p>Given that the authors demonstrate that BCG persists in the spleen, it is possible that some level of BCG persistence in the spleen is a necessary contributor (together with signaling through STAT1) to the observed tissue-specific T1 phenotype.</p><p>Whether ongoing signaling through the axes are required for ongoing protection is not specifically addressed in this work.

The experiment suggested by the reviewer is to treat with abx to remove BCG from the tissue from the first week post challenge for the duration of four weeks. In previous work, Kaufmann et al (PMID: 29328912) showed that after a month of antibiotics, BCG levels are reduced, but residual BCG levels still remains. Accroding to their results, while antibiotic treatment reduces the training phenotype of LKS<sup>+</sup> HSC expansion in the bone marrow, protection against TB was maintained during ex-vivo challenge of BMDMs.</p><p>In our experiments, we are concerned that antibiotic treatment will only change the dynamics of BCG clearance, but residual BCG will remain and will limit our interpretation. Furthermore, examining the transcriptional changes we observed at early timeponts after BCG may not be relavant at 1 month post antibiotics.</p><p>As an alternative approach, we refer to our results with an antibody to block early IFNg signaling (1-5 days; Figure S4 K-M). Here, although BCG levels are comparable between treatment and control groups, we were unable to detect any TI-related transcriptional signatures upon early aIFNg treatment. This indicates that that residual BCG is not sufficient for the TI phenotype in the spleen. We now emphasize this point in the revised version of the manuscript (see lines 335-339).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) “Related to the point about BCG above, it would be helpful to understand whether this is a specifically time-limited requirement when trained immunity is first induced, or whether ongoing signaling through this axis is required for maintenance of the observed trained immunity phenotypes.”… “To address point 2, authors could treat with the inhibitor at 2 weeks and/or 4 weeks post-BCG and profiling later transcriptional and/or <italic>Salmonella</italic> growth phenotypes.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment, but respectfully claim that this experiment might not be feasible. As IFNg signaling is directly required for control of Salmonella infection, we are concerned that late IFNg inhibition will also directly affect the response to <italic>Salmonella</italic> challenge and control. Thus, in our experiments, to ensure that treatment only affects the response to BCG challenge, we were careful to limit aIFNg treatment to the early time points and allowed long resting period before <italic>Salmonella</italic> challenge.</p><p>Furthermore, inhibition of IFNg at late time point was already tested in both Lee et al, and Tran et al. (PMID: 38036767, 38302603). The authors show that late blockage of IFNg signalling (days 14-21) is sufficient to prevent protection during a viral challenge. This would indeed imply that ongoing signalling is necessary in this context to generate protection, specifically also late signalling events. Furthermore, Lee at al., also observed a biphasic activation pattern of cytokines and recruited cells, suggesting that rather than continuous activation, sequential cell activation and signalling may be occurring.</p><p>Respectfully, in our experiments we focus on the early time points based on our observations of early recruitment of CM-T cells (Figure S2. C-D). This was our main findings of this paper. We agree with the reviewer that future experiments are required to compare the differences in cell populations that are invovled in the early vs. late trained phenotpe dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Experimental conditions for the shown data are not consistently clear from the figure legends- would add more detail about the biological conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>OK – done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3E missing units on the legend</p></disp-quote><p>OK – done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4C middle panel missing y-axis label</p></disp-quote><p>OK – done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 40- remove &quot;both&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>OK- done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 156- Language could be clearer about what was described previously in contrast to the results shown in this work</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text accordingly in the revised manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>“A significant amount of work has already been performed for this study. The work is rich with data and description.”</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for acknowledging the importance of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments for the authors to consider:</p><p>“BCG is widely recognised to induce trained immunity. In this study, <italic>Salmonella</italic> is used as secondary infection event. Why? What is role of <italic>Salmonella</italic> in this study? Does this study contribute to our understanding of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection process? What does this tell us about <italic>Salmonella</italic>/vaccines? Is there any evidence that BCG protects against <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection? “</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important comment. We now added to the introduction and the discussion the relevance of our study to the potential of BCG and trained immunity as an alternative heterologous vaccine approach to traditional vaccines that require strain-specific vaccine for each pathogen (lines 49-55 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Figure 1E. RPM cannot be detected by scRNAseq?”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. we excluded RPMs from the scRNA-seq analysis. As we discuss in the manuscript (lines 94-96), and in our previous publication (PMID: 34788598), RPM activation involves rapid cell death. As we are analyzing by scRNA-seq two weeks after BCG challenge, we only measured scRNA-seq of CD11b+ cells, which exclude RPMs, as we were worried that our transcriptional data would represent transcriptional signatures of dying cells, making interpretation of the data difficult.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Figures 1H and I. The CM-T macrophages are not represented? Are they contemplated within the CM population? Would be useful to see the contribution of CM-T to the total CM DEGs/pathways.”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. CM-T cells are evident only after BCG challenge. Because of this, our analysis of DEGs induced in monocytes by BCG requires analysis of all monocytes together. Thus, we were careful throughout the manuscript to refer to CM when analyzing bulk RNA-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Lines 104-117. Can the authors summarise or move the text in this paragraph to discussion? Although it provides important context, it cuts the line of thought and reduces comprehension of this section. “</p></disp-quote><p>OK – we moved this section to the discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Line 127. Is it Fig 1I or 1F that the authors are referring to? “</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we changed the text in the revised manuscipt accordingly.</p><p>“Figure 1J. x-axis labels CM cells but both text and figure legend refer to this panel as CM-T. If this is the case, please show data for CM and CM-T separately.”</p><p>Please see our earlier point above that limits these analyses. As such we have also edited the text and figure legend to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Lines 136-139. Please indicate that this can be found in Fig 1J.”</p></disp-quote><p>OK – indicated in the revised manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Line 152. Please add that STm infection occurred at 14 and 60 days post training.”</p></disp-quote><p>OK – added</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Lines 162-163. This is repeated from lines 89-90, maybe the reduction of RPMs can be only highlighted in this section so that the previous section can be just focused on the new CM-T population?”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct - we removed the mention of RPMs here, and mention them only later in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Line 163. The recruitment is CM or CM-T cells? Since they express CXCL9 (line 165 and Fig1J) could this be used as a marker for the CM-T population at this time point?”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we thank him for this important comment. We now indicate that CXCL9+ is a marker for the CM-Ts population here and throughout the revised manuscript (lines 153-155 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Line 173. The loss of CXCL9 at 60 dpi means that CM-T population disappears/reduces or returns to CM only? If the population is reduced, could it be related to the reduced STm infection control at 60 days?”</p></disp-quote><p>OK– done. Referred to these cells as CM-Ts and suggested a correlation with protection loss in the text (lines 160-162 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Figure 2D. Can the authors show if there is variation in the myeloid populations after PBS injection at different time points? Are the percentages shown only at 3 dpi? It is curious that at 30 dpi the transcriptome has a significant change for certain genes.”</p></disp-quote><p>There are indeed variations across the PBS time points samples, which we demonstrate in Figure S2B. The percentages shown in the main figure for PBS reflect the mean of all time points, this is now stated in greater clarity in the revised manuscript (lines 151-152). We also noted an increase in the cell cycling genes at D30 for the control mice as well, and while still significant in BCG, we limited interpretation accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Line 208. The authors can highlight that the expression of STAT1 follows the same pattern as IFNg. Maybe even present the graphs side by side?”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we have implemented their suggestion as such in the updated text (lines 192-195) and figure (Fig. 2H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Line 213. Authors mention a replenishment of the RPM population - what time point are you referring to? At 60 dpi the population seems to be halved compared to 14 dpi. Later (line 230), authors refer to the replenishment as a repopulation by other cell types - is repopulation more correct than replenishment?”</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, and we thank the reviewer for this important comment. We now changed replenishment to repopulation (lines 95, 201), which is more accurate given the continued decreased percentage at later time points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 214-222. It is not clear what is the conclusion from these experiments: is the recruitment of progenitors from the BM or by local signals?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, we agree that the wording in the initial manuscript was imprecise. This experiment specifically tests whether trained bone marrow progenitors can sustain the observed TI signatures in a naive environment. By transplanting trained bone marrow into naive hosts, we demonstrate that progenitor programming alone is sufficient to maintain long-term SCA-1 expression in NCMs, without requiring ongoing local tissue signals. We now better clarify this text in the revised manuscript (lines 202-212).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Line 333-334. Where is the data that shows that upon Fedratinib RPMs have enhanced survival?”</p></disp-quote><p>OK – We now indicate the figure in the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
