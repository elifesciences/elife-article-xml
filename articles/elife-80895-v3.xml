presence, plasticity, and regulation of synapses. Gephyrin is an inhibitory synaptic scaffolding protein used to mark GABAergic and glycinergic postsynaptic sites. Despite the importance of gephyrin in modulating inhibitory transmission, its study is currently limited by the tractability of available reagents. Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) are a class of synthetic protein binder derived from diverse libraries by in vitro selection and tested by high-throughput screening to produce specific binders. In order to generate a functionally diverse toolset for studying inhibitory synapses, we screened a DARPin library against gephyrin mutants representing both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated states. We validated the robust use of anti-gephyrin DARPin clones for morphological identification of gephyrin clusters in rat neuron culture and mouse brain tissue, discovering previously overlooked clusters. This DARPin-based toolset includes clones with heterogenous gephyrin binding modes that allowed for identification of the most extensive gephyrin interactome to date and defined novel classes of putative interactors, creating a framework for understanding gephyrin’s nonsynaptic functions. This study demonstrates anti-gephyrin DARPins as a versatile platform for studying inhibitory synapses in an unprecedented manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inhibitory synapse</kwd><kwd>postsynaptic density</kwd><kwd>gabaa receptor</kwd><kwd>protein-network</kwd><kwd>interactome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_192522 /1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tyagarajan</surname><given-names>Shiva K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_192689</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plückthun</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Anti-gephyrin synthetic protein binders were screened and developed to specifically and robustly detect gephyrin protein and gephyrin-interacting protein partners in the mouse brain, generating a useful tool set for neuroscience.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biological research has relied for decades on the accuracy and precision of specific antibodies to morphologically describe protein localization and dynamics, or to biochemically describe protein interaction partners, using techniques such as immunolabeling, immunoprecipitation, and immunoassays, among others. While antibody-based tools have been invaluable, for a given protein we often lack a variety of binders that perform excellently across applications. Antibodies that detect fixed proteins in tissue (which are typically partially denatured) may not bind with the same affinity or specificity to the same protein in a lysate (which may retain a more native confirmation). The heterogeneous quality of some commercial antibodies presents an additional challenge as the often ambiguous or unknown antibody sequence, provenance, and specificity of poly- and monoclonal antibodies alike lead to false information and ultimately a high additional cost to research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradbury and Plückthun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith, 2015</xref>). This problem is especially relevant for the study of synaptic proteins, be they receptors or scaffolds, as these proteins are often used as markers to define the presence, plasticity, and regulation of synapses as a strong correlate for synaptic function. For example, ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits and the scaffolding molecule PSD-95 are frequently used to define the excitatory postsynapse, while GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) and the scaffolding protein gephyrin define the inhibitory postsynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Micheva et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Gephyrin is a highly conserved signaling scaffold that oligomerizes into multimers and binds to cognate inhibitory synaptic proteins to functionally tether GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs at postsynaptic sites in apposition to presynaptic GABA release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). Gephyrin is composed of three major domains: the N-terminal G domain and C-terminal E domain facilitate self-oligomerization of gephyrin underneath inhibitory postsynaptic sites, and they are linked together by the C domain, which is a substrate for diverse posttranslational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sander et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). Gephyrin mediates its scaffolding role by coordinating the retention of inhibitory synaptic molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), including GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs, GlyRs), collybistin, and neuroligin 2 through interactions at locations within the E domain or E/C domain interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choii and Ko, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>), with additional protein interactors binding to the G and C domains. These protein interactions can act synergistically to enhance postsynaptic density assembly and alter gephyrin lattice compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Groeneweg et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, via homo- and heterophilic protein–protein interactions, gephyrin can control inhibitory postsynaptic function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>In vitro selection and generation of anti-gephyrin DARPins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of gephyrin function at the inhibitory postsynapse via its scaffolding role.

Gephyrin phosphorylation at several defined serine residues controls gephyrin oligomerization and compaction, thereby affecting GABAergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battaglia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Petrini and Barberis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zacchi et al., 2014</xref>). Two of these phosphosites, serines S268 and S270, are targeted by the kinases ERK1/2 and GSK3ß or cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), respectively, to downregulate gephyrin clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), thereby controlling postsynaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyagarajan et al., 2013</xref>). These phosphorylation events directly regulate gephyrin conformation via packing density changes to alter GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor dwell time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battaglia et al., 2018</xref>), by altering gephyrin interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>), or some combination of the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Specht, 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, the most widely used anti-gephyrin antibody for identifying inhibitory postsynaptic sites, monoclonal antibody clone Ab7a, is sensitive to phosphorylation at serine 270 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalbouneh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhse et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>), thus complicating interpretation of inhibitory postsynaptic presence, size, or dynamics.</p><p>In addition to PTMs, gephyrin is regulated by alternative splicing by a suite of exonic splice cassette insertions (annotation outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fritschy et al., 2008</xref>). While the principal (P1) isoform of gephyrin in neurons facilitates its synaptic scaffolding role, gephyrin is also a metabolic enzyme that participates in molybdenum cofactor (MOCO) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nawrotzki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schwarz and Mendel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). MOCO synthesis can be mediated in non-neuronal cells by an isoform that includes the C3 splice cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meier et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smolinsky et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that gephyrin harbors both isoform- and cell-type-specific functions.</p><p>Gephyrin has been reported to complex with a wide variety of proteins as determined by both targeted and unbiased interaction studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuhrmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabatini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>). These screens have implicated gephyrin in nonsynaptic processes, including regulation of mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabatini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wuchter et al., 2012</xref>), and motor protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuhrmann et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, these interactomes have identified novel proteins such as InSyn1, with implications for understanding the heterogeneity of inhibitory synapse organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uezu et al., 2019</xref>). Still, the overlap in coverage of gephyrin’s interactome in each study has been variable with respect to identification of canonical inhibitory synaptic proteins due to limitations of each screening technique. Taken together, there is a need to generate and characterize molecular tools that can (1) interrogate gephyrin in different applications, (2) be functionally validated for the experiment in question, and (3) be diverse enough in their mode of interaction to not limit the different protein functional states that can be probed.</p><p>Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) represent an attractive alternative tool compared to conventional antibodies as they are highly stable and specific synthetic protein binders that can be generated via high-throughput in vitro selection and screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kohl et al., 2003</xref>). Since they possess a defined genetic sequence, they can be adapted into diverse fusion constructs, and their structural stability facilitates their engineering to achieve differential binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harmansa and Affolter, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plückthun, 2015</xref>). DARPins are composed of a variable number (typically 2–3) ankyrin repeats containing randomized residues, flanked by N- and C-terminal capping repeats with a hydrophilic surface that shield the hydrophobic core. Each repeat forms a structural unit, which consists of a β-turn followed by two antiparallel α-helices and a loop reaching the turn of the next repeat. The randomized residues on adjacent repeats within the β-turn turns and on the surface of the α-helices form a variable and contiguous concave surface that mediates specific interactions with target proteins. Using a DARPin library with high diversity (~10<sup>12</sup> unique DARPins), DARPins can be selected using ribosome display and then screened for particular binding characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dreier and Plückthun, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Douthwaite and Jackson, 2012</xref>). Using this approach, DARPins have been shown to selectively bind to different conformations of proteins, including those brought about by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kummer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plückthun, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite being used extensively as both experimental tools for structural biology as well as therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plückthun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tamaskovic et al., 2012</xref>), DARPins have not yet been applied to neuroscience research in the current literature. In order to generate a new toolset of anti-gephyrin binders, we screened a DARPin library for binding to different gephyrin phosphorylation mutants and characterized the resulting DARPins in both morphological and biochemical applications. We validated the use of anti-gephyrin DARPins to understand how different binders can reveal novel aspects of gephyrin and inhibitory synapse biology highlighting heterogeneity of inhibitory postsynapse morphology and composition.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation and selection of anti-gephyrin DARPins</title><p>Gephyrin clusters GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and other inhibitory molecules such as neuroligin 2 and collybistin at postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), where its clustering role is modified by phosphorylation, importantly at serines S268 and S270 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This phosphorylation of gephyrin links upstream signaling (e.g., neurotrophic factors, activity) to downstream gephyrin regulation of inhibitory synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Groeneweg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tyagarajan and Fritschy, 2014</xref>). The commonly used commercial antibody clone for morphological detection of synaptic gephyrin (clone Ab7a) has been employed extensively for almost four decades in the literature to identify inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeiffer et al., 1984</xref>). Though, rather than binding gephyrin regardless of its modified state, this antibody was recently demonstrated to specifically recognize gephyrin phosphorylated at serine S270 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuhse et al., 2012</xref>). This antibody’s specificity for phospho-gephyrin complicates interpretation of synaptic gephyrin cluster identification when using clone Ab7a and prevents accurate detection of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters when gephyrin S270 phosphorylation is low or blocked. This is illustrated by the lack of binding of Ab7a to gephyrin in brain tissue derived from a phospho-S268A/S270A phospho-mutant mouse line, in which serines S268 and S270 are mutated to alanines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, to generate protein binders that can more robustly identify gephyrin independently of its phosphorylation status, we looked beyond antibody-based binders to (DARPins).</p><p>DARPins are small (~12–15 kDa) compared to conventional antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and their binding to specific target proteins is mediated by several randomized residues contained within assemblies of 2–3 variable ankyrin repeats (AR) flanked by capping repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Binz et al., 2004</xref>). This basic DARPin structure creates a rigid concave shape with enhanced thermostability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, DARPins do not contain cysteines, allowing for functional cytoplasmic recombinant expression in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as well as cytoplasmic expression and functional studies in mammalian cells. We performed a ribosome display selection, followed by screening of individual clones against recombinant gephyrin (P1 principal isoform) containing either S268A/S270A or S268E/S270E mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which mimic the respective dephosphorylated and phosphorylated state, thus representing functionally distinct gephyrin conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Battaglia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyagarajan et al., 2013</xref>). This allowed us to define sensitivity toward the modified state and widen the spectrum of DARPins obtained from the selection. Single DARPin clones were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> containing an N-terminal MRGS(H)<sub>8</sub> (His<sub>8</sub>) tag and C-terminal FLAG tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Initial screening was performed with 376 DARPin clones using a high-throughput HTRF assay with crude extracts derived from 96-well expression plates. Of the initial hits, 32 were sequenced and 25 unique DARPins identified. These DARPins were further screened using an ELISA-based assay for relative binding to the phospho-null or phospho-mimetic gephyrin isoforms, or the absence of target as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). From this screen, eight DARPins were chosen for expression/purification and further analysis due to their high signal-to-background characteristics, as well as for equal binding to both phospho-mutant forms of gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These eight DARPins showed diversity in the variable residues in the target protein interaction surface, highlighting the broad spectrum of binders that were obtained with this technology, and suggesting that they likely interact with gephyrin using different binding orientation or epitopes and independent of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characterization of anti-gephyrin DARPins as morphological tools</title><p>The antibody clone Ab7a has been used extensively to both define the location, size, and dynamics of postsynaptic gephyrin puncta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bausen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalbouneh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Niwa et al., 2019</xref>). However, this antibody reacts preferentially with gephyrin phosphorylated at S270, and sometimes also labels nonspecific structures such as the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Alternative anti-gephyrin antibodies exist such as clone 3B11, which can be used for immunoprecipitation of gephyrin and detection on immunoblots, but leads to high background when used to label synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To determine whether anti-gephyrin DARPins function as antibody-like tools in synaptic staining (in addition to binding recombinant gephyrin in vitro), we compared FLAG-tagged anti-gephyrin DARPins against antibody clone Ab7a for staining in primary rat hippocampal neuron culture at 15 days in vitro (DIV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Clone 27D5-FLAG produced no detectable signal, and clones 27B5, 27H2, and 27G4 labeled gephyrin puncta but produced considerable background comparable to another commercial anti-gephyrin antibody (clone 3B11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Moreover, clones 27B3, 27D3, 27F3, and 27G2 colocalized with presynaptic vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT)-containing axon terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We found no differences between DARPin-FLAG 27B3 or 27G2 and Ab7a colocalization with VGAT, indicating equal functionality in morphological applications. DARPin-FLAG 27D3 and 27F3 labeled puncta of a smaller size, which could relate either to their affinity for synaptic gephyrin or heterogeneity in epitope accessibility as different postsynaptic gephyrin puncta may differ in their isoform or post-translationally modified state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Anti-gephyrin DARPins specifically label gephyrin at inhibitory postsynaptic sites.</title><p>Native gephyrin in fixed hippocampal neuron cultures (DIV15) probed using DARPin-FLAG clones, subsequently detected with anti-FLAG antibodies, and compared to staining with commercial anti-gephyrin antibody clone Ab7a.

We confirmed the phosphosensitivity of this analysis method by inhibiting CDKs (upstream of gephyrin S270 phosphorylation) using 5 µM aminopurvalanol A applied for 24 hr. This treatment reduced Ab7a but not DARPin-hFc 27G2 signal as indicated by the decrease in the ratio between these two intensities seen both for individual synapses and when averaged by neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We therefore examined the Ab7a/DARPin-hFc 27G2 intensity ratio between the somatic, dendritic, and axon-initial segment (A.I.S.) compartments in primary hippocampal neuron culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), finding a significant reduction in Ab7a signal within the A.I.S. as defined by AnkyrinG immunolabeling (AnkG). Our results demonstrate that gephyrin phospho-S270 status varies between two neighboring clusters within a dendrite segment and also for the first time we can label gephyrin within the A.I.S. To test whether application of anti-gephyrin binders may affect the quantification of gephyrin clusters, we transfected hippocampal neuron cultures with EGFP-gephyrin plasmid and quantified cluster size along the principal dendrites of neurons using fluorescent signal from EGFP. This analysis demonstrated that compared to the untreated condition, application of either DARPin-hFc clones or antibody Ab7a does not influence the median size of EGFP gephyrin clusters in fixed tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DARPin-hFc 27G2 detects previously overlooked gephyrin clusters in brain tissue</title><p>Antibody-based identification of gephyrin clusters in the brain is widely used to identify inhibitory synaptic sites, but current reagents may only capture a subset of synaptic gephyrin clusters, namely, those with gephyrin significantly phosphorylated at S270. Therefore, we extended our analysis of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters using DARPin-hFc 27G2 and the phospho-S270-specific antibody Ab7a to mouse brain tissue using the hippocampal CA1 area as a model. The hippocampus is organized in a layered structure, stratifying somatic from dendritic compartments, with compartment-specific GABAergic interneuron innervation patterns well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). We found lamina-specific variability in relative gephyrin phosphorylation at S270, which was significantly elevated in the stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum moleculare compared to other layers (stratum pyramidale and radiatum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). Within the stratum pyramidale, we noticed a population of large, relatively hypophosphorylated clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) reminiscent of A.I.S. synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Indeed, while DARPin-hFc 27G2 labels large gephyrin clusters apposed to presynaptic VGAT terminals, Ab7a reactivity within the A.I.S. is relatively weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lorenz-Guertin and Jacob, 2018</xref>) and span the length of the A.I.S. as defined by the marker AnkG. Therefore, DARPin-hFc 27G2 can better assess postsynaptic gephyrin at the A.I.S. and at synapses where gephyrin phosphorylation is low. These data indicate that gephyrin clusters on the A.I.S. have likely gone un- or underreported in the literature, which is meaningful when considering that threshold-based detection of gephyrin is used as a proxy for inhibitory synapse presence and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Micheva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schneider Gasser et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>DARPin-hFc 27G2 labeling of gephyrin clusters demonstrates laminar and axon-initial segment (A.I.S.)-specific S270 phosphorylation and phosphorylation-dependent cluster size regulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: the relative Ab7a to DARPin-hFc 27G2 fluorescence intensity in the mouse hippocampus area CA1 shows layer-specific variability.

To gain a more complete picture of gephyrin binding partners, we precipitated native gephyrin protein complexes from mouse brain lysates with the traditionally used antibody clone 3B11 (suitable for immunoprecipitations) and each one of our DARPin-hFc clones 27B3, 27F3, 27G2, and the control DARPin E3_5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We additionally cross-referenced this list with interactors precipitated by the antibody 3B11 as well as known binders identified from the literature to compile a high-confidence consensus gephyrin interactome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), representing the largest compilation of putative gephyrin interactors to date. This network encompasses the majority of canonical gephyrin-associated proteins, including GABA<sub>A</sub> and glycine receptors, inhibitory synaptic scaffolding and adhesion molecules, and cytoskeletal adaptor proteins. As expected, over-representation analysis of the consensus interactome found significant enrichment for synaptic organization processes, but also unexpectedly those involved in protein trafficking, mRNA regulation, and metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

To determine whether DARPin-hFc clones bind to different gephyrin domains or modified isoforms with different strength, we used an in-cell binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) to assess the relative binding of these clones to different forms of eGFP-tagged gephyrin. As expected from the in vitro characterization, there was no preference for any of the DARPin-hFc clones between wildtype gephyrin and the phospho-null or phospho-mimetic mutation-containing gephyrin at serines 268 and 270. Interestingly, we saw clear domain-specific binding preferences, with clones 27B3 and 27G2 interacting both with full-length gephyrin or the G and C domains in isolation, whereas clone 27F3 could only bind to full-length gephyrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Gephyrin splice cassette C3 is constitutively spliced out in neurons by the splicing factor NOVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Licatalosi et al., 2008</xref>), implying it is not needed for synaptic scaffolding. However, the C3 cassette is included in gephyrin expressed within non-neuronal cells where it contributes toward MOCO synthesis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smolinsky et al., 2008</xref>) or possible other functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We found that the C3 cassette is significantly less detected by DARPin-hFc 27F3, while clones 27B3 and 27G2 bind to both the principal (P1) and C3-containing cassette isoforms equally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). We additionally probed for binding to gephyrin containing the C4a cassette (thought to be brain-enriched but without a clearly identified function). None of the DARPin-hFc clones tested interacted strongly with the C4a-gephyrin isoform, while the antibody clone 3B11 interacted with this isoform at similar levels to the other gephyrin isoforms.</p><p>To understand whether the different DARPin-hFc clones can interact with ontologically distinct gephyrin protein networks, we performed over-representation analysis of proteins that are exclusive or significantly elevated in the interactome detected by clone 27F3 (neuronal isoform specific) or detected exclusively or significantly elevated by clones 27B3 and 27G2 (bind to neuronal and glial gephyrin isoforms). While we only saw enrichment for synaptic organization-related biological processes from DARPin-hFc 27F3-enriched interactors, we additionally found enrichment for cytoskeletal processes, ribosomal complex formation, and proteins involved in mRNA splicing and transport for the 27B3 and 27G2-enriched interactomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). This suggests that the non-neuronal isoforms of gephyrin could be involved in these other distinct biological processes. In support of this hypothesis, when examining for proteins of glial or myelin ontology, we saw overall higher presence and abundance in the interactomes determined using clones 27B3 and 27G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then confirmed DARPins’ 27B3 and 27G2 bias for capturing gephyrin containing the C3 cassette by analyzing the relative abundance of C3-casette containing peptide fragments recovered from pulldown experiments to total gephyrin, while clone 27F3 binds significantly less C3-casette containing gephyrin than other DARPins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). These data indicate that understanding the isoform specificity of different DARPin clones will be useful for future dissection of gephyrin functionality at synapses, but also outside of synaptic sites or in non-neuronal cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we generated and characterized anti-gephyrin DARPins as tools to study inhibitory synapse biology. This novel class of gephyrin protein binder specifically interacts with gephyrin in both morphological and biochemical applications to label gephyrin clusters and isolate gephyrin protein complexes without the limitations of previous antibody-based tools. We furthermore demonstrated that these DARPins can capture a greater diversity of gephyrin forms, which will allow researchers to better characterize gephyrin and inhibitory synapses alike.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Use of anti-gephyrin DARPins as morphological tools</title><p>Gephyrin is widely used as an inhibitory postsynaptic marker due to its specific enrichment at inhibitory postsynaptic sites, but current antibody epitope limitations mask the heterogeneity of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters that can be probed. As our DARPins are insensitive to modification at two key phospho-sites thought to be dynamically regulated at synapses, we were able to identify previously masked gephyrin clusters at the A.I.S. where relative gephyrin S270 phosphorylation is low (and thus difficult to detect with the antibody Ab7a). Because most image analysis methods use threshold-based detection of gephyrin cluster presence and dynamics, A.I.S. gephyrin clusters (and subsequently identification of inhibitory synapses) will be underrepresented in the literature. For example, by using only the antibody Ab7a, gephyrin was suggested to play a less important role in scaffolding A.I.S. synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao and Heldt, 2016</xref>), whereas the large gephyrin clusters illuminated using DARPins suggest the opposite. Inhibitory input onto the A.I.S. provided by Chandelier interneurons plays an important role in gating neuronal output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, studying gephyrin A.I.S. dynamics is especially relevant for uncovering mechanisms of network plasticity and how inhibition controls circuit function. Outside of the A.I.S., we documented clear changes in relative gephyrin S270 phosphorylation in the stratum oriens and stratum lacunosum moleculare of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, indicating potential interneuron-specific or input-layer-specific regulation of gephyrin function. Therefore, these DARPin-based tools can be used not only to robustly describe native gephyrin clusters in culture systems and in tissue, but they can also be used in tandem with gephyrin phospho-specific antibodies such as clone Ab7a to examine how genetics, environmental factors, or network activity regulate inhibitory adaptations via gephyrin. Moreover, DARPin binders may be able to better capture the heterogeneity of inhibitory postsynaptic sites that display differences in molecular composition regulation dependent on presynaptic inhibitory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiu et al., 2018</xref>). The inclusion of the hFc tag on the DARPin constructs additionally allows them to be used with antihuman secondary antibodies, and thus in conjunction with the vast majority of commercial and homemade antibodies against other synaptic markers raised in nonhuman species.</p><p>DARPins lack cysteines, and thus have an advantage as protein binders over traditional antibodies as they can be expressed intracellularly as ‘intrabodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plückthun, 2015</xref>). Given their highly specific synaptic labeling, DARPin expression could be developed as a tool to visualize inhibitory synapses in living neurons or non-neuronal cells in vivo after by fusing DARPin clones to genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. The small genetic size of DARPins allows for their packaging along with additional elements such as inducible expression systems or other functional moieties into viral vectors with small genomic packaging limits. Future derivatization of anti-gephyrin DARPin binders, for example, using cell-type-specific drivers to express DARPins fused to different genetically encoded fluorescent proteins, could improve our understanding of how the inhibitory postsynapse remodels similarly or differentially within excitatory and inhibitory neurons within the same circuit after experimental intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Use of anti-gephyrin DARPins as biochemical tools</title><p>While gephyrin is used experimentally to morphologically identify the inhibitory postsynapse, it achieves its function through protein–protein interactions. Unbiased protein interaction network identification broadens how we envisage protein function and regulation. For example, a BioID-based gephyrin interactome discovered a novel inhibitory synaptic protein, InSyn1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>), which was found to be a key regulator of the dystroglycan complex and important for cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uezu et al., 2019</xref>). By combining identified gephyrin interactors from antibody-based and DARPin-based experiments (including three distinct DARPin clones with different binding modalities), we were able to develop a consensus gephyrin interactome that facilitates higher-confidence pursuit of understanding how these proteins integrate or are regulated by gephyrin function. The thresholds and criteria used to identify gephyrin interactors were designed to be inclusive and are indeed able to capture a majority of established canonical gephyrin interactors, yet further assessment will be required to determine which interactors are functional, and additionally whether they interact with synaptic versus nonsynaptic gephyrin.</p><p>Various interactome determination techniques may capture different pictures of gephyrin protein networks. Proximity-ligation-based methods require expression of recombinant bait protein, which may not correspond to the endogenous expression level or diversity of isoforms of native proteins in cells, though they are able to capture transient interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burke et al., 2015</xref>). Affinity purification of gephyrin protein complexes is more likely to capture stable gephyrin protein complexes and may not identify transient interactors, but it allows for identification of native gephyrin protein complexes reflecting the heterogeneity in its isoforms present or its post-translationally modified state. Therefore, using proximity-based labeling systems such as APEX and TurboID in conjunction with DARPins will allow for a comparison of stable (possibly structural) functions of gephyrin and transient (possibly signaling) roles of gephyrin.</p><p>A binder that interacts with gephyrin (whether antibody, DARPin, or other) may have the capacity to alter gephyrin interaction with protein partners. Future studies that directly determine the nature of binder–gephyrin interactions will allow us to better understand the extent of this phenomena. Due to the different binding modes of each DARPin to gephyrin, our consensus interactome offers a higher-confidence picture of which gephyrin interacting proteins are likely to occur regardless of how gephyrin itself is precipitated by a given binder.</p><p>Within our interactome data, we found previously unidentified but presumed interacting proteins that are well-known regulators of gephyrin. These include kinases such as CAMKIIα (KCC2A), which enhances gephyrin scaffolding via phosphorylation of serine 305 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flores et al., 2015</xref>), GSK3β, which phosphorylates serine 270, and MK01 (ERK2), which targets serine 268 to reduce clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyagarajan et al., 2013</xref>), as well as Protein Phosphatase 2A, which antagonizes gephyrin phosphorylation at serine 270 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kalbouneh et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, we found the presence of multiple signaling scaffolds, including CNKR2, a PSD-associated protein that may regulate RAS-dependent MAPK signaling and is associated with intellectual disability in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). This protein was very recently confirmed to regulate network excitability using a genetic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Erata et al., 2021</xref>). These data suggest that many of the kinases known to regulate gephyrin scaffolding as well as regulators of those kinases are part of gephyrin protein complexes. Discovering how these kinase scaffolds associate and regulate gephyrin via phosphorylation may pave the way for targeted therapeutic development.</p><p>The name ‘gephyrin’ is derived from the Greek word γέφυρα meaning ‘bridge’ as it was discovered to link glycine receptors to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pfeiffer et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prior et al., 1992</xref>), and subsequently found to interact with other cytoskeletal components, including dynein light chains 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuhrmann et al., 2002</xref>). We have now expanded this list to include multiple cytoskeletal interactors, including those involved in microtubule nucleation during cell division (e.g., TBG1, CENPV). Interestingly, gephyrin colocalized with microtubule nucleation centers has been recently identified in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our consensus interactome identified not only canonical gephyrin binders but also unexpected proteins related to mRNA regulation, metabolism, and ribosomal function, which may suggest nonsynaptic functions of gephyrin yet to be described, the significance of which can now be investigated further with independent methods. Canonical gephyrin interactors differed in their abundance within complexes precipitated by clones that bind the P1 or C3 cassette variants, suggesting that different DARPin clones can access distinct synaptic gephyrin complexes. Gephyrin has been implicated previously in regulation of mTOR, a signaling scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Machado et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sabatini et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wuchter et al., 2012</xref>), as well as with elongation factor EF1A1, which, along with mTOR, directs mRNA translation and acts as a cytoskeletal adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2013</xref>). We identified EF1A1 as an interactor enriched in DARPin-precipitated complexes along with other mRNA binding proteins involved in mRNA splicing and transport (e.g., PURA, PURB, PABP1). Additionally, we detected the presence of transcription regulators such as SAFB1, DDX3X, and SIR2 from all DARPin complexes, and additional transcription factors, including MECP2 (a Rett syndrome-associated protein regulating inhibitory network development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pelkey et al., 2017</xref>] and present at the PSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aber et al., 2003</xref>]) found only in 27B3 and 27G2 gephyrin complexes. Gephyrin signaling has recently been implicated in coupling transcriptional signaling via ARX in pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2017</xref>), and may therefore be involved in regulating additional transcriptional coupling in the brain via these described transcription factors. Many of the unexpected ribosomal and mRNA binding proteins were not detected in the control condition or using clone 27F3, suggesting that nonspecific binding to these classes of proteins is not an intrinsic property of DARPins. Further studies using isoform-specific DARPin clones to capture gephyrin protein networks in neuronal compared to non-neuronal cells will clarify which protein interactors may be isoform or cell-type-specific. Indeed, our group recently demonstrated that gephyrin affects microglial reactivity and synapse stability after stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cramer et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Further applications of DARPins</title><p>Beyond morphological and biochemical applications, DARPin binders can be developed further as functional tools.

Using structural biology to assess the interaction between DARPins and full-length gephyrin, we may not only be able to rationally engineer DARPins to achieve different binding functionality, but may also derive fundamental information about gephyrin’s form and function relationships, which would be essential for any future therapeutic efforts targeting gephyrin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Importance and limitations of protein binder development for neuroscience</title><p>Several synthetic protein binder scaffolds exist, including DARPins, nanobodies, anticalins, affibodies, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harmansa and Affolter, 2018</xref>), providing a plethora of platforms to develop tools that detect or modify synaptic proteins, yet their application in neuroscience has lagged behind other fields. Of note, a fibronectin-based scaffold was used to generate intrabodies (termed FingRs by the authors) against gephyrin and the excitatory postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gross et al., 2013</xref>). This system has been used chiefly to label gephyrin clusters in living neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crosby et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gross et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Son et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>), but has not been extensively used for morphological detection of native gephyrin in tissue. Therefore, our DARPin-based toolset complements previously developed tools for live imaging, and future studies will test whether DARPins may be similarly used for native gephyrin tagging in living neurons. As with any protein binder that interacts with a substrate, DARPins have the potential to alter normal gephyrin interactions, clustering, or function. In the context of fixed tissue, we have demonstrated that this is not the case, though whether DARPins alter gephyrin clustering and inhibitory neurotransmission in living neurons requires evaluation before they can be used in this capacity.</p><p>Due to their stability and structure, DARPins are facile and inexpensive to produce and purify using simple bacterial systems and affinity resins. In addition, DARPins have relatively small sizes and defined sequences, which makes them experimentally tractable. We have shown that developing multiple DARPins to examine gephyrin is a useful strategy for understanding the heterogeneity of its signaling and function, and similar strategies applied to other synaptic beyond gephyrin are likely to yield fruitful insights, as previously demonstrated with other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plückthun, 2015</xref>). For synaptic biology, these DARPins offer an additional toolset that we hope will be expanded in the future so that excellent and well-characterized binders are available to probe a multitude of targets with the goal of enhancing research efficiency and facilitating discoveries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

wildtype [WT]) or the P1 variant containing mutated serine to alanine (phospho-null) or serine to glutamic acid (phospho-mimetic) mutations at serines 268 and 270 has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyagarajan et al., 2013</xref>). Primers introducing a 5′ EcoRI restriction site upstream of a 2× GSSS linker sequence and 3′ KpnI site (<italic>see</italic> Key Resources Table) were used to amplify WT or mutated gephyrin before restriction digest and ligation into target vectors for recombinant bacterial expression and purification containing a 5′ His<sub>8</sub> tag or His-Avi tag. <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21-DE3 Gold was transformed with the correct clones, and clones containing the His-Avi tag were transformed along with a plasmid encoding BirA for AviTag-specific biotin ligation. Bacteria were grown in THY media (20 g tryptone, 10 g yeast extract, 11 g HEPES, 5 g NaCl, 1 g MgSO<sub>4</sub>/L pH 7.4) containing ampicillin (100 µg/mL) and chloramphenicol (10 µg/mL) to ensure expression of both tagged Avi-gephyrin and BirA. Overnight 5 mL cultures were used to inoculate a 150 mL culture grown at 37°C and 250 rpm until an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.7 was reached. Induction and biotinylation were achieved by using a final concentration of 30 µM IPTG and 50 µM D-biotin (dissolved in 10 mM bicine buffer, pH 8.3). Protein induction proceeded for 6 hr before bacteria were pelleted.</p><p>Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 15 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Trizma base, 120 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) containing cOmplete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche) and DNAseI (Roche) before sonication on ice to release proteins. The lysate was pelleted at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> at 4°C for 15 min, and the cleared lysate was passed through 0.45 and 0.22 µm sterile filters. His<sub>8</sub>-tagged proteins were affinity purified on a 1 mL nickel agarose column (HIS-Select) using gravity flow.

Proteins were eluted in 4 mL elution buffer (equilibration buffer containing 250 mM imidazole) and dialyzed in storage buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.5) using dialysis tubing. Dialyzed protein was centrifuged at 60,000 × <italic>g</italic> to remove any aggregated products, and the concentration was determined using absorption at 280 nm using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer with predicted protein molecular weight and extinction coefficient values determined using ProtParam online software (ProtParam, Swissprot, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://web.expasy.org/protparam/">https://web.expasy.org/protparam/</ext-link>).

Ribosome display selections were performed essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dreier and Plückthun, 2012</xref>) using a semi-automatic KingFisher Flex MTP 96-well platform. The library includes N3C-DARPins with stabilized C-terminal caps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramer et al., 2010</xref>). This library is a mixture of DARPins with randomized and nonrandomized N- and C- terminal caps, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Plückthun, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schilling et al., 2014</xref>), and successively enriched pools were cloned as intermediates in a ribosome display specific vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schilling et al., 2014</xref>). Selections were performed over four rounds with decreasing target concentration and increasing washing steps to enrich for binders with high affinities. The first round included the initial selection against gephyrin S268E/S270E at low stringency. The second round included pre-panning with the opposite phospho-null (gephyrin S268A/S270A) variant immobilized on magnetic beads, with the supernatant transferred to immobilized target of the same variant. The third round included this pre-panning of the opposite variant and the addition of the (non-biotinylated) same variant to enrich for binders with slow off-rate kinetics. The fourth and final round included only the pre-panning step and selection was performed with low stringency.</p><p>The final enriched pool was cloned as fusion construct into a bacterial pQE30 derivative vector with an N-terminal MRGS(H)<sub>8</sub> tag (His<sub>8</sub>) and C-terminal FLAG tag via unique BamHI × HindIII sites containing <italic>lacIq</italic> for expression control. After transformation of <italic>E. coli</italic> XL1-blue, 380 single DARPin clones for each target protein were expressed in 96-well format and lysed by addition of a concentrated Tris-HCL-based HT-Lysis buffer containing octylthioglucoside (OTG), lysozyme, and nuclease or B-Per Direct detergent plus lysozyme and nuclease (Pierce). These bacterial crude extracts of single DARPin clones were subsequently used in a homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF)-based screen to identify potential binders. Binding of the FLAG-tagged DARPins to streptavidin-immobilized biotinylated gephyrin variants was measured using FRET (donor: streptavidin-Tb; acceptor: anti-FLAG-d2, Cisbio). Further HTRF measurement against ‘No Target’ allowed for discrimination of gephyrin-specific hits.</p><p>From the identified binders, 32 were sequenced and 25 unique clones were identified. The DARPins were expressed in small scale, lysed with Cell-Lytic B (Sigma), and purified using a 96-well IMAC column (HisPur Cobalt plates, Thermo Scientific). DARPins after IMAC purification were analyzed at a concentration of 10 µM on a Superdex 75 5/150 GL column (GE Healthcare) using an Aekta Micro System (GE Healthcare) with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 400 nM NaCl as the running buffer to identify monomeric DARPin binders. Final hit validation of specificity was performed by ELISA using small-scale IMAC-purified DARPins. Binding of the FLAG-tagged DARPins to streptavidin-immobilized biotinylated gephyrin variants was measured using a mouse-anti-FLAG-M2 antibody (Sigma) as first and goat-anti-mouse-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (Sigma) as second antibody. Further ELISA measurement against ‘No Target’ allowed for discrimination of gephyrin-specific hits. The best binders did not discriminate between phospho-mimetic states, suggesting that other epitopes were favored.

Sub-cloning of select DARPins into a vector containing an N-terminal HSA leader sequence and C-terminal human Fc fragment (hFc) region using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites was performed for mammalian cell production. Test rounds of DARPin-hFc fusion expression were performed in adherent HEK293T cells where the supernatant was collected to confirm DARPin hFc expression. Medium-scale production of DARPin-hFc fusion constructs was performed with assistance from the Protein Production and Structure core facility (PTPSP Lausanne) by transfecting plasmids for clones 27B3-hFc, 27F3-hFc, and 27G2-hFc, as well as control DARPin E3_5-hFc into nonadherent HEK cells and grown in 400 mL cultures. DARPin-hFc recombinant protein was affinity-purified using Protein A resin after overnight incubation with rotation at 4°C and captured on a 15 mL column Protein A Sepharose resin (GenScript), then beads were washed with 50-column volumes of PBS and eluted with glycine buffer pH 3.0 into 1.5 M Tris–HCl pH 8.0 before overnight dialysis into PBS pH 7.5.

HEK293T cells were acquired directly from ATCC and were validated by STR profiling and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FCS at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> jacketed incubator. Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips and grown to 50% confluency before transfecting plasmids (using standard PEI-based transfection at a ratio of 1 µg plasmid to 4 µg PEI). eGFP-tagged gephyrin P1 variant, as well as those containing serine-to-alanine or -glutamate mutations at S268 and S270 (S268A/S270A, S268E/S270E), has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tyagarajan et al., 2013</xref>). eGFP-tagged gephyrin E domain or GC domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lardi-Studler et al., 2007</xref>) as well as variants containing the C3 or C4a splice cassettes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lardi-Studler et al., 2007</xref> have been described previously. Cells grown on coverslips were washed briefly in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min. Coverslips were washed in PBS, then treated with 1:2000 (1 mg/mL stock) dilution of DARPin-FLAG clones or a control clone (nonbinding DARPin E3_5-FLAG) in 10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 90 min. Coverslips were washed and then treated with a 1:1000 dilution of mouse anti-FLAG antibody (clone M2, Sigma) for 60 min, then washed 3× in PBS. Coverslips were incubated with an Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and DAPI for 30 min prior to washing 3× with PBS and drying before mounting with DAKO mounting medium onto glass slides.</p><p>Coverslips were imaged using an LSM700 microscope (Zeiss) with ×40 (1.4 NA) objectives. Images were acquired using Zen software (Zeiss). Laser intensity and gain settings were set to maximize signals in all channels/conditions without bleed-through or signal saturation, and acquisition settings were kept consistent for comparative analyses. eGFP-gephyrin-positive HEK cells were imaged at random locations on the coverslip, and fluorescent signals were acquired at 8 bits in the 488 and 647 channels to capture the eGFP-gephyrin and FLAG signal, respectively. eGFP-gephyrin presents as a diffuse signal in the soma with occasional cytoplasmic aggregates. For intensity analysis, regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn within the cytosol to avoid inclusion of these aggregates in the quantification. Fluorescence intensity was quantified using ImageJ. The slope of the relationship between the eGFP-gephyrin signal and the FLAG signal was used to compare relative binding of DARPins to their target.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Animals</title><p>C56Bl/6J mice were purchased from Charles River (Germany), and timed-pregnant Wistar rats (for E17 embryo collection for neuron culture) were purchased from Envigo (Netherlands).

In the current manuscript, we examined gephyrin clusters in fixed neurons and/or brain tissue, and we do not expect this to bias gephyrin clustering similar to antibody staining.</p><p>However, to address the reviewer’s concern we provide new experimental evidence in Figure 3 Supplement 5. We transfected hippocampal neuron cultures with EGFP-tagged gephyrin and probed fixed neurons with either anti-gephyrin DARPin-hFc clones 27B3, 27F3, 27G2, or commercial anti-gephyrin antibody Ab7a. We then quantified the density and size of detected EGFP clusters, finding no difference in the median size of EGFP gephyrin clusters. Therefore, we do not expect DARPins to interfere importantly with morphological detection of gephyrin clustering in fixed neurons.</p><p>We are actively collaborating with structural biologists to derive high-resolution structure of DARPin-gephyrin interactions using crystallography/cryo-EM. As these experiments are time intensive this data is beyond the scope of our current manuscript. We anticipate that crystal structure information in tandem with functional analysis of GABAergic inhibition upon loading anti-gephyrin DARPins into neurons for patch clamp electrophysiology, as well as live imaging experiments to track gephyrin cluster size changes after intracellular delivery of anti-gephyrin DARPins would be part of a follow up manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors are to be commended on the development of novel tools to study the role that gephyrin plays in the formation of inhibitory synapses.

The issues that should be resolved before publication are outlined below.</p><p>1. Is it possible to confirm the specificity of the DARPs using isoform-specific gephyrin-KO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, gephyrin isoform knockout mice do not currently exist to test this. To examine whether DARPin isoform biases described in our manuscript hold true, we reanalyzed our MS/MS data for relative recovery of the C3 gephyrin isoform (which generates peptide fragments that can be uniquely assigned to this variant) compared to total gephyrin levels. As expected, we recovered significantly less of the C3 cassette-containing isoform from precipitations using DARPin 27F3-hFc. This data has been included as a new figure supplement (Figure 6 – Supplement 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For the mass spec experiments; providing the levels of recovery relative to that seen for gephyrin on a mol/mol basis would aid data interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>Determining the stoichiometry between gephyrin and the different identified interactors would be interesting to calculate for discovering potential roles in postsynaptic apparatus scaffolding and function. For this to be accurate though, we would need additional information about the relative recovery of each type of protein in our preparation. This is because some proteins, for example membrane proteins (such as GABAA and glycine receptors), are expected to be less recovered compared to soluble cytosolic proteins. Indeed, from our dataset (Figure 5 Supplement 2), GABAA receptors are amongst the lower abundance interactors even thought they would be expected to have a higher stoichiometry ratio with gephyrin.</p><p>To determine protein complex stoichiometries, the most accurate methods hinge on absolute quantification of peptides from different proteins as in AQUA approaches, which are based on stable-isotope-labeled standards (Gerber SA, Rush J, Stemman O, Kirschner MW, Gygi SP (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100(12):6940–6945) or QconCAT (Beynon RJ, Doherty MK, Pratt JM, Gaskell SJ (2005) Nat Methods 2(8):587–589). We did not include such standards as this would have involved a significantly longer method development phase. However, we agree that label-free methods using normalized spectral counting (e.g. protein abundance index PAI, APEX) or signal intensity (e.g. top3) would also be an option to estimate relative protein amounts, but only an estimate at best. Spectral counting-based methods suffer from narrower dynamic range limits and under sampling, while intensity-based methods hinge on the reproducible identification of the same peptides across all samples, which is not always the case and may lead to incomplete quantification matrices.</p><p>Therefore, we suggest that it may be misleading to represent mol:mol relationships based on our dataset, though the identified interactors could be specifically interrogated for their stoichiometric relationship with gephyrin on an individual protein basis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A number of published studies have suggested that gephyrin interactions with GEPHS for CDC-42 and other small GTPase. Are these proteins recovered in the authors' purifications?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not detect CDC42 as a gephyrin interactor after applying thresholding. The Rho GTPase activating protein 32 (RGH32, gene name Arhgap32), the Rho GTPase activating protein 44 (RGH44, gene name Arhgap44), and ArfGAP with GTPase domain were detected in all DARPin-determined gephyrin interactomes. RGH32 protein was also previously identified as a gephyrin interactor using proximity ligation proteomics (DOI: 10.1126/science.aag0821).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. KCC2 isoforms are classified as &quot;Phospho-regulators&quot;, I believe they would be better classed as &quot;Ion channels and transporters&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>In this manuscript we used the protein names <italic>en lieu</italic> of gene name identifiers, though this could lead to confusion in some cases. KCC2A is the protein name for the kinase CaMKIIα (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P11798/entry). The Uniprot ID, gene names, and common names for all interactors are listed in the file “Figure 5 – Source Data 1”. As the KCC2 identifier is particularly confusing, we have added this clarification to the discussion where CaMKIIα is mentioned.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) In experiments aimed to localize or study gephyrin clusters one important requirement is that DARPins do not interfere with gephyrin physiological molecular interactions.

How can the Authors at this stage exclude that the use of DARPins delivered in vivo will be also limited similarly to FingRs?</p></disp-quote><p>We erred in our discussion of this point. Our statement stemmed from the potential issue of FingR expression using fluorescently-tagged FingRs’ transcriptional control system where nuclear accumulation of fluorescent signal could interfere with fluorescence-based detection of perisomatic gephyrin clusters. Of course, specifically relating this to FingRs was incorrect, as this issue would exist if DARPins were expressed in neurons using the same expression titration system as well. We have now corrected this in the discussion, and thank the reviewer for pointing out this error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In keeping with the previous point, FingRs can &quot;self regulate&quot; their expression in order to avoid excessive or aspecific binding. How can the expression of DARPins be regulated? Do the authors think that excessive DARPins expression could lead to artifactual staining?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not assess DARPins for this application in this manuscript, though we intend to explore the use of DARPins as in vivo tools in future studies. The similar genetic size of DARPins to FingRs allows them to be used in similar expression control systems. The stability of DARPins is expected to require their expression to be controlled through either a transcriptional feedback system, or inducible methods. Otherwise DARPins would be expected to accumulate intracellularly (which could interfere with protein homeostatic processes, as well as gephyrin function potentially).</p></body></sub-article></article>
