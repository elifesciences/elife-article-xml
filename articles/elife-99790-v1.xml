but the specific cytological mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we applied single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to characterize the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models. We investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on cell populations and molecular characteristics in pig muscles and found CLAs could promote the transformation of fast glycolytic myofibers into slow oxidative myofibers. We also observed three subpopulations including SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup>, FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup>, and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> subclusters in adipocytes and CLAs could increase the percentage of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. RNA velocity analysis showed FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> and PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. We further verified the differentiated trajectory of mature adipocytes and identified PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes could differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes by using high intramuscular fat (IMF) content Laiwu pig models. The cell-cell communication analysis identified the interaction network between adipocytes and other subclusters such as fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). Pseudotemporal trajectory analysis and RNA velocity analysis also showed FAPs could differentiate into PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> preadipocytes and we discovered the differentiated trajectory of preadipocytes into mature adipocytes. Besides, we found CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in vitro. This study provides a foundation for regulating fat infiltration in skeletal muscles by using nutritional strategies and provides potential opportunities to serve pig as an animal model to study human fat infiltrated diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-nucleus RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>conjugated linoleic acid</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>fibro/adipogenic progenitors</kwd><kwd>fat infiltration</kwd><kwd>pig</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32272887</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shan</surname><given-names>Tizhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LZ22C170003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shan</surname><given-names>Tizhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004835</institution-id><institution>Zhejiang University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Hundred Talents Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shan</surname><given-names>Tizhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The cytological mechanism of conjugated linoleic acids regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models via using single-nucleus transcriptomics.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meat is one of the most important sources of animal protein for humans, and its quality is associated with human health. Recently, due to the development of economic levels and the improvement of living standards, people are seeking for ‘less but better’ meat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sahlin and Trewern, 2022</xref>). Intramuscular fat (IMF) deposition is a key factor positively related to meat quality traits and lipo-nutritional values of meat, such as flavor, tenderness, and juiciness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hausman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yi et al., 2023</xref>). Besides, fat infiltration in skeletal muscle (also known as myosteatosis) is the pathologic fat accumulation in skeletal muscle with poor metabolic and musculoskeletal health; it always accompanied by the decline of muscle quality and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biltz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). Myosteatosis is now considered as a common feature of aging and is also related to some diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). However, the occurrence mechanism and cell sources of fat accumulation in skeletal muscle is very complicated. Recently, with the rapid development of multi-omics including single-cell RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>), single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>), and spatial transcriptomics (ST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2021</xref>), more and more cell types have been found to contribute to lipid deposition in skeletal muscle including myogenic cells, e.g., satellite cells (SCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asakura et al., 2001</xref>) and myogenic factor 5 (Myf5)<sup>+</sup> mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yin et al., 2013</xref>) and non-myogenic cells, e.g., fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uezumi et al., 2010</xref>), fibroblasts, myeloid-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2021</xref>), pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farrington-Rock et al., 2004</xref>), endothelial cells (ECs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lang et al., 2008</xref>), PW1<sup>+</sup>/Pax7<sup>-</sup> interstitial cells (PICs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mitchell et al., 2010</xref>), and side population cells (SPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tamaki et al., 2002</xref>) based on animal models. Hence, more and more researches have been focusing on exploring the regulatory mechanism of myosteatosis at the cytological levels. Besides, fat infiltration in skeletal muscle is regulated by many influential triggers, including aging, metabolic and nonmetabolic diseases, disuse and inactivity, and muscle injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). Many genes and signaling pathways participate in the formation and regulation of fat infiltration in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biferali et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wosczyna et al., 2021</xref>). However, the specific mechanism of nutrients regulates fat infiltration in muscle remains unknown.</p><p>Nutritional regulation strategy is one of the most vital strategies to regulate lipid accumulation in skeletal muscle based on some animal models and clinic trials, including vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilsanz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), conjugated linoleic acid (CLAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Vliet et al., 2020</xref>), linseed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), plant extract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">You et al., 2023</xref>), and so on. Hence, exploring the potential nutritional strategies to regulate fat accumulation in skeletal muscle is valuable for animal production and human health. Pigs are not only an important source of animal protein in the human diet but also serve as a valuable model for human medical biology due to their similar physiological structure in terms of size, metabolic characteristics, and cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groenen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lunney et al., 2021</xref>). Chinese local pig species could be used as excellent animal models to study the mechanism of lipid deposition due to the fact that they have better meat quality and high IMF content. A high IMF content always results in better juiciness, tenderness, and flavor of pork. There are different myogenesis potential in neonatal skeletal muscle between Laiwu pigs and Duroc pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). Our previous study has revealed the cell heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics of lipid deposition in skeletal muscle of Laiwu pigs and we found high IMF content Laiwu pigs had lower muscle fiber diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2023b</xref>). Heigai pig is a model of Chinese indigenous pig breeds, which has advantages including high farrowing rate, good pork quality, and strong disease resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>). Specially, we have found CLAs can improve meat quality, especially increase IMF content in both lean type pig breeds and fat type pig breeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). However, although many studies have discussed the effects of CLA on IMF deposition, there are still gaps in the cytological mechanism of CLAs in regulating lipid deposition in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Here, we present an snRNA-seq dataset collected from <italic>longissimus dorsi muscle</italic> (LDM) of Heigai pigs after feeding CLAs supplement to allow for analyzing heterogeneity of transcriptional states in muscles. We investigated the regulatory effects of CLAs on the muscle fiber-type transformation and IMF deposition. We also identified the differentiation trajectories of three subclusters in adipocytes based on Heigai pig models and high IMF content Laiwu pig models. Based on the pseudotemporal trajectories analysis, we found CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This study paves a way to regulate lipid accumulation in muscles by using nutritional strategies and provides theoretical basis on using pig as an animal model to study human muscle-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CLAs changed cell populations and transcriptional dynamics in LDM</title><p>Our previous study discovered CLAs improved IMF content in LDM of Heigai pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>), here, we also found CLAs significantly increased TG content but significantly decreased TC content in LDM of pigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Meanwhile, immunofluorescence staining results showed more lipid droplets in the LDM of the CLAs group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To investigate the changes in cell heterogeneity in pig muscles after CLAs treatment at the cellular level, we performed snRNA-seq from LDM tissue of Heigai pigs using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). First, after Cell Ranger analyses, the estimated number of cells, fraction of reads in cells, mean reads per cell, median genes per cell, and median UMI counts per cell in LDM were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>. We obtained 25,507 cells from two individual libraries, comprising 10,835 cells from CON group and 11,705 cells from CLA group for the downstream analysis after the quality control of snRNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on the Seurat package, we used Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) plots to show the different subclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We identified eight different clusters in two groups of pig muscles, including myofibers (<italic>CAPN3</italic>), FAPs/fibroblasts (<italic>PDGFRA</italic>), ECs (<italic>CD34</italic>), adipocytes (<italic>PPARG</italic>), immune cells (<italic>PTPRC</italic>), muscle SCs (MuSCs) (<italic>PAX7</italic>), myeloid-derived cells (<italic>MRC1</italic>), and pericytes (<italic>RGS5</italic>) using the expression of marker genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Next, the percentage of these cell types showed differences in different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Compared with the CON group, the FAPs/fibroblasts (3.39% vs 8.31%), ECs (1.26% <italic>vs</italic> 2.94%), adipocytes (1.74% vs 2.37%), myeloid-derived cells (0.93% vs 2.17%), and pericytes (0.45% vs 0.7%) had a higher proportion in the CLA group. However, CLA decreased the proportion of myofibers (90.46% vs 81.1%). The top 10 most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were shown in the heatmap and the bar plot showed the top 3 KEGG enrichment of DEGs between the eight different cell types in LDM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Besides, violin plots displayed CLAs upregulated the expression of mature adipocyte master genes including <italic>ADIPOQ</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>PLIN1</italic>, and <italic>LIPE</italic>, adipogenic marker genes including <italic>PPARG</italic>, <italic>PPARA</italic>, <italic>CEBPA</italic>, and <italic>CEBPB</italic>, and lipid metabolism-related genes including <italic>LPL</italic>, <italic>ELOVL4</italic>, <italic>ACAA2,</italic> and <italic>HACD2</italic> in pig muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>).

Furthermore, we observed that the protein levels of JNK phosphorylation were significantly decreased after CLA treatment during FAPs’ adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Hence, we next used JNK activator anisomycin to explore the regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Oil Red O staining result showed that after 24 hr 20 nM anisomycin treatment, the increased adipogenic differentiation of FAPs by CLA were significantly inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Also, CLA+anisomycin group had the lower OD 490 value compared with the CLA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>).

In animal production, CLAs could regulate meat quality in pigs and cattle, especially improve IMF content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). These studies pointed out that the CLAs play a vital role in regulating fat infiltration in skeletal muscle. However, to date, the cellular mechanism of CLAs that regulates lipid deposition has not been studied. Here, we utilized the 10x Genomics platform to identify the cell heterogeneity and transcriptional changes in muscles after CLAs treatment based on pig models. This study revealed the effects of CLAs on cell populations and molecular characteristics of muscles and highlighted the cytological mechanism of CLAs that regulates pork quality in skeletal muscle.</p><p>CLAs are commonly found in ruminant animals and dairy products; they are a class of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid with conjugated double bonds. CLAs not only have anticancer, antihypertension, anti-adipogenic, and antidiabetic effects, but also can improve muscle function and decrease body fat percentage. For example, adding 3.2 g/day CLAs significantly increased muscle mass in higher body fat percentage Chinese adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). After 0.9 g/day CLAs supplementation, body weight variation and muscle mass significantly increased and body fat percentage variation decreased in student athletes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Terasawa et al., 2017</xref>). LC-MS metabolomics results discovered CLAs changed 57 metabolites which enriched in lipids/lipid-like molecules in plasma of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">He et al., 2022</xref>). However, another study found that for sedentary older adults, CLAs had no significant influence on muscle anabolic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">van Vliet et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the specific influences of CLAs on skeletal muscle are still disputed and the function on lipid deposition in human skeletal muscle needs further investigation. In animal models, many studies have demonstrated the important effects of CLAs on regulating fat accumulation in skeletal muscles. In porcine models, our foregoing studies have discovered that adding CLAs into the pig diet could significantly increase IMF contents in LDM of lean pig breeds and Heigai pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>, found 2% dietary CLAs significantly increased IMF deposition and reduced subcutaneous fat deposition in cattle. However, in mouse model, 0.5% mixed isomer CLAs did not lead to lipid accumulation in muscle of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanosky et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, CLAs supplementation positively affect IMF deposition in muscles of pigs and ruminants but the effects of CLAs may have species-specific. In our study, we identified eight cell types in skeletal muscles of Heigai pigs, including myofibers, FAPs/fibroblasts, ECs, adipocytes, immune cells, MuSCs, myeloid-derived cells, and pericytes. Recently, a variety of single cell studies have been performed on mouse/human skeletal muscles and they also identified some cell populations such as myofibers, FAPs/fibroblasts, ECs, adipocytes, immune cells, MuSCs, myeloid-derived cells, tenocytes, SPs, and pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). We also found CLAs improved TG content and increased the percentage of adipocytes in LDM. Previous study demonstrated there are three subclusters in adipocytes and the formation and deposition of IMF mainly relied on DGAT2<sup>+</sup>/SCD<sup>+</sup> adipocytes and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2023b</xref>). Specially, we found CLAs enhanced the percentage of SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> subclusters. These indicated CLAs might improve IMF deposition through increasing SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup>subpopulations of adipocytes. Our findings could provide a foundation for using nutritional strategies to increase pork quality, especially IMF deposition. However, the specific function of CLAs on fat infiltration and deposition of skeletal muscle in people and rodents needs further study.</p><p>Skeletal muscle contains slow and fast muscle fibers and there are four major muscle fiber types in mice, including slow muscle fibers with type I muscle fibers (<italic>Myh7</italic>), fast muscle fibers with type IIA muscle fibers (<italic>Myh2</italic>), type IIX muscle fibers (<italic>Myh1</italic>), and type IIB muscle fibers (<italic>Myh4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dos Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>). In pigs, we illustrated three myofiber composition, including type I, type IIA, and type IIB in skeletal muscles by ST technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we identified six different subpopulations in myofibers, including I myofibers, IIA myofibers, IIX myofibers, IIB myofibers, MTJ, and NMJ. IIB myofibers had the highest percentage in pig muscles. MTJ are known to exhibit structural specialization; NMJ are responsible for formation and maintenance of the synaptic apparatus, and previous studies have identified these cell populations in murine skeletal muscles by using snRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dos Santos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Petrany et al., 2020</xref>). We also identified MTJ and NMJ cell populations in LDM of Laiwu pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2023b</xref>). These results indicate that MTJ and NMJ cell populations also exist in porcine skeletal muscles. In our previous study, we also found the percentage of type IIa myofibers had an increased tendency and type IIb myofibers had a decreased tendency in high IMF content Laiwu pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2023b</xref>). These results suggest that IMF content is closely related to muscle fiber type. Besides, slow muscle fibers, always called slow-twitch oxidative muscle fibers like I myofibers, have higher activities in mitochondrial oxidative metabolic enzymes and myoglobin while fast muscle fibers, always called fast-twitch glycolytic muscle fibers like II myofibers, have higher levels of glycolytic enzymes and glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schiaffino and Reggiani, 2011</xref>). Similarly, we also found I myofibers enriched in metabolic pathways, oxidative phosphorylation, and thermogenesis. In recent years, studies have focused on exploring the influences of CLAs on regulating muscle fiber type. In commercial pigs, the MyHC I mRNA abundance were improved in LDM of the CLAs group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Men et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, t10, c12-CLAs, but not c9, t11-CLAs can increase oxidative skeletal muscle fiber type in gastrocnemius muscle and C2C12 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duan et al., 2021</xref>). CLAs have been found to prevent sarcopenia by maintaining redox balance during aging, actively regulating mitochondrial adaptation, improving muscle metabolism, and inducing hypertrophy of type IIX myofibers after endurance exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Also, we discovered CLAs enhanced the percentage of I and IIA myofibers but reduced the percentage of IIB myofibers. Previous study has found PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC1α) serves a valuable role in skeletal muscle metabolism and is a master regulator of oxidative phosphorylation genes and could regulate muscle fiber-type transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Handschin and Spiegelman, 2011</xref>). In our study, the PGC1α expression was also increased after CLA treatment in myofiber. These results suggested CLAs can promote glycolytic skeletal muscle fiber types switching into oxidative skeletal muscle fiber types through upregulating PGC1α expression.</p><p>Numerous studies have discovered the cell sources of IMF cells and found several cell subsets lead to ectopic IMF formation and deposition, including SCs, Myf5<sup>+</sup> MSCs, FAPs, ECs, pericytes, fibroblasts, myeloid-derived cells, SPs, and PICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sciorati et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we found CLAs increased the percentage of preadipocytes such as FAPs, ECs, myeloid-derived cells, and pericytes. Importantly, FAPs are the major source of IMF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Uezumi et al., 2010</xref>) and our previous study also verified the adipogenic capacity of FAPs in 2D and 3D culture models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2023b</xref>). Xu et al. found that FAPs serve as a cellular interaction hub in skeletal muscle of pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2023</xref>). We used pseudotemporal trajectory and RNA velocity analysis combined with in vitro study to investigate that FAPs could first differentiate into PDE4D<sup>+</sup>/PDE7B<sup>+</sup> adipocytes and then differentiate into DGAT2<sup>+</sup>/ SCD<sup>+</sup> and FABP5<sup>+</sup>/SIAH1<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. However, the regulatory mechanism of FAPs’ directional differentiation still needs to be further explored. In vitro studies demonstrated trans-10, cis-12 CLAs inhibited skeletal muscle differentiation in C2C12 cells and inhibited 3T3-L1 adipocyte adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hommelberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yeganeh et al., 2016</xref>). However, the influences of CLAs on regulating the adipogenic differentiation of FAPs remain unclear. In this study, we found CLAs facilitated FAPs differentiating into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes. Previous studies have found mice orally treated with CLAs mixture upregulated <italic>Scd1</italic> expression in muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Parra et al., 2012</xref>). Besides, SCD1 expression is modulated by mTOR signaling pathway in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, MAPK signaling pathways were enriched in adipogenic differentiation of FAPs after CLAs treatment. Previous studies have discovered JNK had negative effects on regulating the adipogenic differentiation of human MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jang et al., 2015</xref>) and FAPs could prevent skeletal muscle regeneration after muscle injury by ST2/JNK signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamakawa et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, based on JNK signing pathway activator treatment and in vitro experiment, we found CLAs may promote FAPs’ directed differentiation into SCD<sup>+</sup>/DGAT2<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting JNK signaling pathway. These results may provide new targets for treating human fat infiltrated diseases by nutritional strategies. However, we did not further explore the mechanistic action, and the downstream transcriptional regulators need to be discussed.</p><p>In a word, we provide detailed insights into the cytological mechanism of CLAs regulates fat infiltration in skeletal muscles based on pig models via using snRNA-seq. We analyzed the effects of CLAs on the cell heterogeneity and transcriptional dynamics in pig muscles and discovered CLAs could promote glycolytic muscle fiber types switching into oxidative muscle fiber types through regulating PGC1α. We also identified the differentiation trajectories of adipocytes and FAPs. Our data also demonstrated CLAs could promote FAPs differentiate into DGAT2<sup>+</sup>/SCD<sup>+</sup> adipocytes via inhibiting JNK signaling pathway. This study provides a new way of developing nutritional strategies to combat myosteatosis and other muscle-related diseases and also offers potential opportunities to promote the utilization of pigs as animal models to study human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and samples</title><p>The Zhejiang University’s Animal Care and Use Committee approved all procedures and housing (ZJU20170466). 56 Heigai pigs (average body weight: 85.58±10.39kg) were divided randomly into CON group (added 1% soybean oil) and CLA group (added 1% CLAs) for 40days (5days pre-feeding period and 35days formal test period).

The authors identify changes in myofiber type and adipocyte subpopulations induced by linoleic acid at depth previously unobserved. The authors show that linoleic acid supplementation decreased the total myofiber count, specifically reducing type II muscle fiber types (IIB), myotendinous junctions, and neuromuscular junctions, whereas type I muscle fibers are increased. Moreover, the authors identify changes in adipocyte pools, specifically in a population marked by SCD1/DGAT2. To validate the skeletal muscle remodeling in response to linoleic acid supplementation, the authors compare transcriptomics data from Laiwu pigs, a model of high intramuscular fat, to Heigai pigs. The results verify changes in adipocyte subpopulations when pigs have higher intramuscular fat, either genetically or diet-induced. Targeted examination using cell-cell communication network analysis revealed associations with high intramuscular fat with fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). The authors then conclude that conjugated linoleic acid induces FAPs towards adipogenic commitment. Specifically, they show that linoleic acid stimulates FAPs to become SCD1/DGAT2+ adipocytes via JNK signaling. The authors conclude that their findings demonstrate the effects of conjugated linoleic acid on skeletal muscle fat formation in pigs, which could serve as a model for studying human skeletal muscle diseases.</p><p>[Editors' note: the authors have responded to the previous rounds of review: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.99790.1.sa1">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.99790.1.sa1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.99790.2.sa1">https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.99790.2.sa1</ext-link>]</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99790.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Liyi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shiqi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yizhen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Yanbing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shan</surname><given-names>Tizhong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Zhejiang University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors aim to elucidate the cytological mechanisms by which conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) influence intramuscular fat deposition and muscle fiber transformation in pig models. They have utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to explore the effects of CLA supplementation on cell populations, muscle fiber types, and adipocyte differentiation pathways in pig skeletal muscles. Notably, the authors have made significant efforts in addressing the previous concerns raised by the reviewers, clarifying key aspects of their methodology and data analysis.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Thorough validation of key findings: The authors have addressed the need for further validation by including qPCR, immunofluorescence staining, and western blotting to verify changes in muscle fiber types and adipocyte populations, which strengthens their conclusions.</p><p>(2) Improved figure presentation: The authors have enhanced figure quality, particularly for the Oil Red O and Nile Red staining images, which now better depict the organization of lipid droplets (Figure 7A). Statistical significance markers have also been clarified (Figure 7I and 7K).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Cross-species analysis and generalizability of the results: Although the authors could not perform a comparative analysis across species due to data limitations, they acknowledged this gap and focused on analyzing regulatory mechanisms specific to pigs. Their explanation is reasonable given the current availability of snRNA-seq datasets on muscle fat deposition in other human and mouse.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Mechanistic depth in JNK signaling pathway: While the inclusion of additional experiments is a positive step, the exploration of the JNK signaling pathway could still benefit from deeper analysis of downstream transcriptional regulators. The current discussion acknowledges this limitation, but future studies should aim to address this gap fully.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks! As we discussed in discussion part, further studies should focus on the downstream transcriptional regulators of JNK signaling pathway on IMF deposition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Limited exploration of other muscle groups: The authors did not expand their analysis to additional muscle groups, leaving some uncertainty regarding whether other muscle groups might respond differently to CLA supplementation. Further studies in this direction could enhance the understanding of muscle fiber dynamics across the organism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion! In this study, we mainly focused on the adipocytes, muscles and FAPs subpopulations, which play important roles in lipid deposition. As you suggested, our further study will focus on other subpopulations such as endothelial cells and immune cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study comprehensively presents data from single nuclei sequencing of Heigai pig skeletal muscle in response to conjugated linoleic acid supplementation. The authors identify changes in myofiber type and adipocyte subpopulations induced by linoleic acid at depth previously unobserved. The authors show that linoleic acid supplementation decreased the total myofiber count, specifically reducing type II muscle fiber types (IIB), myotendinous junctions, and neuromuscular junctions, whereas type I muscle fibers are increased. Moreover, the authors identify changes in adipocyte pools, specifically in a population marked by SCD1/DGAT2. To validate the skeletal muscle remodeling in response to linoleic acid supplementation, the authors compare transcriptomics data from Laiwu pigs, a model of high intramuscular fat, to Heigai pigs. The results verify changes in adipocyte subpopulations when pigs have higher intramuscular fat, either genetically or diet-induced. Targeted examination using cell-cell communication network analysis revealed associations with high intramuscular fat with fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs). The authors then conclude that conjugated linoleic acid induces FAPs towards adipogenic commitment. Specifically, they show that linoleic acid stimulates FAPs to become SCD1/DGAT2+ adipocytes via JNK signaling. The authors conclude that their findings demonstrate the effects of conjugated linoleic acid on skeletal muscle fat formation in pigs, which could serve as a model for studying human skeletal muscle diseases.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The comprehensive data analysis provides information on conjugated linoleic acid effects on pig skeletal muscle and organ function. The notion that linoleic acid induces skeletal muscle composition and fat accumulation is considered a strength and demonstrates the effect of dietary interactions on organ remodeling. This could have implications for the pig farming industry to promote muscle marbling. Additionally, these data may inform the remodeling of human skeletal muscle under dietary behaviors, such as elimination and supplementation diets and chronic overnutrition of nutrient-poor diets. However, the biggest strength resides in thorough data collection at the single nuclei level, which was extrapolated to other types of Chinese pigs.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors compiled a substantial and comprehensive dataset, the scope of cellular and molecular-level validation still needs to be expanded. For instance, the single nuclei data suggest changes in myofiber type after linoleic acid supplementation, but these findings need more thorough validation. Further histological and physiological assessments are necessary to address fiber types and oxidative potential. Similarly, the authors propose that linoleic acid alters adipocyte populations, FAPs, and preadipocytes; however, there are limited cellular and molecular analyses to confirm these findings. The identified JNK signaling pathways require additional follow-ups on the molecular mechanism or transcriptional regulation. However, these issues are discussed as potential areas for future exploration. While various individual studies have been conducted on mouse/human skeletal muscle and adipose tissues, these have only been briefly discussed, and further investigation is warranted. Additionally, the authors incorporate two pig models into their results, but they only examine one muscle group. Exploring whether other muscle groups respond similarly or differently to linoleic acid supplementation would be valuable. Furthermore, the authors should discuss how their results translate to human and pig nutrition, such as the desirability and cost-effectiveness for pig farmers and human diets high in linoleic acid. Notably, while the single nuclei data is comprehensive, there needs to be a statement on data deposition and code availability, allowing others access to these datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your suggestion!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have discussed and provided some experimental evidence to address the related issues to help justify their conclusions. The reviewer believes that authors should deposit their single-cell sequencing data and code for the broader research community.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!
