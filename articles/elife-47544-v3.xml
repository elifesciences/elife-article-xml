EVs have been implicated in promoting tumor metastasis, but the molecular composition of tumor-derived EV sub-types and the mechanisms by which molecules are sorted into EVs remain mostly unknown. We report the separation of two small EV sub-populations from a metastatic breast cancer cell line, with biochemical features consistent with different sub-cellular origins. These EV sub-types use different mechanisms of miRNA sorting (selective and non-selective), suggesting that sorting occurs via fundamentally distinct processes, possibly dependent on EV origin. Using biochemical and genetic tools, we identified the Lupus La protein as mediating sorting of selectively packaged miRNAs. We found that two motifs embedded in miR-122 are responsible for high-affinity binding to Lupus La and sorting into vesicles formed in a cell-free reaction. Thus, tumor cells can simultaneously deploy multiple EV species using distinct sorting mechanisms that may enable diverse functions in normal and cancer biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular vesicles</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>Lupus La</kwd><kwd>multivesicular bodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM37949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambowitz</surname><given-names>Alan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical fractionation of vesicle sub-populations and in vitro reconstitution studies reveal that Lupus La protein mediates the selective sorting of miR-122 into extracellular vesicles in vitro and in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous compartments that consist of a lipid bilayer with a unique set of transmembrane proteins enclosing soluble contents that include nucleic acids and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>). EVs are found in biofluids as well as in conditioned media of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pisitkun et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caby et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Admyre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vella et al., 2007</xref>). Cells release an array of EV sub-populations, which can be broadly classified into two categories: exosomes and shedding vesicles, distinguished by the cell membrane of origin. Exosomes are 30–150 nm vesicles that originate in the endocytic pathway. Their secretion to the extracellular space occurs upon multivesicular body (MVB) fusion with the plasma membrane resulting in the release of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) to the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harding et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan et al., 1985</xref>). Shedding vesicles, or microvesicles, refer to a more heterogeneous group of EVs, with sizes ranging from 30 to 1,000 nm, which originate by budding directly from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cocucci et al., 2009</xref>). Shedding vesicles and exosomes are also termed as large and small EVs respectively. Their isolation is generally achieved by differential ultracentrifugation. Evidence, however, that multiple EV species are being co-isolated as small EVs (sEVs) has arisen, proving that the sEV fraction represents a crude mix of different EV species. Studies further purifying different sEVs sub-populations have shown that they carry different protein signatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kowal et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, distinct sEV sub-populations have been implicated in mediating various physiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Willms et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the current knowledge of sEV heterogeneity, most current methods used to isolate sEVs do not distinguish between sEV sub-populations, nor do they separate sEVs from protein and RNA-protein complexes (RNPs) that are not EV encapsulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). New methods to facilitate the purification of sEV sub-populations are needed in order to evaluate the physiological role and mechanism of macromolecular sorting into each species.</p><p>The lipid membrane of EVs confers protection to its soluble contents against extracellular hydrolases, thus increasing their stability in the extracellular space. The EV soluble content consists of a variety of proteins as well as small RNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013</xref>). Among the EV resident transcripts, miRNAs have garnered special attention. MiRNAs are ~22 nucleotide transcripts that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel, 2004</xref>). Although the functional importance of EV-miRNAs, specially sEV-miRNAs, as signaling molecules has received some support, including in immunologic response and metastatic tumor cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montecalvo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pegtel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tominaga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>), the molecular mechanisms and regulation of sorting miRNAs into sEVs remain poorly understood. Both, non-selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tosar et al., 2015</xref>) and selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>) mechanisms of miRNA sorting into EVs have been described. One study using two breast epithelial cell lines found that non-selective miRNA sorting occurs in large EVs, referred to as ‘large-exosomes’, whereas a selective mechanism of sorting occurs in sEVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tosar et al., 2015</xref>). The sEV fraction however was not further purified into sEV sub-populations. Therefore the conclusion that selective sorting occurs in the sEV fraction could have been the result of only one or few sEV sub-populations skewing the results.</p><p>Cancer cells produce more EVs than their non-transformed counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Szczepanski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rodríguez et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, EVs have been the focus of attention in the context of cancer biology. Several studies have implicated EVs in cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peinado et al., 2017</xref>). EVs, especially sEVs, have been proposed to increase the metastatic potential of cancer cells and to prepare the pre-metastatic niche prior to tumor cell arrival. Importantly, some studies suggest these effects are due to exosomal-mediated miRNA transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tominaga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). However, due to the heterogeneity of sEVs and the procedures used to isolate them, it is unclear which vesicle subtypes may mediate these processes.</p><p>To gain knowledge of the molecular mechanisms behind miRNA sorting into distinct sEV sub-populations, we used as a model the highly invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. We used buoyant density gradient centrifugation to resolve two distinct sEV sub-populations and found they contain different subsets and levels of enrichment of various miRNAs. With the aid of a cell-free reaction that recapitulates the sorting of miRNAs into vesicles formed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>), we found that the Lupus La protein (La protein) is required for the selective sorting of miRNAs found in the high buoyant density sEV species, a conclusion that was confirmed in cells repressed for the expression of the La protein. At least two La-dependent miRNAs were previously reported to be selectively sorted into sEVs to promote cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickman et al., 2017</xref>). Further, using the cell-free reaction, we identified two La-binding motifs that are required for the selective sorting of miR-122 in vitro. Overall, our use of biochemical fractionation and in vitro reconstitution enabled us to identify La as another one of the RNA-binding proteins required for the selective packaging of some miRNAs into sEVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two biochemically distinct small extracellular vesicle sub-populations are released by MDA-MB-231 cells</title><p>To examine the miRNA content of sEVs released by the metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, we first sought to separate sEVs from contaminating RNA and protein species that co-sediment during common EV isolation procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). To achieve this goal, we developed an EV purification strategy involving differential ultracentrifugation followed by buoyant density flotation on a linear iodixanol gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach allowed the resolution of two distinct sEV species, termed the vesicular low density (vLD) and vesicular high density (vHD) sub-populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Both sEV sub-populations fractionated away from non-vesicular RNPs, as shown by the presence of Ago2 and Dicer in the denser areas of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This result is in accordance with previous studies finding the presence of Ago2 in the crude 100,000 g pellet, but not associated with vesicular fractions when more stringent methods of purification were applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Van Deun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jeppesen et al., 2019</xref>).

Our results are in accordance with a previous study showing that the secretion of CD63-positive, but not of CD9-positive vesicles, is Rab27a dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bobrie et al., 2012</xref>). However, despite the dramatic reduction of secretion of CD63 positive vesicles under the Rab27a KO background, there was only a subtle reduction for the vHD enriched marker flotillin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). This suggests that the vHD vesicle fraction may comprise at least two different types of sEV sub-populations, with at least one of them having its origin in the endocytic pathway. This possibility is consistent with our previous demonstration that sEVs secreted by HEK293T cells contain a population of vesicles that bind to immobilized CD63 antibody and a fraction containing flotillin-2 that does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The Rab35 protein has also been implicated in mediating exosomal secretion in oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsu et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we created a Rab35 knock out cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). When sEVs derived from the Rab35 KO background were probed for CD63 and CD9 signals, no apparent difference was observed in comparison to EVs derived from WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Thus, Rab27a but not Rab35, is involved in the secretion of CD63-positive vesicles derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our data are most consistent with vHD vesicles having at least one type of vesicle originating in the endocytic pathway, whereas vLD vesicles may bud directly from the plasma membrane.</p><p>We next probed the small RNA content of the separated vesicle fractions. An initial qualitative assessment of RNA profiles using a Bioanalyzer showed that both vLD and vHD sub-populations share a predominant peak at ~70 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>), which later proved to correspond to tRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2d</xref>). However, there was an apparent enrichment of transcripts smaller than 70 nucleotides in the vHD sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>) that we hypothesized represented miRNAs. As such, we considered the possibility that the distinct sEV sub-populations might differ in their miRNA content.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Distinct molecular mechanisms of miRNA sorting govern the discrete small extracellular vesicle sub-populations</title><p>To further analyze the miRNA content of the vHD and vLD vesicles, we used two orthogonal approaches: targeted miRNA profiling and an unbiased sequencing approach. Using the commercially available Firefly particle technology, Discovery Panel (Abcam), we compared the abundance of 408 miRNAs in the vLD and vHD sEV sub-populations. Out of the ~400 tested miRNAs, 312 showed a detectable signal in the vHD sub-population and 217 were detected in the vLD counterpart. We found 21 miRNAs present in the vHD vesicles that were enriched at least 10-fold in comparison to their intracellular levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). In contrast, only two miRNAs detected in the vLD sub-population showed over a 10-fold change relative to cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Both of the apparent vLD-enriched miRNAs were also present as highly enriched in the vHD sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Their enrichment in the vLD sub-population was much lower than in the vHD sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting their detection in the vLD subpopulation may have been the result of small amounts of vHD vesicles co-fractionating with the vLD vesicles during flotation.

The TGIRT enzyme is a thermostable, highly processive reverse transcriptase with a proficient template-switching activity used for RNA-seq adapter addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>). This enzyme’s properties allowed us to generate comprehensive cDNA libraries that included highly structured and modified transcripts. Also due to its properties, TGIRT allows the generation of cDNA libraries from low input material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>). The data obtained from TGIRT-seq was normalized to total number of small non-coding RNA reads per sample. As previously described for EVs using TGIRT-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>), we found that miRNAs represented a relatively low proportion of total reads (3.4% and 1% of the mapped reads for vHD and vLD, respectively), resulting in detection of fewer miRNAs by TGIRT-seq than by Firefly profiling. Nevertheless, TGIRT-seq recapitulated the general trends observed by Firefly: multiple miRNAs enriched by at least 10-fold in the vHD sample compared to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>) and fewer enriched miRNAs in the vLD sample compared to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Out of the four apparent vLD enriched miRNA detected by TGIRT-seq, three were also detected as highly enriched in the vHD sub-population, suggesting again that their presence was a result of carryover material overlapping the buoyant density gradient fractions. The total number of uniquely detected vHD miRNAs by TGIRT-seq (detectable in the vHD sample, but absent in the intracellular lysate) was 21. Comparatively, only five miRNAs were uniquely found in the vLD sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>), we found that the most abundant small non-coding transcripts in EVs are tRNAs (representing 88.6% of vHD and 96.3% of vLD transcripts – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2d</xref>). We found that most of the tRNA reads in both sEV sub-populations start at approximately position 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2e</xref>), which may represent a reverse transcription stop at the same unidentified EV-enriched D-loop modification described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, both sEV sub-populations share a modified tRNA version as their most abundant small non-coding transcript.</p><p>We next validated the top sEV-enriched/unique miRNAs per vesicle sub-population using RT-qPCR. Relative levels for each sEV sub-population were compared to intracellular levels. We found that all of our top vHD candidates were validated by this method. As expected, the tested vHD miRNAs were highly enriched in the vHD sEV sample relative to the intracellular levels. The vHD/intracellular lysate ratio ranged from ~50-fold to ~1,000-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, none of our top vLD miRNA candidates were validated as being highly enriched in comparison to their intracellular levels. The vLD/intracellular lysate ratio ranged from ~0.5-fold to ~5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We then compared relative levels for each EV sub-population to each other in order to test for miRNA vesicle specificity. vHD-enriched miRNAs were highly depleted in the vLD vesicles, as seen by &gt;10-fold increase in their vHD/vLD ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, the tested vLD miRNAs had roughly the same abundance or were depleted in comparison to their relative levels in vHD vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). This proved to be true not only for the few miRNAs tested by RT-qPCR, but was also a general trend for multiple miRNAs detected by Firefly profiling, which demonstrated that many miRNAs were more abundant in the vHD vesicles than in their vLD counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). All of this together suggested that a selective mechanism of miRNA sorting occurs in the vHD sub-population with much less or no miRNA selective sorting in the vLD pool.</p><p>Highly enriched (&gt;50-fold change vHD/cellular lysate) and specific (&gt;20-fold change vHD/vLD) vHD miRNAs were then tested to confirm that they were bona fide EV residents, and not simply EV-associated. The high-speed pellet fraction was exposed to ribonuclease in the absence or presence of non-ionic detergent. All of the highly enriched, specific vHD miRNAs tested proved to be EV encapsulated: they were resistant to RNase in the absence but not the presence of detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that a selective miRNA sorting mechanism into sEVs occurs in the biogenesis of the vHD sub-population but less so or not at all in the vLD sub-population. Thus, we identified two distinct sEV sub-populations that are released by MDA-MB-231 cells that utilize fundamentally different miRNA sorting mechanisms (selective vs non-selective).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Selective miR-122 sorting into vesicles is recapitulated in vitro</title><p>We selected miR-122 for further biochemical analysis as it has been shown that circulating miR-122 can serve as a prognostic biomarker for metastasis in patients with breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2012</xref>) and very specifically that MDA-MB-231 cell-derived exosomal miR-122 may promote metastasis by reprogramming glucose metabolism in the premetastatic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>). Because miR-122 is present in the fetal bovine serum (FBS) used to culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wei et al., 2016</xref>), we employed clarified FBS depleted of sedimentable particles to confirm that miR-122 was released by MDA-MB-231 cells. We observed an accumulation of miR-122 over time in conditioned media exposed to MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas the level of miR-122 slightly decreased over time when conditioned media was incubated in the absence of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This suggested that newly synthesized MDA-MB-231 cell-derived miR-122 was secreted into the extracellular space. Moreover, when the levels of miR-122 were tested across the iodixanol linear gradient, we observed co-fractionation of miR-122 with the vHD fraction, substantially separated from RNP particles at the bottom of the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4a,b and c</xref>). Thus confirming our previous observation that miR-122 is a vHD specific transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>).</p><p>To explore the mechanism(s) by which miR-122 is selectively sorted into the MDA-MB-231 vHD sEV sub-population, we first sought to recapitulate miR-122 packaging in vitro. An assay for the cell-free packaging of a miRNA into putative exosomal vesicles was previously developed in our laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>). The reaction includes sedimented membranes and clarified cytosol, obtained from mechanically ruptured HEK293T cells, along with synthetic miRNA and ATP. After an incubation of 20 min at 30°C, RNA incorporated into vesicles was monitored by protection against degradation by exogenous RNase. Protected RNA was then extracted and quantified by RT-qPCR. The outcome of the reaction is represented as the percentage of initial input miRNA that has become protected over the incubation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). Using a modified version of our previously published reaction, we found that maximum protection of miR-122 in lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells required membranes, cytosol and incubation at a physiological temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), as was previously observed for miR-223 in lysates of HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>).

Using membranes and cytosol from WT and <italic>ybx1</italic> null HEK293T cells, we repeated the demonstration that miR-223 packaging was YBX1-dependent, but found that miR-122 was packaged nearly normally in lysates devoid of YBX1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).</p><p>Several RBPs have been implicated in miRNA sorting into sEVs from different cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>). As such, in order to study the RBP(s) that might mediate miR-122 packaging in MDA-MB-231 cells, we performed an in vitro packaging reaction employing a 3’-biotinylated form of miR-122 to allow the capture of the miRNA and any bound proteins. Briefly, following in vitro packaging, reactions were treated with RNase, the RNase activity was quenched and the membranes solubilized with Triton X-100. Once the luminal content was released, biotinylated miR-122, along with its protein interactors, was captured with streptavidin beads. Proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer, extracted from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the eluted fraction used for mass spectrometry. The proteins detected by mass spectrometry were curated for RBPs, except that any ribosomal proteins were excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). We decided to focus on the top three candidates, nucleolin (NCL), Lupus La (La) and nucleophosmin (NPM1).

Both, Ago2 and Dicer were present in the high-speed pellet, but not as buoyant species, suggesting they are associated with co-purifying RNP complexes that are not vesicle-associated.

CRISPRi promotes gene silencing by repressing transcription of the target gene. Importantly, unlike siRNA or shRNA, CRISPRi silences genes independently of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Because the RISC machinery binds to miRNAs and is responsible for miRNA-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartel, 2004</xref>), we avoided any artificial overload of the RISC machinery that might result in unpredictable effects on the miRNA sorting in our system.</p><p>Using CRISPRi, we prepared cytosols from MDA-MB-231 cells depleted of nucleophosmin and La that were then used in the in vitro packaging reactions. Both nucleophosmin and La were efficiently knocked down using this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). However, nucleolin knock-down resulted in apparent cellular arrest with subsequent cell death. Thus, nucleolin functional analysis was not possible by knock-down. Nucleophosmin-depleted cytosol produced a mild packaging phenotype only at reduced cytosol concentrations (3 mg/ml) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). In contrast, La-depleted cytosol showed severely reduced miR-122 packaging efficiency at cytosolic concentrations of 3 and 6 mg/ml in the cell-free reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>).

La has also been indirectly implicated in the exosomal secretion of a small Epstein-Barr viral RNA, EBV-EBER1.

However, addition of La alone with or without membranes and no cytosol resulted in only background protection of miR-122 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that additional cytosolic proteins are necessary for in vitro vesicle biogenesis and/or miRNA sorting process.

An immunoblot was used to test the relative amount of La co-isolated with biotinylated miR-122 in conditions that sustain or fail to result in miR-122 packaging. We observed maximal La recovery in incubations conducted with cytosol and membranes at 30°C but much less so at 4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

WT and La-depleted cells had approximately the same number of purified sEVs as quantified using a Nanosight particle tracking instrument. A significant reduction in secretion of miR-122 with no change in miR-320a was accompanied by intracellular accumulation of miR-122 in the La-depleted background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Thus, La plays a role in the selective sorting of miR-122 into sEVs, without affecting sEV biogenesis. We then tested whether La plays a broader role in the selective sorting of vHD miRNAs. We tested the secretion of validated vHD miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) that proved to reside inside vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>) and the secretion of non-selectively sorted miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) under La depletion vs WT conditions. All the selectively sorted miRNAs tested showed some dependence on La for their secretion, as seen by at least a 50% reduction of their secretion into sEVs in comparison to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). By contrast, all of the non-selectively sorted miRNAs tested showed little to no change under La depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Thus La may play a broader role in mediating the secretion of selectively sorted miRNAs into vHD sEVs.</p><p>To test for the presence of La in sEVs isolated from cultured MDA-MB-231cells, we first purified vesicles by buoyant density flotation. The high-speed pellet was subjected to flotation in a step sucrose gradient. Buoyant membranes were permeabilized with non-ionic detergent and soluble proteins were precipitated/concentrated with acetone in order to facilitate detection by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). We successfully detected the presence of La in the buoyant sample. Its detection was improved upon acetone precipitation/concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Moreover, when we analyzed the La distribution across the iodixanol linear gradient (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), we observed La co-fractionating with the vHD sub-population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus confirming the observation that La is required for the selective sorting of vHD miRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Interestingly, nucleolin, one of the other RBP candidates that pulled-down with biotinylated miR-122 in the in vitro packaging reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>) was also detected in the vHD fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Nucleolin may also be involved in RNA secretion of vHD transcripts.</p><p>In order to confirm that La was a soluble protein residing inside sEVs, and not simply vesicle-associated, we performed proteinase K protection assays on crude high-speed pellet material. The high-speed pellet fraction from conditioned medium was exposed to proteinase K in the presence or absence of detergent and the exposure of La was assessed by immunoblot. The La protein was resistant to proteinase K digestion and rendered sensitive upon membrane permeabilization with non-ionic detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). Flotillin-2, a membrane protein associated with the inner leaflet of the EV, served as a positive control and was degraded only in the presence of detergent. In contrast, Dicer, previously shown to be present in the high-speed pellet but not as an EV-encapsulated RNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), was susceptible to degradation independent of the addition of non-ionic detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>).

Thus, miRNAs released from P bodies and freed from RISC may be proximal to endosomes engaged in the production of vHD vesicles and distant from the site of vLD vesicle biogenesis, thus resulting in a slight enrichment and slight depletion of these miRNAs in the vHD and vLD vesicles, respectively.</p><p>We focused the bulk of our investigation on a set of miRNAs selectively packaged in the vHD sub-population. These selectively sorted miRNAs may belong to the pool of pre-existing RISC-free miRNAs, or may be displaced from RISC prior to or concomitant with sorting into vHD vesicles. Importantly, we found that this mechanism of selective miRNA sorting is specific for the vHD sub-population. We speculate that the sorting machinery required to enrich certain miRNAs in exosomes is specific for MVBs, and it is absent at the site of origin of the vLD vesicles. However, enveloped viruses that bud from the cell surface clearly do sort their RNA genomes in a selective manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Souza and Summers, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Swanson and Malim, 2006</xref>) and the same may be true of other RNA biotypes in the vLD sub-population, especially in other cell lines. We previously showed that tRNAs with an unknown post-transcriptional modification in the D-loop are highly enriched in sEVs in comparison to the cells from the same culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, we detected apparently similarly modified tRNA species in both sEV sub-populations secreted from MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2e</xref>). The machinery for the active sorting of the modified tRNA may be shared for both sEV sub-populations.</p><p>It is widely suggested that sEV miRNAs play a role in intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tominaga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, purifying sEV sub-populations, with differential miRNA content, is critical in order to accurately assess their role in intercellular communication. One study purified different sEVs based on their buoyant densities and showed that the vLD sub-population triggered the differential expression of 257 genes in recipient cells, whereas the vHD sub-population caused the differential expression of 1116 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Willms et al., 2016</xref>). Although this study did not determine if any gene expression differences were the result of miRNA transfer, the effect could be partially explained by the distinct miRNA composition of the two sEV sub-populations. Further studies using purified sEV sub-populations are needed to understand the physiological consequence of selective vs. non-selective sorting mechanisms. Additionally, it needs to be determined if the effects are directly attributable to miRNAs or some other constituents of the two sEV populations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of La in selective sorting of miRNAs</title><p>Here we show in vitro and in vivo evidence for the requirement of La for packaging of miR-122 and other selectively sorted miRNAs into vHD sEVs derived from MDA-MB-231 cells. The La protein is an abundant RBP that is upregulated in some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sommer et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Trotta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Ejeh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sommer et al., 2011a</xref>). Its presence in the cytoplasm has been linked to the translational regulation of mRNAs bearing IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petz et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Petz et al., 2012b</xref>), as well as 5’TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Intine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardinali et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crosio, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, it was previously reported that 5’TOP mRNAs are enriched in sEVs derived from HEK293T cells in comparison to their relative cellular levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>), although we have not yet evaluated the abundance of 5’TOP mRNAs in sEVs isolated from MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p>Little is known about how cytoplasmic RNA binding proteins, such as La, along with bound RNA molecules are targeted and recognized for secretion. The phosphorylation status of La has been suggested to be important for its intracellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Intine et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, sumoylation of La has been shown to be important for La-dependent mRNA transport in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Niekerk et al., 2007</xref>) and sumoylation of another RNA-binding protein in sEVs (hnRNPA2B1) has been shown to be important for export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and sumoylation may serve to direct RNPs to the ESCRT machinery and thus into membrane buds that are internalized into MVBs.</p><p>The La protein binds to and stabilizes poly-uridine stretches of PolIII transcripts that mature in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wolin and Cedervall, 2002</xref>). Likewise in the cytoplasm, La may serve a similar function in the stabilization of polyuridine tracks in 5’TOP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Intine et al., 2003</xref>). Here we show that La directly binds to, and promotes the membrane enclosure of miR-122 in a cell-free reaction. We obtained evidence that a 3’ polyuridine sequence of miR-122 is required for this interaction. This role of La may extend to miRNAs secreted by other cell lines. B cell-derived sEVs are enriched for 3’ uridylylated miRNA isoforms in comparison to their intracellular counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koppers-Lalic et al., 2014</xref>), and La has been detected by mass spectrometry in the high-speed pellet fraction from B cell conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meckes et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the known poly (U) binding site, sequence motif analysis of the most highly enriched miRNAs in the vHD vesicles isolated from MDA-MB-231 conditioned medium identified a second, previously unreported motif required for La:miR-122 high affinity interaction and sorting into sEVs in our cell-free reaction. A 5’ UGGA sequence resembles the motif shown to be required for miRNA sorting into hepatocyte sEVs, dependent on the SYNCRIP protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not detect SYNCRIP in our mass spectrometry analysis for RBP partners responsible for miR-122 sorting in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Thus, it is possible hepatocytes and breast cancer epithelial cells differ in their mechanisms of miRNA sorting. The presence of both motifs, UUU and UGGA, in miR-122 may allow for an exceptionally high affinity interaction with La. The measured K<sub>d</sub> for the La:miR-122 complex is 4.8 nM, indicating tighter binding than that reported for Ago2 to miRNAs using a similar assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan et al., 2009</xref>). This high affinity interaction may explain how selected miRNAs are sequestered into exosomes away from RISC.</p><p>As we have shown with La, other RBPs (YBX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>], hnRNPa2b1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>] and SYNCRIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>]) are involved in the selective sorting and secretion of miRNAs in different cell lines. Conceivably, this process could be organized and controlled in a cell-specific manner by the assembly of RNA granules including other more abundant RNAs such as tRNA, Y-RNA and vault RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>). In this respect, we find that most of the La protein in the cytoplasm is localized in punctate structures, some of which closely associate with the late endosomal marker Rab7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2a,b</xref>). It will be instructive to examine the cytoplasmic co-localization of La with the other RBPs implicated in miRNA secretion in EVs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Significance of selective miRNA sorting into EVs in cancer</title><p>Intercellular communication mediated by miRNAs is a subject of considerable interest, but in most cases, it remains unproven. Many studies using cancer cells suggest EV-mediated miRNA transfer to recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tominaga et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>), possibly to promote metastasis. In the context of breast cancer for example, sEV resident miR-122 has been suggested to promote metastasis through reprogramming glucose metabolism in the resident cells of the premetastatic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>). In another example, sEV-associated miR-105 may promote invasiveness in metastatic breast cancer by disruption of tight junctions, thus promoting vascular permeability and tumor cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). For sEV miRNAs to be functionally transferred to recipient cells, fusion of the EV membrane with a recipient membrane (either plasma membrane or endosomal membrane) must precede the presentation of an exogenous miRNA to the target cell cytoplasm. We find that the highly-selected miRNAs in exosomes are not bound to Ago2. Thus, the usual function of a miRNA would require loading from the EV interior to a cytoplasmic RISC. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the cytoplasmic presentation of miRNAs derived from EVs.</p><p>Alternatively, tumor cell invasiveness may depend on the selective secretion and disposal of tumor suppressor miRNAs. Such a suggestion has been made for miR-23b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ostenfeld et al., 2014</xref>) and miR-100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cha et al., 2015</xref>), which are secreted at high efficiency by cancer cells. These two mechanisms, intercellular communication and disposal, are not mutually exclusive. It is possible that sEVs containing detrimental miRNAs have been repurposed to serve as shuttles for intercellular communication, as has been suggested for the secretion of miR-142 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickman et al., 2017</xref>). Of relevance to the work we report here, miR-122 has been suggested as a tumor suppressor with cells developing greater invasiveness on loss of this miRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulouarn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Nonetheless, the importance of sEV resident miR-122 as a molecule to convey a message to promote metastasis has also been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A bigger challenge in the field of cancer and EV biology is that claims for a role of EV-associated miRNAs are based on crude preparations of sedimentable particles or co-culture experiments. Here we show that Ago2 is secreted to the extracellular space as a RNP, not vesicle-associated, that co-isolates with sEVs in the high-speed pellet. Thus, clear demonstration that the implicated miRNAs in cancer development are enclosed within a membrane vesicle is still missing. Studies purifying, characterizing, understanding the cellular biology behind different sEV sub-populations and their functional effects in the context of cancer will prove important in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic> - Ssb)</td><td>La</td><td>Addgene</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/Addgene_38241">Addgene_38241</ext-link></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-La (mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Origene Technologies</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2239866">AB_2239866</ext-link></td><td>IF 1:100.

All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4°C. Cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall R6+ centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 1000xg for 15 min followed by 10,000xg for 15 min in 500 ml vessels using a fixed angle FIBERlite F14−6 × 500 y rotor (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The interface over the sucrose cushion was collected and pooled for an additional ~130,000 xg (32,500 RPM) centrifugation over a 60% sucrose cushion in a SW41 rotor for 15 hr. The collected interface from the first sucrose cushion should not exceed a sucrose concentration of 21%, as measured by refractometry, for the second centrifugation in the SW41 to be successful. Higher concentrations of sucrose cause the EVs to equilibrate at the ambient buoyant density, impeding sedimentation.

TGIRT-seq libraries were prepared from 2 to 10 ng of starting material.</p><p>TGIRT-seq libraries were prepared essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Qin et al., 2016</xref>), with a modification in the starting molecule (see below). Reverse transcription reactions contained purified RNAs, buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 450 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), 5 mM DTT, 100 nM starting molecule (see below) and 1 µM TGIRT-III (Ingex). Reverse transcription by TGIRT-III is initiated by template switching from a starting molecule consisting of a DNA primer (<named-content content-type="sequence">5’-GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTATTAN-3’</named-content>) encoding the reverse complement of the Illumina Read2 sequencing primer binding site (R2R) annealed to a complementary RNA oligonucleotide (R2) such that there is a single nucleotide 3’ DNA overhang composed of an equimolar mixture of A, G, C and T. The RNA oligonucleotide is blocked at its 3’ end with C3Sp (IDT) to inhibit template switching to itself. Reactions were pre-incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then initiated by addition of 1 mM dNTPs. Reactions were then incubated at 60°C for 15 min and terminated by adding 5 N NaOH to a final concentration of 0.25 N and incubated at 95°C for 3 min to degrade RNAs and denature protein. The reactions were then cooled to room temperature and neutralized with 5 N HCl. cDNAs were purified by using a Qiagen MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit and then ligated at their 3’ ends to a modified DNA oligonucleotide (<named-content content-type="sequence">5’Phos- CCTGTTATCCCTAGATCGTCGGACTGTAGAACTCTGAACGTGTAC-3’-C3Sp</named-content>) encoding the reverse complement of the Illumina Read1 primer binding site (R1R) using Thermostable 5’ AppDNA/RNA Ligase (New England Biolabs). Ligated cDNAs were re-purified with MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit and amplified by PCR for 12 cycles using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with overlapping multiplex and barcode primers that add sequences necessary for Illumina sequencing. PCR reactions were purified using a Select-a-size DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymo) to remove adapter dimers.

The additional contigs for the 5S and 45S rRNA genes included the 2.2 kb 5S rRNA repeats from the 5S rRNA cluster on chromosome 1 (1q42, GeneBank: X12811) and the 43 kb 45S rRNA repeats that contained 5.8S, 18S and 28S rRNAs from clusters on chromosomes 13,14,15,21, and 22 (GeneBank: U13369). Unmapped reads from Pass 1 were re-mapped to Ensembl GRCh38 Release 76 by Bowtie 2 v2.2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) with local alignment to improve the mapping rate for reads containing post-transcriptionally added 5’ or 3’ nucleotides (e.g., CCA and poly(U)), short untrimmed adapter sequences, or non-templated nucleotides added to the 3’ end of the cDNAs by the TGIRT enzyme (denoted Pass 2). The mapped reads from Passes 1 and 2 were combined using Samtools 1.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2009</xref>) and intersected with gene annotations (Ensembl GRCh38 Release 76) supplemented with the RNY5 gene and its 10 pseudogene sequences, which were not annotated in this release, to generate the counts for individual features. Coverage of each feature was calculated by Bedtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). To avoid mis-mapping reads with embedded sncRNAs, reads were first intersected with sncRNA annotations and the remaining reads were then intersected with the annotations for protein-coding genes, lincRNAs, antisense, and other lncRNAs. To further improve the mapping rate for tRNAs and rRNAs, we combined reads mapped to tRNAs or rRNAs in the initial alignments and re-mapped them to tRNA reference sequences (Genomic tRNA Database, and UCSC genome browser website) or rRNA reference sequences (GeneBank: X12811 and U13369) using Bowtie two local alignment. Because similar or identical tRNAs with the same anticodon may be multiply mapped to different tRNA loci by Bowtie 2, mapped tRNA reads were combined according to their anticodon (N = 48) prior to calculating the tRNA distributions.</p><p>For miRNA analysis, sequences were mapped to miRbase using miRdeep2.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Distinct mechanisms of microRNA sorting into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicle subtypes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor (Suzanne Pfeffer) and Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. One of the reviewers has included a number of very detailed comments that should be easily addressed.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present study by Temoche-Diaz et al., reports that Lupus La protein packages a subset of miRNAs for export in a subset of endosome-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). The authors used ultracentrifugation followed by iodixanol-based centrifugation to obtain two biochemically distinct &quot;EV subtypes&quot; (LD and HD) in which they find different, significantly enriched miRNAs. The authors further provide evidence that La binds miR-122 (specifically enriched in HD EVs) to mediate its targeting within exosomes. Using a semi-reconstituted cell-free assay and binding experiments the authors conclude that La specifically engages a subset of microRNAs in the exosome biogenesis pathway. The work will be of broad interest if the authors can determine the number of miRNAs that depend on La for their packaging. Also, a recently published paper should be discussed in relation to the current story.</p><p>Jeppesen et al., 2019 analyzed different cell types (including the MDA-MB-231 cell line) using a similar approach to isolate two distinct fractions, LD and HD. Jeppesen et al., extended their analysis by including IPs using specific tetraspanins (CD63, CD81, CD9) to further isolate vesicles from non-vesicular particles (exomeres, lipoproteins and other RNA-binding protein complexes), the latter found to be mostly enriched in the HD fraction. Their data on CD63 versus CD9 seem to differ from the present story but could this be a cell-type dependent effect? This must be answered.</p><p>Previous work by Schekman and colleagues also used anti-CD63 immunoprecipitation to isolate vesicles enriched for microRNAs. La protein can interact with major vault protein (MVP)-particles (Kickhoefer et al., 2002), an RNA-binding proteinaceous organelle that has previously been shown to be export microRNAs by poorly understood mechanisms (Jeppesen et al., 2019, Teng et al., 2017). Vault particles were enriched in Coffey's iodixanol HD fractions of MDA-MB-231 cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Jeppesen et al., clearly showed that while their &quot;LDs&quot; are almost exclusively enriched in vesicles, the predominant components of the HD fraction are non-vesicular structures. Thus it would be important for the authors to show that miR-122 is detected in anti-CD63 immuno-isolated vesicles from the HD fraction, and that miR-122 export is dependent on Rab27A. Figure 6C shows a sucrose flotation performed on isolated HD iodixanol fractions, which is consistent with these authors' conclusion, but anti-CD63 IP would add a lot.</p><p>2) The authors should blot for an additional non-vesicular particle marker (MVP or Ago?) for their Optiprep gradient fractions. The blots for CD63 or TSG101 are rather smeary across these fractions. Typically, CD63 runs as a smear due to glycosylation and only a few antibodies work on gels run under reducing conditions. Please provide molecular weight markers for the blots and consider whether your antibody is appropriately recognizing CD63 as it seems to have a strange pattern (2 discrete bands) and to be present across the whole blot, not really enriched in any fractions. Jeppesen et al., showed Ago1 and Ago2 in the HD fraction of MDA-MB-231 cells. Please at least discuss this parallel study in relation to the current findings.</p><p>3) Does depletion of La protein change the overall miRNA signature of the LD and HD fractions? This would provide important information as to how many miRNAs rely on the proposed La pathway for export and would add much to the significance of the present story.</p><p>4) Immunoprecipitated La in Figure 7 may co-immunoprecipitate vault proteins (MVPs), which may also be needed for export of miR-122. The authors should show in Figure 8 the non-binding miRNA sequence for comparison.</p><p>5) It is not clear that Rab27a-KO is really making the HD population go away – please show this with a density gradient analysis, with quantitation of vesicle numbers and Western blot analysis of the gradient fractions. It also seems strange that the HD fraction and not the LD fraction would go away with Rab27a KO unless the method you use here is much different from that used in Kowal et al. in which the LD fraction was thought to represent exosomes. Please clarify.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Distinct mechanisms of microRNA sorting into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicle subtypes&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The two tetraspanins they focused their studies on when analyzing fractions from their high-resolution density gradient are CD63 and CD81. There is different distribution of both tetraspanins in their high-resolution density gradient for MDA-MB-231-derived sEVs as shown below: CD81 has two major peaks, one coinciding with the CD63 peak, and one showing a lighter density. The present study has not analyzed the distribution of CD81, however studies have shown that both CD81 and CD9 positive vesicles bud from the plasma membrane (Deneka et al., 2007) and that CD9 and CD81 have mainly a plasma membrane sub-cellular localization (Gould, Fordjour and Daaboul, 2019). Therefore, the CD81 distribution to lighter fractions might mirror the CD9 distribution we show in the present in our study (Figure 1B).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47544-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>Here we report the purification of two sEV sub-populations based on their distinct equilibrium buoyant density distributions. The sEV sub-populations reported here have different enrichments of CD9 and CD63 proteins. Jeppesen et al. results on CD63 IPs in DKO-1 and Gli36 cell lines (no IPs for MDA-MB-231 were shown) showed that CD9 co-IPs with CD63, however the amount of CD9 co-IPing with CD63 and the amount that did not, was not shown. Therefore, it is possible that some, but not all CD9 co-IPs with CD63. Previous studies have shown that there are at least two CD9 sEV sub-populations, one that is immunoisolated with CD63 and one that is not; the later possibly having its origin in the plasma membrane (Kowal et al., 2016). In agreement with the IP results from Kowal et al., we see some CD9 positive vesicles co-fractionating with CD63 in our linear gradient, however most of our CD9 fractionates away from the CD63 positive fraction. The routes of CD63 and CD9 positive vesicles biogenesis might be cell-line specific.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Previous work by Schekman and colleagues also used anti-CD63 immunoprecipitation to isolate vesicles enriched for microRNAs.

Their methodology varies from ours in the sense that their iodixanol gradients span from 12-36% and they collect 1ml fractions. Ours span from 5-25% and 400µl fractions are collected. Thus, our methodology yields improved resolution and detection of different extracellular vesicle populations. On the other hand, Jeppesen et al., refer to their vesicular fractions as LD and the non-vesicular fractions as HD. Here, we further fractionate what they term LD into two distinct sEV sub-populations. We recognize the confusion and now refer to the two sEV sub-populations in this study as vesicular LD and vesicular HD to prevent confusion (vLD and vHD respectively). Jeppesen et al., presented EM images as support that their LD and HD fractions correspond to vesicular and non-vesicular fractions. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> we present evidence of the vesicular nature of the vLD and vHD fractions from this study by EM images.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47544-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><p>We have also included Figure 3—figure supplement 4 to show that most of miR-122 co-fractionates with vHD, floating away from the non-vesicular associated RNP components dicer and Ago2, both of which remain in higher densities in our iodixanol gradient.</p><p>In addition to fractionation, we use RNase protection assays to further support the nature of miR-122 as sEV resident (Figure 3F). We show that extracellular miR-122 is protected from RNases unless treated with non-ionic detergent which renders it susceptible. Combined these results support our conclusion that miR-122 resides in the lumen of sEVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should blot for an additional non-vesicular particle marker (MVP or Ago?) for their Optiprep gradient fractions.

We are also including another previously shown iodixanol gradient (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) where Ago2 and dicer are observed on the bottom of the gradient.</p><p>The CD63 immunoblots have been replaced by new ones using the BD antibody #556019 under non-reducing conditions.</p><p>Molecular weights for all the immunoblots have been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Does depletion of La protein change the overall miRNA signature of the LD and HD fractions? This would provide important information as to how many miRNAs rely on the proposed La pathway for export and would add much to the significance of the present story.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included Figure 6C to address this. We tested the effect of La on the secretion of validated selectively and non-selectively sorted miRNAs by qPCR. Our data suggest that La has a broad effect on the secretion of selectively (miR-122, 142, 126, 145, 486), but not on non-selectively (miR-182, 185, 193b, 320a) sorted miRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Immunoprecipitated La in Figure 7 may co-immunoprecipitate vault proteins (MVPs), which may also be needed for export of miR-122. The authors should show in Figure 8 the non-binding miRNA sequence for comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>The miRNA that does not co-IP with endogenous La in post-nuclear supernatants from MDA-MB-231 cells is miR-182-5p. Its sequence is below:</p><p>5’ uuuggcaaugguagaacucacacu 3’</p><p>Mir-182-5p belongs to the pool of non-selectively sorted miRNAs from this study. Even though miR-182-5p contains a poly-uridine tract, it does not interact with La in our IP analysis. This could be as a result of miR-182 interaction with other RBPs or transcripts in the cytoplasm that mask it from La recognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not clear that Rab27a-KO is really making the HD population go away – please show this with a density gradient analysis, with quantitation of vesicle numbers and Western blot analysis of the gradient fractions. It also seems strange that the HD fraction and not the LD fraction would go away with Rab27a KO unless the method you use here is much different from that used in Kowal et al. in which the LD fraction was thought to represent exosomes. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Rab27a knock out only causes a decrease of CD63 positive vesicles secretion with little change in flotillin-2 (other vHD enriched marker) secretion. Therefore, Rab27a KO does not cause a depletion of the entire vHD fraction. The text and figures (Figure 2G) have been updated accordingly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Distinct mechanisms of microRNA sorting into cancer cell-derived extracellular vesicle subtypes&quot; for further consideration at eLife.
