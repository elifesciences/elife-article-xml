carriers for delivering various therapeutic agents in cancer therapy. Nevertheless, our understanding of how bacteria adapt their physiological condition to the tumor microenvironment remains elusive. In this work, we employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to examine the proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in murine tumors. Compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> cultivated in the rich medium, we found that <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in tumors notably upregulated the processes related to ferric ions, including the enterobactin biosynthesis and iron homeostasis. This finding indicated that the tumor is an iron-deficient environment to <italic>E. coli</italic>. We also found that the colonization of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the tumor led to an increased expression of lipocalin 2 (LCN2), a host protein that can sequester the enterobactin. We therefore engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> in order to evade the nutritional immunity provided by LCN2. By introducing the IroA cluster, the <italic>E. coli</italic> synthesizes the glycosylated enterobactin, which creates steric hindrance to avoid the LCN2 sequestration. The IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> showed enhanced resistance to LCN2 and significantly improved the anti-tumor activity in mice. Moreover, the mice cured by the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> treatment became resistant to the tumor re-challenge, indicating the establishment of immunological memory. Overall, our study underscores the crucial role of bacteria’s ability to acquire ferric ions within the tumor microenvironment for effective cancer therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacterial therapy</kwd><kwd>nutritional immunity</kwd><kwd>iron deficiency</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001869</institution-id><institution>Academia Sinica</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AS-CDA-108-L07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mou</surname><given-names>Kurt Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004663</institution-id><institution>National Science and Technology Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110-2113-M-001-064-MY3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mou</surname><given-names>Kurt Yun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacterial therapy can be impeded by nutrition deprivation in the tumor microenvironment, and enhancing bacteria resistance to iron sequestration enhances its antitumoral activity for therapeutic purposes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacterial therapy has re-emerged as a promising modality for cancer treatment, building on the pioneering works of William Coley in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carlson et al., 2020</xref>). As a living therapeutic agent, bacteria offer several advantages over traditional cancer treatments, including (1) active tumor targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamamoto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kim et al., 2023</xref>), (2) tumor colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Westphal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weibel et al., 2008</xref>), (3) immune system stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qiu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang et al., 2023</xref>), and (4) great engineerability for customized functionalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gurbatri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canale et al., 2021</xref>). The tumor microenvironment (TME) provides unique cues, such as hypoxia, low pH values, and immune suppressors, which facilitate the selective targeting and colonization of certain bacteria, including <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ryan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Flentie et al., 2012</xref>). However, the restricted resource in the TME may pose challenges for bacterial survival and growth, potentially limiting their anti-tumor efficacy. While the molecular physiology of <italic>E. coli</italic> has been extensively studied under well-controlled laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han and Lee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mateus et al., 2020</xref>), it is unclear how <italic>E. coli</italic> adapts to the nutrition-limited and immune-responsive environment in tumors. An in-depth understanding of the intricate relationship between the TME and the adaptation of colonized bacteria may provide hints to unlock the full potential of bacterial therapy against cancers.</p><p>It is well-established that the innate and adaptive immunity are sequentially activated upon bacterial infection in humans. However, even before the innate immune response commences, a critical defense mechanism known as ‘nutritional immunity’ serves as the first line of protection to hinder the bacterial infection. Nutritional immunity is employed by the host organism through restricting the availability of essential nutrients to the invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Weinberg, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murdoch and Skaar, 2022</xref>). For example, humans have evolved specialized proteins to chelate trace minerals, such as iron, zinc, and manganese, keeping their free-form concentrations at very low levels within the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews and Schmidt, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kambe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roth et al., 2013</xref>). In response, pathogens have counter-evolved mechanisms to evade nutritional immunity. For instance, a variety of siderophores are developed by bacteria to acquire ferric ions from the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kramer et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, humans have further adapted by evolving siderophore-sequestering proteins, such as LCN2, for bacterial inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachman et al., 2009</xref>). These co-evolutionary events highlight the importance of nutritional immunity in combating bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Golonka et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies on bacterial cancer therapy have rarely examined the role of nutritional immunity, which may limit bacteria’s therapeutic efficacy.</p><p>In this work, we aimed to understand how bacteria modulate their physiological states at the molecular level in response to the tumor microenvironment. We employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for a quantitative comparison of the proteome between <italic>E. coli</italic> cultured in a nutrient-rich medium and <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in tumors. We found that <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in tumors dramatically increases the protein expressions involved in the enterobactin biosynthesis and the iron ion homeostasis. This finding suggested that <italic>E. coli</italic> was stressed in an iron-deficient environment. Driven by this discovery, we hypothesized that enhancing the iron acquisition ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> might improve its anti-tumor activity. We engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> with enhanced iron-scavenging capacity by introducing LCN2 blockers, including cyclic-di-GMP and glycosylated enterobactin. The engineered bacteria evaded the nutritional immunity and achieved complete tumor emission in mouse models, highlighting strategy for improving anti-tumor bacterial therapy through circumvention of nutritional immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tumor is an iron-deficient microenvironment for bacterial colonization</title><p>While many bacteria are known to colonize and proliferate in the TME, it remains elusive how bacteria adapt to such a nutrition-limited environment as compared to a nutrition-rich one. To this end, we performed quantitative LC-MS/MS experiments to compare the proteome of <italic>E. coli</italic> colonized in the murine tumors or cultured in the rich medium (LB broth) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Not surprisingly, there are many more proteins enriched in the rich medium than in the tumor condition. The Venn diagram and the volcano blot revealed hundreds of protein IDs enriched in the rich medium condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). The Gene Ontology (GO)-term analysis revealed that many of these proteins are associated with the machineries of biosynthetic processes, cell division, and energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), reflecting that the <italic>E. coli</italic> was under a highly proliferative state in the rich medium. Interestingly, there were also 71 proteins that were preferentially expressed in the tumor condition over the rich medium condition. The GO-term analysis and the hierarchical clustering revealed that many of these proteins are involved in the processes of enterobactin synthesis and iron ion homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> showed that the individual proteins in these two processes were markedly up-regulated in the tumor condition. These proteins are known to be tightly controlled by the iron sensing system in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and only become up-regulated under the stress of iron deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Seo et al., 2014</xref>). It is worth mentioning that while enterobactin facilitates the uptake of ferric ions into bacteria, the host immune cells can counteract by secreting a protein called LCN2, which possesses a specialized pocket to bind and sequester enterobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fischbach et al., 2006</xref>). To investigate this possibility, we employed LC-MS/MS and analyzed the LCN2 expression in the tumors with or without <italic>E. coli</italic> colonization. Indeed, we observed a significant up-regulation of LCN2 expression in the tumors with <italic>E. coli</italic> inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Collectively, our data suggest that the tumor is an iron-deficient environment for <italic>E. coli</italic> colonization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The quantitative proteomic analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the rich medium and the tumor microenvironment.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The Venn diagram of the <italic>E. coli</italic> protein IDs identified in the rich medium and in the tumor microenvironment (TME).

First, we hypothesize that an iron chelator that lowers the effective pool concentration of iron may provide a selection pressure, which disfavors the growth of cancer cells over bacteria. We tested three iron chelators, deferoxamine, ciclopirox, and VLX600, which have been approved for clinical trials or medical applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fryknäs et al., 2016</xref>). All three chelators showed high cytotoxicity toward the cancer cells, suggesting the essential role of irons for the survival of mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>E. coli</italic> can better tolerate these iron chelators at relatively high concentrations. Among them, VLX600 was the most potent drug against the cancer cells (IC50=0.33 μM) and provided the largest therapeutic window (280-fold difference) between the cancer cells and <italic>E. coli</italic>. In addition to the iron chelator, we also attempted to find approaches for counteracting the enterobactin sequestering function of LCN2. It has been reported that cyclic di-GMP (CDG) can block the binding between LCN2 and enterobactin, therefore, restoring the functionality of enterobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In our bacterial culture study, we validated that the addition of CDG can enhance bacteria survival in the presence of LCN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), thus prompting our effort to prepare CDG-expressing bacteria. We engineered the <italic>E. coli</italic> by introducing a plasmid that carries the gene of diguanylate cyclase (DGC), an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the biosynthesis of cyclic di-GMP (CDG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lv et al., 2019</xref>). We showed that the <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with the DGC plasmid (hereafter referred to DGC-<italic>E. coli</italic>) actively synthesized CDG and secreted it into the supernatant as detected by the LC/MS-MS mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). It is worth noting that CDG is also a potent ligand for the STING pathway, which can stimulate anti-tumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krasteva and Sondermann, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chattopadhyay et al., 2020</xref>).

The growth conditions differ vastly between the in vitro cultivation and the intratumoral environments. The rich medium provides ample nutrients for the optimal bacterial growth and payload production, whereas tumor is a nutrient-deprived, acidic, and hypoxic environment, which may stress the bacteria and restraint the engineered functionality. Also, unlike the in vitro cultivation, bacteria face the competition from the cancer cells as well as the surveillance from the host’s immune system. This work provides the first proteomic data comparing <italic>E. coli</italic> cultured in the rich medium and colonized in the mouse tumor. The results show that the TME is an iron-deficient environment for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Moreover, upon the bacterial inoculation, the host cells up-regulate LCN2 to further block the iron uptake of <italic>E. coli</italic> by enterobactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Singh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachman et al., 2009</xref>). This observation inspired us to develop <italic>E. coli</italic> that overcame the nutritional immunity from the host. This discovery-driven design, especially the IroA implementation, proves to be highly effective in enhancing the anti-tumor activity of <italic>E. coli</italic>. It is of interest to investigate that if the iron uptake ability is also critical for other types of bacteria when applied in cancer therapy.</p><p>In addition to the enterobactin biosynthetic process and the iron ion homeostasis, our proteomic data also revealed other insights into the key nutrients whose scarcity within the TME may impede the bacterial growth. For example, the proteins involving ‘the de novo synthesis of IMP’ are highly enriched in the <italic>E. coli</italic> grown in tumors compared to the rich medium condition. Inosine phosphate (IMP) is the precursor of purine. When the environment is deficient of purine, the bacteria need to synthesize them using de novo pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rolfes and Zalkin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meng et al., 1990</xref>). A previous report by Samant et al. has shown that the genes associated with the de novo purine synthesis are the most critical factors for the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> or other gram-negative bacteria in human serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Samant et al., 2008</xref>). Their data indicate that, similar to iron, humans also control the purine at a very low level in blood as a strategy of nutritional immunity in order to restrain the proliferation of bacteria. In light of these findings, one potential avenue could involve engineering <italic>E. coli</italic> to bolster its ability for de novo nucleotide biosynthesis, therefore, facilitating better adaptation to the TME. Given that bacteria and cancer cells vie for growth within the TME, an enhanced bacterial adaptation to the TME may potentially improve the anti-tumor activity.</p><p>Overall, our research revealed that the tug of war for iron plays a critical role when applying bacteria for cancer therapy. To aid the bacteria in this war, we have adopted several approaches, including the engineering of <italic>E. coli</italic> to secret cyclic-di-GMP and salmochelin. These methods have demonstrated effectiveness in treating murine tumors, resulting in a significant portion of complete remission. Notably, the cured mice have also established durable anti-tumor adaptive immunity.

In our study, we attempted various experimental approaches, including Immunohistochemistry utilizing an a Fe3+ probe, iron assay kit (ab83366), and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Despite these attempts, the quantification of oxidized Fe3+ concentrations proved challenging due to the inherently low levels of Fe ions and difficulty to distinguish Fe2+ and Fe3+. We observed measurements below the detection threshold of even the sensitive ICP-MS technique. To circumvent this limitation, we designed an experiment wherein bacteria were cultured in a medium supplemented with Chrome Azurol S (CAS) reagent, which colormetrically detects siderophore activity. We compared WT bacteria and IroA-expressing bacteria at varying levels of Lcn2 proteins. The outcome, as depicted in the updated Fig. 3b, reveals an enhanced iron acquisition capability in IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> under the presence of Lcn2 proteins, in comparison to the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. In addition to the Lcn2 study, the proteomic study in Figure 4 highlights the competitive landscape between cancer cells and bacteria.

[Nat Commun 6:8330, 2015]. We regret to inform the reviewer that direct measurement of iron concentration was attempted to no avail due to the limited sensitivity of iron detecting assays. We do acknowledge that CDG may exert different effects in addition to enhancing iron uptake, particularly the potentiation of the STING pathway. We pointed out such effect in Fig 2c that shows enhanced macrophage stimulation by the CDG-expressing bacteria. We would like to accentuate, however, that a primary objective of the experiment is to show that the manipulation of nutritional immunity for promoting anticancer bacterial therapy can be achieved by combining bacteria with iron chelator VLX600. The multifaceted effects of CDG prompted us to focus on IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> in subsequent experiments to examine the role of nutritional immunity on bacterial therapy.

The blood cell analysis suggests that mice treated with the bacteria eventually return to baseline levels comparable to untreated mice, supporting the safety of this approach in our experimental models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Based on their observation that tumor has an iron-deficient microenvironment, and the assumption that nutritional immunity is important in bacteria-mediated tumor modulation, the authors postulate that manipulation of iron homeostasis can affect tumor growth.

For example, this model is dependent on significant LCN production, and different tumors have variable levels of LCN expression.

In light of the reviewer’s suggestion, we extended our investigations beyond the initial colon cancer model, employing B16-F10 melanoma and E0771 breast cancer in mouse subcutaneous models. The results, as depicted in Figures 3g to 3j and Figure S5, demonstrate that IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> consistently outperforms WT bacteria in tumor inhibition. We acknowledge the reviewer’s comment regarding LCN2 being more prominently examined in breast cancer and have highlighted this aspect in the revised manuscript.

Bacterial therapy exerts its anticancer action through several different mechanisms, including bacterial virulence, nutrient and ecological competition, and immune stimulation. Decoupling one mechanism from another would be technically challenging and beyond the scope of the present work. With the objective of demonstrating that an iron-scavenging bacteria can elevate anticancer activity by circumventing nutritional immunity, we highlight our data in Fig. S6, which shows that IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> administration resulted in higher bacterial colonization within solid tumors compared to WT-<italic>E. coli</italic> on Day 15. This increased bacterial presence supports our iron-scavenging bacteria design, and we highlight a few anticancer mechanisms mediated by the engineered bacteria. Firstly, as shown in Fig. 4d, IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> is shown to induce an elevated iron stress response in tumor cells as the treated tumor cells show increased expression of transferrin receptors. Secondly, our experiments involving CD8+ T cell depletion indicates that the IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> establishes a more robust anticancer CD8+ T cell response than WT bacteria. Both immune-mediated responses and alterations in iron status within the tumor microenvironment are demonstrated to contribute to the enhanced anticancer activity of IroA<italic>-E. coli</italic> in the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>If the effects are iron-related, could the authors provide some quantification of iron status in tumor cells and/or the TME?

Consequently, to circumvent this limitation, we designed an experiment wherein bacteria were cultured in a medium supplemented with Chrome Azurol S (CAS) reagent, which colormetrically detects siderophore activity. We compared WT bacteria and IroA-expressing bacteria at varying levels of Lcn2 proteins. The outcome, as depicted in the updated Fig. 3b, reveals an enhanced iron acquisition capability in IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> under the presence of Lcn2 proteins, in comparison to the wild-type <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. In addition to the Lcn2 study, the proteomic study in Figure 4 highlights the competitive landscape between cancer cells and bacteria. We observed that IroA-<italic>E. coli</italic> showed reduced stress responses and exerted elevated iron-associated stress to cancer cells, thus further supporting the IroA-<italic>E. coli’s</italic> iron-scavenging capability against nutritional immunity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewing Editor:</bold></p><p>The authors provide compelling technically sound evidence that bacteria, such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, can be engineered to sequester iron to potentially compete with tumor cells for iron resources and consequently reduce tumor growth. Long-term remission in IroA-E.coli treated mice is associated with enhanced CD8+ T cell activity and a synergistic effect with chemotherapy reagent oxaliplatin is observed to reduce tumor growth. The following additional assessments are needed to fully evaluate the current work for completeness; please see individual reviews for further details.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the editor’s positive comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The premise is one of translation yet the authors have not demonstrated that manipulating bacteria to sequester iron does not provide a potential for sepsis or other evidence that this does not increase the competitiveness of bacteria relative to the host. Only tumor volume was provided rather than animal survival and cause of death, but bacterial virulence is enhanced including the possibility of septic demise. Alternatively, postulated by the authors, that tumor volume is decreased due to iron sequestration but they do not directly quantify the iron concentration in (1) <italic>E. coli</italic> in different growth environments, and (2) tumor microenvironment. These important endpoints will provide the functional consequences of upregulating genes that import iron into the bacteria.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the editor’s comment and have added substantial data to support the translational potential of the iron-scavenging bacteria. In particular, we added evidence that the iron-scavenging bacteria does not increase the risk of sepsis (Fig. 3k, l), evidence of increased bacteria competitiveness and survival in tumor (Fig. S6), and iron-scavenging bacteria’s superior anticancer ability and survival benefit across 3 different tumor models (Fig. 3e-j; Fig. S5). While direct measurement of iron concentration in the tumor environment is technically difficult due to the challenge in differentiating Fe2+ and Fe3+ by available techniques, we added a colormetric CAS assay to demonstrate the iron-scavenging bacteria can more effectively utility Fe than WT bacteria in the presence of LCN2 (Fig. 3b). These results substantiate the translational relevance of the engineered bacteria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is no discussion of the cancer type and why this cancer type was chosen. If the current tumor modulation system is dependent on LCN2 activity, there would need to be some recognition that different tumors have variable levels of LCN expression. Would the response of the tumor depend on the role of iron in that cancer type?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and added relevant text and citations describing clinical relevance of LCN2 expression associated with the tumor types used in the study (breast cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer). Elevated LCN2 has been associated with higher aggressiveness for all three cancer types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) To demonstrate long-term anti-cancer memory was established through enhancement of CD8+ T cell activity (Fig 5c), the &quot;2nd seeding tumor cells&quot; experiment may need to be done in CD8 antibody-treated IronA mice since CD8+ T cells may play a role in tumor suppression regardless of whether or not iron regulation is being manipulated. It appears that the control group for this experiment is naive mice (and not WT-<italic>E. coli</italic> treated mice), in which case the immunologic memory could be from having had tumor/<italic>E. coli</italic> rather than the effect of IroA-<italic>E. coli.</italic></p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that our prior writing may have overstated our claim on immunological memory.

Did the mice die from the experiment (how many from each group)? If it only reflects the tumor size, do these figures deliver the same information as the tumor growth figure?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. The survival rate is indeed based on tumor volume, and we used a cutoff of 1500 mm3. No death event was observed prior to the tumors reaching 1500 mm3. Although the survival figures cover some of the information conveyed by the tumor volume tracking, the figures offer additional temporal resolution of tumor progression with the survival figures. Having both tumor volume and survival tracking are commonly adopted to depict tumor progression. We have the protocol regarding survival monitoring to the materials and method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fig 3a, not sure if entE is a good negative control for this experiment. Neg. Ctrl should maintain its CFU/ml at a certain level regardless of Lcn2 conc.
